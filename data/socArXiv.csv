0,The impact of COVID-19 on A level students in England,"The global outbreak of the COVID-19 virus created new and challenging circumstances for schools, colleges and universities. In England the closure of schools and cancellation of examinations led to concerns about how pupils would be awarded A Level exam grades. These exam results have a significant impact on outcomes for pupils leaving school including access to the employment market, apprenticeships and university places. This report represents an early analysis of research exploring the impact school closures and cancellation of examinations had on students. The main aims of the study were to examine the impact (mental and academic) of predicted grades being used to award A Level grades; to explore support systems in place for students; and, to analyse differences by race, class, gender and school type. Some of the broader themes that emerged from the research included students concerns about the fairness of their A Level results; and, many students identifying structural inequalities within education being mirrored in the new processes for awarding grades.",Kalwant Bhopal et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46248-D84-B66,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46248-D84-B66,2020-09-11,2020-09-11T12:22:59+00:00,SocArXiv|Education; SocArXiv|Education|Secondary Education; schools; class; ethnicity; race; examinations; covid 19; a level; inequality,False
1,Advancing psychosocial measures for COVID-19 affected populations: Perspectives on digital health interventions promoting health equity,"Health equity is a persistent issue discussed in academic disciplines. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become more prominent as inequities emerge across the globe, impacting the health status of individuals and millions. Mortality remains a central question, whereas psychosocial challenges may leave deep trauma in communities. In the digital world, many of those issues could be solved using existing technologies, which are briefly discussed in this paper. Lastly, specific issues related to such measures are discussed to inform local research and how they can inform practices to micro to macro levels of healthcare decision-making.",Rajaei Rukn Al-Din,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46157-4AE-846,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46157-4AE-846,2020-09-11,2020-09-11T12:17:02+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; psychology; covid-19; mental health,False
2,Use of Unofficial Newspaper Data for COVID-19 Death Surveillance,"Objective. To highlight the critical importance of unofficially reported newspaper-based deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)–like illness (CLI) together with officially confirmed death counts to support improvements in COVID-19 death surveillance. Methods. Both hospital-based official COVID-19 and unofficial CLI death counts were collected from daily newspapers between March 8 and August 22, 2020. We performed both exploratory and time-series analyses to understand the influence of combining newspaper-based CLI death counts with confirmed hospital death counts on the trends and forecasting of COVID-19 death counts. An autoregressive integrated moving average–based approach was used to forecast the number of weekly death counts for six weeks ahead. Results. Between March 8 and August 22, 2020, 2,156 CLI deaths were recorded based on newspaper reporting for a count that was 55% of the officially confirmed death count (n = 3,907). This shows that newspaper reports tend to cover a significant number of COVID-19 related deaths. Our forecast also indicates an approximate total of 406 CLI expected for the six weeks ahead, which could contribute to a total of 2,413 deaths including 2,007 confirmed deaths expected from August 23 to October 3, 2020. Conclusions. Analyzing existing trends in and forecasting the expected number of newspaper-based CLI deaths indicates yet-unreported COVID-19 death counts, which could be a critical source to estimate provisional COVID-19 death counts and mortality surveillance. Public Health Implications. Considering unofficial newspaper-based CLI death counts is essential to identify COVID-19 death severity and surveillance needs to advance public health research efforts to prepare appropriate response strategies for low- and middle-income countries.",Mazbahul G Ahamad et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4610C-191-2E8,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4610C-191-2E8,2020-09-11,2020-09-11T09:20:02+00:00,"SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities; SocArXiv|Education; SocArXiv|Law; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Policy Design, Analysis, and Evaluation; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics; mortality surveillance; official hospital data; covid-19-like-illness (cli) death; newspaper-based surveillance",False
3,Travel behaviour after the pandemic: the case of Bulgaria,"The paper analyses the travel intentions of tourists in the post-pandemic world. The sample includes 974 respondents from Bulgaria. The findings show that most of the respondents are ready to travel within two months after travel is allowed in the country. For their first trip, they will travel in the country, by their car and with their family. Hygiene, disinfection and reliable health system in a destination will be important factors in travellers’ decisions.

4,Heard immunity: effective persuasion for a future COVID-19 vaccine,"A survey experiment exposes treatment groups to four messages supporting future vaccination against COVID-19. These treatments emphasize either the risks of the virus or the safety of vaccination, to the respondent personally or to others. For a nationally representative sample, self-reported intent to vaccinate is not significantly different from the control for any message. However, there is a substantial divergence between white non-Hispanic respondents, whose response to all four treatments is close to zero, and non-white or His- panic respondents, whose intention to vaccinate is over 50% higher in response to a message emphasizing prosociality and the safety of others.",Nicolas Duquette,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46152-B35-82F,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46152-B35-82F,2020-09-09,2020-09-09T18:18:44+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Public Economics,False
5,"Changing living arrangements, family dynamics and stress during lockdown: evidence from four birth cohorts in the UK","On 23 March 2020 the UK went into lockdown in an unprecedented step to attempt to limit the spread of coronavirus. Since then, many families have found themselves spending an unprecedented amount of time together, with some facing the additional challenge of adapting to changes in who they are living with as some families have found themselves unexpectedly brought back together. School and university closures, the move to remote working, furlough or the loss of employment have all meant that many adult children who had previously left the parental home have returned. Other individuals have moved to provide care and support for a family member or friend who has been ‘shielding’, and conversely some vulnerable and/or older people have moved in with a younger relative or friend. This paper provides an overview of the changes in living arrangements during the Covid-19 pandemic, drawing upon recently available data from five large scale nationally representative surveys, including the second wave of Understanding Society Covid-19 Study, conducted in May 2020 and the special Covid-19 surveys conducted with the participants of the 1958, 1970, 2000-01 British birth cohorts and Next Steps (born in 1989-90). The paper then goes on to explore the impact of the unexpected changes in living arrangements and mental health, as measured by self-reported stress and interpersonal conflict. Data from the Understanding Society May Covid-19 survey shows that for most of the respondents (95.5%) their living arrangements during the three months since 1st March 2020 had not changed. Just over 2% had changed their address and a further 1.5% reported other people had moved in, whilst under 1% reporting people moving out. However, the likelihood of having changed living arrangements varied significantly by age with one in seven of those aged 20-24 reporting a change in living arrangements. Young people aged 16-29 accounted for over half (57%) of all respondents reporting that they had moved themselves. By contrast, respondents in mid-life (45-59) and early later life (60-74) accounted for the majority of respondents reporting other people had moved in or out. Analysis of the cohort data confirmed this picture with nearly a quarter (24%) of the Millennium Cohort Study, currently aged 19 reporting a change in the people they were living with as a result of covid-19, compared to under one in ten of the 1958 cohort, now aged 62. Logistic regression models were used to assess the odds of reporting increased stress and conflict increase amongst those respondents who had experienced a change in living arrangement change compared to those who had not. The results provide strong evidence that those individuals whose living arrangements have changed as a result of the covoid-19 pandemic have a higher likelihood of reported increased stress and family conflict than those whose living arrangements remained unchanged. This has important implications for public health and wider policy as prolonged periods of stress can lead to serious health problems and policy makers need to be mindful that services may need to flex to take these new, albeit for many temporary, forms of living into account.",Maria Evamdrou et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4614F-108-619,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4614F-108-619,2020-09-09,2020-09-09T18:15:14+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics; stress; cohort; living arrangements; covid-19; pandemic; family relationships,False
6,Face-Saving Strategies Increase Self-Reported Non-Compliance with COVID-19 Preventive Measures: Experimental Evidence from 12 Countries,"Studies of citizens’ compliance with COVID-19 preventive measures routinely rely on survey data. While essential, public health restrictions provide clear signals of what is socially desirable in this context, creating a potential source of response bias in self-reported measures of compliance. In this research, we examine whether the results of a face-saving-strategy that was recently proposed by Daoust et al. (2020) to loosen this constraint are generalizable across twelve countries, and whether the treatment effect varies across subgroups. Our findings show that the face-saving strategy is a very useful tool in every country included, increasing respondents’ proclivity to report non-compliance by 9 to 16 percentage points. This effect holds for different subgroups based on gender, age and education. We conclude that the inclusion of this strategy should be the new standard for survey research that aims to provide crucial data on the current pandemic.",Jean-François Daoust et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46080-BF7-88D,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46080-BF7-88D,2020-09-08,2020-09-08T08:11:28+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics; public health; expected; compliance; survey experiment; social desirability bias; experimental method; covid-19; measurement; pandemic,False
7,Encouraging COVID-19 Vaccine Uptake through Effective Health Communication,"Context: Overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic will require millions of Americans to vaccinate against the virus. Unfortunately, previous research suggests that many Americans plan to refuse a vaccine; thereby jeopardizing collective immunity. We investigate the effectiveness of three different health communication frames hypothesized to increase vaccine intention; emphasizing either (1) personal health risks, (2) economic costs, or (3) collective public health consequences of not vaccinating. Methods: In a large (N = 7,064) and demographically representative survey experiment, we randomly assigned respondents to read pro-vaccine communication materials featuring one of the frames listed above. We also randomly varied the message source (ordinary people vs. medical experts) and availability of information designed the “pre-bunk” concerns about expedited clinical trial safety. Findings: We find that messages emphasizing the personal health risks and collective health consequences of not vaccinating significantly increase Americans’ intentions to vaccinate. These effects are similar in magnitude irrespective of message source, and the inclusion of pre-bunking information. Surprisingly, economic cost frames have no discernible effect on vaccine intention. Conclusions: Health communicators hoping to encourage vaccination may be effective by appealing to the use personal and collective health risks of not vaccinating.",Matthew Motta et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46019-070-223,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46019-070-223,2020-09-08,2020-09-08T08:10:05+00:00,"SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy",False
8,Making Sense of Algorithms: Relational Perception of Contact Tracing and Risk Assessment during COVID-19,"Governments, institutions, and citizens of nearly every nation have been compelled to respond to COVID-19. Many measures have been adopted, including contact tracing and risk assessment, whereby citizen whereabouts are constantly monitored to trace contact with other infectious individuals and isolate contagious parties via algorithmic evaluation of their risk status. This paper investigates how citizens make sense of Health Code (jiankangma), the contact tracing and risk assessment algorithm in China. We probe how people accept or resist the algorithm by examining their ongoing, dynamic, and relational interactions with it over time. By seeking a deeper, iterative understanding of how individuals accept or resist the algorithm, our data unearths three key sites of concern. First, how understandings of algorithmic surveillance shape and are shaped by notions of privacy, including fatalism towards the possibility of true privacy in China and a trade-off narrative between privacy and twin imperatives of public and economic health. Second, how trust in the algorithm is mediated by the perceived competency of the technology, the veracity of input data, and well-publicized failures in both data collection and analysis. Third, how the implementation of Health Code in social life alters beliefs about the algorithm, such as its further role after COVID-19 passes, or contradictory and disorganized enforcement measures upon risk assessment. Chinese citizens make sense of Health Code in a relational fashion, whereby users respond very differently to the same sociotechnical assemblage based upon social and individual factors.",Chuncheng Liu et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F7-EF0-6A9,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F7-EF0-6A9,2020-09-08,2020-09-08T08:09:20+00:00,"SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities; SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities|East Asian Languages and Societies; SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities|East Asian Languages and Societies|Chinese Studies; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Asia and Asian America; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Global and Transnational Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology; risk assessment; contact tracing; china; surveillance; algorithm; covid-19; privacy",False
9,Applications of GIS and Geospatial analyses in COVID-19 research: A systematic review,"Geographic Information Science (GIS) had established itself as a distinct domain and incredibly useful whenever the research is related to geography, space, and other spatio-temporal dimensions. However, the scientific landscape on the integration of GIS in the COVID related studies is largely unknown. In this systematic review, we assessed the current evidence on the implementation of GIS and other geospatial tools and technologies in COVID-19 pandemic. We systematically retrieved and reviewed 79 research articles that either directly used GIS or other Geospatial tools as part of their analysis. We grouped the identified papers under six broader thematic groups based on the objectives and research questions of the study- environmental, socio-economic, and cultural, public health, spatial transmission, computer-aided modeling, and data mining. The interdisciplinary nature of how geographic and spatial analysis was used in COVID-19 research was noticeable among the reviewed papers. Although GIS has substantial potential in planning to slow down the spread, surveillance, contact tracing, and identify the trends and hotspots of breakdowns, it was not employed as much as it could have been. This review not only provided an overarching view on how GIS has been used in COVID-19 research so far but also concluded that this geospatial analysis and technologies could be used in future public health emergencies along with statistical and other socio-economic modeling techniques. Our systematic review also provides how both scientific communities and policymakers could leverage GIS to extract useful information to make an informed decision in the coming days.",Rakibul Ahasan et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4613A-A22-AF5,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4613A-A22-AF5,2020-08-31,2020-09-03T15:21:45+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Physical and Environmental Geography; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies; coronavirus; systematic review; gis; spatial analysis; evidence-based practice; covid-19,False
10,Escaping to nature in pandemic: a natural experiment of COVID-19 in Asian cities,"Cities implemented social distancing measures to cope with COVID-19, which kept people away from nature. A steep drop in the greenspace use was observed in western cities. Surprisingly, news revealed a surging greenspace use in Asian cities. In this study, we used COVID-19 outbreak stages as natural experiments to investigate individual behavioural changes of greenspace use before and during the pandemic. Our case cities are Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo and Seoul. We extracted panel data which consisted of longitudinal posts of 100, 232 users, being posted in 1,185 greenspaces in the four Asian cities. Our statistical models found a 5.3% increase in the odds of people using greenspaces for every 100 additional weekly new cases. The analyses also revealed people’s preference in larger, nature parks that are close to city centres. Due to the established physical and mental health benefits of greenspaces, people have been escaping to nature to cope with the pandemic in Asian cities.",Yi Lu et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461BC-C31-DFA,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461BC-C31-DFA,2020-09-03,2020-09-03T08:24:13+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,False
11,Human-animal relationships and interactions during the Covid-19 lockdown phase in the UK: investigating links with mental health and loneliness,"Background: The Covid-19 pandemic raises questions about the role that relationships and interactions between humans and animals play in the context of widespread social distancing and isolation measures. We aimed to investigate links between mental health and loneliness, companion animal ownership, the human-animal bond, and human-animal interactions; and to explore animal owners’ perceptions related to the role of their animals during lockdown. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey of UK residents over 18 years of age was conducted between April and June 2020. The questionnaire included validated and bespoke items measuring demographics; exposures and outcomes related to mental health, wellbeing and loneliness; the human-animal bond and human-animal interactions. Results: Of 5,926 participants, 5,323 (89.8%) had at least one companion animal. Most perceived their animals to be a source of considerable support, but concerns were reported related to various practical aspects of providing care during lockdown. Strength of the human-animal bond did not differ significantly between species. Poorer mental health pre-lockdown was associated with a stronger reported human-animal bond (b = -.014, 95% CI [-.023 - -.005], p = .002). Animal ownership compared with non-ownership was associated with smaller decreases in mental health (b = .267, 95% CI [.079 - .455], p = .005) and smaller increases in loneliness (b = -.302, 95% CI [-.461 - -.144], p = .001) since lockdown. Conclusion: The human-animal bond is a construct of potential clinical importance to identify mental health vulnerability in animal owners. Animal ownership appeared to mitigate some of the detrimental psychological effects of lockdown. Further targeted investigation of the role of human-animal relationships and interactions for human health, including testing of the social buffering hypothesis and the development of instruments suited for use across animal species, is required.",Elena Ratschen et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46105-AA9-2F9,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46105-AA9-2F9,2020-08-03,2020-09-01T18:13:51+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; social distancing &amp; mental health; isolation; covid-19; human-animal bond; human-animal interaction,False
12,Sickness-related Absences During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Occupations,"During the pandemic, work is exposing many workers to extensive health risks, with workplace infections a major source of COVID-19 outbreaks. The experience of work is substantially different by occupation, and “essential” occupations consist of disproportionately low-SES and non-White workers. Documenting occupational health disparities during the pandemic is therefore crucial for understanding COVID-19 health inequalities in the United States. This study uses the Current Population Survey microdata combined with occupational data from multiple sources to estimate occupational differences in sickness-related absences from work in March – June 2020 and their contribution to income, educational, and racial/ethnic differences in health inequalities. We find that there has been an unprecedented rise in absences compared to previous years, highly concentrated in transportation, food-related, and personal-care and service occupations. In areas with a major COVID-19 outbreak, these occupations saw rates of absence 6 times higher than all non-healthcare professional occupations. Occupations with the greatest increase in absences are those that are unsuitable for remote work, require workers to work in close proximity to others, pay low wages and rarely provide health insurance. These occupations are, on average, disproportionately non-White, immigrant, low-SES, and have workers in worse than average health. We show that occupation contributes 41% of the total of Black/White differences in absences, 40% of high-low income differences, and 54% of differences between college graduates and those with at most a high school diploma.",Thomas Lyttelton et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46248-697-3BB,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46248-697-3BB,2020-09-01,2020-09-01T09:45:24+00:00,"SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class; inequality; coronavirus; ses; occupations; race and ethnicity; covid-19; job characteristics; workplace; health disparities",False
13,Digital screen time during COVID-19 pandemic: A public health concern,"The use of digital screens, including television, computers, mobile phones, and smart devices, can be associated with a wide range of health outcomes. During the COVID-19 pandemic, different population groups may have been adapted to varying levels of screen time, which may have profound implications on their health and wellbeing. The available evidence suggests that screen time is associated with obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, myopia, depression, sleep disorders, and many other noncommunicable diseases. This elevated burden of diseases is prevalent among individuals who have sedentary lifestyles and other unhealthy behaviors that are likely to increase during quarantine or isolation due to COVID-19. As several empirical studies have reported a rising trend of screen time during this pandemic, it is critical to assess the adverse health outcomes that may appear as its long-term consequences globally. Researchers and practitioners need to revisit the available guidelines and incorporate evidence-based interventions for preventing unhealthy screen time among the affected individuals. Such interventions may address not only unhealthy screen use behavior but also promote active lifestyles that may improve health across populations during and after this pandemic.",Abida Sultana et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46184-928-6EC,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46184-928-6EC,2020-09-01,2020-09-01T09:45:22+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Child Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Developmental Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work; covid-19; screen use; screen time; health promotion; coronavirus,False

15,"Blood donors in times of crisis: Increased donation willingness, particularly among high-risk individuals","Traditionally, during crises the number of new blood donors increases. However, the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic created additional barriers to donate due to governmental prevention measures and increased personal health risks. In this report, we examined how the pandemic affected new donor registrations in the Netherlands, especially among groups with higher risk profiles for severe COVID-19. Additionally, we explored the role of media for blood donation and new donor registrations. We analyzed new donor registrations and attention for blood donation in newspapers and on social media from January until May 2020, in comparison to the same period in 2019. After the introduction of nationwide prevention measures, several peaks in new donor registrations occurred, which coincided with peaks in media attention. Interestingly, people with a higher risk profile for COVID-19 (e.g. due to age or region of residence) were overrepresented among new registrants. In sum, the current pandemic has led to increased new blood donor registrations, despite the associated increased health risks. Time and future studies will have to tell whether these new donors are one-off ‘pandemic’ donors or if they will become regular, loyal donors.",Maria Spekman et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46212-570-11E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46212-570-11E,2020-08-27,2020-08-27T10:57:16+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; public goods; covid-19; sars-cov2; pandemic; media; social media; blood donation; blood donor; crisis; newspaper,False
16,Can a COVID-19 Vaccine Live up to Americans’ Expectations? A Conjoint Analysis of how Vaccine Characteristics Influence Vaccination Intentions,"Objective: A vaccine for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) could prove critical in establishing herd immunity. While past work has documented the prevalence and correlates of vaccine refusal, I assess how a less explored topic -- properties of vaccines themselves (e.g., national origin, efficacy, risk of side effects) -- might influence vaccination intentions. This information can help public health officials preempt differential vaccine demand, and inform health communication campaigns that encourage vaccine uptake. Rationale: Previous research suggests that Americans should be more likely to intend to vaccinate if presented with a US-made vaccine that carries a low risk of minor side effects, is highly effective, is administered in just one dose, and has spent significant time in development. Methods: I administered a conjoint experiment (N = 5,940 trials) in a demographically representative survey (N = 990) of US adults to assess how variation in vaccine properties influence self-reported public vaccination intentions. Results: I find that respondents prefer vaccines that are US-made, over 90% effective, and carry a less than 1% risk of minor side effects. This is potentially problematic, as some leading vaccine candidates are produced outside the US, and may be less effective and more likely to produce minor side effects than respondents would otherwise prefer. Worryingly, intended vaccine refusal rates exceed 30% for a vaccine meeting these optimal characteristics. Encouragingly, though, Americans show no clear preference for vaccines administered in one dose, or developed in under a year, and do not appear to draw a distinction between weakened viral vs. mRNA-based vaccines. Conclusion: Americans’ preferences for a novel coronavirus vaccine may be at odds with the vaccine that ultimately hits the market, posing both policy and health communication challenges for vaccination uptake.",Matthew Motta,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4616B-B83-F1E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4616B-B83-F1E,2020-08-27,2020-08-27T04:58:41+00:00,"SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Science and Technology Policy; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies",False
17,Impact of Pandemic COVID-19 on Education in India,"The impact of pandemic COVID-19 is observed in every sector around the world. The education sectors of India as well as world are badly affected by this. It has enforced the world wide lock down creating very bad effect on the students’ life. Around 32 crore learners stopped to move schools/colleges and all educational activities halted in India. The outbreak of COVID-19 has taught us that change is inevitable. It has worked as a catalyst for the educational institutions to grow and opt for platforms with technologies, which have not been used before. The education sector has been fighting to survive the crises with a different approach and digitising the challenges to wash away the threat of the pandemic. This paper highlights some measures taken by Govt. of India to provide seamless education in the country. Both the positive and negative impacts of COVID-19 on education are discussed and some fruitful suggestions are also pointed to carry out educational activities during the pandemic situation.",Pravat Kumar Jena,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4613C-9EB-547,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4613C-9EB-547,2020-08-26,2020-08-26T20:34:22+00:00,SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities; SocArXiv|Education; SocArXiv|Education|Elementary Education; SocArXiv|Education|Higher Education; SocArXiv|Education|Humane Education; SocArXiv|Education|Secondary Education; govt. of india.; pandemic; covid-19; impact; education,False
18,"Examining the impact of Covid-19-related disruptions, dislocations and stressors on the academic performance of undergraduates at a diverse public university","Objective: Investigate the influence of the stressors caused by the Covid-19 pandemic on the academic performance of undergraduate students, and their ability to concentrate on schoolwork. Participants: 1,806 students attending a racially diverse 4-year university with a high rate of first generation college students. Methods: An online survey utilizing measures of depression (PHQ-9), generalized anxiety (GAD-7), faculty and academic advising support, economic insecurity, studying conditions, family conditions, trouble concentrating on schoolwork, and academic performance. OLS regression is used to explain academic performance and trouble concentrating. Results: Four of five students reported trouble concentrating, and trouble concentrating strongly decreased academic performance. Faculty and peer advising support and adequate studying conditions improved academic performance. Depression strongly increased trouble concentrating. Adequate studying conditions and academic advising support improved concentration. Conclusions: In the upcoming year, faculty and student support services should highlight mental health issues and services, and increase supports for students experiencing distress.",Carl Stempel et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F8-D41-E34,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F8-D41-E34,2020-08-25,2020-08-25T05:21:42+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education; covid-19; academic performance; trouble concentrating; depression; stressors,False
19,The pathway from distrusting Western actors to non-compliance with public health guidance during the COVID-19 crisis in Romania,"Global crises provide a fertile environment for the proliferation of disinformation, rumors, and conspiracy narratives. We investigate people's perceptions and beliefs related to COVID-19 in Romania, during the lockdown period (April 2020) and during the state of alert period (July 2020), by fielding two surveys with different modes of collection (CATI and web). Building on measures tested in other countries, we identify the public’s vulnerability to conspiracy narratives and its willingness to comply with public health guidance. Using Structural Equation Modeling, we check if individuals exhibiting pro-Russian or anti-Western attitudes believe more strongly in COVID-19 conspiracy narratives compared to the rest of the population. Then, we check if those believing conspiracy narratives are less susceptible to comply with public health recommendations. We find in both surveys that holding conspiracy beliefs is a mediator between distrusting Western actors and noncompliance with COVID-19 guidelines. Thus, pro-Russian and anti-EU, U.S. and NATO attitudes are linked to stronger conspiracy beliefs, which relate to lower levels of concern and knowledge regarding the virus, which in turn can reduce compliance with guidelines. This suggests that openness to anti-Western narratives may have behavioral consequences. These findings highlight the potential sources of unsafe behaviors during the pandemic and can inform official communication strategies meant to counter both disinformation and non-compliance with public health policies.",Vlad Achimescu et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46009-A81-3C3,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46009-A81-3C3,2020-08-24,2020-08-24T11:49:41+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,False
20,Optimistically biased economic growth forecasts and negatively skewed annual variation,"Authoritative economic growth forecasts are often optimistically biased, with important implications for debates regarding growth futures and climate change scenarios. Negatively skewed variation--where negative shocks to growth are larger than positive shocks--might contribute to bias. Negative skewness makes long-run average growth smaller than typical-year (median) growth, which positively biases forecasts based on typical years. We compare medians and means in real per-capita GDP growth across countries, regions, and time windows from 1820-2016. Over decadal periods, we find mean growth rates to be <1%/y smaller than median growth rates in most countries and regions (median 0.23%/y across countries). Surprisingly, we find both large- and medium-magnitude shocks contribute to these differences, rather than only large ‘black swan’ events. We find negative skewness correlated with high levels and slow growth of per-capita GDP and population, and high per-capita GDP growth volatility, building on previous studies. We find that recent growth over-projections--by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the U.S. Congressional Budget Office (CBO), and the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios--have mostly been larger than negative skewness alone can explain, suggesting other sources of bias exist. Analyses and policy using economic forecasts should account for negative skewness and positive forecast biases.",Matthew G.

21,Staging Science: Authoritativeness and Fragility of Models and Measurement in the COVID-19 Crisis,"n the COVID‐19 crisis, society pins its hopes on science to play an authoritative role in reducing uncertainty and ambiguity. But is science up to the task? This is far from self‐evident. The demands on science in times of crisis run counter to the values of good, normal science. Crisis science needs to be fast, univocal, personalized, and direct, while normal science is slow, contentious, collective, and sensitive to complexity. Science can only play its atypical role if it is staged in the public arena. Some patterns of staging stand out: personalization, visualization, and connection to lived experiences. So far, the staging of science has been successful, but it is fragile. The COVID‐19 crisis shows the potential of well‐staged forms of alliance between science and policy, but when the general assumption is that scientists will “solve” societal “problems,” the staging of science has gone too far.",Wouter Van Dooren et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46101-39A-1A8,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46101-39A-1A8,2020-08-21,2020-08-21T21:17:43+00:00,"SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Administration; policy science interface; covid 19; corona",False
22,Gender differences in the impact of the Covid-19 lockdown on unpaid care work and psychological distress in the UK,"School and nursery closures and homeworking during the Covid-19 crisis have resulted in an immediate increase in unpaid care work, particularly for parents. Amongst contemporary couples in the UK, women spent more time than men doing housework, childcare and caring for adults prior to the crisis; thus, lockdown draws new attention to gender inequality in divisions of unpaid care work. This study aims to answer how couples in the UK divided childcare and housework during lockdown and whether this is associated with changes in levels of psychological distress. Data for this study come from the April and May waves of Understanding Society Covid-19 study. Psychological distress was measured using the GHQ score (ranges from 0 to 36). Unpaid care work included men and women’s hours spent on childcare and housework and the impact of increased unpaid care work on employment schedules. We found that every week, women spent 5 more hours on housework and 10 more hours on childcare than men during lockdown, and this increased housework and childcare was associated with higher levels of psychological distress for women. One-third of parents adapted their work patterns because of childcare/ homeschooling. Men and women who adapted their work patterns had on average 1.16 and 1.39 higher GHQ scores than those who did not. This association was much stronger if he or she was the only member in the household who adapted their work patterns, or if she was a lone mother. Only 10% of fathers reduced work hours due to care work compared to 20% of mothers. Fathers had more psychological distress if they reduced work hours but she did not, compared to neither reducing work hours. Our research suggests that lockdown has hit people with young families and lone mothers particularly hard in terms of mental health, and continued gender inequality in divisions of unpaid care work during lockdown may be putting women at a greater risk of psychological distress.",Baowen Xue et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AE-6C7-E11,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AE-6C7-E11,2020-08-21,2020-08-21T13:00:02+00:00,"SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health; mental health; covid; lone mothers; domestic work; gender inequality; divisions of unpaid care",False
23,A mixed-method analysis of Facebook posts on the COVID-19 pandemic.,"The advent of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has renewed the debate about the credibility of health information shared across social network sites, (SNS), such as Facebook. Despite these concerns, empirical studies into the reliability and accuracy of Facebook posts are largely limited. The objective of this study is to judge the accuracy and reliability of COVID-19-related information shared on Facebook using a mixed methodology. The authors extracted Facebook posts (text and embedded video links) in English from Buzzsumo between March 11, 2020, to April 31, 2020, using predetermined keywords. The first 50 posts pertaining to each keyword were extracted and analyzed using a one-way ANOVA, Tukey test for post hoc analysis, and modified DISCERN score. A qualitative content analysis was then conducted to contextualize the data. 196 posts were included in the analysis, with 24,084,564 shares and 3,436,275 comments. Useful posts had higher interactions compared to misleading and irrelevant posts (p < 0.05). The mean mDISCERN score for reliability was 3.2/5 for useful videos. The majority of the posts (56%) comprised positive appeals.

24,Collaboration through Online Discussion Board: A Discourse Analysis of CALL in a Normal University in China,"Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic, all students take courses online in Mainland China at the beginning of the semester. The discourse for communication online is important for a successful course. In this study, the online discussion board assignment of a college graduate course was analyzed for the discourse patterns based on Vygotsky’s Cultural-historical theories that are more pragmatic than linguistics (Wertsch, 1990) and miss communication between students (Forman & McCormick, 1995). The course was taught and communicated in all-English. Participants are first-year graduate students in one Normal University in Northern Jiangsu Province in China. Data were generated based on a discourse analysis qualitative research and analyzed using the histogram and qualitative discourse pattern analysis. Findings for the histogram showed a late assignment submission, while more than half of students submitted during the final three days while having 11 days to finish. Patterns of responding were discussed in ""questions with most responses"" and ""questions with no response."" The open-ended questions allow respondents to utilize knowledge previously acquired as mediation for further discussions, while close-ended questions received a pattern of the contribution of degrading.

25,A Decade of Stability and Change: Review of U.S. Adolescents' Sexual Behavior and Contraceptive Use 2006-2017,"This study examines changes over time, and demographic differentials, in the prevalence of select sexual behaviors and contraceptive use measures in a national sample of US adolescents. We used data on female and male adolescents aged 15-19 from the 2006-2010 (N=4,662), 2011-2015 (N=4,134), and 2015-2017 (N=1,810) National Survey of Family Growth. Logistic regression was used to identify differences between periods by gender, and for some measures by age, in sexual behaviors (penile-vaginal intercourse (PVI), oral or anal sex with an opposite-sex partner, sexual experience with a same-sex partner), contraceptive use and condom consistency. We estimated probabilities of age at first PVI with Kaplan-Meier failure analysis and tested for changes over time and differences by gender. Over half of all adolescents have engaged in at least one of the sexual behaviors measured. Between 2011-2015 and 2015-2017, males age 15-17 reported significant declines in all but same-sex partners, while the prevalence of sexual behaviors among older males and adolescent females overall remained generally stable. In each period, females were more likely than males to report a same-sex partner. Age of first PVI increased, but by age 17 the difference between time periods is minimal. Adolescent females report increases in the use at last sex of long-acting reversible contraceptive methods (3% to 18%) and multiple methods (27% to 41%). The condom use measures did not change over time. These findings identify components of both stability and change in adolescent sexual and contraceptive behavior in the last decade. Implications This analysis contributes a timely update on trends in adolescent sexual behavior and contraceptive use, showing that adolescents’ behaviors are complex and evolving.

26,COVerAGE-JP: COVID-19 Deaths by Age and Sex in Japan,"This database (https://github.com/fumiyau/COVerAGE-JP) collects COVID-19 deaths by age, sex, date, and region in Japan. As with other causes of deaths, deaths related to COVID-19 are reported by local public health center (Hokenjo), which is located in every prefecture and major metropolitan/large cities. 47 prefectures and some metropolitan cities then collect the information about COVID-19 cases and deaths to report the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare (MHLW). Although MHLW provides a summary statistics about the COVID-19 cases and deaths on their webpage, the distribution broken down by age and sex is not available, that leads many volunteering organizations to collect COVID-19 information based on prefectural/municipality reports. However, even these databases do not provide COVID-19 deaths by age and sex.

27,"Giants On Clay Feet – COVID-19, infection control, and public health laboratory networks in England, the US, and (West-)Germany (1945-2020)","COVID-19 has exposed significant differences in public health systems’ ability to mount effective test and trace responses. This article analyses the historical and structural reasons behind the relative success of Germany and the problems experienced in Britain and the US during the first wave of the pandemic. It also asks why recent international surveys overestimated Anglo-American preparedness. The article argues that the answer lies in the different evolution of public health systems as well as varying public health capacities at the local level. In Germany, post-1994 reforms of the decentralised public health system managed to overcome decades of political neglect and underinvestment and strengthen federal integration without compromising public health capacity at the state and communal level. This joint strengthening of the centre and hinterland allowed the Robert Koch Institute to function as an effective coordinating hub for locally tailored COVID-19 responses. By contrast, the decades after 1970 saw world-renowned Anglo-American public health systems face increasing challenges posed by funding cuts, privatisation, overambitious reforms, and increasing loss of political autonomy. Both the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Public Health England retained significant prestige, which resulted in an overestimation of capacity by international reviews. However, once centres in Atlanta and Colindale had been overwhelmed, there was little local and state public health capacity to fall back on.",Claas Kirchhelle,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4603C-8F9-0F7,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4603C-8F9-0F7,2020-08-19,2020-08-19T11:01:01+00:00,"SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities; SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities|History; SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities|History|History of Science, Technology, and Medicine; phe; cdc; covid-19; robert koch institute; disease surveillance; public health; infection control",False
28,There’s an app for that: technological solutionism as COVID-19 policy in the Global North,"Higher-income countries’ response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been characterised by technological solutionism—the claim that technology on its own can solve problems that are in reality complex and multidimensional. This essay explores the mutual shaping that has occurred between technological solutions and public health policy in the Global North, where governments have allowed capacity to drive policy rather than vice versa. This has led to a situation where contact-tracing and other surveillance technology has become centered in policy, at the expense of the human capacity and material resources that were, and are, necessary to combat the pandemic effectively.

The task is to evaluate the stories as true or false. Besides students with and without healthcare background, we recruit healthcare professionals to increase the external validity of our study. Our main findings are: (i) Healthcare professionals perform similar to students in correctly distinguishing between true and false news stories. (ii) The propensity to engage in analytical thinking and actively open-minded thinking is positively associated with the ability to distinguish between true and false.

30,Disequilibrium and COVID-19: Effectively Applying Crisis Intervention,"Crisis intervention is widely understood as a response to life-threatening emergencies and therefore often limited in its application to natural disasters, severe physical violence, suicidal ideation, and similarly dangerous incidents. While crisis intervention is appropriate for these scenarios, historical definitions of crisis suggest the term and related interventions have much broader application. The ramifications of the novel coronavirus and related cultural fallout increase vulnerability and impair coping capacity in such a way that individuals are significantly more likely to enter crisis states, demanding a prompt reconsideration of the breadth of this practice technique. Successful application of crisis intervention reduces the long-term psychological implications for individuals encountering sudden loss, unexpected traumas, and other hazards that overwhelm traditional coping strategies, outcomes all made more likely by this pandemic. Crisis intervention is a structured, time-limited, problem-oriented treatment modality that is well suited to a remote practice environment because it is directive in its approach and requires few contacts at a time when client access is potentially limited. This paper examines the course of crisis with or without intervention, assessment and intervention tactics, social work values when applying crisis intervention, and the implications of the use of this modality as it relates to COVID-19.",Stephen Oby,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D5-7FB-5A9,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D5-7FB-5A9,2020-08-17,2020-08-17T03:46:01+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work; crisis intervention; coping; crisis; covid-19; disequilibrium; coronavirus,False

34,Automation and Labour in India: Policy Implications of Job Polarisation pre and post COVID-19 crisis,"Advancements in ICTs have heightened the potential of such technology to automate jobs and render labour redundant en masse, uniting the concerns of sociologists, policy makers, and economists alike. Realistically, however, concern revolves not around redundancy of labour, but the polarising effect automation exerts on jobs. This polarisation stems from the claim that automation 'hollows out' mid-skill jobs, thereby increasing demand for high- and low- skill jobs. Job polarisation widens wage disparity, lowers the aggregate skill level of labour and exacerbates existing social inequalities. Proponents of laissez-faire automation argue that while automation may exert adverse effects on labour in the short run, it is bound to realise higher net benefits and employment in the long run. Such an understanding which is based on the Schumpterian notion of creative destruction is predicated on the fact that firms would adopt only such technology which bring about substantial strides in productivity. However, world over and in India firms have been merely substituting labour with capital, without any greater efficiency gains. This trend is only set to worsen with the ongoing health crisis due to varied reasons. In such a situation, it becomes imperative to design novel methods of social security.",Abishek Nippani,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619F-85E-E84,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619F-85E-E84,2020-08-11,2020-08-11T07:07:08+00:00,"SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Economic Policy; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Other Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy; technological unemployment; indian labour market; jobless recovery; job polarisation; labour; social security; automation",False
35,Functional and Dysfunctional Fear of COVID-19: A Classification Scheme,"Worry about COVID-19 is a central topic of research into the social and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Worry can be a negative and debilitating experience that damages mental health and discourages healthy re-engagement with the world, but it can also be a problem-solving activity, directing people’s attention to problems, and encouraging them to act accordingly. We present in this paper a way of measuring worry about catching COVID-19 that distinguishes between “functional fear” and “dysfunctional fear.” Drawing on work into fear of crime, our classification divides people into three groups: (1) the unworried, (2) the functionally worried (adaptive emotions encourage proactive behaviours to reduce the chance of infection) and (3) the dysfunctionally worried (quality of life is damaged by the emotional experience or taking ineffective or damaging precautions). Analysing data from two waves of a longitudinal panel study of over 1,000 individuals living in ten cities in England, Scotland and Wales, we find differing levels of negative anxiety, anger, loneliness, unhappiness and life satisfaction for each of the three groups, with dysfunctionally worried experiencing the most negative outcomes and functionally worried experiencing less negative outcomes than unworried. We find no difference between groups in compliance and willingness to re-engage in social life. Finally, we compare perceptions of risk (differentiating between likelihood, control and consequence) for each group, and find a difference between the dysfunctionally worried compared with functional and unworried groups. Our findings inform what sort of content-targeted messaging aimed at reducing dysfunctional worry might wish to promote. We conclude with some thoughts on the applicability of our measurement scheme for future research.",Reka Solymosi et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46108-D58-862,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46108-D58-862,2020-08-08,2020-08-08T18:06:02+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; risk; wellbeing; worry; covid-19; precautions; re-engagement,False
36,The impacts of covid-19 on Indonesian poverty and unemployment,"This study estimates the negative impacts of the COVID-19 on poverty and unemployment in Indonesia. In doing so, this study develops and uses the SD model that reproduced similar patterns in terms of GDP, poverty, and unemployment. Estimated unemployment and estimated poverty under the COVID-19 are calculated for three different economic scenarios: the optimistic, the mid, and the pessimistic scenarios. This study concludes that Indonesia will experience rising unemployment and poverty in ranges (9-10) and (25-26) million people respectively by the end of this year – depending on projected economy growths. This study suggests that existing financial aids are sufficient to support rising unemployment and rising poverty level. However, if the Indonesia government cannot carefully slow the COVID-19 flow, higher financial supports are required to curb the negative impacts of the COVID-19.",Muhamad Bahri,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460C3-398-844,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460C3-398-844,2020-08-08,2020-08-08T18:03:45+00:00,"SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Economic Policy; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Policy Design, Analysis, and Evaluation; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy; poverty; coronavirus impacts; covid-19; unemployment; socioeconomic impacts; indonesia",False
37,The Economic Consequences of R=1: Towards a Workable Behavioural Epidemiological Model of Pandemics,"This paper reviews the literature on incorporating behavioural elements into epidemiological models of pandemics. While modelling behaviour by forward-looking rational agents can provide some insight into the time paths of pandemics, the non-stationary nature of Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) models of viral spread makes characterisation of resulting equilibria difficult. Here I posit a shortcut that can be deployed to allow for a tractable equilibrium model of pandemics with intuitive comparative statics and also a clear prediction that effective reproduction numbers (that is, R) will tend towards 1 in equilibrium. This motivates taking R=1 as an equilibrium starting point for analyses of pandemics with behavioural agents. The implications of this for the analysis of widespread testing, tracing, isolation and mask-use is discussed.",Joshua Samuel Gans,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D7-5AA-5DC,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D7-5AA-5DC,2020-08-08,2020-08-08T18:02:02+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic Theory; covid-19; epidemiology; pandemic,False
38,Lifestyle and Mental Health Disruptions During COVID-19,"COVID-19 has affected daily life in unprecedented ways. Using a longitudinal dataset linking biometric and survey data from several cohorts of young adults before and during the pandemic (N=685), we document large disruptions to physical activity, sleep, time use, and mental health. At the onset of the pandemic, average steps decline from 9,400 to 4,600 steps per day, sleep increases by about 25-30 minutes per night, time spent socializing declines by over half to less than 30 minutes, and screen time more than doubles to over 5 hours per day. The proportion of participants at risk of clinical depression increases to 65%, over twice the rate in the same population prior to the pandemic. Our analyses suggest that disruption to physical activity is a leading risk factor for depression during the pandemic.

39,Maintaining contact with blue-green spaces during the COVID-19 pandemic associated with positive mental health,"There is growing evidence that exposure to the natural world (blue-green spaces) has potential benefits for mental health and well-being. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures adopted to control it provide a natural experiment to investigate the links between nature exposure and mental health under extreme conditions. Using a survey distributed online and based on 6,080 responses, we tested three hypotheses: (1) people will show different levels of symptoms of depression and anxiety depending on the level of lockdown (severity) and ability to maintain contact with outdoor spaces; and (2) where access to outdoor public spaces was restricted, those with access to private outdoor spaces (2a) or even a green-blue nature view (2b) will show fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety and a more positive mood. Lockdown severity significantly affected mental health, while contact with nature helped people to cope with these impacts. The buffering effect of nature was especially relevant for those under strict lockdowns. People perceived that nature helped them to cope with lockdown measures; and emotions were more positive among individuals with accessible outdoor spaces and blue-green elements in their views. These findings can help decision-makers in developing potential future lockdown measures to mitigate the negative impacts, helping people to be more resilient and maintain better mental health.",Sarai Pouso et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46095-496-4DD,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46095-496-4DD,2020-08-04,2020-08-04T08:29:42+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies; nature’s contributions to people; depression; ecosystem services; anxiety; green-blue infrastructure,False
40,Über was spricht die Politische Theorie? Eine Netzwerkanalyse der Zeitschrift für Politische Theorie (2010-2019),"The article examines the terms and concepts discussed in the first decade of the publication of the Zeitschrift für Politische Theorie (ZPTh). For this purpose, the keywords of all research articles have been collected and edited in order to conduct a network analysis. The analysis focuses on the reconstruction of the discursive field of political theory. Two central results were identified: First, the keyword network forms an almost completely connected network, which, however, 'frays' at the discursive margins and sub-discourses emerge. Second, the keywords 'democracy' and 'freedom' are particularly central to the network and form the core of the political theory debate. Nevertheless, discussions of populism and post-structuralist approaches are also found in the network, thus demonstrating the emergence of new concepts and themes. The political theory debate in the ZPTh thus partially exhibits a center-periphery structure and at the same time illustrates a high degree of pluralism in German-based political theory. The article contributes to self-reflection and understanding in the field of political theory and offers first empirical insights into the state of research and publication of German-based political theory.",Stefan Wallaschek,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46044-34F-ED9,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46044-34F-ED9,2020-08-04,2020-08-04T05:00:42+00:00,SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities; SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Scholarly Publishing; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Political Theory; network analysis; keywords; co-occurence analysis; political theory; discursive field; germany,False
41,The Welfare State and Risk Perceptions: The Novel Coronavirus Pandemic and Public Concern in 70 Countries,"The novel coronavirus pandemic led individuals to experience heightened social risks, particularly financial and health related. The strength of a welfare state shapes individual risk perceptions under normal circumstances. My research question is whether it also shapes risk perceptions in abnormal disaster scenarios, for example amidst the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. I test this using the data from the global COVIDiSTRESS survey to compare 70 countries in April of 2020, a month where deaths resulting from Covid-19 affected three-quarters of the world’s societies. Controlling for local timing and severity of the pandemic, welfare state strength predicts lower risk perceptions. However, this it is not a universal effect as I expected. The welfare state impact depends on how quickly a government introduced strong ‘lock down’ measures. The longer it took a government to respond the more the welfare state reduces risk perceptions. Governments that took lock down measures in advance of the virus show no variation in risk perceptions, whereas governments that took 30 days to respond have up to a 1.5 standard deviation range of risk perceptions depending on the strength of the welfare state. I conclude that the welfare state matters very much when governments fail to take effective intervention measures in a global emergency.",Nate Breznau,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460C0-3E3-6A3,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460C0-3E3-6A3,2020-06-30,2020-08-02T16:16:07+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology; welfare state; pandemic; covid-19; policy intervention; covidistress; novel coronavirus; sars-cov-2; risk perceptions,False
42,Assessing the Impacts of “Infodemic” on Social Well-Being and Health Preparedness of Indian Communities during COVID-19 Pandemic through WhatsApp groups study,"The present study is an attempt to understand the propagation of health-related fake news in India during COVID-19 pandemic in diversely distributed WhatsApp groups comprising uneven groups of members. Ten different WhatsApp groups were selected covering demographic and socio-economic profile and ten most important health-related fake news were studied. Different fake news circulation paths like forward, react, multi-forward, reference etc. were analyzed for different groups. It was observed that older generations (boomers) were more susceptible towards fake news and they tended to distribute the fake news in different groups. Male boomers actively circulate pseudo-science information whereas female boomers distribute faith-based information in the WhatsApp group. It was found that the Gen X as well as Millennials played a role as the first recipients or first responders but primarily most of the forwards were attributed to the Boomers of both genders. Levels of education, social media influence or ignorance, technology access, age, gender and understanding played a major role in the distribution and propagation of fake information during times of COVID. It can be also inferred that easy availability of data and devices, lack of understanding of the game of social media and unscientific baggage of age old beliefs were some factors for over -dependence and reliance on fake news.",Syeda Saadia Azim et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46179-AE9-32B,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46179-AE9-32B,2020-07-31,2020-07-31T20:42:45+00:00,"SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Other Communication; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology; covid-19; fake news; whatsapp group; misinformation",False

44,Cultivating Common Good: A Call for Transformative Science to renew the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP),"This paper calls for transformative science to catalyze the needed change in the agricultural sector. It sheds light on the current dysfunctional system of resource allocation of the CAP and its poor economic, ecological and social outcomes. While the disparity between the desired outcomes and the reality is undisputed within research, former reforms have resulted in little change of the CAP. However, there is now a window of opportunity for real change with the transitional phase of the CAP, the shock event of the Coronavirus pandemic as a magnifying glass for underlying systemic problems and the proclamation of the European Green Deal, in particular the Farm-to-Fork-Strategy. The current system is impoverishing our biodiversity, soils, health and rural socio-economic tissue.

45,Social capital and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic,"COVID-19 pandemic is affecting mental health and wellbeing across populations. The continued burden of psychosocial stressors in different contexts necessitates multipronged interventions that address mental health problems and associated disparities. Global evidence suggests that social capital plays a critical role in determining mental health outcomes in communities, which can be leveraged for improving mental health in COVID-19. As communities with better social capital is likely to have a lower burden of mental disorders, it is necessary to assess potential measures to use social capital for mental health promotion in vulnerable populations. The existing forms of social capital may provide social support within and between communities that are critically affected by COVID-19. Alongside faster recovery from socioeconomic challenges, social capital interventions may strengthen the social determinants of mental health and empower communities to alleviate the psychosocial consequences of this pandemic.",Tahmina Tasnim Rodela et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B6-B45-166,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B6-B45-166,2020-07-28,2020-07-28T07:08:05+00:00,"SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Clinical Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociological Practice and Public Sociology; mental health; coronavirus; psychosocial interventions; covid-19; social capital; mental disorders",False

This study investigates this pandemic from the perspective of government responses. The analyses are not limited to the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on deaths, but also cover the effect of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths on NPIs using daily cross-national data. This paper also shows the precise timing in which NPIs have a reduced effect on deaths. The results indicate that confirmed cases are more positively correlated with NPIs than deaths, and NPIs show a strong positive correlation with deaths in the short run and a negative correlation in the long run.

47,Global City in a Global Pandemic: Assessing the Ongoing Impact of COVID Induced Trends on London’s Economic Sectors,"Over the last 50 years, London has successfully adapted to technological change and globalization, making it the major driver of the UK economy. But its strengths have also made the city particularly vulnerable to the health impacts of COVID-19, and potentially also to wider negative economic implications of the crisis. Many of London’s key sectors rely on proximity, agglomeration economies and externalities. We evaluate the available data on the impact of the pandemic on London to date, with a particular focus on the differential effects between sectors. We also identify seven key trends, affecting both the demand and supply side of the economy, that are likely to have significant medium- to long-term economic impacts, and assess the potential impacts on London’s major industrial sectors.

48,"Intelligent lockdown, intelligent effects? The impact of the Dutch COVID-19 ‘intelligent lockdown’ on gendered work and family dynamics among parents","This study examines the impact of the Dutch ‘intelligent lockdown’ during the COVID-19 pandemic on work and family dynamics among parents. This ‘intelligent lockdown’ relied on a combination of restrictive measures and an emphasis on individual responsibility as a means of lessening the spread and health impact of the pandemic. However, the COVID-19 pandemic is more than a public health crisis. Lockdown measures had substantial societal effects, including a significant impact on parents with (young) children. Given gender inequality existent prior to the pandemic, the question arises to what extent the consequences of the lockdown varied for mothers and fathers. Using representative survey data gathered among Dutch parents in April 2020, we explore changes in three areas: paid work, the division of care and household work, and quality of life (leisure, work-life balance, relationship dynamics). Our linear probability and multinomial logistic models demonstrate that the way in which families were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic reflects a complex gendered reality. We find that gender inequality patterns in the division of paid work, care work, and housework continue to exist. Moreover, the unique situation created by restrictive lockdown measures magnified some inequalities while others were lessened. We find evidence of increased gender inequality in relation to paid work and quality of life, yet a decrease in gender inequality in the division of care and household tasks. During the lockdown, Dutch fathers reported doing more care and household tasks than before. The insights provided here offer key comparative references for understanding the broader impact of lockdown measures on work and family dynamics, as well as quality of life as we move forward in the COVID-19 pandemic.",Mara A.

49,A Pragmatic Analysis of Islam-related Terminologies in Selected Eastern and Western,"The mass media are blamed for constructing a negative image of Islam through the use of Islam-related terms in reporting terrorism. It is presumed that when Islam-related terms are used without regard to their original connotations, they are likely to lose their original meanings and begin to take on altered meanings created by the media. Therefore, this study aims to explore the use of Islam-related terminologies in selected eastern and western mass media outlets in relation to their semantic and linguistic interpretations. The study employed a qualitative approach in which content analysis was used. Using purposive sampling, The Jordan Times and Al-Jazeera were chosen from the eastern Arab world while The BBC and The Guardian were chosen from the western media. total of 368 news articles focusing on Islam and Muslims were collected from the selected news media outlets using internet-based search from March 2018 until October 2019. The findings showed significant differences (P = 0.000/P < 0.05) exist between the selected eastern and western mass media outlets in using Islam-related terminologies. The terms are used more frequently in the western media outlets than in the eastern media outlets. Further analysis of the findings revealed that the selected media outlets use Islam-related terminologies, such as “Islamist” and “Jihadist”, in negative contexts. The use of Islam-related terminologies in the selected media outlets could be influential in making the audience to perceive Islam as a religion of terrorism. The negative use of Islam-related terms could be minimized through training of journalists on news coverage of religion, provision of proper guidelines on religious reporting and ensuring that these guidelines are strictly followed. It was envisaged that this study would be useful to the media outlets, particularly in the process of news gathering, production, and dissemination.",Arab World English Journal Awej Awej AWEJ et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46093-3E4-EBC,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46093-3E4-EBC,2020-07-20,2020-07-20T01:07:51+00:00,SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities; SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature; SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature|Other English Language and Literature; media discourse; terminologies; islam; pragmatic analysis; online news; terrorism,False
50,Apolitical Values & Compliance with Government-Recommended Prosocial Health Behavior,"At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, federal government and local governments across the U.S. recommended that individuals engage in social distancing and other prosocial health behaviors (e.g., wear a mask when out in public). While social scientists know a fair amount about the extent to which people complied with these recommendations, far less is known about why some people may have been more likely to do so. Building on insights from Human Values Theory, we argue that people who are more self-transcendent (i.e., more likely to put others’ needs before their own) should be more likely to engage in a variety of prosocial health behaviors (PSHB); including social distancing. In a nationally representative survey (N = 1,015) conducted at the start of the coronavirus outbreak, we find that people who are highly self-transcendent were significantly more likely to engage in PSHB. Recognizing the limitations of self-reported data, we validate these findings by merging both international and inter-state phone-tracking data into state and country opinion surveys. We find that, on average, people in both countries and states that place a higher emphasis on self-transcendence values were more likely to engage in social distancing at the start of the pandemic.",Matthew Motta et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4609F-D69-3EA,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4609F-D69-3EA,2020-07-17,2020-07-17T15:01:25+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics; mask wearing; social distancing; covid19; health behavior; public opinion; political psychology; values; political science,False

52,"How the ‘plates’ of a health system can shift, change and adjust during economic recessions. A qualitative interview study of public and private health providers in Brazil’s São Paulo and Maranhão states","Background. Economic recessions carry an impact on population health and access to care; less is known on how health systems adapt to the conditions brought by a downturn. This particularly matters now that the COVID-19 epidemic is putting health systems under stress. Brazil is one of the world’s most affected countries, and its health system was already living the aftermath of the 2015 recession. Methods. Between 2018 and 2019 we conducted 46 semi-structured interviews with health practitioners, managers and policy-makers to explore the impact of the 2015 recession on public and private providers in prosperous (São Paulo) and impoverished (Maranhão) states in Brazil. Thematic analysis was employed to identify drivers and consequences of system adaptation and coping strategies. Nvivo software was used to aid data collection and analysis. We followed the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research to provide an account of the findings. Results. We found the concept of ‘health sector crisis’ to be politically charged among healthcare providers in São Paulo and Maranhão. Contrary to expectations, the public sector was reported to have found ways to compensate for diminishing federal funding, having outsourced services and adopted flexible – if insecure – working arrangements. Following a drop in employment and health plans, private health insurance companies streamlined their offer, at times at the expenses of coverage. Low-cost walk-in clinics were hit hard by the recession, but also credited for having moved to cater for higher-income customers in Maranhão. Conclusions. The ‘plates’ of a health system may shift and adjust in unexpected ways in response to recessions, and some of these changes might outlast the crisis. As low-income countries enter post-COVID recessions, it will be important to monitor the adjustments taking place in health systems, to ensure that past gains in access to care and job security are not eroded.",Giuliano Russo et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46046-22F-D5C,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46046-22F-D5C,2020-07-12,2020-07-13T17:39:49+00:00,"SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Industrial Organization; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Economic Policy; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy; brazil health system; covid-19 and health systems; economic recession and health; health services in lmics",False
53,Understanding Violence during Coronavirus lockdown from a Policy Perspective,"India has always been in a conflicting state in itself. The term largest democracy helps to bind an understanding regarding the reason and rise in violence. Different age groups with different mindset living on same land make them vulnerable and intolerable due to their living condition. A slight change in their routine has an effect on their actions. This became an objective to study a rise in the number of violence during coronavirus lockdown. There are multiple factors which trigger different forms of outrage and anger among people forcing them to indulge in an act of violence. Factors triggering violence can be social and cultural norms or can be political norms. These norms help in shaping individual behaviour both negatively and positively. The leading indicators of these norms are income, employment, stress is a result in itself not a factor perse, religious, gender disparity and literacy. The understanding of norms cannot remain error free until seen from the lens of policy implication. It will give a ground reality of its existence. However, there are constant efforts to deal with such atrocities. The paper will try to address the question of such violence that have existed and still continue to grow even when the Government have stringent policies to address such issue.",Roshani Goel,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461C5-49B-967,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461C5-49B-967,2020-07-12,2020-07-12T19:42:41+00:00,"SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction; health issue; policy; unemployment; lockdown; vioence",False
54,Blue uncertainty: Warding off systemic risks in the Anthropocene – Lessons from COVID-19,"COVID-19 has made evident that we are ill-prepared to respond to an international health emergency, the complex interdependence of social and ecological systems, and that to reduce the risk of future zoonotic pandemics we must safeguard nature. Approaches based on complexity science taking into account that interdependence and its associated systemic risks must be mainstreamed in current policy making, in general. However, at present, that could result in failure for three main reasons: (1) those approaches might be too sophisticated for current policy making pursuing sustainable development; (2) the reductionist views from conventional economics still deeply influence economic and environmental policy making; (3) it is unlikely that far-reaching policies aimed at stimulating post-pandemic economic development can be steered through radically innovative approaches that remain untested. Here, using COVID-19 as an example, I suggest that the use of innovative complexity-based approaches could be enabled through intermediary approaches equipped to resonate with the mindset pervading current policy making. In particular, I propose to understand the response to unexpected systemic threats as instances of reactive policy making driven by radical uncertainty, and advance three notions that could enhance that understanding: modulating contingency, adaptive inference and blue uncertainty.",Pablo F.

55,Online Learning During Lockdown Period For Covid-19 In India,"Covid-19, as a global pandemic, has called for social distancing. It has made people mandatory to sit indoor and sitting idle indoor may lead to mental stress. Hence to keep people engaged and free from mental stress, online learning can play important role. Online learning is the best solution during this pandemic situation. Teachers can use virtual classrooms to teach from home with all necessary tools which makes the online sessions as effective as traditional ones. Pandemics often compel the learners to stay at home for long period of time and obstruct teaching-learning process. This article emphasizes on how online learning is beneficial during times of crises like work absences or pandemics. Therefore, some tools and techniques for online learning which can ensure the continuity of learning are highlighted. Some emerging approaches of Government of India for online learning are presented. Merits and demerits of online learning platform are also discussed. Perceptions of learners and educators on Online Learning system during lockdown are pointed.",Pravat Kumar Jena,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46109-435-BC1,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46109-435-BC1,2020-07-10,2020-07-10T20:32:03+00:00,"SocArXiv|Education; SocArXiv|Education|Adult and Continuing Education; SocArXiv|Education|Educational Assessment, Evaluation, and Research; SocArXiv|Education|Elementary Education; SocArXiv|Education|Higher Education; SocArXiv|Education|Other Education; SocArXiv|Education|Teacher Education and Professional Development; educators; perceptions of learners &amp; online platforms; online learning",False
56,Gender Differences in Telecommuting and Implications for Inequality at Home and Work,"The global pandemic has led to an unprecedented shift to remote work that will likely persist to some degree into the future. Telecommuting’s impact on flexibility and work family conflict is a critical question for researchers and policy-makers. Our study addresses this question with data collected before and during the COVID-19 crisis: the 2003-2018 American Time Use Survey (ATUS, N = 19,179) and the April and May 2020 COVID Impact Survey (N = 784). Comparing mothers and fathers who work exclusively at the workplace, exclusively from home, and part-day from home, we describe differences in time spent on housework, childcare, and leisure; the nature of time worked at home; and the subjective experiences of telecommuting. In addition to a broad descriptive portrait, we take advantage of a quasi-experimental design in the ATUS leave supplements to examine time working at home among those who report ever telecommuting, providing estimates of telecommuting’s effect on other uses of time that better approximate causal relationships than prior studies. We find that gender gaps in housework are larger for telecommuters, and, among telecommuters, larger on telecommuting days. Conversely, telecommuting may shrink the gender gap in childcare, particularly among couples with two full time earners, although childcare more frequently impinges upon mothers’ work time. Survey data collected following the March COVID19 stay-at-home orders show that telecommuting mothers more frequently report feelings of anxiety, loneliness and depression than telecommuting fathers. Early estimates of responses to the COVID19 pandemic offer insights into future implications of telecommuting for gender equality at work.",Thomas Lyttelton et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F8-A87-AC7,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F8-A87-AC7,2020-07-09,2020-07-09T05:06:21+00:00,"SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender; housework; care work; covid; inequality; telecommuting; wellbeing; time use; covid-19; work; gender; household labor; working from home",False
57,Natural stings: alternative health services selling distrust about vaccines on YouTube,"In this study, we investigate YouTube’s videos related to vaccines to understand the particularities of the opposition to vaccines in Brazil. The World Health Organization considered vaccine hesitation as one of the greatest threats to global health in 2019. Researchers associated this hesitation to a strengthening of the anti-vaccination movements, suggesting that social media is currently the main spreader of this position. YouTube increasingly becomes a matter of concern, since its recommendation system is identified as a promoter of misinformation and extreme content. Despite YouTube’s statements, misinformation and disinformation (M&D) about vaccines continue to be disseminated in videos in Portuguese, reaching a large audience. We found 52 videos containing M&D about vaccines. The main M&D were the claim of dangerous ingredients in vaccines, the defense of self-direction — freedom of choice, independent research —, the promotion of alternative health services, the myth that vaccines cause diseases, conspiracy theories, and the allegation of vaccine’s severe collateral effects. We identified 39 brands advertising on 13 videos of our M&D sample. Although the YouTube Partner Program is an important source of income, the channels use different economic strategies, such as the selling of courses, and therapies and the use of fundraising platforms. We also found that alternative health channels spread distrust about traditional institutions to promote themselves as trusted sources for the audience and thereby profit with alternative health services.",Dayane Fumiyo Tokojima Machado et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461EF-1A2-964,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461EF-1A2-964,2020-07-01,2020-07-07T18:04:23+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media; disinformation; misinformation; youtube; vaccines; alternative health,False
58,Global years of life lost to COVID-19,"Understanding the mortality impact of COVID-19 requires not only counting the dead, but analyzing how premature the deaths are. We calculate years of life lost (YLL) across 42 countries due to COVID-19 attributable deaths, and also conduct an analysis based on estimated excess deaths. As of June 13th 2020, YLL in heavily affected countries are 2 to 6 times the average seasonal influenza; over two thirds of the YLL result from deaths in ages below 75 and one quarter from deaths below 55; and men have lost 47% more life years than women. The results confirm the large mortality impact of COVID-19 among the elderly.

59,Linking excess mortality to Google mobility data during the COVID-19 pandemic in England and Wales,"Following the outbreak of COVID-19, a number of non-pharmaceutical interventions have been implemented to contain the spread of the pandemic. Despite the recent reduction in the number of infections and deaths in Europe, it is still unclear to which extent these governmental actions have contained the spread of the disease and reduced mortality. In this article, we estimate the effects of reduced human mobility on excess mortality using digital mobility data at the regional level in England and Wales. Specifically, we employ the Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports, which offer an approximation to the changes in mobility due to different social distancing measures. Considering that changes in mobility would require some time before having an effect on mortality, we analyse the relationship between excess mortality and lagged indicators of human mobility. We find a negative association between excess mortality and time spent at home, as well as a positive association with changes in outdoor mobility, after controlling for the time trend of the pandemic and regional differences. We estimate that almost 130,000 excess deaths have been averted as a result of the increased time spent at home. In addition to addressing a key scientific question, our results have important policy implications for future pandemics and a potential second wave of COVID-19.",Ugofilippo Basellini et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46029-C77-D97,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46029-C77-D97,2020-07-07,2020-07-07T16:54:48+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population; digital data; excess mortality; human mobility; covid-19; coronavirus; sars-cov-2,False
60,"Indirect consequences of COVID-19 on people’s lives. Findings from an on-line survey in France, Italy and Spain","The COVID-19 pandemic has limited individuals’ possibility to meet and socialize with others due to the state of emergency restrictions to movements, events and relations imposed in different countries. Most shops and restaurants have been closed and some economic activities have been seriously damaged. This significant disruption may have contributed to a deterioration of people’s mental health on top of other negative consequences of the pandemic. To better understand the indirect consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak on people’s lives we have designed the intergen-COVID online survey (https://sites.google.com/unifi.it/intergen-covid), carried out in France, Italy and Spain between the 14th to the 24th of April 2020. Quota sampling on the population 18-plus and post-stratification weights were used to achieve the alignment between the sample (N = 9,056) and the total population on important socio-demographic characteristics. We collected information on four key domains of individuals’ lives: intergenerational (and other type of) relationships (physical and non-physical; means of communication; frequency, etc.); living arrangements; mental health; events experienced during the lockdown (e.g., income loss, death of relative/friend due to COVID-19, worsened partner relationships, time spent with family); intentions for the future 3 years (e.g., fertility, living parental home, marriage, cohabitation, divorce/separation, retirement). In this paper we provide the main results from this survey, focusing on the first three domains abovementioned. The fourth domain consists of questions applicable to different sub-groups of the population and will be analyzed in separate papers. We show that, despite the general reduction of physical contacts, with low educated people reporting a lower reduction in all kinds of physical contacts, non-physical contacts have significantly increased, especially among women. About 50% of respondents felt sad or depressed more often than usual during the lockdown, but mental health deterioration was found to be heterogeneous and vary with respondents’ age, gender and country. Job and income loss, and worsening of relationships quality were other negative consequences often experienced during the lockdown, especially by younger individuals. Finally, although maintaining physical distance, during the lockdown people have experienced a high level of social connection, emotional support and practical help.",Bruno Arpino et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4603E-788-AD3,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4603E-788-AD3,2020-07-07,2020-07-07T13:06:02+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning; physical distancing; mental health; social relationships; coronavirus; sars-cov-2; consequences of covid-19; covid-19,False
61,Learning to love cosmopolitanism? Testing the socialisation effect of educational field of study on cosmopolitan attitudes in the Netherlands,"Across Europe, those with higher education are consistently found to be more pro-cosmopolitan than those with less education. However, it remains an open question what aspects of education drive this relationship. One influential mechanism through which education is argued to affect cosmopolitan attitudes is by instilling tolerance inducing values and beliefs that continue to influence the thinking of students long after they have left the education system. Using the Dutch LISS panel between 2008 and 2019, we explore differences in the emphasis on tolerant values and beliefs across fields of study to assess the explanatory power of the socialisation model of education for cosmopolitan attitudes. By estimating between- and within subject panel regressions, we find that although there are cross-sectional differences between fields of study in cosmopolitan attitudes, these differences cannot conclusively be attributed to the socialisation influence of the specific field. Consequently, our results challenge the importance of the socialisation model to understand the current educational divide in cosmopolitanism.",Sander Kunst,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461CE-1D9-260,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461CE-1D9-260,2020-07-07,2020-07-07T13:04:23+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; field of study; education; cosmopolitanism; liss panel,False
62,"Getting out while staying in: Park use decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially where park availability was low","The spread of COVID-19 altered use of public spaces, such as parks, with potential effects on human health and well-being. Little is known about park use during the pandemic, how local features (e.g, park availability) influence use, and whether park visits accelerate COVID-19 spread. Using weekly panel data for 620 U.S. counties, we show park visits decreased by 10% beginning March 15, and by 17-35% through May 9, 2020. Net of weekly sample trends, park visits decreased by 2.3% when stay-at-home orders were in effect, yet increased by 8.3% after school closures and 4.1% after business closures. Park visits decreased less during the pandemic in metropolitan counties or where park availability was high. Higher park visits were weakly associated with COVID-19 case growth rate but not incidence. Thus, parks may serve as alternatives for recreation when schools and businesses close, especially where parks are available, with no-to-little influence on COVID-19 spread.",David Stuart Curtis et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4604A-5F4-63E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4604A-5F4-63E,2020-07-06,2020-07-06T16:05:31+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning; covid-19; cell phone data; green space; park access; social distancing measures; google mobility reports; parks; outdoor recreation; safegraph,False
63,Migration discourse in Sweden: frames and sentiments in mainstream and social media,"This study makes a systematic analysis of media discourse on migration in Sweden in 2012-2019. Using a novel dataset consisting of mainstream newspapers, Twitter and forum data, the article answers two questions: what do Swedish media actually talk about when they talk about “migration”? And how do they talk about it? Using a combination of computational text analysis tools, I analyse a shift in the media discourse as one of the outcomes of the so-called “European refugee crisis” in 2015 and try to comprehend the role of social media in this process. The results of the study provide some evidence for a populist and hostile character of the migration framing and indicate that the messages on social media, generally, had negative tonality. At the same time, the analysis of framing and sentiment dynamics suggests that a statement about the discourse shift in the Swedish media during the “European refugee crisis” is to some extent over-estimated. Rather, one can suggest that the role of the “crisis” should be viewed in a broader political and historical context.",Victoria Yantseva,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4624E-B9D-7C0,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4624E-B9D-7C0,2020-07-06,2020-07-06T10:17:08+00:00,"SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration; twitter; media discourse; refugee crisis; computational text analysis; migration; social media; automated text analysis; sentiment analysis; topic modelling",False
64,"The Heathen, the Plague, and the Model Minority: Perpetual Self-Assessment of Asian Americans as a Panoptic Mechanism","The novel coronavirus has highlighted some racial divides in the United States. Incidents of racism against Asians, in particular, have been on the rise since the pandemic turned global in early 2020. I employ Foucault’s concept of panopticism to examine how some Asians and Asian Americans respond to xenophobic or anti-Asian sentiments during the pandemic by performing a close reading of an op-ed by former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang on The Washington Post. This essay argues that the panoptic mechanism of perpetual self-assessment ensures that Asian Americans accept their place within America’s racial hierarchy and adapts the dominant white racial frame. Borrowing theoretical resources from religious studies, this essay also demonstrates that the precarious dualistic identities assigned to Asian Americans by the panoptic structure help to ensure that Asian Americans are only able to negotiate their identities within such discursive limits. Such limitations uphold whiteness as the American Gnosis. This panoptic mechanism of perpetual self-assessment of the Asian Americans makes it hard to locate, let alone criticize the white racial frame. The assignment of identity by the gaze is the real power that lies within the Panopticon and what truly sustains this structure in modern society.",Sherry Chan,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46046-4E1-EA3,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46046-4E1-EA3,2020-07-06,2020-07-06T02:37:41+00:00,SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities; SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities|Religion; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; whiteness; religion; asian american; religious studies; asian; foucault; coronarivus; racism; race and ethnicity,False
65,Challenges and Opportunities created by Covid-19 for ODL: A case study of IGNOU,"The pandemic Covid-19 came as havoc for developing countries like India. It has significantly disrupted the education sector which is a critical determinant of a country’s economic future. It has compelled the human society to maintain social distancing. It has made people mandatory to sit indoor and sitting idle indoor may lead to mental stress. Hence, it has created more challenges to keep people engaged and free from mental stress. Open and Distance Learning (ODL) system is the best solution to meet the challenges of education during this pandemic situation of COVID-19. Every challenge is an opportunity. These challenges have also created opportunities for the educational institutes to strengthen their technological knowledge and infrastructure to tackle the Covid-19 like situation. Indian education system is more acquainted with face to face or physical teaching learning process. Most of educators and learners are not equipped with use of technology in education and there is also lack of practice and motivation towards use of technology in education which creates more challenges during pandemics.

66,Twitter under Storm: Social Media Response Sensitization in the Caribbean,"Climate change has led to rising sea levels and warmer sea surface temperatures. These factors contribute greatly to the intensity of hurricanes and floods they provoke. Projections estimate there will be an increase of 45% to 87% in the frequency of Category >4 hurricanes originating in the Atlantic Basin, which typically impact the Caribbean and Continental United States of America. During the 2019 Hurricane Season, there were 20 depressions, 18 storms, 6 hurricanes and 3 major hurricanes. Through this work, we explored the response on Social Media to these natural phenomena as a function of their trajectory, intensity, and previous exposure of the population to intense natural disasters. Data was collected through the Twitter API. The influences of hurricane proximity and intensity on volume of Social Media production was explored. Hurricane Dorian, with its trajectory strongly threatening the previously exposed Puerto Rico, and eventually causing widespread damage in the Abaco Islands of the Bahamas, presented the strongest case for the evaluation of the dichotomy of responses between populations with differences in previous history of exposure.

67,"Emerging COVID-19 impacts, responses, and lessons for building resilience in the seafood system","The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns are creating health and economic crises that threaten food and nutrition security. The seafood sector provides important sources of employment and nutrition, especially in low-income countries, and is highly globalized, allowing shocks to propagate internationally. We use a resilience ‘action cycle’ framework to study the first five months of COVID-19-related disruptions, impacts, and responses to the seafood sector. Looking across high- and low-income countries, we find that some supply chains, market segments, companies, small-scale actors and civil society have shown initial signs of greater resilience than others. For example, frozen Ecuadorian shrimp and Chinese tilapia exports were diverted to alternative markets, while live-fresh supply chains were more impacted. COVID-19 has also highlighted the vulnerability of certain groups working in- or dependent on the seafood sector.

Using original survey data, we find that the effect of Fox News came not merely from its long-standing distrustful stance toward science, but also due to program-specific content that minimized the COVID-19 threat.",Elliott Ash et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46159-2E5-B55,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46159-2E5-B55,2020-06-27,2020-06-27T14:10:21+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy,False
69,Applications of artificial intelligence technologies on mental health research during COVID-19,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted mental health globally. It is essential to deploy advanced research methodologies that may use complex data to draw meaningful inferences facilitating mental health research and policymaking during this pandemic. Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies offer a wide range of opportunities to leverage advancements in data sciences in analyzing health records, behavioral data, social media contents, and outcomes data on mental health. Several studies have reported the use of several AI technologies such as vector machines, neural networks, latent Dirichlet allocation, decision trees, and clustering to detect and treat depression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, and other mental health problems. The applications of such technologies in the context of COVID-19 is still under development, which calls for further deployment of AI technologies in mental health research in this pandemic using clinical and psychosocial data through technological partnerships and collaborations.

70,"Restarting “normal” life after Covid-19 and the lockdown: Evidence from Spain, the United Kingdom, and Italy","Currently, unprecedented series of events are taking place that affect the institutional structure of the world economy and the social fabric of our societies. In this article, we examine the expectations of the economic outlook, fear of the future, and behavioural change during the lockdown, for three European countries (Spain, the United Kingdom, and Italy) that have been severely hit by Covid-19. We use a novel data source that we collected to monitor the three countries during the pandemic. As outcome variables, we use expectations (e.g., economic outlook, labour market situation, recovery), fear (e.g., scenario of new outburst, economic depression, restriction to individual rights and freedom), and behavioural change across the following dimensions: savings, cultural consumption, social capital, and risky behaviour. After providing descriptive evidence that is representative of the population of interest, using longitudinal data from the same survey on exposure to shocks and matching techniques, we estimate the impact of exposure to shock occurred during the crisis on the same outcome variables.",Cristiano Codagnone et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4617A-A2C-F06,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4617A-A2C-F06,2020-06-21,2020-06-21T19:24:49+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Cognitive Psychology; expectations; covid19; fear; behavioural change; negative economic shocks,False
71,Studying the prominence effect amid the COVID-19 crisis: implications for public health policy decision-making.,"Background: The novel COVID-19 has brought upon crucial policy- and decision- making situations, especially when making judgments between economic and health concerns. One particularly relevant decision-making phenomenon is the prominence effect, where decision-makers base their decisions on the most prominent attribute of the object at hand (e.g., health concerns) rather than weigh all the attributes together. This bias diminishes when the decision-making mode inhibits heuristic processes. In this study, we tested the prominence of health vs. economic concerns across two decision-making modes - choice (prone to heuristics) and matching (mitigates heuristics) - during the peak of the COVID-19 in the UK using Tversky et al.’s classic experimental paradigm. We added to the classic experimental design a priming condition. Methods and Findings: Four hundred twenty participants from the UK were recruited via a crowd-working platform. They were presented with two casualty- minimization programs, differing in lives saved and costs: program X would save 100 lives at the cost of 55-million-pound sterling, whereas program Y would save 30 lives at the cost of 12-million-pound sterling. Half of the participants were required to choose between the programs (choice condition). The other half were not given the cost of program X and were asked to determine what the cost should be to make it as equally attractive as the program Y. Participants in both groups were primed for either: a) economic concerns; b) health concerns; or c) control (no priming). Results showed that in the choice condition, unless primed for economic concerns, health concerns are more prominent (only under economic priming was there a significant preference for program Y, p<0.001). In the matching condition, on the other hand, the prominence of health concerns did not affect decision-makers, as they all “preferred” the cheaper option. Conclusions: These results add further support to the practical relevance of using the proper decision-making modes in times of consequential crises where multiple concerns, interests, and parties are involve",Yossi Maaravi et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4623F-E65-683,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4623F-E65-683,2020-06-21,2020-06-21T03:27:21+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology,False

74,"Lärares digitala kompetens före, under och efter covid-19","This study chrono-logically investigates teachers’ professional knowledge in relation to the digitally ‘boosted’ educational landscape caused by the COVID-19-pandemic. The aim is to describe how teachers employ their competences under extreme digitized circumstances compared to ordinary, to a greater extent analogically organized schooling. The study is inspired by action research where five secondary and upper secondary teachers document their work between March 19 and April 2020. A contrastive analysis highlights qualitative aspects of teachers’ (digital) competence when teaching is affected by digital “interferences” in its corporeal and material framing, a dissolved spatiality and “truncated” senses/sensuousness. Employing different dimensions of knowledge in terms of intellectus and ratio, the study argues that subjective, emotional and relational processes of teachers’ digital competence need to be prioritized in contrast to the easily measurable aspects that tend to overrun the discussions about educational digitalization and its knowledge in society.",Linnea Stenliden et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46198-E2C-626,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46198-E2C-626,2020-06-18,2020-06-18T20:29:05+00:00,SocArXiv|Education; SocArXiv|Education|Online and Distance Education; SocArXiv|Education|Secondary Education; home schooling; remote teaching; distance teaching; quarantine; online teaching; lärare; education; skola; school closure; intellectus; covid-19; ratio; social precense; distansundervisning; skolnedstängning; digital kompetens; utbildning,False
75,The importance of urban natural areas and urban ecosystem services during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Urban, peri-urban forests and other natural areas provide a wide range of material and non-material benefits to people known as ecosystem services. Access to these areas has been linked to improvements in physical and mental health of local populations. In the Spring of 2020, the COVID-19 global pandemic forced many governments to impose a set of restrictions including the closure of businesses and cancelation of events, social distancing and limitation of gatherings, and movement limitations. During this period of restrictions, we conducted a study assessing the importance of urban and peri-urban forests and other natural areas to people living in and around the city of Burlington, Vermont, USA. We evaluated the use and value changes related to these natural areas before and during the period of restrictions. We received over 400 surveys from the local community. The results show that 69.0% of the respondents had increased or greatly increased their visitation rate to these areas, and 80.6% of respondents considered that the importance of these natural areas and access to them either increased or greatly increased. Moreover 25.8% of the sample had either never, or very rarely accessed their local natural areas before the pandemic, but 69.2% of the first time or infrequent visitors reported that having access to these areas during COVID-19 as ‘very important’. People reported that these areas were important for a wide range of activities from exercise to birding, but also reported values related to reducing stress in a time of global chaos. Our results indicate the increasing demand and value of such areas in times of crisis such as COVID-19. Experts in zoonotic disease predict the potential for more frequent pandemic events, thus predicating the importance for continued funding for, maintenance of and improved access to natural areas to our largely urban civilization.",Brendan Fisher et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A2-F81-886,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A2-F81-886,2020-06-12,2020-06-18T15:10:23+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,False
76,The Political Scar of Epidemics,"What will be political legacy of the Coronavirus pandemic? We find that epidemic exposure in an individual's impressionable years (ages 18 to 25) has a persistent negative effect on confidence in political institutions and leaders. We find similar negative effects on confidence in public health systems, suggesting that the loss of confidence in political leadership and institutions is associated with healthcare related policies at the time of the epidemic. In line with this argument, our results are mostly driven by individuals who experienced epidemics under weak governments with less capacity to act against the epidemic, disappointing their citizens. We provide evidence of this mechanism by showing that weak governments took longer to introduce policy interventions in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. These results imply that the Coronavirus may leave behind a long-lasting political scar on the current young generation (""Generation Z"").",Cevat Giray Aksoy et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46191-E9D-D60,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46191-E9D-D60,2020-06-16,2020-06-16T07:40:02+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy; epidemics; government approval; political trust; covid-19; democracy,False
77,Lifting the lockdown: what are the options for low and middle-income countries?,"To limit the social, economic and psychological damage caused by strict social distancing interventions, many low and middle-income countries (LMICs) are seeking to ease restrictions. However, it is unknown what a ‘safe reopening’ entails in LMICs given suboptimal diagnostic and surveillance capabilities. Here we discuss three community-based public health measures (sustained mitigation, zonal lockdown and dynamic rolling lockdowns) which seek to adequately balance the public health and economic priorities. Each of these options have limitations and prerequisites that may be context-specific and should be considered before implementation, including implementation and maintenance costs, social and economic costs, context-specific epidemic growth and the existing health resources.",Rajiv Chowdhury et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46246-83F-814,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46246-83F-814,2020-06-16,2020-06-16T07:30:23+00:00,"SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy; covid-19; lmics; exit strategies",False

79,Year 10 and 12 school students' opinions on returning to partial schooling during the COVID-19 pandemic: an action research prospective survey,"Objective Educational provision changed during the lockdown period of the COVID-19 outbreak in the UK (20th March to 31st May 2020) with schooling moving online. The Prime Minister announced a timetable for partial reopening of school on 10th May. With the return to partial schooling imminent, the views of year 10 and year 12 students were surveyed. Design Cross-sectional web-based survey disseminated via closed social media fora. Setting A structured questionnaire hosted on Google Forms™ and disseminated via two Facebook™ fora in the week prior to the original stated date of return to partial schooling for year 10 and year 12 students (20th to 27th May 2020). Participants United Kingdom school students in year 10 (age 14 to 15 years old) and year 12 (age 16 to 17 years old). Main outcome measures Views of year 10 and year 12 students on returning to schools with a focus on their opinions on government guidance, impact on their future, and how remote learning has impacted on their education. Results 1534 students (yr10 n= 1007 66%, yr12 n=527 34%) completed the questionnaire. Students were equally divided in opinion with 781 (51%) preferring to return to partial schooling with limited educational contact and 753 (49%) preferring to remain isolated at home with remote schooling, when an unsure option was removed. A majority (73%, n=1111) of students feel unsafe or unsure that Government guidelines will be enough to protect them from COVID-19 in a school environment. 79% (n=1205) of students felt that COVID-19 has impacted on their future. 15% (n=231) of students said they have had no additional support or guidance from their school during remote learning. Conclusions Year 10 and 12 school students were divided equally in their preferences about returning to partial school. Exploration of their uncertainty by thematic analysis revealed the source to be anxieties around safety. Students feel they are being put at risk and because guidelines will be impossible to enforce in a school environment. Some students recognised a need to return to education despite this perceived risk. An inequity in the standard of education was identified with 15% (n=231) of students reporting that they did not receive any support during the 87 days of lock down. School students expressed desire that their concerns be heard by the Government.

80,Political trust during the Covid-19 pandemic: Rally around the flag or lockdown effects?,"How can we explain the rise in diffuse political support during the Covid-19 pandemic? Recent research has argued that the lockdown measures generated political support. In contrast, I argue that the intensity of the pandemic rallied people around political institutions. Collective angst in the face of exponentially rising Covid-19 cases depresses the usual cognitive evaluations of institutions, and leads citizens to rally around existing intuitions as a lifebuoy. Using a representative Dutch household survey conducted over March 2020, I compare the lockdown effect to the dynamic of the pandemic. I find that the lockdown effect is driven by pre-existing time trends. Accounting for nonlinearities in time makes the lockdown effect disappear. In contrast, more flexible modelling techniques reveal a robust effect of Covid-19 infections on political trust. Moreover, I find that standard determinants of political trust – such as economic evaluations and social trust – lose explanatory power as the pandemic spreads. This speaks to an emotionally driven rally effect that pushes cognitive evaluations to the background.",Dominik Schraff,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4621E-6CD-E2B,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4621E-6CD-E2B,2020-06-08,2020-06-08T18:27:35+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science; corona; political support; netherlands; covid-19; political trust,False
