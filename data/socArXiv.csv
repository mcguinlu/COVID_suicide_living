0,How Families Matter for Health Inequality during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"A version of this article has been published in the Journal of Family Theory and Review, https://doi.org/10.1111/jftr.12398 We theorize that social conditions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic have the potential to increase the importance of families for health and widen existing inequalities. We suggest three primary tenets important for understanding families and health during COVID-19. First, risks of specific COVID-19 outcomes and other health problems are unevenly distributed across families. Second, how families impact health during the COVID-19 pandemic is conditional on public policies, organizational decisions, and concurrent events. Third, many health inequalities driven by racism, sexism, classism, and other oppressive societal force are amplified during COVID-19, but the extent to which this is occurring is shaped by families and by the public policies, organizational decisions, and concurrent events that also impact families and health. As health disparities continue to emerge from this pandemic, we call on researchers and policy-makers to pay attention to the multiple ways that families matter.",Mieke Beth Thomeer et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A9-BDC-8F4,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A9-BDC-8F4,2020-11-26,2020-12-28T17:17:52+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology; health; public policy; families; covid-19; pandemic; health disparities; health inequalities,False
1,Enhancing EFL Students’ Autonomous Learning of English Conversation During COVID-19 Via Language-in-talk Log Assignments,"This one-group pre- and post-test quasi-experimental study endeavored to investigate whether learner autonomy was developed with implementing language-in-talk log assignments as a monitored self-study task in a university English conversation course (890-020 English Conversation). Eighty-eight Thai second-year undergraduate accounting majors at Prince of Songkla University (PSU), Hat Yai, Thailand took part in the study. The participants completed 10 language-in-talk log assignments over 10 weeks. A pre- and post-questionnaire was administered before and after the intervention to examine the effect of the log assignments in developing participants’ learner autonomy. The reflective log was also used to gather participants’ perceptions of using the log assignments in a conversation course. The results showed that the language-in-talk log assignments aided in enhancing the students’ learner autonomy to set learning goals, select appropriate learning materials, take responsibility, and evaluate their learning. Seeking social assistance, however, did not have a significant difference in mean scores, and participants expressed dissatisfaction over not being able to interact with their peers as in classroom learning. The findings further highlighted the significance of teachers’ presence in scaffolding learners to achieve full autonomy. Overall, the results from this research supported the use of the log assignment as a potential pedagogical tool to enable learners to be responsible for their own learning in a language course.",Asian Institute Of Research et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D6-C3D-029,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D6-C3D-029,2020-12-28,2020-12-28T00:41:01+00:00,SocArXiv|Education; online learning; covid-19; autonomous learning; english language teaching; asian efl learners; learning logs,False
2,Análise da evolução do Sars-Cov-2 no Rio Grande do Sul e reflexões acerca do modelo de distanciamento controlado,"RESUMO A pandemia de Covid-19 chegou ao Rio Grande do Sul (RS) evidenciando a necessidade de uma abordagem multidisciplinar e sistemática, buscando respostas emergentes. A falta de uma estratégia nacional de combate ao novo coronavírus exigiu a elaboração de uma alternativa própria por parte do governo local. A opção adotada foi um modelo de distanciamento controlado, considerando a gestão do sistema de saúde, visando garantir a capacidade de atendimento dos enfermos por Covid-19 e demais doenças e propiciar o funcionamento dos setores econômicos. O presente artigo faz um apanhado geral da confirmação de casos de Covid-19 no Rio Grande do Sul, analisa a evolução da doença no período de abril a outubro de 2020 e disserta criticamente acerca do modelo de distanciamento controlado aplicado pelo governo do estado. São feitas reflexões sobre os objetivos de tal modelo, que exprimem uma tentativa de condicionamento das práticas espaciais da população, e sobre a eficiência da instrumentalização do controle social simbolizada por cores que indicam a intensidade de restrições. Palavras-chave: Covid-19; distanciamento controlado; coronavírus; Sars-Cov-2. ABSTRACT The Covid-19 pandemic reached Rio Grande do Sul (RS), highlighting the need for a multidisciplinary and systematic approach, seeking emerging responses. The lack of a national strategy to combat the new coronavirus required the elaboration of an alternative by the local government. The option adopted was a controlled distance model, considering the health system management, aiming at guaranteeing the capacity to attend the sick due to Covid-19 and other diseases, and allowing the functioning of the economic sectors. This article provides an overview of the confirmation of cases of Covid-19 in Rio Grande do Sul, analyzes the evolution of the disease from April to October 2020, and gives a critical commentary on the controlled distance model applied by the state government. Reflections are made on the objectives of such a model, which express an attempt to condition the population’s spatial practices, and on the efficiency of the instrumentalization of social control symbolized by colors indicating the intensity of restrictions.

3,O monitoramento da Covid-19 através de Sistemas de Informação Geográfica: estratégias e desafios para a transparência de dados públicos no Rio Grande do Sul,"From the first cases of Covid-19 in Rio Grande do Sul, in March 2020, we started monitoring the pandemic using an online Geographic Information System (GIS). Within the SIG Litoral Project, from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, we developed the platform as a strategy to provide society with spatial analysis and organized data on the disease, bringing together researchers, scholarship holders and volunteers. The portal, focused on health communication, allows the visualization of data on the global, national and regional scales, in addition to monitoring the indigenous populations of the Amazon and mapping the solidarity networks in the North Coast of Rio Grande do Sul. In the article in question, we mainly focus on monitoring Covid-19 in Rio Grande do Sul, addressing the tools used, the challenges to obtaining data and some spatial analysis performed. We show divergences between data sources, indicating the problem of underreporting and the different methodologies employed by health surveillance systems. Finally, we address the impact of the monitoring of Covid-19, having a positive impact on society by providing transparency to official data, contributing to the plurality of the debate, the interaction of multidisciplinary teams and the academic training of students.",Ricardo Dagnino et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461B0-F5F-BF8,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461B0-F5F-BF8,2020-12-26,2020-12-26T18:21:22+00:00,"SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Health Communication; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics; geographic information system; comunicação de saúde; gis; sistemas de informação geográfica; covid-19; health communication",False
4,The Impact of Introducing Low Traffic Neighbourhoods on Road Traffic Injuries,"We examine the impact on road traffic injuries of introducing low traffic neighbourhoods in Waltham Forest, London. Using Stats19 police data 2012-2019, we find a three-fold decline in number of injuries inside low traffic neighbourhoods after implementation, relative to the rest of Waltham Forest and the rest of Outer London. We further estimate that walking, cycling, and driving all became approximately 3-4 times safer per trip. There was no evidence that injury numbers changed on boundary roads. Our findings suggest that low traffic neighbourhoods reduce injury risks across all modes inside the neighbourhood, without negative impacts at the boundary.",Anthony Laverty et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4603F-A8F-E82,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4603F-A8F-E82,2020-12-18,2020-12-21T22:29:25+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,False
5,STEM undergraduates’ perspectives of instructor and university responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in Spring 2020,"Objectives: We examined undergraduate STEM students’ experiences during Spring 2020 when universities switched to remote instruction due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we sought to understand actions by universities and instructors that students found effective or ineffective, as well as instructor behaviors that conveyed a sense of caring or not caring about their students’ success. Methods: In July 2020 we conducted 16 focus groups with STEM undergraduate students enrolled in US colleges and universities (N=59). Focus groups were stratified by gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Thematic analyses were conducted on the data. Results: Participants (N=59; 51% female) were racially/ethnically diverse (76% race/ethnicity other than non-Hispanic white) and from 32 colleges and universities. The most common effective instructor strategies mentioned included hybrid instruction (35%) and use of multiple tools for learning and student engagement (27%). The most common ineffective strategies mentioned were increasing the course workload or difficulty level (18%) and use of pre-recorded lectures (15%). The most common behaviors cited as making students feel the instructor cared about their success were exhibiting leniency and/or flexibility regarding course policies or assessments (29%) and being responsive and accessible to students (25%). The most common behaviors cited as conveying the instructors did not care included poor communication skills (28%) and increasing the difficulty of the course (15%). University actions students found helpful included flexible policies (41%) and moving key services online (e.g., tutoring, counseling; 24%). Students felt universities should have created policies for faculty and departments to increase consistency (26%) and ensured communication strategies were honest, prompt, and transparent (23%). Conclusions: To be prepared for future emergencies, universities should devise evidence-based policies for remote operations and all instructors should be trained in best practices for remote instruction. Research is needed to identify and ameliorate negative impacts of the pandemic on STEM education.",Sherry L.

6,“My Husband Thinks I’m Crazy”: COVID-19-Related Conflict in Couples with Young Children,"Objective: We examine how disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic are creating conflicts for couples with young children. Background: National polls suggest that COVID-19 has led to increased conflict for couples in the U.S. Although scholars have not examined the source of these new conflicts, pre-pandemic research suggests that pandemic-related disruptions may create conflicts around paid work and parenting, economic security, politics, and health decision-making. Method: This study uses the Pandemic Parenting Study, a mixed-methods study of Southern Indiana mothers, conducted April-May 2020, and involving surveys (N=139), diary entries (N=104), and in-depth interviews (N=65). We examine mothers’ reports of pandemic-related changes in their frustrations with their partners and how those changes vary with the disruptions couples have experienced during the pandemic. We then use qualitative data to understand how pandemic-related disruptions are generating conflicts for couples and what consequences those conflicts have. Results: A substantial minority of mothers (39%) report pandemic-related increases in their frustrations with their partners. These frustrations are particularly common among mothers whose partners are (reportedly) providing insufficient support with pandemic parenting or dismissing mothers’ concerns about COVID-19. Mothers blame themselves for these conflicts and feel responsible for reducing them, including by leaving the workforce, beginning use of antidepressants, or ignoring their own concerns about COVID-19. Conclusion: The pandemic has exacerbated longstanding sources of conflict (related to partners’ insufficient support with parenting) and created new sources of conflict (related to partners’ dismissals of mothers’ concerns about COVID-19), with serious implications for mothers, families, and public health.",Jessica Mccrory Calarco et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46176-680-C96,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46176-680-C96,2020-10-09,2020-12-21T22:23:37+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family; relationships; work-family; family; conflict; health; decision-making; covid-19; parenthood,False
7,“Let’s Not Pretend It’s Fun”: How COVID-19-Related School and Childcare Closures are Damaging Mothers’ Well-Being,"The COVID-19 pandemic closed schools and childcare centers across the U.S., forcing many parents to care for children at home. While parents generally enjoy time with children and want more “family time,” evidence also suggests that substantial, unanticipated increases in parenting time may negatively impact at least some mothers’ well-being. We investigate this possibility using surveys (N=139) and in-depth interviews (N=65) with mothers of young children in Southern Indiana conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic (April-May 2020). We find that mothers who have greatly increased the time they spend caring for their children also disproportionately report increased stress, anxiety, and frustrations with their children. Our qualitative data reveal that disruptions in childcare arrangements, particularly when coupled with intensive work pressures and/or intensive parenting norms, exacerbate the negative impact of increased parenting time on mothers’ well-being. Meanwhile, other mothers are not experiencing increased parenting time as a substantial source of stress, and some are even experiencing increased parenting time as a source of joy in otherwise difficult times. We discuss the implications of these findings for research on parenting and its impact on women’s health and labor force participation, as well as for policies to support families during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.",Jessica Mccrory Calarco et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461CD-ABB-EA6,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461CD-ABB-EA6,2020-10-04,2020-12-21T22:23:36+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family; interviews; family; mixed methods; parenthood; stress; unemployment; qualitative; motherhood; mental health; work-family; time use; childcare; covid-19,False
8,The Perceived Deservingness of COVID-19 Health Care: A Conjoint Experiment on Priority Access to Intensive Care and a Vaccine,"Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, governments, supported by health experts and ethicists, released guidelines about which groups should receive priority access to both (intensive) care and vaccines as resources are limited. To achieve political legitimacy, support from the general public is important, as deservingness theory informs us that not all groups are equally perceived as deserving of assistance. Relying on a probability-based sample representative of the Dutch population (N = 1,601), participants were offered two choice-based conjoint experiments that measured what deservingness criteria matter most in respectively priority access to intensive care, and priority access to a COVID-19 vaccine. The results foremost show that noncompliance with government measures aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus impedes perceived deservingness. By contrast, being employed in the ‘crucial’ sector (i.e. health care and to a lesser extent education), leads to a higher perceived priority. Having an unhealthy BMI leads to less support for priority access to intensive care and vaccines. Age shows mixed patterns: public opinion would give less priority to elderly patients for intensive care. These results indicate that, control and reciprocity over need are important criteria to determine people’s deservingness of COVID-19 health care. We discuss our findings in light of ongoing ethical discussions.",Tim Reeskens et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4623D-4DD-B7C,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4623D-4DD-B7C,2020-11-28,2020-12-21T22:22:01+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology; deservingness theory; vaccine; netherlands; covid-19; conjoint experiment; vignette experiment; icu; liss panel,False
9,Cause for concerns: gender inequality in experiencing the COVID-19 lockdown in Germany,"COVID-19 is having a tremendous impact on gender relations, as care needs have been magnified due to schools and day-care closures. Using topic modeling on over 1,100 open reports from a survey fielded during the first four weeks of the lockdown in Germany, we shed light on how personal experiences of the lockdown differ between women and men. Our results show that, in general, people were most concerned about social contacts and childcare. However, we find clear differences among genders: women worried more about childcare while men were more concerned about paid work and the economy. We argue that the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting women more heavily than men not only at the physical level of work (e.g. women are reducing more paid work hours than men), but also through increasing the division regarding the cognitive level of work (e.g. women are more worried about childcare work while men are about paid work). These developments can potentially contribute to a future widening of the gender wage gap during the recovery process.",Christian S.

10,My home is my castle? The role of living arrangements on experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany,"The restrictions implemented to slow down the spread of COVID-19 are leading to noticeable declines in mental health. However, one’s living arrangement may buffer or catalyze the impact of COVID-19’s restrictions. We argue that restrictions may have a stronger impact for those with higher risk of loneliness and those who need to provide childcare. To test these considerations, we employ quantitative text analysis on open-ended questions from novel survey data of a sample of about 1,100 individuals. We examine how worries and loneliness vary across four different household structures: Living alone, shared living without children, living with a partner and children, and single parents. We find that individuals living alone are most likely to report feelings of loneliness, while single parents are at highest risk of experience care related worries, particularly regarding their financial situation. Those sharing a house, with or without children, had lower risks of experiencing both loneliness or care related worries. Implications for policy and practice are discussed.",Alexander Langenkamp et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4616C-0B8-59D,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4616C-0B8-59D,2020-11-20,2020-12-21T22:19:09+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family; germany; topic models; covid-19; loneliness; children; experience; household; corona; content analysis; partnership,False
11,Can a COVID-19 Vaccine Live up to Americans’ Expectations? A Conjoint Analysis of how Vaccine Characteristics Influence Vaccination Intentions,"Objective: A vaccine for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) could prove critical in establishing herd immunity. While past work has documented the prevalence and correlates of vaccine refusal, I assess how a less explored topic -- properties of vaccines themselves (e.g., national origin, efficacy, risk of side effects) -- might influence vaccination intentions. This information can help public health officials preempt differential vaccine demand, and inform health communication campaigns that encourage vaccine uptake. Rationale: Previous research suggests that Americans should be more likely to intend to vaccinate if presented with a US-made vaccine that carries a low risk of minor side effects, is highly effective, is administered in just one dose, and has spent significant time in development. Methods: I administered a conjoint experiment (N = 5,940 trials) in a demographically representative survey (N = 990) of US adults to assess how variation in vaccine properties influence self-reported public vaccination intentions. Results: I find that respondents prefer vaccines that are US-made, over 90% effective, and carry a less than 1% risk of minor side effects. This is potentially problematic, as some leading vaccine candidates are produced outside the US, and may be less effective and more likely to produce minor side effects than respondents would otherwise prefer. Worryingly, intended vaccine refusal rates exceed 30% for a vaccine meeting these optimal characteristics. Encouragingly, though, Americans show no clear preference for vaccines administered in one dose, or developed in under a year, and do not appear to draw a distinction between weakened viral vs. mRNA-based vaccines. Conclusion: Americans’ preferences for a novel coronavirus vaccine may be at odds with the vaccine that ultimately hits the market, posing both policy and health communication challenges for vaccination uptake.",Matthew Motta,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4616B-B83-F1E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4616B-B83-F1E,2020-08-27,2020-12-21T11:46:49+00:00,"SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Science and Technology Policy; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies",False

We share how we are dealing with COVID-19 discourses that run counter to the scientific foregrounding of our STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) and health and medical sciences training, reflect on the role of the pandemic in shifting post- baccalaureate plans, navigate the lockdown while participating in racial justice protests in Minneapolis, and examine the experiences of being essential healthcare workers while in school.

13,Pseudoscience in the times of crisis: How and why chlorine dioxide consumption became popular in Latin America during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the economic and political landscape of the world (Greer et al., 2020). Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have been particularly vulnerable to the effects of the disease (Breevoort et al., 2020; Dahab et al., 2020; Elhadi, et al., 2020; Loayza and Pennings, 2020). In many regions, including Africa and Latin America, the role of traditional media, as well as social media has been important to disseminate information related to disease containment and treatment (Hopman et al., 2020). Yet, these tools have also been used to spread misinformation and support pseudoscientific ideals masked as “miracle cures” for COVID-19 (Malinverni and Brigagão 2020; Oliveira et al., 2020; Pereira et al., 2020). Chlorine dioxide is a disinfectant commonly used to clean medical equipment and treat residual waters (Smith et al., 2001). At high concentrations and non-physiological pH, it has been shown that treating surfaces with chlorine dioxide effectively inhibits microbial and viral activity (Hauchman et al., 1986; Zoffoli et al., 2005). To date, no controlled studies have been done to evaluate the toxicity of this compound in human subjects. However, exposing rats and nonhuman primates to chlorine dioxide resulted in dose-dependent nonchronic toxicity through thyroid suppression (Abdel-Rahman et al., 1984; Bercz et al., 1982; Harrington et al., 1986; Orme et al., 1985), as well as DNA damage and neurotoxicity in the cerebral cortex (Toth et al, 1990). It is therefore understood that chlorine dioxide is not safe for human consumption. In a self-published book, chlorine dioxide proponent Jim Humble has taunted the use of this compound to treat at variety of diseases, ranging from cancer to HIV, calling it “Miracle Mineral Solution” (MMS) (Humble, 2006). More recently, chlorine dioxide has been suggested to be an inexpensive preventive and treatment for COVID-19 (Burela et al., 2020; Galloso, 2020; Karnik-Henry, 2020; Oliveira et al., 2020). Yet, no scientific evidence has ever been provided to support any of these claims (Burela et al., 2020; Galloso, 2020). On the contrary, several studies have reported a series of concerning symptoms due to MMS intoxication (Bathina et al., 2003; Daniel et al., 2014; Hulshof et al., 2019; Lardieri et al., 2020; Li and Lim, 1993; Loh and Shafi, 2014). These studies highlight the importance of caution in adopting unproven therapies, particularly in regions with weak medical systems. Here I use chlorine dioxide as an example of dissemination of pseudoscience in Latin America in the context of COVID-19. I then describe the adoption and manipulation of chlorine dioxide in Bolivia, where it was used by a political party as a tool to destabilize the constitutional government in view of the 2020 presidential elections.",Mohammed A Mostajo-Radji,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4612A-AB4-C3B,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4612A-AB4-C3B,2020-10-29,2020-12-19T17:08:47+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies; chlorine dioxide; latin american politics; covid-19; bolivia,False
14,Working From Home and the Division of Housework and Childcare Among Dual Earner Couples During the Pandemic in the UK,"This paper examines how working from home influenced the division of childcare and housework among dual earning heterosexual couples with children in the UK during the first wave of the COVID-19 lockdown. We use unique data gathered during the peak of the UK lockdown (May-June), when many employees were required to work from home, to see whether fathers flexible working was associated with a more equitable division of housework and childcare. We found mothers were more likely to be the ones carrying out more if not all of five of the six categories of housework and care we examined – namely, cooking, cleaning, routine and non-routine childcare, and the education of children/home-schooling, both before and during the lockdown. This was not the case for the DIY tasks. A multivariate regression analysis showed that when fathers worked from home or using flexitime during the lockdown, a more equal division was found for tasks such as cleaning, routine childcare, and to some extent home schooling. Furthermore, fathers who worked flexibly were more likely to report that they had increased the amount of time they spent on housework and care. Mothers also reported that fathers who worked from home increased the time they spent on routine childcare. Overall, the study shows how flexible working, including working from home among men, especially done on a mass scale where there are no negative assumptions or stigma behind its use, may lead to a more equitable distribution of housework and childcare. Policy makers should encourage more men to work from home in order to support families and women’s labour market participation during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.",Heejung Chung et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4606A-FE1-C24,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4606A-FE1-C24,2020-12-18,2020-12-18T21:42:03+00:00,"SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class; flexible working; covid-19 pandemic; childcare; work from home; division of housework; fathers; gender",False
15,Six Months In: Pandemic Crime Trends in England and Wales.,"Governments around the world have enforced strict guidelines on social interaction and mobility in an effort to control the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Evidence has begun to emerge which suggests that such dramatic changes in people’s routine activities have yielded similarly dramatic changes in criminal behavior. This study represents the first ‘look back’ on six months of the nationwide lockdown in England and Wales. Using open police-recorded crime trends, we provide a comparison between expected and observed crime rates for fourteen different offence categories between March and August, 2020. We find that most crime types experienced sharp, short-term declines during the first full month of lockdown. This was followed by a gradual resurgence as restrictions were relaxed.

16,"'Two hours extra for working from home': Reporting on gender, space, and time from the Covid-field of Delhi, India","This article explores, through the case study of Prachi, a young woman working for an e- commerce company in Delhi, India, the immediate and potential long-term gendered implications of the Covid-19 pandemic. While one of the more ‘privileged’ workers who did not lose her job during the crisis, Prachi had to suddenly and swiftly adapt to the practice of ‘work-from-home’. As a neophyte service worker with very limited infrastructure for working at home, Prachi experienced deterioration in her physical and mental health. While working long hours to keep her family afloat during this difficult time, she also had to negotiate the compulsion to participate in housework. Her employers’ distrust and increased surveillance has left her feeling vulnerable, particularly as a woman whose work is not given due recognition in the organisation. Prachi’s account highlights that although the practice of work-from-home affords flexibility to workers, it can also result in the exacerbation of inequalities. This article outlines the need for closer examination of the gendered implications of work transitions during the pandemic.",Asiya Islam,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F4-217-F17,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F4-217-F17,2020-12-17,2020-12-17T17:36:02+00:00,"SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender; india; work-from-home; e-commerce; covid19; gender",False
17,Optimistically biased economic growth forecasts and negatively skewed annual variation,"Authoritative economic growth forecasts are often optimistically biased. Negatively skewed variation--negative shocks being larger than positive shocks--might contribute to bias by making long-run average growth smaller than typical-year (median) growth. This positively biases forecasts based on typical years. We compare medians and means in real per-capita GDP growth across countries, regions, and time windows from 1820-2016. Over decadal periods, we find mean growth rates <1%/y smaller than median growth rates in most countries and regions (median 0.23%/y across countries). Surprisingly, we find both large- and medium-magnitude shocks contribute to these differences, rather than only large 'black swan' events. We find negative skewness correlated with high levels and slow growth of per-capita GDP and population, and high per-capita GDP growth volatility, building on previous studies. We find negative skewness insufficient to explain recent growth over-projections by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the U.S. Congressional Budget Office (CBO).",Matthew G.

18,Socioeconomic adversities experienced by creative freelancers in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative study.,"There are concerns that the socioeconomic consequences of COVID-19, including unemployment and financial insecurity, are having adverse effects on the mental wellbeing of the population. One group particularly vulnerable to socioeconomic adversity during this period are those employed freelance within the creative and cultural industries. Many workers in the sector were already subject to income instability, erratic work schedules and a lack of economic security before the pandemic, and it is possible that COVID-19 may exacerbate pre-existing economic precarity. Through interviews with 20 freelancers working within the performing arts, visual arts, and film and television industries, this article explores the impact of the pandemic on their working lives. Findings suggest the pandemic is affecting the psychological wellbeing of freelancers through employment loss, financial instability and work dissonance, and illustrates the need for urgent economic and psychosocial support for those employed within this sector.",Tom May et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46045-8B8-F28,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46045-8B8-F28,2020-12-16,2020-12-16T19:06:02+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health; precarity; covid-19; freelancers; creative and cultural industries; mental health; self-employment; creative careers,False
19,Über was spricht die Politische Theorie? Eine Netzwerkanalyse der Zeitschrift für Politische Theorie (2010-2019),"The article examines the terms and concepts discussed in the first decade of the publication of the Zeitschrift für Politische Theorie (ZPTh). For this purpose, the keywords of all research articles have been collected and edited to conduct a network analysis. The analysis focuses on the reconstruction of the discursive field of political theory. Two central results were identified: First, the keyword network forms an almost completely connected network, which, however, 'frays' at the discursive margins so that sub-discourses emerge. Second, the keywords 'democracy' and 'freedom' are particularly central to the network and form the core of the political theory debate. Nevertheless, discussions on populism and post-structuralist approaches are also found in the network, thus demonstrating the emergence of new concepts and themes. The political theory debate in the ZPTh thus partially exhibits a center-periphery structure and at the same time illustrates a high degree of pluralism in German-based political theory. The article contributes to self-reflection and understanding in the field of political theory and offers first empirical insights into the state of research and publication of German-based political theory.",Stefan Wallaschek,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46044-34F-ED9,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46044-34F-ED9,2020-08-04,2020-12-15T09:15:40+00:00,SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities; SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Scholarly Publishing; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Political Theory; network analysis; keywords; co-occurence analysis; political theory; discursive field; germany,False
20,Active Citizenship and Subjective Well-Being Among Indonesian Millennials,"A society cannot progress without the well-being of its citizens. This study aims to assess the subjective well-being (SWB) of Indonesian millennials, mainly through their active participation in communities. Active citizenship is a form of social interaction with a blend of activism. It is not purely an act of altruism as individuals are assumed to expect gains from their social networks through civic participation. Therefore, social networks are taken into account as determinants that moderates the effect of active citizenship on SWB. Given the heterogeneous nature of the Indonesian society, socio-demographic determinants of gender, education, religiosity, and place of domicile are also expected to moderate the aforementioned relationship. The research is conducted by incorporating 318 (N=318) respondents of the 19 - 35 years old age group, residing in Indonesia. Data is collected by using non-random and convenient sampling. Result from Ordinary Least Square (OLS) Multiple Regression analysis indicate a significant effect in the association between active citizenship and SWB. Furthermore, network density, education, and religiosity also have direct effects on SWB. With regard to the interaction effect, the analysis result indicates more frequent online interactions moderates the effect of active citizenship on SWB, in comparison to the offline interactions. Moreover, gender is another determinant moderating the association. However, both interaction variables are indicated in negative effect sizes. As implication, some of these finding are to give new insights in the current discussion on subjective well-being among Indonesian millenials, whereas other aspects are to be improved in future similar studies.",Deena Soedikto,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4605E-2C2-9E0,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4605E-2C2-9E0,2020-12-13,2020-12-13T15:30:01+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Other Sociology; subjective well being; social capital; millennials; active citizenship,False
21,Using structural equation modeling to model compliance with COVID-19 related non-pharmaceutical interventions amongst university students in the United States,"The world is currently dealing with a devastating pandemic. Although growing COVID-19 case numbers, deaths, and hospitalizations are concerning, this spread is particularly alarming in the United States where polarizing opinions, changing policies, and misinformation abound. In particular, American college campuses have been a venue of rampant transmission, with concerning spillover into surrounding, more vulnerable, communities. We surveyed over 600 college students from across the United States and modeled predictors of compliance with non-pharmaceutical interventions. We identified concern with severity (p < .001), constitutional originalist ideology (p < .001), news exposure (p < .001) and religiosity (p < .05) as significant positive correlates with compliance, and general trust in science (p < .05) as a significant negative correlate. To determine how applicable nationwide modeling might be to individual local campuses we also administered this same survey to nearly 600 students at two large universities in Utah County. In this population, concern with severity was the only significant positive correlate with compliance (p < .001); Additionally, feelings of inconvenience was negatively correlated (p < .001). The effects of feelings of inconvenience, and news exposure were significantly different between populations (p < .001, p < .001). These results suggest that we should focus our efforts on increasing knowledge about the pandemic’s effects on our society and informing about constitutionality amongst college students. However, we also show that nationwide surveys and modeling are informative, but if campuses are to efficiently curb the spread of COVID-19 this coming semester, they would be best served to utilize data collected from their student populations as these might significantly differ from general consensus data.",Spencer Shumway et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46095-899-D0C,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46095-899-D0C,2020-12-10,2020-12-13T00:47:18+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics; non-pharmaceutical interventions; covid-19; compliance; undergraduates,False
22,"COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy, misinformation and conspiracy theories on social media: A content analysis of Twitter data","Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a significant burden of mortality and morbidity. A vaccine will be the most effective global preventive strategy to end the pandemic. Studies have maintained that exposure to negative sentiments related to vaccination on social media increase vaccine hesitancy and refusal. Despite the influence social media has on vaccination behavior, there is a lack of studies exploring the public's exposure to misinformation, conspiracy theories, and concerns on Twitter regarding a potential COVID-19 vaccination. Objective: The study aims to identify the major thematic areas about a potential COVID-19 vaccination based on the contents of Twitter data. Method: We retrieved 1,286,659 publicly available tweets posted within the timeline of July 19, 2020, to August 19, 2020, leveraging the Twint package. Following the extraction, we used Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic modelling and identified 20 topics discussed in the tweets. We selected 4,868 tweets with the highest probability of belonging in the specific cluster and manually labeled as positive, negative, neutral, or irrelevant. The negative tweets were further assigned to a theme and subtheme based on the content Result: The negative tweets were further categorized into 7 major themes: ""safety and effectiveness,” ""misinformation,” ""conspiracy theories,” ""mistrust of scientists and governments,” ""lack of intent to get a COVID-19 vaccine,” ""freedom of choice,"" and ""religious beliefs. Negative tweets predominantly consisted of misleading statements (n=424) that immunization against coronavirus is unnecessary as the survival rate is high. The second most prevalent theme to emerge was tweets constituting safety and effectiveness related concerns (n=276) regarding the side effects of a potential vaccine developed at an unprecedented speed. Conclusion: Our findings suggest a need to formulate a large-scale vaccine communication plan that will address the safety concerns and debunk the misinformation and conspiracy theories spreading across social media platforms, increasing the public's acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccination.",Tasmiah Nuzhath et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619E-FC8-9F9,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619E-FC8-9F9,2020-12-11,2020-12-12T05:32:31+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,False
23,Social Assistance Dynamics among Young Adults in Finland: Duration Dependence and the Role of Parental Recipiency,"The probability of social assistance exit decreasing over time is called negative duration dependence. This is one of the most debated aspects of social assistance receipt. This study analyses duration dependence among young adults in Finland and aims to show how social assistance receipt per se affects the likelihood of exiting social assistance. It also examines whether parental recipiency is associated with duration dependence. While the intergenerational transmission of social assistance has received extensive research attention, there is a scarcity of evidence on whether parental recipiency is associated with social assistance exits and duration effects. This study uses full monthly history of social assistance receipt between ages 19 and 29. The analyses are based on Finnish register data and conducted using discrete-time event-history models (pooled logistic, random-effect logistic and fixed-effect logistic). The findings indicate that controlling for all time-invariant characteristics reduces but does not completely remove duration dependence among young adults. They also show that those whose parents received social assistance are less likely to exit social assistance. In models controlling for all time-invariant characteristics, parental social assistance receipt is also linked with stronger duration dependence. The implications of these findings are discussed.",Invest Flagship et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46242-D52-4ED,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46242-D52-4ED,2020-12-08,2020-12-08T05:47:22+00:00,"SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility; social assistance; young adults; duration dependence; finland; intergenerational transmission",False
24,Functional and Dysfunctional Fear of COVID-19: A Classification Scheme,"Worry about COVID-19 is a central topic of research into the social and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Worry can be a negative and debilitating experience that damages mental health and discourages healthy re-engagement with the world, but it can also be a problem-solving activity, directing people’s attention to problems, and encouraging them to act accordingly. We present in this paper a way of measuring worry about catching COVID-19 that distinguishes between “functional fear” and “dysfunctional fear.” Drawing on work into fear of crime, our classification divides people into three groups: (1) the unworried, (2) the functionally worried (adaptive emotions encourage proactive behaviours to reduce the chance of infection) and (3) the dysfunctionally worried (quality of life is damaged by the emotional experience or taking ineffective or damaging precautions). Analysing data from two waves of a longitudinal panel study of over 1,000 individuals living in ten cities in England, Scotland and Wales, we find differing levels of negative anxiety, anger, loneliness, unhappiness and life satisfaction for each of the three groups, with dysfunctionally worried experiencing the most negative outcomes and functionally worried experiencing less negative outcomes than unworried. We find no difference between groups in compliance and willingness to re-engage in social life. Finally, we compare perceptions of risk (differentiating between likelihood, control and consequence) for each group, and find a difference between the dysfunctionally worried compared with functional and unworried groups. Our findings inform what sort of content-targeted messaging aimed at reducing dysfunctional worry might wish to promote. We conclude with some thoughts on the applicability of our measurement scheme for future research.",Reka Solymosi et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46108-D58-862,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46108-D58-862,2020-08-08,2020-12-07T09:19:19+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; risk; precautions; re-engagement; covid-19; worry; wellbeing,False
25,Emergency Physicians and Personal Narratives Improve the Perceived Effectiveness of COVID-19 Public Health Recommendations on Social Media: A Randomized Experiment,"Background: Containment of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic requires the public to change behavior under social distancing mandates. Social media are important information dissemination platforms that can augment traditional channels communicating public health recommendations. The objective of the study is to assess the effectiveness of COVID-19 public health messaging on Twitter when delivered by emergency physicians and containing personal narratives. Methods: On April 30, 2020, we randomly assigned 2007 U.S. adults to an online survey using a 2x2 factorial design. Participants rated 1 of 4 simulated Twitter posts varied by messenger type (emergency physician vs federal official) and content (personal narrative vs impersonal guidance). Main outcomes were: perceived message effectiveness (35-point scale); perceived attitude effectiveness (15-point scale); likelihood to share Tweets (7-point scale); and writing a letter to their governor to continue COVID-19 restrictions (write letter or none). Results: The physician/personal message had the strongest effect and significantly improved all main messaging outcomes except for letter-writing. Unadjusted mean differences between physician/personal and federal/impersonal were: perceived messaging effectiveness (3.2 [95%CI, 2.4-4.0]); perceived attitude effectiveness (1.3 [95%CI, 0.8-1.7]); likelihood to share (0.4 [95%CI, 0.15-0.7]). For letter-writing, physician/ personal made no significant impact compared to federal/ impersonal (odds ratio 1.14 [95%CI, 0.89-1.46]).

26,Age-Related Differences in Home Experiences and Worries During COVID-19,"The Coronavirus pandemic differentially impacted older adults in comparison to other age groups, creating extended time at home and even limiting interaction with others. In order to understand how individuals are coping with extensive time at home, we used a representative sample of community-dwelling adults to examine how home experiences and personal worries during the COVID-19 pandemic may differ across age groups, including among older adults. Overall, we find fewer older adults experienced home-based stressors (e.g. household conflict, lack of personal space) and fewer worries (e.g. related to finances or boredom) that may arise during a disease outbreak with lockdown measures. Those ages 70+ who were living alone also faced fewer negative home experiences and worries than individuals 60-69 years old living in single-person households.

Many academic institutions were not ready for such a rapid change. The remote learning of foreign languages during the COVID-19 lockdown caused modern teaching technologies to expand the scope of the educational process, broaden its practical orientation, contribute to the intensification of students' independent work, increasing their cognitive activity. The goals of the article include: to define types and specifics of modern edTech for the educational process on the way of transition from no E-Learning to fully E-Learning; to eliminate the role of the Internet as means of information and communication edTech in teaching foreign languages at higher education establishments; to find out the ways of improving students' learning at higher educational establishments, the importance of using distance edTechs and Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, & Challenges (SWOC) analysis of E-learning techniques during the pandemic lockdown.

28,The social support networks of elderly people in Slovenia during the Covid-19 pandemic,"Population ageing requires society to adjust by ensuring additional types of services and assistance for elderly people. These may be provided by either organized services and sources of informal social support. The latter is especially important since a lack of social support is associated with a lower level of psychological and physical well-being. During the Covid-19 pandemic, social support for the elderly has proven to be even more crucial, also due to physical distancing. Therefore, this study aims to identify and describe the various types of personal social support networks of the elderly population during the coronavirus pandemic. To this end, a survey of Slovenians older than 64 years was conducted from April 25 to May 4, 2020 on a probability Web-panel-based sample (n = 605). The ego-networks were clustered by a hierarchical clustering approach for symbolic data. Clustering was performed for different types of social support (socializing, instrumental support, emotional support) and different characteristics of the social support networks (i.e., type of relationship, number of contacts, geographical distance). The results show that most of the elderly population in Slovenia have a satisfactory social support network, while the share of those without any (accessible) source of social support is significant.

29,The Impact of Covid-19 on Trump’s Electoral Demise,"Did the Covid-19 crisis have a significant effect on Trump's electoral demise? We present survey experimental evidence on two substantial effects of the pandemic. First, the unprecedented economic downturn significantly depressed Trump's popular support across all partisan groups, and especially among middle-low and low-income respondents. Second, the poor public health record of the Trump administration reduced its electoral prospects in 25 percentage points among citizens aged between 55 and 70 years old. By contrast, populist attitudes proved to have a negligible effect on the outcome. We conclude that the 2020 election was a normal contest compatible with theories of economic voting and political competence. Our results cast doubts on the role of populism as a major and permanent electoral driver of Trump’s base, and suggest that democratic accountability is a powerful determinant of the fate of political outsiders once in power.",Sergi Pardos-Prado et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460CB-FBD-95F,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460CB-FBD-95F,2020-11-28,2020-11-28T18:55:42+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics; economic voting; covid-19; survey experiment; trump,False
30,"Institutions, Liquidity Preference, and Reserve Asset Holding in the Eurozone Core and Periphery Before and After Crises: Some Stylized Facts","The monetary integration of the Eurozone initially accommodated endogenous money creation across its members; however, liquidity crises that followed the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) revealed structural disparities in liquidity provision in response to funding crises. By refusing to act as a lender of last resort, the European Central Bank pushed governments across the Eurozone to guarantee domestic financial liabilities. The importance of repurchase agreements to fund Eurozone banking and the predominance of European government bonds in general collateral left peripheral governments vulnerable to decreased private demand for their debt, and financially constrained by private intermediaries’ refusal of peripheral sovereign bonds in general collateral. This constraint created accelerated the sovereign debt crises driving the Eurozone crisis. This paper analyzes Eurozone banks’, National Central Banks’, and governments’ balance sheets to show how they have internalized the lessons from the GFC. We find that these entities have returned to holding larger concentrations of reserve assets, a practice that some architects of the Eurozone had hoped monetary integration at the supranational level would end. As Eurozone governments consider how to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic, liquidity crunches that hurt financial and fiscal activity across the Eurozone remain a risk.",Nina Eichacker,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4611A-6BB-276,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4611A-6BB-276,2020-11-24,2020-11-24T06:45:43+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy; post-keynesian economics; eurozone crisis; monetary policy; endogenous money,False
31,Therapeutic alliance: How participation in Covid-19 mutual aid groups affects subjective wellbeing and how political identity moderates these effects,"Mutual aid groups have flourished during the Covid-19 pandemic. However, a major challenge is sustaining such groups, which tend to decline following the initial upsurge immediately after emergencies. The present study investigates one possible motivation for continued participation: the wellbeing benefits associated with psychological membership of groups, as suggested by the ‘social cure’ approach. Interviews were conducted with 11 volunteers in a mutual aid group organised by ACORN, a community union and anti-poverty campaigning organisation. Through qualitative analysis we show that participation provided wellbeing in different ways: positive emotional experiences, increased engagement in life, improved social relationships, and greater sense of control. Participants also reported some negative emotional experiences. Whilst all interviewees experienced benefits from participation, those who viewed their participation through a political lens were able to experience additional benefits such as feelings of empowerment. Moreover, the benefits conferred by a shared political identity appeared to be qualitatively different from the benefits conferred by other forms of shared identity. The interview data is used to hypothesise an overall process by which participants may come to attain a political identity via mutual aid.

34,Aging during COVID-19 in Germany: A Longitudinal Analysis of Psychosocial Adaptation and Attitudes Toward Aging,"Available theories of aging suggest that there may be similarities and differences in how COVID-19 impacts older peoples’ psychosocial adaptation compared to younger age groups, particularly mid-aged individuals. We analyzed data from 3,215 participants between 40 and 79 years gathered at three measurement occasions between the start of the nation-wide lock-down mid-March 2020 and its lifting early August 2020 in an online survey in Germany. The survey focused on everyday experiences during the COVID-19 crisis and collected various satisfaction ratings (e.g., general life satisfaction, satisfaction with family life, satisfaction with social contacts). Participants also provided retrospective satisfaction ratings for their situations before the COVID-19 crisis at baseline. For a small sub-sample of 29 participants (48–78 years), we explored how attitudes toward own aging (ATOA) measured prior to the crisis may have played a role in satisfaction ratings during the crisis. Both mid-aged and older participants experienced the greatest decreases in satisfaction in the social domain, with more pronounced decreases seen in mid-aged participants. We also observed a partial recovery effect in all measures at T3, and this effect was more pronounced in older adults. More negative ATOA prior to the crisis was associated with lowered psychosocial adaptation. Although ageism arose during the pandemic in the sense that older adults were labeled as a “risk group” particularly at the outbreak, we found in accordance with other studies that mid-aged adults’ satisfaction decreased to a greater extent than older adults’. Beginning evidence supports that attitudes toward aging were relevant for adaptation.",Anna Schlomann et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46208-3E3-089,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46208-3E3-089,2020-11-18,2020-11-18T22:43:43+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course; survey study; satisfaction with life; age stereotypes; older adults; coronavirus pandemic; satisfaction with social relations,False
35,The Coronavirus Pandemic and Voter Turnout: Addressing the Impact of Covid-19 on Electoral Participation,"External shocks have been shown to be able to alter countries’ political dynamics in a deep manner. The number of works examining the impact of economic crisis, natural disasters or even terrorist attacks are numerous. However, the literature addressing the political effects of the current Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is still in its infancy. Definitively, the pandemic has constituted an unpredictable external shock not only affecting the health of millions around the planet but also damaging the economic and social stability of most countries. Politically, it has forced electoral authorities in some countries to postpone elections (e.g. Kiribati, North Macedonia, Sri Lanka), to suspend voting rights for those infected with the virus (e.g. Galicia and Basque Country in Spain) or to adapt postal vote regulations (e.g. Bavaria in Germany) in order to guarantee citizens’ voting rights and diminish electoral fraud. Trying to fill a lacuna in the literature, the goal of this article is to give a first and nuanced examination on how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted electoral participation all over the world. To that end we have collected data on all parliamentary, presidential and regional elections held worldwide during the first seven months since the COVID-19 outbreak became recognized as a health emergency of global scope and started to affect the organization of elections (March 1st-September 30th, 2020). Our results show that while voter turnout has not generally declined in comparison with those elections held before the pandemic, electoral participation is lower in polities hit by the pandemic the most, both in terms of infections and – especially - deceases. This seems to point to the fact that when faced with a choice (civic duty vs. personal risk), the fear of becoming infected will constrain voters to opt for the former.",Andrés Santana et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46145-A8B-D21,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46145-A8B-D21,2020-11-18,2020-11-18T22:43:23+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics; coronavirus; external shocks; covid-19; voter turnout; elections,False
36,Masks and face coverings for the lay public: A narrative update,"Whether and when to mandate the wearing of masks or face coverings by the public to prevent the spread of Covid-19 remains controversial. We summarise a large research literature across a range of academic disciplines. There is growing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is airborne, hence may travel long distances and be inhaled. Infection control policies must therefore go beyond contact and droplet measures (such as hand-washing and cleaning surfaces) and attend more carefully to masking and ventilation. Masks work mainly by source control (protecting others) but give some protection to wearers. Even small reductions in individual transmission with ‘imperfect’ masks and face coverings could lead to large effects on population spread. Randomized controlled trials of the preventive effect of population masking in Covid-19 remain sparse and have not addressed source control. Performance varies widely across different kinds of mask; comfort and fit need to be optimized. Masks may cause discomfort and communication difficulties, which affect some groups (e.g. d/Deaf) disproportionately. The harms of mask-wearing were over-estimated in the early months of the pandemic; there is no evidence that risk compensation occurs in people who wear them or that masks account for significant fomite transmission. Masks do not cause clinically significant physiological decompensation in healthy people. Documented medical exemptions to mask-wearing are few. The psychological impacts of masks are culturally shaped; they may include threats to autonomy, social relatedness and competence. Whilst harms of masks are generally outweighed by benefits when COVID-19 is spreading in a population, mandated masking involves a trade-off with personal freedom, so such policies should be pursued only if the threat is severe and benefits cannot be achieved through less intrusive means.",Thomas Czypionka et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46109-AEB-537,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46109-AEB-537,2020-10-20,2020-11-17T18:55:13+00:00,"SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy; covid-19; masks; sars-cov-2; public health; face coverings",False
37,Getting out while staying in: Policy and environmental predictors of park visits during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic,"The spread of COVID-19 altered use of public spaces, such as parks, with potential effects on human health and well-being. Little is known about park use during the pandemic, how local features (e.g, park availability) influence use, and whether park visits accelerate COVID-19 spread. Using weekly panel data for 620 U.S. counties, we show park visits decreased by 10% beginning March 15, and by 17-35% through May 9, 2020. Net of weekly sample trends, park visits decreased by 2.3% when stay-at-home orders were in effect, yet increased by 8.3% after school closures and 4.1% after business closures. Park visits decreased less during the pandemic in metropolitan counties or where park availability was high. Higher park visits were weakly associated with COVID-19 case growth rate but not incidence. Thus, parks may serve as alternatives for recreation when schools and businesses close, especially where parks are available, with no-to-little influence on COVID-19 spread.",David Stuart Curtis et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4604A-5F4-63E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4604A-5F4-63E,2020-07-06,2020-11-15T05:31:34+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning; green space; safegraph; outdoor recreation; parks; google mobility reports; social distancing measures; park access; cell phone data; covid-19,False
38,Collective Anxieties of Canadians During The COVID-19 Pandemic: The Angst-Free and Anxious Population Segments,"The COVID-19 Pandemic in Canada represents a very troubling period as individuals confront a powerful ""invisible"" enemy killer in the form of the COVID-19 virus. This historical juncture is important to analyze because it constitutes a moment where collective anxieties become widespread and collective resources are mobilized to address them. Using market segmentation analysis, the purpose of the study is to produce a portrait of collective anxieties, paying special attention to the typical population segments in the Canadian population differentiated by their particular concerns about health and social conditions in the country and the world. The study used as its data source a survey sample of 4,600 adult Canadians aged 15 years old and over during the confinement period of March 29 2020 to April 3 2020 and collected by Statistics Canada. Attitudinal domain items (12 in total) included concerns about personal and household health, the health system, the ability to cooperate and support during and after the crisis, family stress and others. A market segmentation analysis using Principal Components and k-means cluster analysis of these domain items revealed the presence of six major population segments: Health Conditions Anxious (13%), Health System Overload Anxious (26%), Angst-Free (23%), Inner-Bubble Conditions Anxious (12%), Outer-Bubble Conditions Anxious (25%) and World Conditions Anxious (1%). The segment mottos were as follows: ""Glad I Have A Health Card!"", ""How Many Beds Do We Have?"", ""I'm Not Worried!, ""My Bubble May Be In Trouble!"", ""Other Bubbles May Be In Trouble! and ""It’s the End of the World As We Know It!”. Inner-Bubble Conditions Anxious members displayed the higher average scores of collective anxiety and Angst-Free members, the lowest. Market segmentation is a useful tool for decision makers to categorize population members by their typical attitudinal traits and, by doing so, facilitate better public campaigns, help design messages, and implement changes that can promote more efficient ways to deal with the various psychosocial consequences of the COVID-19 confinement.",Fernando Mata,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461E1-F87-FAB,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461E1-F87-FAB,2020-11-12,2020-11-12T15:17:41+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology; canada; covid-19 pandemic; collective anxieties,False
39,Suppression and Timing: Using COVID-19 Policies against Political Dissidents?,"In this paper, we explore whether government incentives to repress domestic dissidents influences the adoption, timing, and duration of government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. We argue that governments which have historically repressed internal dissent are more likely to adopt policies in response to the pandemic which are observationally equivalent to those that they would use to limit domestic dissent --- in particular policies that restrict citizen's freedom of movement --- compared to countries that have not. Empirically, we find that governments that have recently engaged in state violence against civilians have been more likely to enact lockdown and curfew policies, have done so earlier in the pandemic, and have implemented these policies over a longer time period. Overall, our results have implications for understanding how the repressiveness of state institutions shapes policy responses to a global health crisis.",Joan Barceló et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46181-F40-2F2,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46181-F40-2F2,2020-11-12,2020-11-12T13:04:21+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations; covid-19; state repression; civil liberties; pandemics,False
40,"COVID-19 and the Way Forward: A Story of Livelihoods from Coastal Rural Sundarbans, West Bengal","Globally around 2 billion people (⁓ 61% of the total world population) are engaged in informal sector, whereas the percentage rises to more than 80% in India (ILO, 2018). Since 25th March 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown in India due the COVID-19 pandemic has created an atmosphere of extreme uncertainty and raised several questions. Global analysts have already suggested that, for many developing countries, the economic consequences could be more crippling and devastating than the disease itself. Livelihoods are vital means of making a living. The terminology Livelihood is not synonymous to mere income generation. It encompasses people’s capabilities, assets and activities required to secure the necessities of life. Undoubtedly, globally COVID-19 has become an unprecedented shock; however, any kind of shock tends to reinforce the existing socio-economic-political and environmental stresses, problems and inequalities. Therefore, there is a need to understand how and to what extent this pandemic has affected and going to affect the lives and livelihoods of a coastal rural community entirely dependent on rain-fed agriculture, small-scale fisheries (inland and marine) and other riverine as well as forest resources for their subsistence. This paper attempts to explore the impact of COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown the livelihood choices and daily lives in the coastal rural stretches of Indian Sundarbans delta region. This study incorporates a telephonic rapid assessment survey method to understand the impact of COVID-19; for assessing the minute detailing and pathways of livelihoods, this paper refers to findings from a questionnaire-based household survey of the concerned area carried out by the author herself. The findings support the argument that the shock of COVID-19 will further aggravate the preexisting socioeconomic issues. The long withstanding local problems as well as backwardness and COVID-19 are mutually reinforcing in nature; the social cost and economic cost of this pandemic is immense. Asset loss, changes in dietary pattern and consumption, increased indebtedness, increased dependence on natural resources are some of the major findings.",Sharanya Chattopadhyay,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4624A-D0D-55D,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4624A-D0D-55D,2020-11-12,2020-11-12T01:28:22+00:00,"SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility; covid-19; livelihood diversity; vulnerability; indian sundarbans",False
41,The National Sports and Society Survey Methodological Summary,"The 2018-19 National Sports and Society Survey (NSASS) was designed to be a unique social science data collection effort to enable quantitative research on important but under-researched issues. In particular, its intent was to provide comprehensive empirical evidence of sports involvement patterns and contexts, sports-related public opinions and ideologies, and indicators of well-being, social patterns, and the more general social contexts of adult Americans ages 21-65. Respondents were also asked to report on the sports involvement histories and contexts, family and school experiences, and health and well-being of a child between 6 and 17 years old if they had such a child who also shared a residence with them. A targeted sample of 4,000 adults was established using members of the American Population Panel (APP) so that important subgroup analyses could be undertaken, and to allow for follow-up interviews to be conducted with sufficient numbers in today’s climate of declining survey responses. The NSASS was designed and enacted by Prof. Chris Knoester (PI), with support from the College of Arts and Sciences, the Sports and Society Initiative, and CHRR at The Ohio State University. CHRR worked closely with the PI to design the study, navigate Institutional Review Board protocols, construct and polish the survey instrument, program the online interface, and collect, document and disseminate the data.

42,Political trust during the Covid-19 pandemic: Rally around the flag or lockdown effects?,"How can we explain the rise in diffuse political support during the Covid-19 pandemic? Recent research has argued that the lockdown measures generated political support. In contrast, I argue that the intensity of the pandemic rallied people around political institutions. Collective angst in the face of exponentially rising Covid-19 cases depresses the usual cognitive evaluations of institutions, and leads citizens to rally around existing intuitions as a lifebuoy. Using a representative Dutch household survey conducted over March 2020, I compare the lockdown effect to the dynamic of the pandemic. I find that the lockdown effect is driven by pre-existing time trends. Accounting for nonlinearities in time makes the lockdown effect disappear. In contrast, more flexible modelling techniques reveal a robust effect of Covid-19 infections on political trust. Moreover, I find that standard determinants of political trust – such as economic evaluations and social trust – lose explanatory power as the pandemic spreads. This speaks to an emotionally driven rally effect that pushes cognitive evaluations to the background.",Dominik Schraff,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4621E-6CD-E2B,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4621E-6CD-E2B,2020-06-08,2020-11-11T09:03:57+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science; political support; political trust; covid-19; corona; netherlands,False
43,Palestinian Attitudes Towards Settlers in the West Bank,"We present survey data from 1,573 West Bank Palestinians with which we estimate that the average Palestinian lives 14 km (UI 11 to 18 km) from the closest Israeli settlement. We also show with this data that while Palestinians in general hold negative attitudes towards settlers in the West Bank, Palestinians living in closer proximity to a settlement report more neutral attitudes towards settlers. Multivariate analysis shows that this effect appears to be driven by social and professional contact: Palestinians who have interacted with a settler or worked in a settlement present more positive attitudes towards settlers while distance loses its ability to predict attitudes. Since the onset of the COVID-19 global pandemic, the majority of respondents stated that they have lost either a job or a business from COVID-related restrictions, suggesting that this positive contact effect could dissipate as Palestinians have less reason to interact with Israelis.",Tesea Conte Thornton et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A1-8D8-670,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A1-8D8-670,2020-11-10,2020-11-10T10:39:29+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics; west bank; occupation; contact hypothesis; palestine,False
44,“Over by Christmas”: The impact of war-metaphors and other science-religion narratives on science communication environments during the Covid-19 crisis,"Narratives are crucial for understanding the world, making decisions within it, but may also distort realities, and redirect actions in more damaging directions. This underlines their vital role in public health crisis. Studies of narrative in health crises have negatively assessed the overall impact of warfare rhetoric, judging according to discrepancies between projected and achieved outcomes. Yet the warfare narrative dominated the framing of the Covid-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. Through a historical alignment of Christian, military and national virtues, the warfare narrative provided a guiding framework for collective response to crisis, simultaneously hoping to reassure and ‘bring the Nation together’. The narrative, however, polarised British society, accentuating divisions and exacerbating political tensions coinciding with the pandemic.

45,An analysis of policy decisions to combat SARS-CoV-2 transmission: comparing the available evidence and policies of public face masking to social distancing,"As the COVID-19 pandemic spread throughout the world in early 2020, many country leaders endorsed social distancing policies to reduce transmission. Public face masking policies, however, were only endorsed by a few countries in eastern Asia until recently. Herein, we review the theory and evidence behind public face masking and social distancing. We find a complete absence of adequate randomized trials for social distancing and only a few for public masking, but similar levels of evidence that both interventions could work to reduce the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Given the similar levels of evidence, it is strange that social distancing was promoted in the absence of public face masking policies, particularly so with the detrimental emotional, social, and economic side effects that social distancing entails. In the future, possible interventions to combat pandemic illness should be evaluated against the entire body of evidence rather than upon the absence or presence of adequate randomized trials.",David Larsen et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46182-83F-296,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46182-83F-296,2020-11-10,2020-11-10T00:58:01+00:00,"SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy",False
46,Factors Influencing Countries’ Success Level in Curbing COVID-19: From A Socio-Ecological System (SES) Perspective,"Little attention has been paid to interactions between institutional-human-environment dimensions, which are believed to impact the outcome of COVID-19 abatement. Thus, through the diagnostic SES framework analysis, this paper aims to investigate what and how the multifaceted social, physical, and governance factors affect the success level of 7 selected Asia-Pacific countries (namely South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Indonesia, and New Zealand) in combatting the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing on secondary data from February 2020 to June 2020, the success or severity level of a country was measured by cumulative positive cases, average daily increase, and the mortality rate. A qualitative content analysis, covering code assignation, i.e., Present (P), Partially Present (PP), Absent (A) for each SES attribute, as well as rank ordering (from 1st to 7th) and score calculation (from 3 to 21) for the success level between the countries, was undertaken. Attributes (design principles) of SES factors, such as past experiences facing similar diseases, facilities mobility, lockdown measures, penalty, and standard of procedures in public spaces are deemed significant in determining the abatement outcome or severity of a country. The findings show that Vietnam (1st) and New Zealand (2nd) adopting most of the design principles of governance (with the scores of 15 and above) had successfully eliminated the virus, while Indonesia (7th) and Japan (6th) were deemed least successful (scoring between 3-9), likely due to the low presence frequency of design principles. Not only does the study validate SES framework adaptability in a health-related (non-commons) setting, where some design principles used in resource/commons governance are also relevant in explaining the COVID-19 outcome, the critical attributes of institutional-social-ecological factors are highlighted, ultimately helping policymakers devise more strategic measures to address the crisis",Nur Amiera Md Suhud et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B1-6CB-DFE,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B1-6CB-DFE,2020-11-09,2020-11-09T04:16:22+00:00,"SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration; design principles; institutional-social-ecological system; coronavirus; ses; asia-pacific",False
47,"PERCEPTIONS OF THE ACADEMICS FROM FACULTY OF SCIENCE, PALACKÝ UNIVERSITY OLOMOUC TOWARDS SELECTED ASPECTS RELATED TO THE COURSE OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC AS AN EXAMPLE OF A SUCCOUR FOR THE STRATEGY AND POLICY MAKERS","Background: The impact of the COVID-19 illness all around the world is enormous and as such is a subject of study for not only medicine but also geography, economics, society, psychology and media. Information, data and materials which are the basis for decisions made by policy and strategy makers are acquired from a vast and chaotic mixture of sources. Those are produced based on opinions of experts from diverse fields, results of statistical or clinical studies, official or covert economic interests, political opinions or media pressure and many more inputs. This study presents a concrete example of a possible instrument for correction for the influence of the potentially misleading view in media or society. Methods: Using a questionnaire, this study heuristically quantifies the perceptions of a selected group of Faculty of Science, Palacký University Olomouc employees towards the development of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Czech Republic. We presume that overall they possess more experience with critical analysis and recognizing the relevance of the data than the general population. Results: The respondents assume that based on the data they believe to be relevant COVID-19 is less than or comparably dangerous as seasonal flu (34.1 %) or several times or by an order of magnitude more dangerous (54,1 %); implementing wearing face covering inside is in total for the population rather beneficial (83,8 %), or disadvantageous or without any significance (7,5 %), the daily count of infected is relevant (49,7 %), or irrelevant (42,2 %); the exposure rate in the population is relevant (55,2 %), or irrelevant (34,0 %); the percentage of the Czech population that has already been exposed to the virus is 5% or less (46,5 %), or 6% or more (29,2 %). The respondents view the government measures as relevant and sufficient or insufficient (58,9 %), or relevant but excessive (20,0 %), or irrelevant and excessive or absurd (9,2 %). A significant amount of further data has been derived from the results presented in this study. Conclusion: Certain results of the perceptions quantification reflect the predominant media discourse (such as the question of the benefit of wearing face coverings inside), other seem to differ or contradict the discourse (such as the comparison with seasonal flu or the preference for the exposure data over the daily infected count). As a conclusion, it can be ascertained that when correctly implemented a verified survey of a predefined closed group of respondents can be an applicable instrument for a potential correction for the prevailing public and media paradigm.",Pavel Rušar et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4623A-3A7-6E4,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4623A-3A7-6E4,2020-11-05,2020-11-05T13:10:25+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; survay as a tool in public health; faculty of science upol; covid-19 czech republic,False
48,On the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the intention to leave the parental home,"With the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic all over Europe during the first months of 2020, most of the European governments imposed restrictive measures to people mobility and physical distance (the lockdown), which severely impacted on the economic activities and performance of many countries. Thus, the health emergency turned rapidly into in an economic crisis. The Covid-19 crisis in Europe increased the uncertainty about the economic recovery and the end of the health emergency. This situation is supposed to have conditioned individuals’ life course path with the effect of inducing people to postpone or to abandon many life plans. This paper aims to explore whether the rise of health emergency due to the Covid-19 has delayed or vanished young people intention to leave the parental home during the 2020 in five European countries: Italy, Germany, France, Spain and UK. Using data from an international survey from the “Youth Project”, carried out by the Toniolo Institute of Advanced Studies, this paper implements ordered logistic models in order to investigate the determinants of a possible revision of the choice of leaving the parental home for a representative sample of 6,000 respondents aged 18 to 34, interviewed between March and April 2020. A special focus has been pointed on the Italian case, because of being the first European country to be strongly hit by the pandemic and because of the already economic vulnerable conditions of its young population. Results reports that Italy is the country with the highest rate of downward revisions of the intentions of leaving the nest. In particular, having negative expectations about changes in the individual’s and family’s future income is a key predictor of the choice of abandoning the purpose of leaving the parental home across Europe. However, the vulnerability of the category of temporary workers arises especially in Italy: young people with precarious jobs seems to be the most prone to negatively revise their intentions of leaving, even compared with those not working.",Francesca Luppi et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4617B-F95-F55,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4617B-F95-F55,2020-11-05,2020-11-05T11:55:02+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; coronavirus; covid-19; intentions; sars-cov2; leaving parental home,False
49,"The Fears of Being Infected by the COVID–19 Virus in Canada: A Look At Germophobes, Crowd-Averse, Fearless and Other Population Segments","The fear of being infected by the COVID-19 virus is widespread in the Canadian population. This study examined the COVID-19 virus infection fears in a survey sample of 4,200 adult Canadians aged 15 years old and over during the confinement period of June 21-26, 2020 and collected by Statistics Canada. A marketing segmentation analysis was carried out using a roster of 13 perceived health risks items leading to the identification of typical fears and the profiling of five major segments present in the Canadian adult population: ""Germophobes"" (7%), ""Crowd-Averse"" (34%), ""Fearless"" (17%), ""Outside ""Bubble""-Averse"" (18%), and """"Nursing Homes-Averse"" (24%).

50,COVID–19 and Gaza: a policy recommendation to establish the Gazan Medical Reserve Corps,"This paper serves as a policy recommendation to develop a collaborative public–private interdisciplinary healthcare system known as the Gazan Medical Reserve Corps (Reserves) during the COVID–19 pandemic. Due to the high concentration of educated unemployed in Gaza, the Reserves would draw from recent medical school graduates and unemployed physicians. Although initial funds must be awarded by the government and international community to launch the Reserves, the proposed four evidence–based divisions of the Reserves are designed to make a self-sustaining and financially–sound entity. Our literature review demonstrates that the United Nations, various interest groups, and numerous researchers recommend the work of each of the proposed divisions as necessary aspects of a long–term health sector. The Reserves would work with humanitarian organizations, such as the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and International Medical Corps (IMC), in cooperation with the World Health Organization (WHO). It is a goal to ultimately transition Gaza out of the need for short–term aid and assistance. The Reserves would also work alongside the local health entities and facilities already present in Gaza, such as the medical schools, hospitals, and clinics.",Ponn P Mahayosnand et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4606C-1D7-946,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4606C-1D7-946,2020-11-01,2020-11-01T15:59:23+00:00,"SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy; public health; medical reserve corps; healthcare management; gaza; health reform; covid-19; palestine; health policy",False
51,"From danger to uncertainty: changing healthcare practices, everyday experiences, and temporalities in dealing with COVID-19 policies in the Netherlands","Based on ongoing longitudinal research, this article makes intelligible changing everyday experiences and healthcare practices of dealing with COVID-19 policies in the Netherlands. The article shows changing practices of emotion management regarding health risk constructions which are conceptualized and interpreted as a response to the political and policy context. We found various ways in which parents pragmatically interpret COVID-19 policies to fit their healthcare needs in all households. Our research brings various changes to the fore, which we differentiate conceptually using a novel conceptual model for temporality. During the ten weeks we studied, breaks or disruptions, gradual increases/decreases, cycles, phases, and uncertainties were visible. Negative emotions were initially managed by conforming to the call for solidarity in light of the construction of COVID-19 as a danger. The easing of restrictions provided justification for managing emotions differently and heralded different uncertainties. During this process, the perspective shifted from danger to risk.",Christian Bröer et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46068-590-D11,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46068-590-D11,2020-11-01,2020-11-01T11:17:21+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology; everyday life; covid-19; uncertainty; longitudinal research; emotion managment; risk,False

53,"What happened to drug detections and drug-offences during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic: A comparison of recorded offence rates and dynamic forecasts (ARIMA) in Queensland, Australia","Public commentary has offered mixed opinion on the likely impact of COVID-19 restrictions on drug-related offending. On the one hand, it is argued that drug users—and the drug markets in which they interact—may have become the incidental targets of law enforcement as police seek to enforce social distancing regulations by focusing their efforts on street-level pedestrian activity or open-air gatherings. On the other, interstate border closures and restrictions on person and freight traffic are thought to have interrupted illicit drug supply chains, temporarily reducing or displacing market activity at the street level and thus reducing police detections of drug users. In this study, we extend current analyses of crime during the COVID-19 pandemic to explore how the rate of police detection for drug possession and other drug-related offences has changed. Using Queensland crime data, we use Auto-Regressive and Moving Average (ARIMA) time series modelling techniques to explore historical trends and their dynamic forecasts. We then compare actual offence rates for March through June to identify any statistically significant changes. Importantly, we do not expect the impact of COVID-19 regulations to be universal, mostly because of the significant heterogeneity in local drug market dynamics that has elsewhere been documented. Our analysis has significant import for criminal justice practitioners in further understanding drug market dynamics and drug-related offending during COVID-19 restrictions.",Cameron Thomas Langfield et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4603E-922-43C,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4603E-922-43C,2020-10-29,2020-10-29T02:01:42+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics; sell-supply; queensland; australia; drug-crime; drug possession; covid-19; pandemic; trafficking; arima,False
54,LET'S SPEND THE NIGHT TOGETHER: A Challenge for Medically Optimal Coronavirus Social Distancing Policies,"Public health efforts aiming to slow the COVID-19 epidemic and protect the vulnerable by reducing interpersonal contact and increasing interpersonal physical distance have achieved considerable success. About three-quarters of Americans report following all the recommended practices. But there is an elephant in the room: Overnighting – staying overnight at someone else’s home or having them stay overnight at your place -- is rarely mentioned publicly. But we find that overnighting is widespread throughout the epidemic thus far. In the past month, over half American adults had at least one overnight guest and about the same number (but not always the same people) spent at least one night at somebody else's home. The consequences are striking: People who overnight are more than twice as likely to report having had COVID-19. Who overnights? Overnighting is much more common among young adults (over 60% for those 25-34) than among their seniors (dipping below 40% for those age 65 and over).

55,Exploring the Impact of Mandatory Remote Work during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"During the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of people had to work from home. We examine the ways in which COVID-19 affect organizational communication by analyzing five months of calendar and messaging metadata from a technology company. We found that: (i) cross-level communication increased more than that of same-level, (ii) while within-team messaging increased considerably, meetings stayed the same, (iii) off-hours messaging became much more frequent, and that this effect was stronger for women; (iv) employees respond to non-managers faster than managers; finally, (v) the number of short meetings increased while long meetings decreased. These findings contribute to theories on organizational communication, remote work, management, and flexibility stigma. Besides, this study exemplifies a strategy to measure organizational health using an objective (not self-report based) method.

56,Why Identifying Households by Degree of Food Insecurity Matters for Policymaking,"Experience-based household food insecurity (HFI) indicators can be used to rank households across the continuum of levels of severity of HFI. However, studies have not closely examined if there is value for policymakers to receive information on all or just some of the HFI levels. We examined peer reviewed and gray literature reports to answer this question. Reporting on different HFI levels is key for targeting and evaluating policies and programs. In addition, there are dose-response or curvilinear relationships between HFI levels and diverse physical and mental health outcomes, and early childhood development indicators. The process of introduction of HFI experience-based measures in Latin America improved the understanding of the meaning of different HFI levels among policymakers, media and population at large. Findings strongly suggest that HFI can only be properly understood and addressed by assessing and reporting on all levels of HFI at the local, provincial, national, regional and global levels. Tracking and reporting secular trends of different HFI levels is key during major economic shocks and public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic.",Rafael Pérez-Escamilla et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46099-6F2-13A,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46099-6F2-13A,2020-10-27,2020-10-27T15:13:57+00:00,"SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Food Studies; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy; measurement; household food insecurity; food systems governance; evidence-based decision making; food policy",False
57,"A Gendered Pandemic: Childcare, Homeschooling, and Parents’ Employment During COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically affected employment, particularly for mothers. Many believe that the loss of childcare and homeschooling requirements are key contributors to this trend, but previous work has been unable to test these hypotheses due to data limitations. This study uses novel data from 989 partnered, US parents to empirically examine whether the loss of childcare and new homeschooling demands are associated with employment outcomes early in the pandemic. We also consider whether the division of childcare prior to the pandemic is associated with parents’ employment. For parents with young children, the loss of full-time childcare was associated with an increased risk of unemployment for mothers but not fathers. Yet, father involvement in childcare substantially buffered against negative employment outcomes for mothers of young children. For parents with school-age children, participation in homeschooling was associated with adverse employment outcomes for mothers but not fathers. Overall, this study provides empirical support for the current discourse on gender differences in employment during the pandemic and also highlights the role fathers can play in buffering against reduced labor force participation among mothers.",Richard Petts et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46230-59C-CF3,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46230-59C-CF3,2020-09-12,2020-10-27T15:02:01+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender; childcare; parents' employment; covid19; division of labor; homeschooling,False
58,Effects of Task Repetition on Saudi EFL Learners’ Reading Comprehension,"Recent developments in English language teaching and learning have heightened the need for the use of tasks to foster second language (L2) learning. Central to task-based interaction is the repetition of the same task. Task repetition (TR) stimulates cognitive skills for speech learning and functionality. It has been emphasised in research and practice how task repetition boosts learner processing tools by fortifying form-meaning correlations, facilitating lexicon integration, and providing practical expertise. This study aims to examine the impact of TR on reading comprehension of EFL learners, focusing on individual reading performance and group differences in familiar and recycled tasks. A total of 50 students participated in the current study. The participants were divided into two sample groups (25 male and female respondents). A quantitative research method was utilised in the data analysis. Data management and analyses were performed using IBM SPSS 24.0 (2019). Results indicated that content familiarity and TR significantly impact participants’ reading skill. In addition, this study provides insights into how teachers may utilise TR within L2 lessons to support learners’ language production. The findings observed in this study mirror those of the previous studies which have reported TR as being an effective tool for enhancing reading comprehension. The study concludes by discussing pedagogical implications on the role of TR in L2 learning within EFL contexts.",Arab World English Journal Awej Awej AWEJ et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DC-BD6-F7A,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DC-BD6-F7A,2020-10-09,2020-10-27T14:54:54+00:00,SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities; SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature; second language; reading comprehension; saudi efl learners; task complexity; task repetition,False
59,From Populism to the ‘Plandemic’: Why populists believe in COVID-19 conspiracies,"Why are COVID-19 conspiracy theories so prevalent? Particularly, why would some citizens ignore scientific evidence and common logic but, instead, be convinced that COVID-19 was a military experiment or spread by 5G signals? Why would they believe that Bill Gates had anything to do with it? In this contribution, we argue that populism is at the centre of these beliefs, as the complex nature of the COVID-19 pandemic makes it an ideal playground for populists’ opposition to scientific and political elites. We use Structural Equation Models and panel survey data (n = 823) from the Austrian Corona Panel Project to test this argument. We demonstrate a negative correlation of populist attitudes with both trust in political and scientific institutions, which, in return, negatively relate to COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs. This results in an overall positive relationship of populist attitudes and conspiracy beliefs that is independent of political ideology. These findings have important implications for elite communication regarding virus mitigation.",Jakob-Moritz Eberl et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46015-12F-226,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46015-12F-226,2020-10-04,2020-10-27T14:52:38+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science; conspiracy beliefs; coronavirus; populist attitudes; pandemic; trust; science,False
60,Crime and COVID-19: Effect of changes in routine activities in Mexico City,"**Background.** This study aimed to determine whether crime patterns in Mexico City changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and to test whether any changes observed were associated with the disruption of routine activities. **Method.** The first objective was assessed by comparing the observed incidence of crime after the COVID-19 pandemic was detected in the country with that expected based on ARIMA forecasts based on the pre-pandemic trends. The second objective was assessed by examining the association between crime incidence and the number of passengers on public transport using regressions with ARIMA errors. **Results.** Results indicated that most crime categories decreased significantly after the pandemic was detected in the country or after a national lockdown was instituted. Furthermore, the study found that most of the declines observed were associated with the reductions seen in public transport passenger numbers. However, the declines predicted by the changes in mobility were not always consistent nor as large as those observed. **Conclusion.** The findings contribute to the global evaluation of the effects of COVID-19 on crime and propose a robust method to explictily test whether the changes observed are associated with changes in routine activities.",Patricio Rodrigo Estévez-Soto,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46170-25B-23A,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46170-25B-23A,2020-10-27,2020-10-27T12:11:48+00:00,"SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",False

The pandemic continues while our climate-change response is growing more urgent. Together they place demands on policy in conflict with the ongoing pursuit of human development. So there is a need for quantified tools to assess and compare policies to see how governments have made efforts and policies to balance the demands of the pandemic with ongoing demands of development, inequality and climate.

62,L’enfer c’est les autres? The effects of COVID-19 virus on interpersonal trust,"Does the threat posed by the COVID-19 pandemic affect interpersonal trust? While most evidence shows that natural threats reinforce trust and cooperation, the COVID-19 virus differs from other calamities since it spreads through contact with people, thus potentially increasing mistrust and suspicion towards human beings. We in-vestigate the link between exposure to COVID-19 and trust in strangers by conducting a survey experiment with a representative sample of adults in Italy, one the countries that has been worst affected by the outbreak of the virus. Contrary to intuitive expectations, we find that those who report COVID-19 symptoms and those who live in the municipalities that have been worst affected by the virus trust strangers substantially more than their rela-tive counterparts. In addition, our experimental findings reveal that the risk that the COVID-19 pandemic poses to our health in the future leads to a substantial increase in trust in strangers. The risk that the pandemic poses to our livelihood, in terms of job loss and economic recession, also leads to a smaller increase in trust in strangers, while solidarity appeals and knowledge of people with COVID-19 symptoms within a close circle of relatives, friends and colleagues have no effects on trust. These findings, we suggest, could be explained by adapting the “emancipation theory of trust” to the context of natural disasters, conjecturing that when caught in catastrophes people become more dependent on other people’s support.",Diego Gambetta et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46168-C7F-B17,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46168-C7F-B17,2020-10-20,2020-10-20T16:17:51+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science; natural threats; interpersonal trust; covid19; trust,False
63,COVID-19 Health Precautions: Examining Demographic and Socioeconomic Disparities,"The COVID-19 pandemic has required the adoption of new precautionary health behaviours to reduce the risk of infection. This study examines adherence to four key precautionary behaviours among Canadian adults: wearing face masks, increasing the frequency of hand washing, practicing social distancing, and avoiding large crowds. Data are drawn from the Canadian Perspective Survey Series 3: Resuming Economic and Social Activities During COVID-19, administered by Statistics Canada in June 2020. Weighted descriptives calculate overall adherence levels and logistic regressions models of each behaviour as a function of demographics and socioeconomic status identify vulnerable segments of the population. We find a nearly universal increase in hand washing (94%) and high adherence to social distancing and avoiding crowds (82% and 84% respectively). Adherence to the use of face masks is much lower (67% on average); moreover, there are significant disparities in their use. Women, older adults, immigrants, and urban residents are much more likely to adhere to mask wearing, and other precautionary behaviours, than men, younger adults, Canadian-born, and rural residents. Canadian adults with a university degree are also the most likely to wear face masks and avoid large crowds. The most significant disparities in the use of COVID-19 precautions are found across demographic characteristics.

64,Mental Health and Economic Concerns from March to May during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Canada,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the psychological wellbeing of populations worldwide. In this study, we assess changes in mental health during the early months of the pandemic in Canada and examine its relationship with another prominent problem during this time, economic concerns. Methods Analyses were based on two nationally representative cross-sectional surveys from the Canadian Perspectives Survey Series (N=4,627 in March and 4,600 in May). We described the changes in mental health and economic concerns between March and May, and assessed the relationship between the two characteristics. Results Mental health declined significantly during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic: the proportion of Canadian adults who reported only good/fair/poor mental health grew from 46% to 52% from March to May. Economic concerns including food insecurity were an important correlate of ‘bad’ mental health, as was younger age, female gender, and Canada-born status. Contrary to expectations, however, economic concerns lessened during this time frame. Conclusions These findings suggest that policies to mitigate economic stress, such as Canada’s Emergency Response Benefit, may have eased mental health deterioration in early pandemic months through a reduction in financial hardship. Interventions to increase the economic security of the population will have far-reaching consequences in terms of improved mental health, and should be continued throughout the pandemic.",Anna Zajacova et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46240-EB2-6C5,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46240-EB2-6C5,2020-10-18,2020-10-18T21:23:03+00:00,"SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population; mental health; adults; covid-19; canada; economic",False
65,"The Effects of New York City’s Neighborhood Policing Program on Crime, Misdemeanor Arrests, and Racial Disparities","Objectives: New York City implemented an expansive community policing program, called “neighborhood policing,” between 2015 and 2018. This study examines the initiative and evaluates its effects on crime, arrests, and racial disparities. Methods: We gather monthly data on New York City’s 76 residential police precincts between 2006 and 2019. We then use a novel method to estimate the causal effect of neighborhood policing that couples high-dimensional time series models with machine learning methods. The approach accounts for the policy’s staggered adoption by different precincts at different times and addresses the potential correlation among outcomes across precincts. In the context of all precincts eventually adopting the new policy, our approach controls for all unobserved precinct characteristics and allows for the examination of heterogeneous treatment effects across different communities. Further, the method is empirically validated using realistic simulation studies of the data before the initiation of neighborhood policing to assess the robustness of the approach to untestable assumptions. Findings: We find neighborhood policing did not impact crime. It did reduce misdemeanor arrests and proactive arrests, especially in high-unemployment precincts outside of Manhattan. The policy reduced the racial disparity in proactive arrests in high-unemployment areas and increased it in low-unemployment areas. Conclusions: Though New York’s leaders promoted neighborhood policing as a method to reduce crime, our findings echo other literature showing community policing interventions do not impact crime rates, at least in the short term. City policymakers who want to reduce low-level arrests might pursue community policing, as it decreased such arrests.",Brenden Beck et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4615D-62A-381,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4615D-62A-381,2020-10-09,2020-10-13T17:45:20+00:00,"SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance; simulation validation; heterogeneous treatment effects; community policing; staggered policy adoption; machine learning; misdemeanor arrests",False
66,Does schooling decrease social inequality in early achievement?,"Does schooling affect social inequality in educational achievement? Earlier studies based on seasonal comparisons suggested schooling to equalize social gaps in achievement, but recent replication studies gave rise to skepticism about the validity of older findings. We propose an alternative causal design that identifies schooling exposure effects by exploiting (conditionally) random variation in test dates and birth dates for children participating in assessment studies. We test effects of school exposure in first grade for a series of learning domains (vocabulary, grammar, math, and science) by drawing on recent data from the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS). Findings clearly indicate that schooling increases learning in all domains and particularly in math and science. However, we did not find any evidence that schooling effects differed by children’s socio-economic background. We conclude that, while all children benefitted by first-grade exposure, first-grade schooling had no consequences for social inequality in learning. We discuss the relevance of our approach and results in the context of the massive school lockdowns due to the COVID-19 crisis and to further knowledge on the role of schooling in the process of social stratification.",Giampiero Passaretta et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4604A-FA4-37C,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4604A-FA4-37C,2020-10-12,2020-10-12T16:48:30+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociological Practice and Public Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education; social inequality; schooling; seasonal comparisons; achievement ineqaulity; achievement inequality; covid-19; summer setback,False

68,"Physically distant but socially close? Changes in intergenerational non-physical contacts during the COVID-19 pandemic among older people in France, Italy and Spain","Keeping physical distance is intended to mitigate the spread of the Sars-CoV-2 virus. However, the impact of a decrease in face-to-face interactions on non-physical social contacts of older people remains unclear. In particular, we focus on intergenerational contacts that are particularly relevant for older people’s mental health implications. Our analyses rely on an on-line representative survey conducted in Italy, Spain and France during April 14-24 2020. We considered the sub-sample of individuals aged 50+ (N=4,207).

69,Factors Affecting COVID-19 Testing Decisions: Social and Economic Heterogeneities in a Representative Sample,"Introduction: Willingness to participate in COVID-19 testing and tracing programs has potential to exacerbate health disparities due to systematic variation by social determinants of health. This study evaluates sociodemographic, economic, and psychological factors associated with COVID-19 testing motivations. Methods: We used data from the Person to Person Health Interview Study, collected by telephone in April and May 2020, using a representative sample of Indiana residents (n=943). Testing intentions were assessed across six motivations: treatment affordability, ability to work if positive, hospital effectiveness, symptom severity, proximity to infected, and risk of transmitting to others. Bivariate analyses and ordinal logistic models were used to assess the influence of race/ethnicity, education, financial strain, and COVID-19 worries on each outcome. Results: Respondents strongly agree that symptom severity, proximity to infected, and risk of transmitting to others would be important considerations in COVID-19 test decisions. Black and Latino respondents were more likely than white respondents to agree that ability to work if positive (b = 0.48 and 0.96) and hospital effectiveness (b = 0.92 and 0.96) would influence their decision to get tested. Test affordability (b = 2.80), hospital effectiveness (b = 2.00), and risk of transmission (b = 0.99) were considerations among participants reporting financial strain. Desire to reduce transmission (b = 1.49) and concern about proximity to infected (b = 2.66) were reported among those who expressed COVID-19 worries. Conclusions: In a representative sample in Indiana, people consider their own and others’ vulnerability to COVID-19 in testing decisions. Lower-SES groups and Black and Latino people were more likely to cite resource constraints. Policies expanding financial assistance and prosocial message framing may increase testing rates, particularly among vulnerable subpopulations.",Brea Louise Perry et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46077-4DA-647,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46077-4DA-647,2020-10-09,2020-10-09T18:41:01+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology; testing intentions; socioeconomic status; covid-19; race and ethnicity; disparities,False
70,The Impact of Virtual Classes on Second Language Interaction in the Saudi EFL Context: A Case Study of Saudi Undergraduate Students,"This study was performed to investigate the impact of the virtual classroom on second/foreign language (L2) interaction. A total of 90 Saudi female undergraduate students participated in this study. All participants were enrolled in an English language course in the Preparatory Year Programme (PYP) at a Saudi English Language Centre (ELC), with the English language being taught as a core module in this course. The English language proficiency level of the participants was equal to beginner or low intermediate, which was determined to be the A2 language level of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). A quantitative research method, a questionnaire was developed with 19 statements to test the hypotheses of this study, which sought to determine whether virtual classes had an effective impact on language interaction and L2 learning, and whether participants had a positive attitude towards interaction and learning via virtual classes. The study revealed that there was a good degree of communication and interaction among Saudi students specifically in virtual classes. Also, participants showed a positive attitude towards using online classes for L2 learning. Thus, implementing virtual classes for language learning and teaching is highly recommend not only in this particular Saudi learning environment, but also across other EFL contexts. The study aspired to answer the following research questions:1. How effective are virtual classes for promoting interaction through the English language in the preparatory year in Saudi Arabia? 2. To what extent can Saudi students use virtual classes for learning English?",Arab World English Journal Awej Awej AWEJ et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46212-6B1-3BA,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46212-6B1-3BA,2020-10-09,2020-10-09T18:15:03+00:00,SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities; SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature; virtual classes; interaction; second language; saudi context,False
71,"Epidemics, Inequality and Poverty in Preindustrial and Early Industrial Times","Recent research has explored the distributive consequences of major historical epidemics, and the current crisis triggered by Covid-19 prompts us to look at the past for insights about how pandemics can affect inequalities in income, wealth, and health. The fourteenth-century Black Death, which is usually believed to have led to a significant reduction in economic inequality, has attracted the greatest attention. However, the picture becomes much more complex if other epidemics are considered. This article covers the worst epidemics of preindustrial times, from Justinian’s Plague of 540-41 to the last great European plagues of the seventeenth century, as well as the cholera waves of the nineteenth. It shows how the distributive outcomes of lethal epidemics do not only depend upon mortality rates, but are mediated by a range of factors, chief among them the institutional framework in place at the onset of each crisis. It then explores how past epidemics affected poverty, arguing that highly lethal epidemics could reduce its prevalence through two deeply different mechanisms: redistribution towards the poor, or extermination of the poor. It concludes by recalling the historical connection between the progressive weakening and spacing in time of lethal epidemics and improvements in life expectancy, and by discussing how epidemics affected inequality in health and living standards.

72,COVID-19 and the Future of US Fertility: What Can We Learn from Google?,"We use data from Google Trends to predict the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on future births in the United States. First, we show that periods of above-normal search volume for Google keywords relating to conception and pregnancy in US states are associated with higher numbers of births in the following months. Excess searches for unemployment keywords have the opposite effect. Second, by employing simple statistical learning techniques, we demonstrate that including information on keyword search volumes in prediction models significantly improves forecast accuracy over a number of cross-validation criteria. Third, we use data on Google searches during the COVID-19 pandemic to predict changes in aggregate fertility rates in the United States at the state level through February 2021. Our analysis suggests that between November 2020 and February 2021, monthly US births will drop sharply by approximately 15%. For context, this would be a 50% larger decline than that following the Great Recession of 2008-2009, and similar in magnitude to the declines following the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918-1919 and the Great Depression. Finally, we find heterogeneous effects of the COVID-19 pandemic across different types of mothers. Women with less than a college education, as well as Black or African American women, are predicted to have larger declines in fertility due to COVID-19. This finding is consistent with elevated caseloads of COVID-19 in low-income and minority neighborhoods, as well as with evidence suggesting larger economic impacts of the crisis among such households.",Joshua Wilde et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46186-A32-3DA,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46186-A32-3DA,2020-10-07,2020-10-07T15:14:44+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population; fertility; births; google; covid-19; prediction; statistical learning; machine learning,False
73,Exploring Household Food Security and Malnutrition Risk with Psychosocial Indicators of Healthy Ageing in Place: The Food Train - Eat Well Age Well Partnership Project,"In Scotland, and United Kingdom, there are stark inequalities in the experience of older age, particularly for those with limited social contact, poorer health, located in deprived neighbourhoods (Centre for Ageing Better 2015). This mixed-methodology research, reports survey findings with n=169 community dwelling older adults in Scotland (average age 79.5), supported with qualitative interviews to evidence the underexplored connection between food insecurity and physiological risk indicators of undernutrition (malnutrition), with psychosocial indicators of healthy ageing. Findings are grounded in collaboration with a third sector social enterprise – Food Train, who provide food shopping and volunteer meal making for those aged 65+. Findings revealed correlations between food insecurity and early indicators of malnutrition risk with poorer wellbeing, and social connectedness. Supported food access mitigates the negative cycle of food insecurity on mental health, via empowerment (locus of control) over one’s life. Qualitative findings suggest that risks of food insecurity may not be financial (food poverty), or attributable to health realities associated with ageing. Rather, psychosocial health and wellbeing diverge as older adults attempt to draw upon available resources, reflective of their own social capital. Mitigators of malnutrition risk includes empowerment through social care located in the third sector, as well as social aspects of food access e.g. social eating, warranting future investigation. These findings are considered post Covid-19, with key policy implications.",Kate Reid et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46194-866-997,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46194-866-997,2020-10-01,2020-10-01T00:38:04+00:00,"SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities; SocArXiv|Law; SocArXiv|Law|Human Rights Law; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Food Studies; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Community Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy; malnutrition; social connections; older adult; ageing in place; wellbeing; food insecurity; healthy ageing; third sector; undernutrition; active ageing",False

To understand how COVID-19 has influenced the practices of community-led urban agricultural spaces, we suggest future efforts take into consideration three essential areas of focus: uses of community gardening in combating food insecurity during a pandemic, changes in community garden operations as a response to crises, and community gardening's role in nurturing emotional well-being.",Angie Mejia et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46149-115-FFB,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46149-115-FFB,2020-09-29,2020-09-29T07:17:42+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics|Food Security,False
75,Algorithms in Action: Reassembling Contact Tracing and Risk Assessment during the Covid-19 Pandemic in China,"During the Covid-19 pandemic, technologies such as contact tracing and risk assessment algorithms are widely used. While debates are heated about the optimal algorithm designs with respect to their effectiveness and ethics, little is known about how the algorithms are deployed, experienced, challenged, and reshaped in society. Combining in-depth interviews, media articles, and policy documents, this study examines how Health Code, the Chinese contact tracing and risk assessment algorithm, is assembled, disassembled, and reassembled in society. I argue for a conceptualization of algorithms as sociotechnical assemblages with the involvement of diverse human and non-human actors, which are constantly in action. I first explore the intensive and invisible work and infrastructures that enable Health Code to be enacted. However, these assembly attempts are consistently challenged in differing situations and destabilized Health Code from time to time. Health Code reassembles under the diverse yet unintended engagements of social actors, local networks, and power relations, which creates multiple Health Codes at different periods of time and social localities. I also examine how people game and bypass the algorithm’s surveillance as forms of everyday resistance. These findings go beyond the current technical debates and bring a more dynamic, nuanced, and realistic depicture of algorithms’ operation and power. Lastly, I explore how algorithms contribute to a new dialectical relationship between state and society, and how this relationship reshapes the mechanism of surveillance, inequality, and citizenship in this digital age.",Chuncheng Liu,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46154-1B7-05C,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46154-1B7-05C,2020-09-26,2020-09-26T19:21:43+00:00,"SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities; SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities|East Asian Languages and Societies; SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities|East Asian Languages and Societies|Chinese Studies; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Asia and Asian America; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology; covid-19; algorithms; risk assessment; china; contact tracing; surveillance",False
76,Use of Specialized Questioning Techniques to Detect Decline in Giraffe Meat Consumption,"Biodiversity conservation depends on influencing human behaviors, but when activities are illegal or otherwise sensitive, actors can be hesitant to admit engagement with illicit behaviors. We applied Specialized Questioning Techniques (SQT) to estimate and compare behavioral prevalence of giraffe meat consumption between direct questioning and two SQTs, Randomized Response Technique (RRT) and Unmatched Count Technique (UCT), from 2017 to 2019. Comparisons between the two samples yielded significant differences across all three methods, with confidence intervals distinctly divergent between years. The significant disparity between the two samples for all three methods suggests that there was a true reduction in giraffe meat usage from 2017 to 2019. A key change in the study area between the two time periods was the introduction of a community-based program for giraffe conservation. Primary program activities, including ecological monitoring, community outreach and education, and collaboration with wildlife security teams, align with other conservation programs that have demonstrated reduced poaching pressures. This study demonstrates an application of SQTs to detect a decline of giraffe meat consumption, providing an alternative to self-reported data for monitoring sensitive behaviors related to direct exploitation and illegal uses of wildlife.",Kirstie A.

77,"Nominative technique, a simple tool for assessing illegal wildlife consumption","To test the efficacy of nominative technique within a small sample, we performed a total of 179 semi-structured interviews in Luang Prabang, northern Laos, in August 2017 and April 2019, using the domestic consumption of bears in northern Lao People’s Democratic Republic (hereafter Laos) as our case study. We also assessed whether the specialised questioning technique of nominative technique could be used within qualitative data collection methods, such as semi-structured interviews. The technique theoretically ensures more accurate statements of illegal wildlife consumption behaviour, by maintaining the anonymity of an individual’s sensitive behaviour through asking about the behaviour of peers. We also directly asked about participants’ use of bear bile. Nominative technique showed that approximately 11% of the participants’ peers used bear products, with respondents’ direct admittance of using bear bile was nearly double, at 23%. Use of bear parts appears to not be sensitive in northern Laos. In addition, a strong association was found between nominative technique and direct questioning responses, which indicates that users of bear parts have social networks with higher levels of use. This lends supports to theories that use of wildlife products is directly influenced by the social group. The underreporting found through nominative technique indicates the high variability of response that can occur within small samples; however, these results show that nominative technique may be a simple, useful tool for triangulating data, assessing users’ integration into social networks of use, and assessing changes in behaviour prevalence.",Elizabeth Davis et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46186-04A-867,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46186-04A-867,2020-09-26,2020-09-26T19:08:33+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,False
78,Making Sense of Algorithms: Relational Perception of Contact Tracing and Risk Assessment during COVID-19,"Governments, institutions, and citizens of nearly every nation have been compelled to respond to COVID-19. Many measures have been adopted, including contact tracing and risk assessment, whereby citizen whereabouts are constantly monitored to trace contact with other infectious individuals and isolate contagious parties via algorithmic evaluation of their risk status. This paper investigates how citizens make sense of Health Code (jiankangma), the contact tracing and risk assessment algorithm in China. We probe how people accept or resist the algorithm by examining their ongoing, dynamic, and relational interactions with it over time. By seeking a deeper, iterative understanding of how individuals accept or resist the algorithm, our data unearths three key sites of concern. First, how understandings of algorithmic surveillance shape and are shaped by notions of privacy, including fatalism towards the possibility of true privacy in China and a trade-off narrative between privacy and twin imperatives of public and economic health. Second, how trust in the algorithm is mediated by the perceived competency of the technology, the veracity of input data, and well-publicized failures in both data collection and analysis. Third, how the implementation of Health Code in social life alters beliefs about the algorithm, such as its further role after COVID-19 passes, or contradictory and disorganized enforcement measures upon risk assessment. Chinese citizens make sense of Health Code in a relational fashion, whereby users respond very differently to the same sociotechnical assemblage based upon social and individual factors.",Chuncheng Liu et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F7-EF0-6A9,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F7-EF0-6A9,2020-09-08,2020-09-26T16:16:32+00:00,"SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities; SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities|East Asian Languages and Societies; SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities|East Asian Languages and Societies|Chinese Studies; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Asia and Asian America; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Global and Transnational Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology; privacy; risk assessment; covid-19; algorithm; china; surveillance; contact tracing",False

80,Pride and Protest: Emotional response in the aftermath of the Chilean social outburst,"In recent months, Chile, like many other countries around the world, has undergone a wave of widespread street protests calling for structural changes and challenging the “Chilean miracle.” This study uses an interrupted public opinion poll to assess the effect on the moral sentiments of the general population of the first weeks of the Chilean social crisis that began in October 2019. Our findings suggest that emotions toward the country, official symbols, and economic development were negatively affected by the crisis. Protests signaled that not everything in the country was as thought, generating a moral shock that affected shared emotions about the country. However, at the same time, the specific reciprocal moral sentiments between fellow citizens were positively affected. Hence, the social crisis emerges as an opportunity to strengthen collective ties either by sharing sentiments toward who is responsible for the movement or between Chileans. In the aftermath of October 18, the effect on emotions could explain the massive scale and durability of the social movement.",Francisco Olivos et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461FE-F67-B3E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461FE-F67-B3E,2020-09-21,2020-09-21T04:07:41+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology; public opinion; emotions; pride; chile; social movements,False

82,Class Conflict in Henry Fielding's Joseph Andrews,"The basis of this paper is a research project that studies the struggle between classes in Henry Fielding's novel Joseph Andrews. It has been carried out during the second semester of the academic year 2019-2020 at the College of Science and Humanities, Hotat Bani Tamim, Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University, Al-Kharj, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Since the issue of classes and class struggle dominates almost all aspects of life, it is natural to consider the importance of this phenomenon in literature, especially through theories that view literature as a reflection of real life. The most suitable school of literary criticism to tackle such a subject, according to the authors, is that of Marxism. Two basic Marxist principles are at the center of the study: class conflict and the notion of base and superstructure. The novel is studied as part of the superstructure which is a reflection of the ongoing class conflict occurring at the base mainly between feudal landlords and peasants. Three main questions have been addressed: 1) Is the novel a mere perpetuation of the upper class ideology and interests? 2) Is it a subversion of that ideology? or 3) Does it signify both a perpetuation of a class-structured society while condemning the negative aspects of the dominant ideology? The study reaches the conclusion that while Fielding favors a perpetuation of the already existing social order, he, nevertheless, levels bitter criticism at various upper class beliefs and practices that hinder the advancement of poor class causes.",Awej-Tls For Translation &Amp; Literary Studies et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46044-30F-E7E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46044-30F-E7E,2020-09-12,2020-09-12T16:29:05+00:00,SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities; SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature; class conflict; base and superstructure; joseph andrews; marxist criticism,False

85,Use of Unofficial Newspaper Data for COVID-19 Death Surveillance,"Objective. To highlight the critical importance of unofficially reported newspaper-based deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)–like illness (CLI) together with officially confirmed death counts to support improvements in COVID-19 death surveillance. Methods. Both hospital-based official COVID-19 and unofficial CLI death counts were collected from daily newspapers between March 8 and August 22, 2020. We performed both exploratory and time-series analyses to understand the influence of combining newspaper-based CLI death counts with confirmed hospital death counts on the trends and forecasting of COVID-19 death counts. An autoregressive integrated moving average–based approach was used to forecast the number of weekly death counts for six weeks ahead. Results. Between March 8 and August 22, 2020, 2,156 CLI deaths were recorded based on newspaper reporting for a count that was 55% of the officially confirmed death count (n = 3,907). This shows that newspaper reports tend to cover a significant number of COVID-19 related deaths. Our forecast also indicates an approximate total of 406 CLI expected for the six weeks ahead, which could contribute to a total of 2,413 deaths including 2,007 confirmed deaths expected from August 23 to October 3, 2020. Conclusions. Analyzing existing trends in and forecasting the expected number of newspaper-based CLI deaths indicates yet-unreported COVID-19 death counts, which could be a critical source to estimate provisional COVID-19 death counts and mortality surveillance. Public Health Implications. Considering unofficial newspaper-based CLI death counts is essential to identify COVID-19 death severity and surveillance needs to advance public health research efforts to prepare appropriate response strategies for low- and middle-income countries.",Mazbahul G Ahamad et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4610C-191-2E8,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4610C-191-2E8,2020-09-11,2020-09-11T09:20:02+00:00,"SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities; SocArXiv|Education; SocArXiv|Law; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Policy Design, Analysis, and Evaluation; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics; newspaper-based surveillance; covid-19-like-illness (cli) death; official hospital data; mortality surveillance",False

87,Heard immunity: effective persuasion for a future COVID-19 vaccine,"A survey experiment exposes treatment groups to four messages supporting future vaccination against COVID-19. These treatments emphasize either the risks of the virus or the safety of vaccination, to the respondent personally or to others. For a nationally representative sample, self-reported intent to vaccinate is not significantly different from the control for any message. However, there is a substantial divergence between white non-Hispanic respondents, whose response to all four treatments is close to zero, and non-white or His- panic respondents, whose intention to vaccinate is over 50% higher in response to a message emphasizing prosociality and the safety of others.",Nicolas Duquette,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46152-B35-82F,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46152-B35-82F,2020-09-09,2020-09-09T18:18:44+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Public Economics,False
88,"Changing living arrangements, family dynamics and stress during lockdown: evidence from four birth cohorts in the UK","On 23 March 2020 the UK went into lockdown in an unprecedented step to attempt to limit the spread of coronavirus. Since then, many families have found themselves spending an unprecedented amount of time together, with some facing the additional challenge of adapting to changes in who they are living with as some families have found themselves unexpectedly brought back together. School and university closures, the move to remote working, furlough or the loss of employment have all meant that many adult children who had previously left the parental home have returned. Other individuals have moved to provide care and support for a family member or friend who has been ‘shielding’, and conversely some vulnerable and/or older people have moved in with a younger relative or friend. This paper provides an overview of the changes in living arrangements during the Covid-19 pandemic, drawing upon recently available data from five large scale nationally representative surveys, including the second wave of Understanding Society Covid-19 Study, conducted in May 2020 and the special Covid-19 surveys conducted with the participants of the 1958, 1970, 2000-01 British birth cohorts and Next Steps (born in 1989-90). The paper then goes on to explore the impact of the unexpected changes in living arrangements and mental health, as measured by self-reported stress and interpersonal conflict. Data from the Understanding Society May Covid-19 survey shows that for most of the respondents (95.5%) their living arrangements during the three months since 1st March 2020 had not changed. Just over 2% had changed their address and a further 1.5% reported other people had moved in, whilst under 1% reporting people moving out. However, the likelihood of having changed living arrangements varied significantly by age with one in seven of those aged 20-24 reporting a change in living arrangements. Young people aged 16-29 accounted for over half (57%) of all respondents reporting that they had moved themselves. By contrast, respondents in mid-life (45-59) and early later life (60-74) accounted for the majority of respondents reporting other people had moved in or out. Analysis of the cohort data confirmed this picture with nearly a quarter (24%) of the Millennium Cohort Study, currently aged 19 reporting a change in the people they were living with as a result of covid-19, compared to under one in ten of the 1958 cohort, now aged 62. Logistic regression models were used to assess the odds of reporting increased stress and conflict increase amongst those respondents who had experienced a change in living arrangement change compared to those who had not. The results provide strong evidence that those individuals whose living arrangements have changed as a result of the covoid-19 pandemic have a higher likelihood of reported increased stress and family conflict than those whose living arrangements remained unchanged. This has important implications for public health and wider policy as prolonged periods of stress can lead to serious health problems and policy makers need to be mindful that services may need to flex to take these new, albeit for many temporary, forms of living into account.",Maria Evamdrou et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4614F-108-619,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4614F-108-619,2020-09-09,2020-09-09T18:15:14+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics; family relationships; covid-19; living arrangements; cohort; stress; pandemic,False
89,Face-Saving Strategies Increase Self-Reported Non-Compliance with COVID-19 Preventive Measures: Experimental Evidence from 12 Countries,"Studies of citizens’ compliance with COVID-19 preventive measures routinely rely on survey data. While essential, public health restrictions provide clear signals of what is socially desirable in this context, creating a potential source of response bias in self-reported measures of compliance. In this research, we examine whether the results of a face-saving-strategy that was recently proposed by Daoust et al. (2020) to loosen this constraint are generalizable across twelve countries, and whether the treatment effect varies across subgroups. Our findings show that the face-saving strategy is a very useful tool in every country included, increasing respondents’ proclivity to report non-compliance by 9 to 16 percentage points. This effect holds for different subgroups based on gender, age and education. We conclude that the inclusion of this strategy should be the new standard for survey research that aims to provide crucial data on the current pandemic.",Jean-François Daoust et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46080-BF7-88D,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46080-BF7-88D,2020-09-08,2020-09-08T08:11:28+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics; compliance; survey experiment; expected; public health; pandemic; measurement; covid-19; experimental method; social desirability bias,False
90,Encouraging COVID-19 Vaccine Uptake through Effective Health Communication,"Context: Overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic will require millions of Americans to vaccinate against the virus. Unfortunately, previous research suggests that many Americans plan to refuse a vaccine; thereby jeopardizing collective immunity. We investigate the effectiveness of three different health communication frames hypothesized to increase vaccine intention; emphasizing either (1) personal health risks, (2) economic costs, or (3) collective public health consequences of not vaccinating. Methods: In a large (N = 7,064) and demographically representative survey experiment, we randomly assigned respondents to read pro-vaccine communication materials featuring one of the frames listed above. We also randomly varied the message source (ordinary people vs. medical experts) and availability of information designed the “pre-bunk” concerns about expedited clinical trial safety. Findings: We find that messages emphasizing the personal health risks and collective health consequences of not vaccinating significantly increase Americans’ intentions to vaccinate. These effects are similar in magnitude irrespective of message source, and the inclusion of pre-bunking information. Surprisingly, economic cost frames have no discernible effect on vaccine intention. Conclusions: Health communicators hoping to encourage vaccination may be effective by appealing to the use personal and collective health risks of not vaccinating.",Matthew Motta et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46019-070-223,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46019-070-223,2020-09-08,2020-09-08T08:10:05+00:00,"SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy",False
91,Applications of GIS and Geospatial analyses in COVID-19 research: A systematic review,"Geographic Information Science (GIS) had established itself as a distinct domain and incredibly useful whenever the research is related to geography, space, and other spatio-temporal dimensions. However, the scientific landscape on the integration of GIS in the COVID related studies is largely unknown. In this systematic review, we assessed the current evidence on the implementation of GIS and other geospatial tools and technologies in COVID-19 pandemic. We systematically retrieved and reviewed 79 research articles that either directly used GIS or other Geospatial tools as part of their analysis. We grouped the identified papers under six broader thematic groups based on the objectives and research questions of the study- environmental, socio-economic, and cultural, public health, spatial transmission, computer-aided modeling, and data mining. The interdisciplinary nature of how geographic and spatial analysis was used in COVID-19 research was noticeable among the reviewed papers. Although GIS has substantial potential in planning to slow down the spread, surveillance, contact tracing, and identify the trends and hotspots of breakdowns, it was not employed as much as it could have been. This review not only provided an overarching view on how GIS has been used in COVID-19 research so far but also concluded that this geospatial analysis and technologies could be used in future public health emergencies along with statistical and other socio-economic modeling techniques. Our systematic review also provides how both scientific communities and policymakers could leverage GIS to extract useful information to make an informed decision in the coming days.",Rakibul Ahasan et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4613A-A22-AF5,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4613A-A22-AF5,2020-08-31,2020-09-03T15:21:45+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Physical and Environmental Geography; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies; coronavirus; systematic review; gis; spatial analysis; evidence-based practice; covid-19,False
92,Escaping to nature in pandemic: a natural experiment of COVID-19 in Asian cities,"Cities implemented social distancing measures to cope with COVID-19, which kept people away from nature. A steep drop in the greenspace use was observed in western cities. Surprisingly, news revealed a surging greenspace use in Asian cities. In this study, we used COVID-19 outbreak stages as natural experiments to investigate individual behavioural changes of greenspace use before and during the pandemic. Our case cities are Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo and Seoul. We extracted panel data which consisted of longitudinal posts of 100, 232 users, being posted in 1,185 greenspaces in the four Asian cities. Our statistical models found a 5.3% increase in the odds of people using greenspaces for every 100 additional weekly new cases. The analyses also revealed people’s preference in larger, nature parks that are close to city centres.

93,Human-animal relationships and interactions during the Covid-19 lockdown phase in the UK: investigating links with mental health and loneliness,"Background: The Covid-19 pandemic raises questions about the role that relationships and interactions between humans and animals play in the context of widespread social distancing and isolation measures. We aimed to investigate links between mental health and loneliness, companion animal ownership, the human-animal bond, and human-animal interactions; and to explore animal owners’ perceptions related to the role of their animals during lockdown. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey of UK residents over 18 years of age was conducted between April and June 2020. The questionnaire included validated and bespoke items measuring demographics; exposures and outcomes related to mental health, wellbeing and loneliness; the human-animal bond and human-animal interactions. Results: Of 5,926 participants, 5,323 (89.8%) had at least one companion animal. Most perceived their animals to be a source of considerable support, but concerns were reported related to various practical aspects of providing care during lockdown. Strength of the human-animal bond did not differ significantly between species. Poorer mental health pre-lockdown was associated with a stronger reported human-animal bond (b = -.014, 95% CI [-.023 - -.005], p = .002). Animal ownership compared with non-ownership was associated with smaller decreases in mental health (b = .267, 95% CI [.079 - .455], p = .005) and smaller increases in loneliness (b = -.302, 95% CI [-.461 - -.144], p = .001) since lockdown. Conclusion: The human-animal bond is a construct of potential clinical importance to identify mental health vulnerability in animal owners. Animal ownership appeared to mitigate some of the detrimental psychological effects of lockdown. Further targeted investigation of the role of human-animal relationships and interactions for human health, including testing of the social buffering hypothesis and the development of instruments suited for use across animal species, is required.",Elena Ratschen et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46105-AA9-2F9,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46105-AA9-2F9,2020-08-03,2020-09-01T18:13:51+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; social distancing &amp; human-animal interaction; human-animal bond; covid-19; isolation; mental health,False
94,Sickness-related Absences During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Occupations,"During the pandemic, work is exposing many workers to extensive health risks, with workplace infections a major source of COVID-19 outbreaks. The experience of work is substantially different by occupation, and “essential” occupations consist of disproportionately low-SES and non-White workers. Documenting occupational health disparities during the pandemic is therefore crucial for understanding COVID-19 health inequalities in the United States. This study uses the Current Population Survey microdata combined with occupational data from multiple sources to estimate occupational differences in sickness-related absences from work in March – June 2020 and their contribution to income, educational, and racial/ethnic differences in health inequalities. We find that there has been an unprecedented rise in absences compared to previous years, highly concentrated in transportation, food-related, and personal-care and service occupations. In areas with a major COVID-19 outbreak, these occupations saw rates of absence 6 times higher than all non-healthcare professional occupations. Occupations with the greatest increase in absences are those that are unsuitable for remote work, require workers to work in close proximity to others, pay low wages and rarely provide health insurance. These occupations are, on average, disproportionately non-White, immigrant, low-SES, and have workers in worse than average health. We show that occupation contributes 41% of the total of Black/White differences in absences, 40% of high-low income differences, and 54% of differences between college graduates and those with at most a high school diploma.",Thomas Lyttelton et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46248-697-3BB,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46248-697-3BB,2020-09-01,2020-09-01T09:45:24+00:00,"SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class; inequality; coronavirus; ses; occupations; race and ethnicity; covid-19; job characteristics; workplace; health disparities",False
95,Digital screen time during COVID-19 pandemic: A public health concern,"The use of digital screens, including television, computers, mobile phones, and smart devices, can be associated with a wide range of health outcomes. During the COVID-19 pandemic, different population groups may have been adapted to varying levels of screen time, which may have profound implications on their health and wellbeing. The available evidence suggests that screen time is associated with obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, myopia, depression, sleep disorders, and many other noncommunicable diseases. This elevated burden of diseases is prevalent among individuals who have sedentary lifestyles and other unhealthy behaviors that are likely to increase during quarantine or isolation due to COVID-19. As several empirical studies have reported a rising trend of screen time during this pandemic, it is critical to assess the adverse health outcomes that may appear as its long-term consequences globally. Researchers and practitioners need to revisit the available guidelines and incorporate evidence-based interventions for preventing unhealthy screen time among the affected individuals.

97,"Blood donors in times of crisis: Increased donation willingness, particularly among high-risk individuals","Traditionally, during crises the number of new blood donors increases. However, the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic created additional barriers to donate due to governmental prevention measures and increased personal health risks. In this report, we examined how the pandemic affected new donor registrations in the Netherlands, especially among groups with higher risk profiles for severe COVID-19. Additionally, we explored the role of media for blood donation and new donor registrations. We analyzed new donor registrations and attention for blood donation in newspapers and on social media from January until May 2020, in comparison to the same period in 2019. After the introduction of nationwide prevention measures, several peaks in new donor registrations occurred, which coincided with peaks in media attention. Interestingly, people with a higher risk profile for COVID-19 (e.g. due to age or region of residence) were overrepresented among new registrants. In sum, the current pandemic has led to increased new blood donor registrations, despite the associated increased health risks.

Around 32 crore learners stopped to move schools/colleges and all educational activities halted in India. The outbreak of COVID-19 has taught us that change is inevitable. It has worked as a catalyst for the educational institutions to grow and opt for platforms with technologies, which have not been used before.

100,The pathway from distrusting Western actors to non-compliance with public health guidance during the COVID-19 crisis in Romania,"Global crises provide a fertile environment for the proliferation of disinformation, rumors, and conspiracy narratives. We investigate people's perceptions and beliefs related to COVID-19 in Romania, during the lockdown period (April 2020) and during the state of alert period (July 2020), by fielding two surveys with different modes of collection (CATI and web). Building on measures tested in other countries, we identify the public’s vulnerability to conspiracy narratives and its willingness to comply with public health guidance. Using Structural Equation Modeling, we check if individuals exhibiting pro-Russian or anti-Western attitudes believe more strongly in COVID-19 conspiracy narratives compared to the rest of the population. Then, we check if those believing conspiracy narratives are less susceptible to comply with public health recommendations. We find in both surveys that holding conspiracy beliefs is a mediator between distrusting Western actors and noncompliance with COVID-19 guidelines. Thus, pro-Russian and anti-EU, U.S. and NATO attitudes are linked to stronger conspiracy beliefs, which relate to lower levels of concern and knowledge regarding the virus, which in turn can reduce compliance with guidelines. This suggests that openness to anti-Western narratives may have behavioral consequences. These findings highlight the potential sources of unsafe behaviors during the pandemic and can inform official communication strategies meant to counter both disinformation and non-compliance with public health policies.",Vlad Achimescu et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46009-A81-3C3,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46009-A81-3C3,2020-08-24,2020-08-24T11:49:41+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,False
101,Staging Science: Authoritativeness and Fragility of Models and Measurement in the COVID-19 Crisis,"n the COVID‐19 crisis, society pins its hopes on science to play an authoritative role in reducing uncertainty and ambiguity. But is science up to the task? This is far from self‐evident. The demands on science in times of crisis run counter to the values of good, normal science. Crisis science needs to be fast, univocal, personalized, and direct, while normal science is slow, contentious, collective, and sensitive to complexity. Science can only play its atypical role if it is staged in the public arena. Some patterns of staging stand out: personalization, visualization, and connection to lived experiences. So far, the staging of science has been successful, but it is fragile. The COVID‐19 crisis shows the potential of well‐staged forms of alliance between science and policy, but when the general assumption is that scientists will “solve” societal “problems,” the staging of science has gone too far.",Wouter Van Dooren et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46101-39A-1A8,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46101-39A-1A8,2020-08-21,2020-08-21T21:17:43+00:00,"SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Administration; policy science interface; corona; covid 19",False
102,Gender differences in the impact of the Covid-19 lockdown on unpaid care work and psychological distress in the UK,"School and nursery closures and homeworking during the Covid-19 crisis have resulted in an immediate increase in unpaid care work, particularly for parents. Amongst contemporary couples in the UK, women spent more time than men doing housework, childcare and caring for adults prior to the crisis; thus, lockdown draws new attention to gender inequality in divisions of unpaid care work. This study aims to answer how couples in the UK divided childcare and housework during lockdown and whether this is associated with changes in levels of psychological distress. Data for this study come from the April and May waves of Understanding Society Covid-19 study. Psychological distress was measured using the GHQ score (ranges from 0 to 36). Unpaid care work included men and women’s hours spent on childcare and housework and the impact of increased unpaid care work on employment schedules. We found that every week, women spent 5 more hours on housework and 10 more hours on childcare than men during lockdown, and this increased housework and childcare was associated with higher levels of psychological distress for women. One-third of parents adapted their work patterns because of childcare/ homeschooling. Men and women who adapted their work patterns had on average 1.16 and 1.39 higher GHQ scores than those who did not. This association was much stronger if he or she was the only member in the household who adapted their work patterns, or if she was a lone mother. Only 10% of fathers reduced work hours due to care work compared to 20% of mothers. Fathers had more psychological distress if they reduced work hours but she did not, compared to neither reducing work hours. Our research suggests that lockdown has hit people with young families and lone mothers particularly hard in terms of mental health, and continued gender inequality in divisions of unpaid care work during lockdown may be putting women at a greater risk of psychological distress.",Baowen Xue et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AE-6C7-E11,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AE-6C7-E11,2020-08-21,2020-08-21T13:00:02+00:00,"SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health; covid; domestic work; gender inequality; divisions of unpaid care; mental health; lone mothers",False
103,A mixed-method analysis of Facebook posts on the COVID-19 pandemic.,"The advent of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has renewed the debate about the credibility of health information shared across social network sites, (SNS), such as Facebook. Despite these concerns, empirical studies into the reliability and accuracy of Facebook posts are largely limited. The objective of this study is to judge the accuracy and reliability of COVID-19-related information shared on Facebook using a mixed methodology. The authors extracted Facebook posts (text and embedded video links) in English from Buzzsumo between March 11, 2020, to April 31, 2020, using predetermined keywords. The first 50 posts pertaining to each keyword were extracted and analyzed using a one-way ANOVA, Tukey test for post hoc analysis, and modified DISCERN score. A qualitative content analysis was then conducted to contextualize the data. 196 posts were included in the analysis, with 24,084,564 shares and 3,436,275 comments.

104,Collaboration through Online Discussion Board: A Discourse Analysis of CALL in a Normal University in China,"Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic, all students take courses online in Mainland China at the beginning of the semester. The discourse for communication online is important for a successful course. In this study, the online discussion board assignment of a college graduate course was analyzed for the discourse patterns based on Vygotsky’s Cultural-historical theories that are more pragmatic than linguistics (Wertsch, 1990) and miss communication between students (Forman & McCormick, 1995). The course was taught and communicated in all-English. Participants are first-year graduate students in one Normal University in Northern Jiangsu Province in China. Data were generated based on a discourse analysis qualitative research and analyzed using the histogram and qualitative discourse pattern analysis. Findings for the histogram showed a late assignment submission, while more than half of students submitted during the final three days while having 11 days to finish. Patterns of responding were discussed in ""questions with most responses"" and ""questions with no response."" The open-ended questions allow respondents to utilize knowledge previously acquired as mediation for further discussions, while close-ended questions received a pattern of the contribution of degrading. Questions with no responses were mostly posted during the final two days.

105,A Decade of Stability and Change: Review of U.S. Adolescents' Sexual Behavior and Contraceptive Use 2006-2017,"This study examines changes over time, and demographic differentials, in the prevalence of select sexual behaviors and contraceptive use measures in a national sample of US adolescents. We used data on female and male adolescents aged 15-19 from the 2006-2010 (N=4,662), 2011-2015 (N=4,134), and 2015-2017 (N=1,810) National Survey of Family Growth. Logistic regression was used to identify differences between periods by gender, and for some measures by age, in sexual behaviors (penile-vaginal intercourse (PVI), oral or anal sex with an opposite-sex partner, sexual experience with a same-sex partner), contraceptive use and condom consistency. We estimated probabilities of age at first PVI with Kaplan-Meier failure analysis and tested for changes over time and differences by gender. Over half of all adolescents have engaged in at least one of the sexual behaviors measured. Between 2011-2015 and 2015-2017, males age 15-17 reported significant declines in all but same-sex partners, while the prevalence of sexual behaviors among older males and adolescent females overall remained generally stable. In each period, females were more likely than males to report a same-sex partner. Age of first PVI increased, but by age 17 the difference between time periods is minimal. Adolescent females report increases in the use at last sex of long-acting reversible contraceptive methods (3% to 18%) and multiple methods (27% to 41%). The condom use measures did not change over time. These findings identify components of both stability and change in adolescent sexual and contraceptive behavior in the last decade. Implications This analysis contributes a timely update on trends in adolescent sexual behavior and contraceptive use, showing that adolescents’ behaviors are complex and evolving. Sexual health information and services must be available so that young people have the resources to make healthy and responsible choices for themselves and their partners.",Laura Lindberg et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46022-FA3-83E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46022-FA3-83E,2020-08-20,2020-08-20T06:03:23+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; sexual behavior; national survey of family growth; reproductive health; sexual health; contraception; adolescents,False

As with other causes of deaths, deaths related to COVID-19 are reported by local public health center (Hokenjo), which is located in every prefecture and major metropolitan/large cities. 47 prefectures and some metropolitan cities then collect the information about COVID-19 cases and deaths to report the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare (MHLW). Although MHLW provides a summary statistics about the COVID-19 cases and deaths on their webpage, the distribution broken down by age and sex is not available, that leads many volunteering organizations to collect COVID-19 information based on prefectural/municipality reports. However, even these databases do not provide COVID-19 deaths by age and sex.

107,"Giants On Clay Feet – COVID-19, infection control, and public health laboratory networks in England, the US, and (West-)Germany (1945-2020)","COVID-19 has exposed significant differences in public health systems’ ability to mount effective test and trace responses. This article analyses the historical and structural reasons behind the relative success of Germany and the problems experienced in Britain and the US during the first wave of the pandemic. It also asks why recent international surveys overestimated Anglo-American preparedness. The article argues that the answer lies in the different evolution of public health systems as well as varying public health capacities at the local level. In Germany, post-1994 reforms of the decentralised public health system managed to overcome decades of political neglect and underinvestment and strengthen federal integration without compromising public health capacity at the state and communal level. This joint strengthening of the centre and hinterland allowed the Robert Koch Institute to function as an effective coordinating hub for locally tailored COVID-19 responses. By contrast, the decades after 1970 saw world-renowned Anglo-American public health systems face increasing challenges posed by funding cuts, privatisation, overambitious reforms, and increasing loss of political autonomy. Both the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Public Health England retained significant prestige, which resulted in an overestimation of capacity by international reviews. However, once centres in Atlanta and Colindale had been overwhelmed, there was little local and state public health capacity to fall back on.",Claas Kirchhelle,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4603C-8F9-0F7,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4603C-8F9-0F7,2020-08-19,2020-08-19T11:01:01+00:00,"SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities; SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities|History; SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities|History|History of Science, Technology, and Medicine; covid-19; infection control; robert koch institute; disease surveillance; cdc; phe; public health",False
108,There’s an app for that: technological solutionism as COVID-19 policy in the Global North,"Higher-income countries’ response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been characterised by technological solutionism—the claim that technology on its own can solve problems that are in reality complex and multidimensional. This essay explores the mutual shaping that has occurred between technological solutions and public health policy in the Global North, where governments have allowed capacity to drive policy rather than vice versa. This has led to a situation where contact-tracing and other surveillance technology has become centered in policy, at the expense of the human capacity and material resources that were, and are, necessary to combat the pandemic effectively.

To limit its dissemination, it is essential to know what determines the ability to distinguish between true and false news stories. In our experimental study, we present the subjects corona-related stories taken from the media from various categories (e.g. social isolation, economic consequences, direct health consequences, and “bullshit”). The task is to evaluate the stories as true or false. Besides students with and without healthcare background, we recruit healthcare professionals to increase the external validity of our study. Our main findings are: (i) Healthcare professionals perform similar to students in correctly distinguishing between true and false news stories. (ii) The propensity to engage in analytical thinking and actively open-minded thinking is positively associated with the ability to distinguish between true and false. (iii) We find that the residence of the subjects (East- or West-Germany) plays only a minor role.

110,Disequilibrium and COVID-19: Effectively Applying Crisis Intervention,"Crisis intervention is widely understood as a response to life-threatening emergencies and therefore often limited in its application to natural disasters, severe physical violence, suicidal ideation, and similarly dangerous incidents. While crisis intervention is appropriate for these scenarios, historical definitions of crisis suggest the term and related interventions have much broader application. The ramifications of the novel coronavirus and related cultural fallout increase vulnerability and impair coping capacity in such a way that individuals are significantly more likely to enter crisis states, demanding a prompt reconsideration of the breadth of this practice technique. Successful application of crisis intervention reduces the long-term psychological implications for individuals encountering sudden loss, unexpected traumas, and other hazards that overwhelm traditional coping strategies, outcomes all made more likely by this pandemic. Crisis intervention is a structured, time-limited, problem-oriented treatment modality that is well suited to a remote practice environment because it is directive in its approach and requires few contacts at a time when client access is potentially limited. This paper examines the course of crisis with or without intervention, assessment and intervention tactics, social work values when applying crisis intervention, and the implications of the use of this modality as it relates to COVID-19.",Stephen Oby,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D5-7FB-5A9,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D5-7FB-5A9,2020-08-17,2020-08-17T03:46:01+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work; coronavirus; disequilibrium; covid-19; crisis; coping; crisis intervention,False

Different Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques are widely used across scientific disciplines, including public health since the mid-1960s.

Methods Participants were recruited through online multi-frame non-probability sampling in April and May, 2020. The baseline questionnaire focused on the effects of COVID-19 on daily life and mental health. Monthly follow-ups will be conducted for one year. Findings In total, 6,938 adults participated across all 50 US states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico (mean [SD] age: 67.3 [7.9]; 64% female). Two in three adults reported leaving home only for essential purposes in the past week (population-weighted proportion: 69%; 95% CI: 68%-71%). One-quarter of older adults in work before the pandemic reported reduced work hours or income (25%; 95% CI: 22%-27%). One in three screened positive for depression (32%; 95% CI: 30%-34%) and anxiety (29%; 95% CI: 28%-31%).

COVID-19 data are typically presented cumulatively and by only one demographic characteristic. Understanding and communicating complex demographic trends is imperative to recognize population-level vulnerabilities and inform tailored public health responses. Using the latest COVID-19 Case Surveillance Public Use Data by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), we aim to: a) assess one dimension of reporting quality-- data completeness; and b) examine national time-trends in the age pattern of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths overall as well as by race and ethnicity. Reporting of race and ethnicity in COVID-19 cases has been persistently poor, multiple months into the pandemic.

114,Automation and Labour in India: Policy Implications of Job Polarisation pre and post COVID-19 crisis,"Advancements in ICTs have heightened the potential of such technology to automate jobs and render labour redundant en masse, uniting the concerns of sociologists, policy makers, and economists alike. Realistically, however, concern revolves not around redundancy of labour, but the polarising effect automation exerts on jobs. This polarisation stems from the claim that automation 'hollows out' mid-skill jobs, thereby increasing demand for high- and low- skill jobs. Job polarisation widens wage disparity, lowers the aggregate skill level of labour and exacerbates existing social inequalities. Proponents of laissez-faire automation argue that while automation may exert adverse effects on labour in the short run, it is bound to realise higher net benefits and employment in the long run. Such an understanding which is based on the Schumpterian notion of creative destruction is predicated on the fact that firms would adopt only such technology which bring about substantial strides in productivity. However, world over and in India firms have been merely substituting labour with capital, without any greater efficiency gains. This trend is only set to worsen with the ongoing health crisis due to varied reasons. In such a situation, it becomes imperative to design novel methods of social security.",Abishek Nippani,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619F-85E-E84,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619F-85E-E84,2020-08-11,2020-08-11T07:07:08+00:00,"SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Economic Policy; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Other Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy; jobless recovery; job polarisation; technological unemployment; indian labour market; automation; social security; labour",False
115,The impacts of covid-19 on Indonesian poverty and unemployment,"This study estimates the negative impacts of the COVID-19 on poverty and unemployment in Indonesia. In doing so, this study develops and uses the SD model that reproduced similar patterns in terms of GDP, poverty, and unemployment. Estimated unemployment and estimated poverty under the COVID-19 are calculated for three different economic scenarios: the optimistic, the mid, and the pessimistic scenarios. This study concludes that Indonesia will experience rising unemployment and poverty in ranges (9-10) and (25-26) million people respectively by the end of this year – depending on projected economy growths. This study suggests that existing financial aids are sufficient to support rising unemployment and rising poverty level.

116,The Economic Consequences of R=1: Towards a Workable Behavioural Epidemiological Model of Pandemics,"This paper reviews the literature on incorporating behavioural elements into epidemiological models of pandemics. While modelling behaviour by forward-looking rational agents can provide some insight into the time paths of pandemics, the non-stationary nature of Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) models of viral spread makes characterisation of resulting equilibria difficult. Here I posit a shortcut that can be deployed to allow for a tractable equilibrium model of pandemics with intuitive comparative statics and also a clear prediction that effective reproduction numbers (that is, R) will tend towards 1 in equilibrium. This motivates taking R=1 as an equilibrium starting point for analyses of pandemics with behavioural agents. The implications of this for the analysis of widespread testing, tracing, isolation and mask-use is discussed.",Joshua Samuel Gans,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D7-5AA-5DC,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D7-5AA-5DC,2020-08-08,2020-08-08T18:02:02+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic Theory; covid-19; pandemic; epidemiology,False
117,Lifestyle and Mental Health Disruptions During COVID-19,"COVID-19 has affected daily life in unprecedented ways. Using a longitudinal dataset linking biometric and survey data from several cohorts of young adults before and during the pandemic (N=685), we document large disruptions to physical activity, sleep, time use, and mental health. At the onset of the pandemic, average steps decline from 9,400 to 4,600 steps per day, sleep increases by about 25-30 minutes per night, time spent socializing declines by over half to less than 30 minutes, and screen time more than doubles to over 5 hours per day. The proportion of participants at risk of clinical depression increases to 65%, over twice the rate in the same population prior to the pandemic. Our analyses suggest that disruption to physical activity is a leading risk factor for depression during the pandemic.

118,Maintaining contact with blue-green spaces during the COVID-19 pandemic associated with positive mental health,"There is growing evidence that exposure to the natural world (blue-green spaces) has potential benefits for mental health and well-being. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures adopted to control it provide a natural experiment to investigate the links between nature exposure and mental health under extreme conditions. Using a survey distributed online and based on 6,080 responses, we tested three hypotheses: (1) people will show different levels of symptoms of depression and anxiety depending on the level of lockdown (severity) and ability to maintain contact with outdoor spaces; and (2) where access to outdoor public spaces was restricted, those with access to private outdoor spaces (2a) or even a green-blue nature view (2b) will show fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety and a more positive mood. Lockdown severity significantly affected mental health, while contact with nature helped people to cope with these impacts. The buffering effect of nature was especially relevant for those under strict lockdowns. People perceived that nature helped them to cope with lockdown measures; and emotions were more positive among individuals with accessible outdoor spaces and blue-green elements in their views. These findings can help decision-makers in developing potential future lockdown measures to mitigate the negative impacts, helping people to be more resilient and maintain better mental health.",Sarai Pouso et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46095-496-4DD,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46095-496-4DD,2020-08-04,2020-08-04T08:29:42+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies; depression; green-blue infrastructure; anxiety; ecosystem services; nature’s contributions to people,False
119,The Welfare State and Risk Perceptions: The Novel Coronavirus Pandemic and Public Concern in 70 Countries,"The novel coronavirus pandemic led individuals to experience heightened social risks, particularly financial and health related. The strength of a welfare state shapes individual risk perceptions under normal circumstances. My research question is whether it also shapes risk perceptions in abnormal disaster scenarios, for example amidst the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. I test this using the data from the global COVIDiSTRESS survey to compare 70 countries in April of 2020, a month where deaths resulting from Covid-19 affected three-quarters of the world’s societies. Controlling for local timing and severity of the pandemic, welfare state strength predicts lower risk perceptions. However, this it is not a universal effect as I expected. The welfare state impact depends on how quickly a government introduced strong ‘lock down’ measures. The longer it took a government to respond the more the welfare state reduces risk perceptions. Governments that took lock down measures in advance of the virus show no variation in risk perceptions, whereas governments that took 30 days to respond have up to a 1.5 standard deviation range of risk perceptions depending on the strength of the welfare state. I conclude that the welfare state matters very much when governments fail to take effective intervention measures in a global emergency.",Nate Breznau,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460C0-3E3-6A3,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460C0-3E3-6A3,2020-06-30,2020-08-02T16:16:07+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology; covid-19; sars-cov-2; risk perceptions; novel coronavirus; covidistress; welfare state; pandemic; policy intervention,False
120,Assessing the Impacts of “Infodemic” on Social Well-Being and Health Preparedness of Indian Communities during COVID-19 Pandemic through WhatsApp groups study,"The present study is an attempt to understand the propagation of health-related fake news in India during COVID-19 pandemic in diversely distributed WhatsApp groups comprising uneven groups of members. Ten different WhatsApp groups were selected covering demographic and socio-economic profile and ten most important health-related fake news were studied. Different fake news circulation paths like forward, react, multi-forward, reference etc. were analyzed for different groups. It was observed that older generations (boomers) were more susceptible towards fake news and they tended to distribute the fake news in different groups. Male boomers actively circulate pseudo-science information whereas female boomers distribute faith-based information in the WhatsApp group. It was found that the Gen X as well as Millennials played a role as the first recipients or first responders but primarily most of the forwards were attributed to the Boomers of both genders. Levels of education, social media influence or ignorance, technology access, age, gender and understanding played a major role in the distribution and propagation of fake information during times of COVID. It can be also inferred that easy availability of data and devices, lack of understanding of the game of social media and unscientific baggage of age old beliefs were some factors for over -dependence and reliance on fake news.",Syeda Saadia Azim et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46179-AE9-32B,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46179-AE9-32B,2020-07-31,2020-07-31T20:42:45+00:00,"SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Other Communication; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology; misinformation; fake news; covid-19; whatsapp group",False

The corpus is divided into three sub-groups: citizens, politicians and the media. We first present the corpus collection and the methodology we followed. We also look at the lexical creativity that resulted from the crisis and the lockdown situation.

122,Cultivating Common Good: A Call for Transformative Science to renew the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP),"This paper calls for transformative science to catalyze the needed change in the agricultural sector. It sheds light on the current dysfunctional system of resource allocation of the CAP and its poor economic, ecological and social outcomes. While the disparity between the desired outcomes and the reality is undisputed within research, former reforms have resulted in little change of the CAP. However, there is now a window of opportunity for real change with the transitional phase of the CAP, the shock event of the Coronavirus pandemic as a magnifying glass for underlying systemic problems and the proclamation of the European Green Deal, in particular the Farm-to-Fork-Strategy.

123,Social capital and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic,"COVID-19 pandemic is affecting mental health and wellbeing across populations. The continued burden of psychosocial stressors in different contexts necessitates multipronged interventions that address mental health problems and associated disparities. Global evidence suggests that social capital plays a critical role in determining mental health outcomes in communities, which can be leveraged for improving mental health in COVID-19. As communities with better social capital is likely to have a lower burden of mental disorders, it is necessary to assess potential measures to use social capital for mental health promotion in vulnerable populations. The existing forms of social capital may provide social support within and between communities that are critically affected by COVID-19. Alongside faster recovery from socioeconomic challenges, social capital interventions may strengthen the social determinants of mental health and empower communities to alleviate the psychosocial consequences of this pandemic.",Tahmina Tasnim Rodela et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B6-B45-166,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B6-B45-166,2020-07-28,2020-07-28T07:08:05+00:00,"SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Clinical Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociological Practice and Public Sociology; mental disorders; coronavirus; social capital; mental health; covid-19; psychosocial interventions",False
124,COVID-19 and Government Responses,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the worst pandemic since the Spanish flu, has spread rapidly across the world. This study investigates this pandemic from the perspective of government responses. The analyses are not limited to the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on deaths, but also cover the effect of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths on NPIs using daily cross-national data. This paper also shows the precise timing in which NPIs have a reduced effect on deaths. The results indicate that confirmed cases are more positively correlated with NPIs than deaths, and NPIs show a strong positive correlation with deaths in the short run and a negative correlation in the long run. The turnaround time is about 25 days. This means that NPIs take about one month to reduce the number of deaths.",Susumu Annaka,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4607A-7C1-9E5,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4607A-7C1-9E5,2020-07-23,2020-07-23T13:07:36+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; si; covid-19; npis; government response,False
125,Global City in a Global Pandemic: Assessing the Ongoing Impact of COVID Induced Trends on London’s Economic Sectors,"Over the last 50 years, London has successfully adapted to technological change and globalization, making it the major driver of the UK economy. But its strengths have also made the city particularly vulnerable to the health impacts of COVID-19, and potentially also to wider negative economic implications of the crisis. Many of London’s key sectors rely on proximity, agglomeration economies and externalities. We evaluate the available data on the impact of the pandemic on London to date, with a particular focus on the differential effects between sectors. We also identify seven key trends, affecting both the demand and supply side of the economy, that are likely to have significant medium- to long-term economic impacts, and assess the potential impacts on London’s major industrial sectors. Our findings suggest that COVID-19 may further accentuate the existing divide between globally competitive advanced producer services and more locally focused sectors providing lower-value personal and household services, posing a number of significant policy challenges.",Dylan Anderson et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46168-B36-655,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46168-B36-655,2020-07-22,2020-07-22T14:58:03+00:00,"SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Public Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Urban Studies; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning; covid; services; migration; agglomeration economies; london",False
126,"Intelligent lockdown, intelligent effects? The impact of the Dutch COVID-19 ‘intelligent lockdown’ on gendered work and family dynamics among parents","This study examines the impact of the Dutch ‘intelligent lockdown’ during the COVID-19 pandemic on work and family dynamics among parents. This ‘intelligent lockdown’ relied on a combination of restrictive measures and an emphasis on individual responsibility as a means of lessening the spread and health impact of the pandemic. However, the COVID-19 pandemic is more than a public health crisis. Lockdown measures had substantial societal effects, including a significant impact on parents with (young) children. Given gender inequality existent prior to the pandemic, the question arises to what extent the consequences of the lockdown varied for mothers and fathers. Using representative survey data gathered among Dutch parents in April 2020, we explore changes in three areas: paid work, the division of care and household work, and quality of life (leisure, work-life balance, relationship dynamics). Our linear probability and multinomial logistic models demonstrate that the way in which families were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic reflects a complex gendered reality. We find that gender inequality patterns in the division of paid work, care work, and housework continue to exist. Moreover, the unique situation created by restrictive lockdown measures magnified some inequalities while others were lessened. We find evidence of increased gender inequality in relation to paid work and quality of life, yet a decrease in gender inequality in the division of care and household tasks. During the lockdown, Dutch fathers reported doing more care and household tasks than before. The insights provided here offer key comparative references for understanding the broader impact of lockdown measures on work and family dynamics, as well as quality of life as we move forward in the COVID-19 pandemic.",Mara A.

127,A Pragmatic Analysis of Islam-related Terminologies in Selected Eastern and Western,"The mass media are blamed for constructing a negative image of Islam through the use of Islam-related terms in reporting terrorism. It is presumed that when Islam-related terms are used without regard to their original connotations, they are likely to lose their original meanings and begin to take on altered meanings created by the media. Therefore, this study aims to explore the use of Islam-related terminologies in selected eastern and western mass media outlets in relation to their semantic and linguistic interpretations. The study employed a qualitative approach in which content analysis was used. Using purposive sampling, The Jordan Times and Al-Jazeera were chosen from the eastern Arab world while The BBC and The Guardian were chosen from the western media. total of 368 news articles focusing on Islam and Muslims were collected from the selected news media outlets using internet-based search from March 2018 until October 2019. The findings showed significant differences (P = 0.000/P < 0.05) exist between the selected eastern and western mass media outlets in using Islam-related terminologies. The terms are used more frequently in the western media outlets than in the eastern media outlets. Further analysis of the findings revealed that the selected media outlets use Islam-related terminologies, such as “Islamist” and “Jihadist”, in negative contexts. The use of Islam-related terminologies in the selected media outlets could be influential in making the audience to perceive Islam as a religion of terrorism. The negative use of Islam-related terms could be minimized through training of journalists on news coverage of religion, provision of proper guidelines on religious reporting and ensuring that these guidelines are strictly followed. It was envisaged that this study would be useful to the media outlets, particularly in the process of news gathering, production, and dissemination.",Arab World English Journal Awej Awej AWEJ et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46093-3E4-EBC,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46093-3E4-EBC,2020-07-20,2020-07-20T01:07:51+00:00,SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities; SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature; SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature|Other English Language and Literature; terrorism; online news; media discourse; islam; pragmatic analysis; terminologies,False
128,Apolitical Values & Compliance with Government-Recommended Prosocial Health Behavior,"At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, federal government and local governments across the U.S. recommended that individuals engage in social distancing and other prosocial health behaviors (e.g., wear a mask when out in public). While social scientists know a fair amount about the extent to which people complied with these recommendations, far less is known about why some people may have been more likely to do so. Building on insights from Human Values Theory, we argue that people who are more self-transcendent (i.e., more likely to put others’ needs before their own) should be more likely to engage in a variety of prosocial health behaviors (PSHB); including social distancing. In a nationally representative survey (N = 1,015) conducted at the start of the coronavirus outbreak, we find that people who are highly self-transcendent were significantly more likely to engage in PSHB. Recognizing the limitations of self-reported data, we validate these findings by merging both international and inter-state phone-tracking data into state and country opinion surveys. We find that, on average, people in both countries and states that place a higher emphasis on self-transcendence values were more likely to engage in social distancing at the start of the pandemic.",Matthew Motta et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4609F-D69-3EA,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4609F-D69-3EA,2020-07-17,2020-07-17T15:01:25+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics; social distancing; political science; mask wearing; values; political psychology; public opinion; health behavior; covid19,False

Older adults are highly vulnerable to COVID-19 infection and associated adverse outcomes, whereas they often experience chronic diseases requiring institutional care. Hospital at home (HAH) is a strategic approach that may provide hospital-level care for older adults in their home settings. HAH may potentially minimize the health risks associated with COVID-19, ensure timely care for other health problems, improve health outcomes, reduce costs, increase satisfaction, and make institutional resources available for other patients during this pandemic.

130,"How the ‘plates’ of a health system can shift, change and adjust during economic recessions. A qualitative interview study of public and private health providers in Brazil’s São Paulo and Maranhão states","Background. Economic recessions carry an impact on population health and access to care; less is known on how health systems adapt to the conditions brought by a downturn. This particularly matters now that the COVID-19 epidemic is putting health systems under stress. Brazil is one of the world’s most affected countries, and its health system was already living the aftermath of the 2015 recession. Methods. Between 2018 and 2019 we conducted 46 semi-structured interviews with health practitioners, managers and policy-makers to explore the impact of the 2015 recession on public and private providers in prosperous (São Paulo) and impoverished (Maranhão) states in Brazil. Thematic analysis was employed to identify drivers and consequences of system adaptation and coping strategies. Nvivo software was used to aid data collection and analysis. We followed the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research to provide an account of the findings. Results. We found the concept of ‘health sector crisis’ to be politically charged among healthcare providers in São Paulo and Maranhão. Contrary to expectations, the public sector was reported to have found ways to compensate for diminishing federal funding, having outsourced services and adopted flexible – if insecure – working arrangements. Following a drop in employment and health plans, private health insurance companies streamlined their offer, at times at the expenses of coverage. Low-cost walk-in clinics were hit hard by the recession, but also credited for having moved to cater for higher-income customers in Maranhão. Conclusions. The ‘plates’ of a health system may shift and adjust in unexpected ways in response to recessions, and some of these changes might outlast the crisis. As low-income countries enter post-COVID recessions, it will be important to monitor the adjustments taking place in health systems, to ensure that past gains in access to care and job security are not eroded.",Giuliano Russo et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46046-22F-D5C,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46046-22F-D5C,2020-07-12,2020-07-13T17:39:49+00:00,"SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Industrial Organization; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Economic Policy; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy; health services in lmics; brazil health system; covid-19 and health systems; economic recession and health",False
131,Understanding Violence during Coronavirus lockdown from a Policy Perspective,"India has always been in a conflicting state in itself. The term largest democracy helps to bind an understanding regarding the reason and rise in violence. Different age groups with different mindset living on same land make them vulnerable and intolerable due to their living condition. A slight change in their routine has an effect on their actions. This became an objective to study a rise in the number of violence during coronavirus lockdown. There are multiple factors which trigger different forms of outrage and anger among people forcing them to indulge in an act of violence. Factors triggering violence can be social and cultural norms or can be political norms. These norms help in shaping individual behaviour both negatively and positively. The leading indicators of these norms are income, employment, stress is a result in itself not a factor perse, religious, gender disparity and literacy. The understanding of norms cannot remain error free until seen from the lens of policy implication. It will give a ground reality of its existence. However, there are constant efforts to deal with such atrocities.

132,Blue uncertainty: Warding off systemic risks in the Anthropocene – Lessons from COVID-19,"COVID-19 has made evident that we are ill-prepared to respond to an international health emergency, the complex interdependence of social and ecological systems, and that to reduce the risk of future zoonotic pandemics we must safeguard nature. Approaches based on complexity science taking into account that interdependence and its associated systemic risks must be mainstreamed in current policy making, in general. However, at present, that could result in failure for three main reasons: (1) those approaches might be too sophisticated for current policy making pursuing sustainable development; (2) the reductionist views from conventional economics still deeply influence economic and environmental policy making; (3) it is unlikely that far-reaching policies aimed at stimulating post-pandemic economic development can be steered through radically innovative approaches that remain untested. Here, using COVID-19 as an example, I suggest that the use of innovative complexity-based approaches could be enabled through intermediary approaches equipped to resonate with the mindset pervading current policy making. In particular, I propose to understand the response to unexpected systemic threats as instances of reactive policy making driven by radical uncertainty, and advance three notions that could enhance that understanding: modulating contingency, adaptive inference and blue uncertainty.",Pablo F.

133,Online Learning During Lockdown Period For Covid-19 In India,"Covid-19, as a global pandemic, has called for social distancing. It has made people mandatory to sit indoor and sitting idle indoor may lead to mental stress. Hence to keep people engaged and free from mental stress, online learning can play important role. Online learning is the best solution during this pandemic situation. Teachers can use virtual classrooms to teach from home with all necessary tools which makes the online sessions as effective as traditional ones. Pandemics often compel the learners to stay at home for long period of time and obstruct teaching-learning process. This article emphasizes on how online learning is beneficial during times of crises like work absences or pandemics. Therefore, some tools and techniques for online learning which can ensure the continuity of learning are highlighted.

134,Gender Differences in Telecommuting and Implications for Inequality at Home and Work,"The global pandemic has led to an unprecedented shift to remote work that will likely persist to some degree into the future. Telecommuting’s impact on flexibility and work family conflict is a critical question for researchers and policy-makers. Our study addresses this question with data collected before and during the COVID-19 crisis: the 2003-2018 American Time Use Survey (ATUS, N = 19,179) and the April and May 2020 COVID Impact Survey (N = 784). Comparing mothers and fathers who work exclusively at the workplace, exclusively from home, and part-day from home, we describe differences in time spent on housework, childcare, and leisure; the nature of time worked at home; and the subjective experiences of telecommuting. In addition to a broad descriptive portrait, we take advantage of a quasi-experimental design in the ATUS leave supplements to examine time working at home among those who report ever telecommuting, providing estimates of telecommuting’s effect on other uses of time that better approximate causal relationships than prior studies. We find that gender gaps in housework are larger for telecommuters, and, among telecommuters, larger on telecommuting days. Conversely, telecommuting may shrink the gender gap in childcare, particularly among couples with two full time earners, although childcare more frequently impinges upon mothers’ work time. Survey data collected following the March COVID19 stay-at-home orders show that telecommuting mothers more frequently report feelings of anxiety, loneliness and depression than telecommuting fathers.

135,Natural stings: alternative health services selling distrust about vaccines on YouTube,"In this study, we investigate YouTube’s videos related to vaccines to understand the particularities of the opposition to vaccines in Brazil. The World Health Organization considered vaccine hesitation as one of the greatest threats to global health in 2019. Researchers associated this hesitation to a strengthening of the anti-vaccination movements, suggesting that social media is currently the main spreader of this position. YouTube increasingly becomes a matter of concern, since its recommendation system is identified as a promoter of misinformation and extreme content. Despite YouTube’s statements, misinformation and disinformation (M&D) about vaccines continue to be disseminated in videos in Portuguese, reaching a large audience. We found 52 videos containing M&D about vaccines. The main M&D were the claim of dangerous ingredients in vaccines, the defense of self-direction — freedom of choice, independent research —, the promotion of alternative health services, the myth that vaccines cause diseases, conspiracy theories, and the allegation of vaccine’s severe collateral effects. We identified 39 brands advertising on 13 videos of our M&D sample. Although the YouTube Partner Program is an important source of income, the channels use different economic strategies, such as the selling of courses, and therapies and the use of fundraising platforms. We also found that alternative health channels spread distrust about traditional institutions to promote themselves as trusted sources for the audience and thereby profit with alternative health services.",Dayane Fumiyo Tokojima Machado et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461EF-1A2-964,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461EF-1A2-964,2020-07-01,2020-07-07T18:04:23+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media; disinformation; misinformation; vaccines; alternative health; youtube,False

137,Linking excess mortality to Google mobility data during the COVID-19 pandemic in England and Wales,"Following the outbreak of COVID-19, a number of non-pharmaceutical interventions have been implemented to contain the spread of the pandemic. Despite the recent reduction in the number of infections and deaths in Europe, it is still unclear to which extent these governmental actions have contained the spread of the disease and reduced mortality. In this article, we estimate the effects of reduced human mobility on excess mortality using digital mobility data at the regional level in England and Wales. Specifically, we employ the Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports, which offer an approximation to the changes in mobility due to different social distancing measures. Considering that changes in mobility would require some time before having an effect on mortality, we analyse the relationship between excess mortality and lagged indicators of human mobility. We find a negative association between excess mortality and time spent at home, as well as a positive association with changes in outdoor mobility, after controlling for the time trend of the pandemic and regional differences. We estimate that almost 130,000 excess deaths have been averted as a result of the increased time spent at home.

138,"Indirect consequences of COVID-19 on people’s lives. Findings from an on-line survey in France, Italy and Spain","The COVID-19 pandemic has limited individuals’ possibility to meet and socialize with others due to the state of emergency restrictions to movements, events and relations imposed in different countries. Most shops and restaurants have been closed and some economic activities have been seriously damaged. This significant disruption may have contributed to a deterioration of people’s mental health on top of other negative consequences of the pandemic. To better understand the indirect consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak on people’s lives we have designed the intergen-COVID online survey (https://sites.google.com/unifi.it/intergen-covid), carried out in France, Italy and Spain between the 14th to the 24th of April 2020. Quota sampling on the population 18-plus and post-stratification weights were used to achieve the alignment between the sample (N = 9,056) and the total population on important socio-demographic characteristics. We collected information on four key domains of individuals’ lives: intergenerational (and other type of) relationships (physical and non-physical; means of communication; frequency, etc.); living arrangements; mental health; events experienced during the lockdown (e.g., income loss, death of relative/friend due to COVID-19, worsened partner relationships, time spent with family); intentions for the future 3 years (e.g., fertility, living parental home, marriage, cohabitation, divorce/separation, retirement). In this paper we provide the main results from this survey, focusing on the first three domains abovementioned. The fourth domain consists of questions applicable to different sub-groups of the population and will be analyzed in separate papers. We show that, despite the general reduction of physical contacts, with low educated people reporting a lower reduction in all kinds of physical contacts, non-physical contacts have significantly increased, especially among women. About 50% of respondents felt sad or depressed more often than usual during the lockdown, but mental health deterioration was found to be heterogeneous and vary with respondents’ age, gender and country. Job and income loss, and worsening of relationships quality were other negative consequences often experienced during the lockdown, especially by younger individuals.

139,Learning to love cosmopolitanism? Testing the socialisation effect of educational field of study on cosmopolitan attitudes in the Netherlands,"Across Europe, those with higher education are consistently found to be more pro-cosmopolitan than those with less education. However, it remains an open question what aspects of education drive this relationship. One influential mechanism through which education is argued to affect cosmopolitan attitudes is by instilling tolerance inducing values and beliefs that continue to influence the thinking of students long after they have left the education system. Using the Dutch LISS panel between 2008 and 2019, we explore differences in the emphasis on tolerant values and beliefs across fields of study to assess the explanatory power of the socialisation model of education for cosmopolitan attitudes. By estimating between- and within subject panel regressions, we find that although there are cross-sectional differences between fields of study in cosmopolitan attitudes, these differences cannot conclusively be attributed to the socialisation influence of the specific field. Consequently, our results challenge the importance of the socialisation model to understand the current educational divide in cosmopolitanism.",Sander Kunst,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461CE-1D9-260,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461CE-1D9-260,2020-07-07,2020-07-07T13:04:23+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; liss panel; field of study; education; cosmopolitanism,False
140,Migration discourse in Sweden: frames and sentiments in mainstream and social media,"This study makes a systematic analysis of media discourse on migration in Sweden in 2012-2019. Using a novel dataset consisting of mainstream newspapers, Twitter and forum data, the article answers two questions: what do Swedish media actually talk about when they talk about “migration”? And how do they talk about it? Using a combination of computational text analysis tools, I analyse a shift in the media discourse as one of the outcomes of the so-called “European refugee crisis” in 2015 and try to comprehend the role of social media in this process. The results of the study provide some evidence for a populist and hostile character of the migration framing and indicate that the messages on social media, generally, had negative tonality. At the same time, the analysis of framing and sentiment dynamics suggests that a statement about the discourse shift in the Swedish media during the “European refugee crisis” is to some extent over-estimated. Rather, one can suggest that the role of the “crisis” should be viewed in a broader political and historical context.",Victoria Yantseva,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4624E-B9D-7C0,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4624E-B9D-7C0,2020-07-06,2020-07-06T10:17:08+00:00,"SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration; media discourse; social media; migration; computational text analysis; refugee crisis; twitter; topic modelling; sentiment analysis; automated text analysis",False
141,Challenges and Opportunities created by Covid-19 for ODL: A case study of IGNOU,"The pandemic Covid-19 came as havoc for developing countries like India. It has significantly disrupted the education sector which is a critical determinant of a country’s economic future. It has compelled the human society to maintain social distancing. It has made people mandatory to sit indoor and sitting idle indoor may lead to mental stress. Hence, it has created more challenges to keep people engaged and free from mental stress. Open and Distance Learning (ODL) system is the best solution to meet the challenges of education during this pandemic situation of COVID-19. Every challenge is an opportunity. These challenges have also created opportunities for the educational institutes to strengthen their technological knowledge and infrastructure to tackle the Covid-19 like situation. Indian education system is more acquainted with face to face or physical teaching learning process. Most of educators and learners are not equipped with use of technology in education and there is also lack of practice and motivation towards use of technology in education which creates more challenges during pandemics. This article highlights different challenges and opportunities created by Covid-19 for ODL system of Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU). The steps taken by IGNOU to meet the challenges by exploring various opportunities are pointed. Some tools and techniques for distance learning which can ensure the continuity of learning during the current pandemic are described. Some suggestions for handling the challenges created by Covid-19 by exploring various opportunities for ODL system are also pointed in the article.",Pravat Kumar Jena,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4618B-D2A-44B,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4618B-D2A-44B,2020-07-04,2020-07-04T02:05:30+00:00,SocArXiv|Education; SocArXiv|Education|Adult and Continuing Education; SocArXiv|Education|Educational Administration and Supervision; SocArXiv|Education|Educational Leadership; SocArXiv|Education|Educational Methods; SocArXiv|Education|Elementary Education; SocArXiv|Education|Higher Education; SocArXiv|Education|Indigenous Education; SocArXiv|Education|Other Education; SocArXiv|Education|Outdoor Education; SocArXiv|Education|Secondary Education; SocArXiv|Education|Teacher Education and Professional Development; odl; ignou; challenges; covid-19; opportunities,False
142,Twitter under Storm: Social Media Response Sensitization in the Caribbean,"Climate change has led to rising sea levels and warmer sea surface temperatures. These factors contribute greatly to the intensity of hurricanes and floods they provoke. Projections estimate there will be an increase of 45% to 87% in the frequency of Category >4 hurricanes originating in the Atlantic Basin, which typically impact the Caribbean and Continental United States of America. During the 2019 Hurricane Season, there were 20 depressions, 18 storms, 6 hurricanes and 3 major hurricanes. Through this work, we explored the response on Social Media to these natural phenomena as a function of their trajectory, intensity, and previous exposure of the population to intense natural disasters. Data was collected through the Twitter API. The influences of hurricane proximity and intensity on volume of Social Media production was explored. Hurricane Dorian, with its trajectory strongly threatening the previously exposed Puerto Rico, and eventually causing widespread damage in the Abaco Islands of the Bahamas, presented the strongest case for the evaluation of the dichotomy of responses between populations with differences in previous history of exposure. The landscape of historic hurricane exposure Caribbean has radically changed in recent years.

143,"Emerging COVID-19 impacts, responses, and lessons for building resilience in the seafood system","The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns are creating health and economic crises that threaten food and nutrition security. The seafood sector provides important sources of employment and nutrition, especially in low-income countries, and is highly globalized, allowing shocks to propagate internationally. We use a resilience ‘action cycle’ framework to study the first five months of COVID-19-related disruptions, impacts, and responses to the seafood sector. Looking across high- and low-income countries, we find that some supply chains, market segments, companies, small-scale actors and civil society have shown initial signs of greater resilience than others. For example, frozen Ecuadorian shrimp and Chinese tilapia exports were diverted to alternative markets, while live-fresh supply chains were more impacted. COVID-19 has also highlighted the vulnerability of certain groups working in- or dependent on the seafood sector.

144,The Effect of Fox News on Health Behavior During COVID-19,"In the early weeks of the 2020 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, Fox News Channel advanced a skeptical narrative that downplayed the risks posed by the virus. We find that this narrative had significant consequences: in localities with higher Fox News viewership---exogenous due to random variation in channel positioning---people were less likely to adopt behaviors geared toward social distancing (e.g., staying at home) and consumed less goods in preparation (e.g., cleaning products, hand sanitizers, masks). Using original survey data, we find that the effect of Fox News came not merely from its long-standing distrustful stance toward science, but also due to program-specific content that minimized the COVID-19 threat.",Elliott Ash et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46159-2E5-B55,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46159-2E5-B55,2020-06-27,2020-06-27T14:10:21+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy,False

Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies offer a wide range of opportunities to leverage advancements in data sciences in analyzing health records, behavioral data, social media contents, and outcomes data on mental health. Several studies have reported the use of several AI technologies such as vector machines, neural networks, latent Dirichlet allocation, decision trees, and clustering to detect and treat depression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, and other mental health problems. The applications of such technologies in the context of COVID-19 is still under development, which calls for further deployment of AI technologies in mental health research in this pandemic using clinical and psychosocial data through technological partnerships and collaborations.

In this article, we examine the expectations of the economic outlook, fear of the future, and behavioural change during the lockdown, for three European countries (Spain, the United Kingdom, and Italy) that have been severely hit by Covid-19. We use a novel data source that we collected to monitor the three countries during the pandemic. As outcome variables, we use expectations (e.g., economic outlook, labour market situation, recovery), fear (e.g., scenario of new outburst, economic depression, restriction to individual rights and freedom), and behavioural change across the following dimensions: savings, cultural consumption, social capital, and risky behaviour.

147,Studying the prominence effect amid the COVID-19 crisis: implications for public health policy decision-making.,"Background: The novel COVID-19 has brought upon crucial policy- and decision- making situations, especially when making judgments between economic and health concerns. One particularly relevant decision-making phenomenon is the prominence effect, where decision-makers base their decisions on the most prominent attribute of the object at hand (e.g., health concerns) rather than weigh all the attributes together. This bias diminishes when the decision-making mode inhibits heuristic processes. In this study, we tested the prominence of health vs. economic concerns across two decision-making modes - choice (prone to heuristics) and matching (mitigates heuristics) - during the peak of the COVID-19 in the UK using Tversky et al.’s classic experimental paradigm. We added to the classic experimental design a priming condition. Methods and Findings: Four hundred twenty participants from the UK were recruited via a crowd-working platform. They were presented with two casualty- minimization programs, differing in lives saved and costs: program X would save 100 lives at the cost of 55-million-pound sterling, whereas program Y would save 30 lives at the cost of 12-million-pound sterling. Half of the participants were required to choose between the programs (choice condition). The other half were not given the cost of program X and were asked to determine what the cost should be to make it as equally attractive as the program Y. Participants in both groups were primed for either: a) economic concerns; b) health concerns; or c) control (no priming). Results showed that in the choice condition, unless primed for economic concerns, health concerns are more prominent (only under economic priming was there a significant preference for program Y, p<0.001). In the matching condition, on the other hand, the prominence of health concerns did not affect decision-makers, as they all “preferred” the cheaper option. Conclusions: These results add further support to the practical relevance of using the proper decision-making modes in times of consequential crises where multiple concerns, interests, and parties are involve",Yossi Maaravi et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4623F-E65-683,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4623F-E65-683,2020-06-21,2020-06-21T03:27:21+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology,False

The aim is to describe how teachers employ their competences under extreme digitized circumstances compared to ordinary, to a greater extent analogically organized schooling. The study is inspired by action research where five secondary and upper secondary teachers document their work between March 19 and April 2020. A contrastive analysis highlights qualitative aspects of teachers’ (digital) competence when teaching is affected by digital “interferences” in its corporeal and material framing, a dissolved spatiality and “truncated” senses/sensuousness.

151,The importance of urban natural areas and urban ecosystem services during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Urban, peri-urban forests and other natural areas provide a wide range of material and non-material benefits to people known as ecosystem services. Access to these areas has been linked to improvements in physical and mental health of local populations. In the Spring of 2020, the COVID-19 global pandemic forced many governments to impose a set of restrictions including the closure of businesses and cancelation of events, social distancing and limitation of gatherings, and movement limitations. During this period of restrictions, we conducted a study assessing the importance of urban and peri-urban forests and other natural areas to people living in and around the city of Burlington, Vermont, USA. We evaluated the use and value changes related to these natural areas before and during the period of restrictions. We received over 400 surveys from the local community. The results show that 69.0% of the respondents had increased or greatly increased their visitation rate to these areas, and 80.6% of respondents considered that the importance of these natural areas and access to them either increased or greatly increased. Moreover 25.8% of the sample had either never, or very rarely accessed their local natural areas before the pandemic, but 69.2% of the first time or infrequent visitors reported that having access to these areas during COVID-19 as ‘very important’. People reported that these areas were important for a wide range of activities from exercise to birding, but also reported values related to reducing stress in a time of global chaos. Our results indicate the increasing demand and value of such areas in times of crisis such as COVID-19.

152,The Political Scar of Epidemics,"What will be political legacy of the Coronavirus pandemic? We find that epidemic exposure in an individual's impressionable years (ages 18 to 25) has a persistent negative effect on confidence in political institutions and leaders. We find similar negative effects on confidence in public health systems, suggesting that the loss of confidence in political leadership and institutions is associated with healthcare related policies at the time of the epidemic. In line with this argument, our results are mostly driven by individuals who experienced epidemics under weak governments with less capacity to act against the epidemic, disappointing their citizens. We provide evidence of this mechanism by showing that weak governments took longer to introduce policy interventions in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. These results imply that the Coronavirus may leave behind a long-lasting political scar on the current young generation (""Generation Z"").",Cevat Giray Aksoy et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46191-E9D-D60,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46191-E9D-D60,2020-06-16,2020-06-16T07:40:02+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy; epidemics; democracy; covid-19; political trust; government approval,False

The Prime Minister announced a timetable for partial reopening of school on 10th May. With the return to partial schooling imminent, the views of year 10 and year 12 students were surveyed. Design Cross-sectional web-based survey disseminated via closed social media fora. Setting A structured questionnaire hosted on Google Forms™ and disseminated via two Facebook™ fora in the week prior to the original stated date of return to partial schooling for year 10 and year 12 students (20th to 27th May 2020). Participants United Kingdom school students in year 10 (age 14 to 15 years old) and year 12 (age 16 to 17 years old). Main outcome measures Views of year 10 and year 12 students on returning to schools with a focus on their opinions on government guidance, impact on their future, and how remote learning has impacted on their education. Results 1534 students (yr10 n= 1007 66%, yr12 n=527 34%) completed the questionnaire. Students were equally divided in opinion with 781 (51%) preferring to return to partial schooling with limited educational contact and 753 (49%) preferring to remain isolated at home with remote schooling, when an unsure option was removed. A majority (73%, n=1111) of students feel unsafe or unsure that Government guidelines will be enough to protect them from COVID-19 in a school environment. 79% (n=1205) of students felt that COVID-19 has impacted on their future. 15% (n=231) of students said they have had no additional support or guidance from their school during remote learning. Conclusions Year 10 and 12 school students were divided equally in their preferences about returning to partial school. Exploration of their uncertainty by thematic analysis revealed the source to be anxieties around safety. Students feel they are being put at risk and because guidelines will be impossible to enforce in a school environment. Some students recognised a need to return to education despite this perceived risk. An inequity in the standard of education was identified with 15% (n=231) of students reporting that they did not receive any support during the 87 days of lock down.
