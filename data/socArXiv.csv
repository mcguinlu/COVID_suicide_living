0,Optimistically biased economic growth forecasts and negatively skewed annual variation,"Authoritative economic growth forecasts are often optimistically biased. One possible reason is that growth often has negatively skewed variation--negative shocks tend to have larger magnitudes than positive shocks, as the Great Recession and COVID-19 crisis illustrate. Negative skewness means that average growth over decades is smaller than typical-year (median or mode) growth, which would positively bias forecasts based on typical years. Here, we quantify this aspect of negative skewness in real per-capita GDP growth since the Industrial Revolution (1820-2016), by comparing medians and means across countries, regions, and time windows. Over decadal periods, we find mean growth rates to be <1%/y smaller than median growth rates in most countries and regions (median 0.23%/y across countries). Surprisingly, we find these differences are driven by negative skewness in both large- and medium-magnitude shocks, rather than only large shocks ('black swan' events). We also find our measure of negative skewness correlated with slow average per-capita GDP and population growth, high per-capita GDP growth volatility, and high per-capita GDP and population, building on previous studies. We find that recent over-projections of growth--by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the U.S. Congressional Budget Office (CBO), and the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios informing climate change research--have mostly been larger than can be explained solely by negative skewness, suggesting other sources of bias exist.",Matthew G.

1,Gender Differences in Telecommuting and Implications for Inequality at Home and Work,"The global pandemic has led to an unprecedented shift to remote work that will likely persist to some degree into the future. Telecommuting’s impact on flexibility and work family conflict is a critical question for researchers and policy-makers. Our study addresses this question with data collected before and during the COVID-19 crisis: the 2003-2018 American Time Use Survey (ATUS, N = 19,179) and the April and May 2020 COVID Impact Survey (N = 784). Comparing mothers and fathers who work exclusively at the workplace, exclusively from home, and part-day from home, we describe differences in time spent on housework, childcare, and leisure; the nature of time worked at home; and the subjective experiences of telecommuting. In addition to a broad descriptive portrait, we take advantage of a quasi-experimental design in the ATUS leave supplements to examine time working at home among those who report ever telecommuting, providing estimates of telecommuting’s effect on other uses of time that better approximate causal relationships than prior studies. We find that gender gaps in housework are larger for telecommuters, and, among telecommuters, larger on telecommuting days. Conversely, telecommuting may shrink the gender gap in childcare, particularly among couples with two full time earners, although childcare more frequently impinges upon mothers’ work time. Survey data collected following the March COVID19 stay-at-home orders show that telecommuting mothers more frequently report feelings of anxiety, loneliness and depression than telecommuting fathers. Early estimates of responses to the COVID19 pandemic offer insights into future implications of telecommuting for gender equality at work.",Thomas Lyttelton et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F8-A87-AC7,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F8-A87-AC7,2020-07-09,2020-07-09T05:06:21+00:00,"SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender; housework; care work; covid; inequality; telecommuting; wellbeing; time use; covid-19; work; gender; household labor; working from home",False
2,Natural stings: alternative health services selling distrust about vaccines on YouTube,"In this study, we investigate YouTube’s videos related to vaccines to understand the particularities of the opposition to vaccines in Brazil. The World Health Organization considered vaccine hesitation as one of the greatest threats to global health in 2019. Researchers associated this hesitation to a strengthening of the anti-vaccination movements, suggesting that social media is currently the main spreader of this position. YouTube increasingly becomes a matter of concern, since its recommendation system is identified as a promoter of misinformation and extreme content. Despite YouTube’s statements, misinformation and disinformation (M&D) about vaccines continue to be disseminated in videos in Portuguese, reaching a large audience. We found 52 videos containing M&D about vaccines. The main M&D were the claim of dangerous ingredients in vaccines, the defense of self-direction — freedom of choice, independent research —, the promotion of alternative health services, the myth that vaccines cause diseases, conspiracy theories, and the allegation of vaccine’s severe collateral effects. We identified 39 brands advertising on 13 videos of our M&D sample. Although the YouTube Partner Program is an important source of income, the channels use different economic strategies, such as the selling of courses, and therapies and the use of fundraising platforms. We also found that alternative health channels spread distrust about traditional institutions to promote themselves as trusted sources for the audience and thereby profit with alternative health services.",Dayane Fumiyo Tokojima Machado et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461EF-1A2-964,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461EF-1A2-964,2020-07-01,2020-07-07T18:04:23+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media; misinformation; youtube; disinformation; alternative health; vaccines,False
3,Global years of life lost to COVID-1,"Understanding the mortality impact of COVID-19 requires not only counting the dead, but analyzing how premature the deaths are. We calculate years of life lost (YLL) across 42 countries due to COVID-19 attributable deaths, and also conduct an analysis based on estimated excess deaths. As of June 13th 2020, YLL in heavily affected countries are 2 to 6 times the average seasonal influenza; over two thirds of the YLL result from deaths in ages below 75 and one quarter from deaths below 55; and men have lost 47% more life years than women. The results confirm the large mortality impact of COVID-19 among the elderly. They also call for heightened awareness in devising policies that protect vulnerable demographics losing the largest number of life-years.",Héctor Pifarré I Arolas et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F0-B14-CD8,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F0-B14-CD8,2020-06-23,2020-07-07T18:01:56+00:00,"SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics; covid-19; years of life lost; excess mortality; public health",False
4,Linking excess mortality to Google mobility data during the COVID-19 pandemic in England and Wales,"Following the outbreak of COVID-19, a number of non-pharmaceutical interventions have been implemented to contain the spread of the pandemic. Despite the recent reduction in the number of infections and deaths in Europe, it is still unclear to which extent these governmental actions have contained the spread of the disease and reduced mortality. In this article, we estimate the effects of reduced human mobility on excess mortality using digital mobility data at the regional level in England and Wales. Specifically, we employ the Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports, which offer an approximation to the changes in mobility due to different social distancing measures. Considering that changes in mobility would require some time before having an effect on mortality, we analyse the relationship between excess mortality and lagged indicators of human mobility. We find a negative association between excess mortality and time spent at home, as well as a positive association with changes in outdoor mobility, after controlling for the time trend of the pandemic and regional differences. We estimate that almost 130,000 excess deaths have been averted as a result of the increased time spent at home. In addition to addressing a key scientific question, our results have important policy implications for future pandemics and a potential second wave of COVID-19.",Ugofilippo Basellini et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46029-C77-D97,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46029-C77-D97,2020-07-07,2020-07-07T16:54:48+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population; covid-19; human mobility; excess mortality; sars-cov-2; coronavirus; digital data,False
5,"Indirect consequences of COVID-19 on people’s lives. Findings from an on-line survey in France, Italy and Spain","The COVID-19 pandemic has limited individuals’ possibility to meet and socialize with others due to the state of emergency restrictions to movements, events and relations imposed in different countries. Most shops and restaurants have been closed and some economic activities have been seriously damaged. This significant disruption may have contributed to a deterioration of people’s mental health on top of other negative consequences of the pandemic. To better understand the indirect consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak on people’s lives we have designed the intergen-COVID online survey (https://sites.google.com/unifi.it/intergen-covid), carried out in France, Italy and Spain between the 14th to the 24th of April 2020. Quota sampling on the population 18-plus and post-stratification weights were used to achieve the alignment between the sample (N = 9,056) and the total population on important socio-demographic characteristics. We collected information on four key domains of individuals’ lives: intergenerational (and other type of) relationships (physical and non-physical; means of communication; frequency, etc.); living arrangements; mental health; events experienced during the lockdown (e.g., income loss, death of relative/friend due to COVID-19, worsened partner relationships, time spent with family); intentions for the future 3 years (e.g., fertility, living parental home, marriage, cohabitation, divorce/separation, retirement). In this paper we provide the main results from this survey, focusing on the first three domains abovementioned. The fourth domain consists of questions applicable to different sub-groups of the population and will be analyzed in separate papers. We show that, despite the general reduction of physical contacts, with low educated people reporting a lower reduction in all kinds of physical contacts, non-physical contacts have significantly increased, especially among women. About 50% of respondents felt sad or depressed more often than usual during the lockdown, but mental health deterioration was found to be heterogeneous and vary with respondents’ age, gender and country. Job and income loss, and worsening of relationships quality were other negative consequences often experienced during the lockdown, especially by younger individuals. Finally, although maintaining physical distance, during the lockdown people have experienced a high level of social connection, emotional support and practical help.",Bruno Arpino et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4603E-788-AD3,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4603E-788-AD3,2020-07-07,2020-07-07T13:06:02+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning; physical distancing; consequences of covid-19; sars-cov-2; coronavirus; social relationships; mental health; covid-19,False
6,Learning to love cosmopolitanism? Testing the socialisation effect of educational field of study on cosmopolitan attitudes in the Netherlands,"Across Europe, those with higher education are consistently found to be more pro-cosmopolitan than those with less education. However, it remains an open question what aspects of education drive this relationship. One influential mechanism through which education is argued to affect cosmopolitan attitudes is by instilling tolerance inducing values and beliefs that continue to influence the thinking of students long after they have left the education system. Using the Dutch LISS panel between 2008 and 2019, we explore differences in the emphasis on tolerant values and beliefs across fields of study to assess the explanatory power of the socialisation model of education for cosmopolitan attitudes. By estimating between- and within subject panel regressions, we find that although there are cross-sectional differences between fields of study in cosmopolitan attitudes, these differences cannot conclusively be attributed to the socialisation influence of the specific field. Consequently, our results challenge the importance of the socialisation model to understand the current educational divide in cosmopolitanism.",Sander Kunst,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461CE-1D9-260,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461CE-1D9-260,2020-07-07,2020-07-07T13:04:23+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; education; field of study; liss panel; cosmopolitanism,False
7,"Getting out while staying in: Park use decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially where park availability was low","The spread of COVID-19 altered use of public spaces, such as parks, with potential effects on human health and well-being. Little is known about park use during the pandemic, how local features (e.g, park availability) influence use, and whether park visits accelerate COVID-19 spread. Using weekly panel data for 620 U.S. counties, we show park visits decreased by 10% beginning March 15, and by 17-35% through May 9, 2020. Net of weekly sample trends, park visits decreased by 2.3% when stay-at-home orders were in effect, yet increased by 8.3% after school closures and 4.1% after business closures. Park visits decreased less during the pandemic in metropolitan counties or where park availability was high. Higher park visits were weakly associated with COVID-19 case growth rate but not incidence. Thus, parks may serve as alternatives for recreation when schools and businesses close, especially where parks are available, with no-to-little influence on COVID-19 spread.",David Stuart Curtis et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4604A-5F4-63E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4604A-5F4-63E,2020-07-06,2020-07-06T16:05:31+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning; covid-19; cell phone data; green space; park access; social distancing measures; google mobility reports; parks; outdoor recreation; safegraph,False
8,Migration discourse in Sweden: frames and sentiments in mainstream and social media,"This study makes a systematic analysis of media discourse on migration in Sweden in 2012-2019. Using a novel dataset consisting of mainstream newspapers, Twitter and forum data, the article answers two questions: what do Swedish media actually talk about when they talk about “migration”? And how do they talk about it? Using a combination of computational text analysis tools, I analyse a shift in the media discourse as one of the outcomes of the so-called “European refugee crisis” in 2015 and try to comprehend the role of social media in this process. The results of the study provide some evidence for a populist and hostile character of the migration framing and indicate that the messages on social media, generally, had negative tonality. At the same time, the analysis of framing and sentiment dynamics suggests that a statement about the discourse shift in the Swedish media during the “European refugee crisis” is to some extent over-estimated. Rather, one can suggest that the role of the “crisis” should be viewed in a broader political and historical context.",Victoria Yantseva,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4624E-B9D-7C0,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4624E-B9D-7C0,2020-07-06,2020-07-06T10:17:08+00:00,"SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration; twitter; media discourse; refugee crisis; computational text analysis; migration; social media; automated text analysis; sentiment analysis; topic modelling",False
9,The Welfare State and Risk Perceptions: The Novel Coronavirus Pandemic and Public Concern in 70 Countries,"The novel coronavirus pandemic led individuals to experience heightened social risks, particularly financial and health related. The strength of a welfare state shapes individual risk perceptions under normal circumstances. My research question is whether it also shapes risk perceptions in abnormal disaster scenarios, for example amidst the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. I test this using the data from the global COVIDiSTRESS survey to compare 70 countries in April of 2020, a month where deaths resulting from Covid-19 affected three-quarters of the world’s societies. Controlling for local timing and severity of the pandemic, welfare state strength predicts lower risk perceptions. However, this it is not a universal effect as I expected. The welfare state impact depends on how quickly a government introduced strong ‘lock down’ measures. The longer it took a government to respond the more the welfare state reduces risk perceptions. Governments that took lock down measures in advance of the virus show no variation in risk perceptions, whereas governments that took 30 days to respond have up to a 1.5 standard deviation range of risk perceptions depending on the strength of the welfare state. I conclude that the welfare state matters very much when governments fail to take effective intervention measures in a global emergency.",Nate Breznau,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460C0-3E3-6A3,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460C0-3E3-6A3,2020-06-30,2020-07-06T09:26:39+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology; welfare state; pandemic; covid-19; policy intervention; covidistress; novel coronavirus; sars-cov-2; risk perceptions,False
10,"The Heathen, the Plague, and the Model Minority: Perpetual Self-Assessment of Asian Americans as a Panoptic Mechanism","The novel coronavirus has highlighted some racial divides in the United States. Incidents of racism against Asians, in particular, have been on the rise since the pandemic turned global in early 2020. I employ Foucault’s concept of panopticism to examine how some Asians and Asian Americans respond to xenophobic or anti-Asian sentiments during the pandemic by performing a close reading of an op-ed by former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang on The Washington Post. This essay argues that the panoptic mechanism of perpetual self-assessment ensures that Asian Americans accept their place within America’s racial hierarchy and adapts the dominant white racial frame. Borrowing theoretical resources from religious studies, this essay also demonstrates that the precarious dualistic identities assigned to Asian Americans by the panoptic structure help to ensure that Asian Americans are only able to negotiate their identities within such discursive limits. Such limitations uphold whiteness as the American Gnosis. This panoptic mechanism of perpetual self-assessment of the Asian Americans makes it hard to locate, let alone criticize the white racial frame. The assignment of identity by the gaze is the real power that lies within the Panopticon and what truly sustains this structure in modern society.",Sherry Chan,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46046-4E1-EA3,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46046-4E1-EA3,2020-07-06,2020-07-06T02:37:41+00:00,SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities; SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities|Religion; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; whiteness; religion; asian american; religious studies; asian; foucault; coronarivus; racism; race and ethnicity,False
11,Challenges and Opportunities created by Covid-19 for ODL: A case study of IGNOU,"The pandemic Covid-19 came as havoc for developing countries like India. It has significantly disrupted the education sector which is a critical determinant of a country’s economic future. It has compelled the human society to maintain social distancing. It has made people mandatory to sit indoor and sitting idle indoor may lead to mental stress. Hence, it has created more challenges to keep people engaged and free from mental stress. Open and Distance Learning (ODL) system is the best solution to meet the challenges of education during this pandemic situation of COVID-19. Every challenge is an opportunity. These challenges have also created opportunities for the educational institutes to strengthen their technological knowledge and infrastructure to tackle the Covid-19 like situation. Indian education system is more acquainted with face to face or physical teaching learning process. Most of educators and learners are not equipped with use of technology in education and there is also lack of practice and motivation towards use of technology in education which creates more challenges during pandemics. This article highlights different challenges and opportunities created by Covid-19 for ODL system of Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU). The steps taken by IGNOU to meet the challenges by exploring various opportunities are pointed.

12,Twitter under Storm: Social Media Response Sensitization in the Caribbean,"Climate change has led to rising sea levels and warmer sea surface temperatures. These factors contribute greatly to the intensity of hurricanes and floods they provoke. Projections estimate there will be an increase of 45% to 87% in the frequency of Category >4 hurricanes originating in the Atlantic Basin, which typically impact the Caribbean and Continental United States of America. During the 2019 Hurricane Season, there were 20 depressions, 18 storms, 6 hurricanes and 3 major hurricanes. Through this work, we explored the response on Social Media to these natural phenomena as a function of their trajectory, intensity, and previous exposure of the population to intense natural disasters. Data was collected through the Twitter API. The influences of hurricane proximity and intensity on volume of Social Media production was explored. Hurricane Dorian, with its trajectory strongly threatening the previously exposed Puerto Rico, and eventually causing widespread damage in the Abaco Islands of the Bahamas, presented the strongest case for the evaluation of the dichotomy of responses between populations with differences in previous history of exposure.

Although MHLW provides a summary statistics about the COVID-19 cases and deaths on their webpage, the distribution broken down by age and sex is not available, that leads many volunteering organizations to collect COVID-19 information based on prefectural/municipality reports. However, even these databases do not provide COVID-19 deaths by age and sex.

14,"Emerging COVID-19 impacts, responses, and lessons for building resilience in the seafood system","The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns are creating health and economic crises that threaten food and nutrition security. The seafood sector provides important sources of employment and nutrition, especially in low-income countries, and is highly globalized, allowing shocks to propagate internationally. We use a resilience ‘action cycle’ framework to study the first five months of COVID-19-related disruptions, impacts, and responses to the seafood sector. Looking across high- and low-income countries, we find that some supply chains, market segments, companies, small-scale actors and civil society have shown initial signs of greater resilience than others. For example, frozen Ecuadorian shrimp and Chinese tilapia exports were diverted to alternative markets, while live-fresh supply chains were more impacted. COVID-19 has also highlighted the vulnerability of certain groups working in- or dependent on the seafood sector.

15,The Effect of Fox News on Health Behavior During COVID-19,"In the early weeks of the 2020 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, Fox News Channel advanced a skeptical narrative that downplayed the risks posed by the virus. We find that this narrative had significant consequences: in localities with higher Fox News viewership---exogenous due to random variation in channel positioning---people were less likely to adopt behaviors geared toward social distancing (e.g., staying at home) and consumed less goods in preparation (e.g., cleaning products, hand sanitizers, masks). Using original survey data, we find that the effect of Fox News came not merely from its long-standing distrustful stance toward science, but also due to program-specific content that minimized the COVID-19 threat.",Elliott Ash et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46159-2E5-B55,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46159-2E5-B55,2020-06-27,2020-06-27T14:10:21+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy,False

It is essential to deploy advanced research methodologies that may use complex data to draw meaningful inferences facilitating mental health research and policymaking during this pandemic. Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies offer a wide range of opportunities to leverage advancements in data sciences in analyzing health records, behavioral data, social media contents, and outcomes data on mental health. Several studies have reported the use of several AI technologies such as vector machines, neural networks, latent Dirichlet allocation, decision trees, and clustering to detect and treat depression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, and other mental health problems. The applications of such technologies in the context of COVID-19 is still under development, which calls for further deployment of AI technologies in mental health research in this pandemic using clinical and psychosocial data through technological partnerships and collaborations.

17,"Restarting “normal” life after Covid-19 and the lockdown: Evidence from Spain, the United Kingdom, and Italy","Currently, unprecedented series of events are taking place that affect the institutional structure of the world economy and the social fabric of our societies. In this article, we examine the expectations of the economic outlook, fear of the future, and behavioural change during the lockdown, for three European countries (Spain, the United Kingdom, and Italy) that have been severely hit by Covid-19. We use a novel data source that we collected to monitor the three countries during the pandemic. As outcome variables, we use expectations (e.g., economic outlook, labour market situation, recovery), fear (e.g., scenario of new outburst, economic depression, restriction to individual rights and freedom), and behavioural change across the following dimensions: savings, cultural consumption, social capital, and risky behaviour.

18,Studying the prominence effect amid the COVID-19 crisis: implications for public health policy decision-making.,"Background: The novel COVID-19 has brought upon crucial policy- and decision- making situations, especially when making judgments between economic and health concerns. One particularly relevant decision-making phenomenon is the prominence effect, where decision-makers base their decisions on the most prominent attribute of the object at hand (e.g., health concerns) rather than weigh all the attributes together. This bias diminishes when the decision-making mode inhibits heuristic processes. In this study, we tested the prominence of health vs. economic concerns across two decision-making modes - choice (prone to heuristics) and matching (mitigates heuristics) - during the peak of the COVID-19 in the UK using Tversky et al.’s classic experimental paradigm. We added to the classic experimental design a priming condition. Methods and Findings: Four hundred twenty participants from the UK were recruited via a crowd-working platform. They were presented with two casualty- minimization programs, differing in lives saved and costs: program X would save 100 lives at the cost of 55-million-pound sterling, whereas program Y would save 30 lives at the cost of 12-million-pound sterling. Half of the participants were required to choose between the programs (choice condition). The other half were not given the cost of program X and were asked to determine what the cost should be to make it as equally attractive as the program Y. Participants in both groups were primed for either: a) economic concerns; b) health concerns; or c) control (no priming). Results showed that in the choice condition, unless primed for economic concerns, health concerns are more prominent (only under economic priming was there a significant preference for program Y, p<0.001). In the matching condition, on the other hand, the prominence of health concerns did not affect decision-makers, as they all “preferred” the cheaper option. Conclusions: These results add further support to the practical relevance of using the proper decision-making modes in times of consequential crises where multiple concerns, interests, and parties are involve",Yossi Maaravi et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4623F-E65-683,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4623F-E65-683,2020-06-21,2020-06-21T03:27:21+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology,False

20,EPIDEMIC RESILIENCE LABEL FOR A POST-COVID CITY (ERL Project),The development of a label that evaluates the epidemic-resistance capacity of places of social exchange can be an invaluable tool in determining prevention policies on the one hand and social containment and distancing measures on the other. Policies that protect the health of citizens as much as possible while allowing develop human activities. The research project will work on the evaluation of the safety of buildings and urban spaces in cities in the context of a pandemic such as Covid-19 through the development of the so-called Epidemic Resilience Label. Passive site labelling measures will promote synergies for the development of the economy of this new normality.

21,"Lärares digitala kompetens före, under och efter covid-19","This study chrono-logically investigates teachers’ professional knowledge in relation to the digitally ‘boosted’ educational landscape caused by the COVID-19-pandemic. The aim is to describe how teachers employ their competences under extreme digitized circumstances compared to ordinary, to a greater extent analogically organized schooling. The study is inspired by action research where five secondary and upper secondary teachers document their work between March 19 and April 2020. A contrastive analysis highlights qualitative aspects of teachers’ (digital) competence when teaching is affected by digital “interferences” in its corporeal and material framing, a dissolved spatiality and “truncated” senses/sensuousness. Employing different dimensions of knowledge in terms of intellectus and ratio, the study argues that subjective, emotional and relational processes of teachers’ digital competence need to be prioritized in contrast to the easily measurable aspects that tend to overrun the discussions about educational digitalization and its knowledge in society.",Linnea Stenliden et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46198-E2C-626,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46198-E2C-626,2020-06-18,2020-06-18T20:29:05+00:00,SocArXiv|Education; SocArXiv|Education|Online and Distance Education; SocArXiv|Education|Secondary Education; home schooling; remote teaching; distance teaching; quarantine; online teaching; lärare; education; skola; school closure; intellectus; covid-19; ratio; social precense; distansundervisning; skolnedstängning; digital kompetens; utbildning,False
22,The importance of urban natural areas and urban ecosystem services during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Urban, peri-urban forests and other natural areas provide a wide range of material and non-material benefits to people known as ecosystem services. Access to these areas has been linked to improvements in physical and mental health of local populations. In the Spring of 2020, the COVID-19 global pandemic forced many governments to impose a set of restrictions including the closure of businesses and cancelation of events, social distancing and limitation of gatherings, and movement limitations. During this period of restrictions, we conducted a study assessing the importance of urban and peri-urban forests and other natural areas to people living in and around the city of Burlington, Vermont, USA. We evaluated the use and value changes related to these natural areas before and during the period of restrictions. We received over 400 surveys from the local community. The results show that 69.0% of the respondents had increased or greatly increased their visitation rate to these areas, and 80.6% of respondents considered that the importance of these natural areas and access to them either increased or greatly increased. Moreover 25.8% of the sample had either never, or very rarely accessed their local natural areas before the pandemic, but 69.2% of the first time or infrequent visitors reported that having access to these areas during COVID-19 as ‘very important’. People reported that these areas were important for a wide range of activities from exercise to birding, but also reported values related to reducing stress in a time of global chaos. Our results indicate the increasing demand and value of such areas in times of crisis such as COVID-19. Experts in zoonotic disease predict the potential for more frequent pandemic events, thus predicating the importance for continued funding for, maintenance of and improved access to natural areas to our largely urban civilization.",Brendan Fisher et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A2-F81-886,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A2-F81-886,2020-06-12,2020-06-18T15:10:23+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,False

24,Blue uncertainty: Warding off systemic risks in the Anthropocene – Lessons from COVID-19,"COVID-19 has made evident that we are ill-prepared to respond to an international health emergency, the complex interdependence of social and ecological systems, and that to reduce the risk of future zoonotic pandemics we must safeguard nature. Approaches based on complexity science taking into account that interdependence and its associated systemic risks must be mainstreamed in current policy making, in general. However, at present, that could result in failure for three main reasons: (1) those approaches might be too sophisticated for current policy making pursuing sustainable development; (2) the reductionist views from conventional economics still deeply influence economic and environmental policy making; (3) it is unlikely that far-reaching policies aimed at stimulating post-pandemic economic development can be steered through radically innovative approaches that remain untested. Here, using COVID-19 as an example, I suggest that the use of innovative complexity-based approaches could be enabled through intermediary approaches equipped to resonate with the mindset pervading current policy making. In particular, I propose to understand the response to unexpected systemic threats as instances of reactive policy making driven by radical uncertainty, and advance three notions that could enhance that understanding: modulating contingency, adaptive inference and blue uncertainty.",Pablo F.

25,The Political Scar of Epidemics,"What will be political legacy of the Coronavirus pandemic? We find that epidemic exposure in an individual's impressionable years (ages 18 to 25) has a persistent negative effect on confidence in political institutions and leaders. We find similar negative effects on confidence in public health systems, suggesting that the loss of confidence in political leadership and institutions is associated with healthcare related policies at the time of the epidemic. In line with this argument, our results are mostly driven by individuals who experienced epidemics under weak governments with less capacity to act against the epidemic, disappointing their citizens. We provide evidence of this mechanism by showing that weak governments took longer to introduce policy interventions in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. These results imply that the Coronavirus may leave behind a long-lasting political scar on the current young generation (""Generation Z"").",Cevat Giray Aksoy et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46191-E9D-D60,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46191-E9D-D60,2020-06-16,2020-06-16T07:40:02+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy; epidemics; government approval; political trust; covid-19; democracy,False
26,Lifting the lockdown: what are the options for low and middle-income countries?,"To limit the social, economic and psychological damage caused by strict social distancing interventions, many low and middle-income countries (LMICs) are seeking to ease restrictions. However, it is unknown what a ‘safe reopening’ entails in LMICs given suboptimal diagnostic and surveillance capabilities. Here we discuss three community-based public health measures (sustained mitigation, zonal lockdown and dynamic rolling lockdowns) which seek to adequately balance the public health and economic priorities. Each of these options have limitations and prerequisites that may be context-specific and should be considered before implementation, including implementation and maintenance costs, social and economic costs, context-specific epidemic growth and the existing health resources.",Rajiv Chowdhury et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46246-83F-814,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46246-83F-814,2020-06-16,2020-06-16T07:30:23+00:00,"SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy; covid-19; lmics; exit strategies",False

28,Year 10 and 12 school students' opinions on returning to partial schooling during the COVID-19 pandemic: an action research prospective survey,"Objective Educational provision changed during the lockdown period of the COVID-19 outbreak in the UK (20th March to 31st May 2020) with schooling moving online. The Prime Minister announced a timetable for partial reopening of school on 10th May. With the return to partial schooling imminent, the views of year 10 and year 12 students were surveyed. Design Cross-sectional web-based survey disseminated via closed social media fora. Setting A structured questionnaire hosted on Google Forms™ and disseminated via two Facebook™ fora in the week prior to the original stated date of return to partial schooling for year 10 and year 12 students (20th to 27th May 2020). Participants United Kingdom school students in year 10 (age 14 to 15 years old) and year 12 (age 16 to 17 years old). Main outcome measures Views of year 10 and year 12 students on returning to schools with a focus on their opinions on government guidance, impact on their future, and how remote learning has impacted on their education. Results 1534 students (yr10 n= 1007 66%, yr12 n=527 34%) completed the questionnaire. Students were equally divided in opinion with 781 (51%) preferring to return to partial schooling with limited educational contact and 753 (49%) preferring to remain isolated at home with remote schooling, when an unsure option was removed. A majority (73%, n=1111) of students feel unsafe or unsure that Government guidelines will be enough to protect them from COVID-19 in a school environment. 79% (n=1205) of students felt that COVID-19 has impacted on their future. 15% (n=231) of students said they have had no additional support or guidance from their school during remote learning. Conclusions Year 10 and 12 school students were divided equally in their preferences about returning to partial school. Exploration of their uncertainty by thematic analysis revealed the source to be anxieties around safety. Students feel they are being put at risk and because guidelines will be impossible to enforce in a school environment. Some students recognised a need to return to education despite this perceived risk. An inequity in the standard of education was identified with 15% (n=231) of students reporting that they did not receive any support during the 87 days of lock down. School students expressed desire that their concerns be heard by the Government.

29,Political trust during the Covid-19 pandemic: Rally around the flag or lockdown effects?,"How can we explain the rise in diffuse political support during the Covid-19 pandemic? Recent research has argued that the lockdown measures generated political support. In contrast, I argue that the intensity of the pandemic rallied people around political institutions. Collective angst in the face of exponentially rising Covid-19 cases depresses the usual cognitive evaluations of institutions, and leads citizens to rally around existing intuitions as a lifebuoy. Using a representative Dutch household survey conducted over March 2020, I compare the lockdown effect to the dynamic of the pandemic. I find that the lockdown effect is driven by pre-existing time trends. Accounting for nonlinearities in time makes the lockdown effect disappear. In contrast, more flexible modelling techniques reveal a robust effect of Covid-19 infections on political trust. Moreover, I find that standard determinants of political trust – such as economic evaluations and social trust – lose explanatory power as the pandemic spreads. This speaks to an emotionally driven rally effect that pushes cognitive evaluations to the background.",Dominik Schraff,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4621E-6CD-E2B,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4621E-6CD-E2B,2020-06-08,2020-06-08T18:27:35+00:00,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science; corona; political support; netherlands; covid-19; political trust,False
