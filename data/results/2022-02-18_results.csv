"The impact of gender differences, school adjustment, social interactions, and social activities on emotional and behavioral reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic among Japanese school children","The COVID-19 pandemic has had negative psychological effects, such as increased depression, anxiety, and suicide, on children worldwide, including in Japan. To effectively mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic among Japanese children, it is necessary to increase understanding of the culturally specific psychological effects on Japanese children, including age and gender differences, as well as related risk and protective factors. However, no previous research has quantitatively evaluated changes in Japanese children's emotional functioning before and after the pandemic began. The present study examined changes in Japanese children's emotional functioning with pre- and mid-pandemic questionnaires, particularly focusing on age and gender differences. The present study also explored the effects of school adjustment, social interactions, and lifestyle activities on children's emotional and behavioral functioning during the pandemic. Data were analyzed from 293 children from the southwestern region in Japan. The pre-pandemic questionnaire assessed emotional and behavioral functioning and school adjustment, while the mid-pandemic questionnaire assessed emotional and behavioral functioning, social interactions, and lifestyle activities. The results indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the emotional functioning of Japanese children, especially younger boys. Pre-pandemic school adjustment negatively influenced emotional functioning. Spending time alone, spending little time with one's mother, poor sleep regulation, a lack of exercise, and a high frequency of playing video games were related to poor emotional and behavioral functioning. The findings imply that Japanese children, especially younger boys, may benefit from psychological interventions that promote social interactions, especially with their mothers, regulated sleep patterns, adequate exercise, and that support children in managing video game engagement, to mitigate the pandemic's negative psychological impact.","Ishimoto, Yuma, Yamane, Takahiro, Matsumoto, Yuki, Takizawa, Yu, Kobayashi, Katsutoshi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmmh.2022.100077","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: SSM - Mental Health;: 100077, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-18","",27101,""
"The Impact of Telework on Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Four-Wave Cohort Study among Belgian Workers in the First Wave","Introduction: Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments have promoted telework to contain the spread of the virus. This massive switch to telework may have an important impact on workersâ€™ mental health. Research from before the pandemic has shown inconsistent findings on its effect on health, which might be explained by opposing mechanisms underlying this effect (e.g. better work-life balance versus less social support). We aim to enhance our understanding of the impact of telework on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic by investigating the explanatory role of work-home interference (WHI) and social support by colleagues. Methods: Data were collected in a heterogenous sample of 5959 Belgian workers, who participated in at least one of four online surveys during the initial lockdown and a period of initial relaxations of the COVID-19 measures (April-June 2020, time lag of four weeks between measurements). Psychological distress was measured with the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), using a threshold of 2/3. Results: Repeated-measures ANOVAs, with age, gender and cohabiting children as covariates, showed significant changes in telework (F(3,1702)=8.55, p&lt;.001), psychological distress (F(3,2653)=5.29, p=.001) and social support (F(3,2753=7.17, p&lt;.001) across measurement points, but not for WHI (F(3,2618)=0.58, ns). The percentages of workers with psychological distress were 58%, 53%, 49% and 38% at the four measurement points. The results of a timed-lagged mediation model will be presented at the conference. Conclusion: Conclusions and implications for practice will be discussed at the conference","Elst, T.

"Healthy and safe telework: A WHO/ILO technical brief","Introduction: Telework, the practice of working remotely using informational technology (IT), has an important and growing role in the workplace, and has a significant impact on the health, safety and wellbeing of workers. The WHO and ILO has taken steps to assess the impact of telework to the health of safety and workers worldwide and to disseminate information and guidance to help promote safety and health of teleworkers. Material and Methods: A rapid review of the scientific literature was undertaken to determine the impact of telework on worker health and safety pr- and post-COVID. WHO and ILO guidance relevant to telework were reviewed by a joint technical advisory group as well national policies and â€œbest practicesâ€ set out by professional organizations. A scientific brief and OpenWHO course were developed to guide teleworkers and their mangers and employers. Results: Telework is associated with extended working hours, increased reporting of musculoskeletal symptoms, higher incidence of loneliness, irritability, worry, and guilt. Working a digital environment in physical isolation, with high demand and low control over the work can result in mental health problems and unhealthy behaviors. Poor physical environment and workplace design, inadequate IT equipment and technology can result on musculoskeletal disorders, eye strain and injuries. Conclusions: The joint WHO-ILO technical brief advises workers and managers on organizing and carrying out telework that protects and promotes physical and mental health and social wellbeing of workers.","Amster, Y.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shaw.2021.12.1700","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Safety and Health at Work; 13:S303-S304, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-18","",27103,""
"Navigating the Covid-19 Pandemic at the Workplace â€“ the Experience of Uganda's Formal (Public and Private) Sector","Introduction: Uganda has not been spared by the global challenges of the C19 Pandemic, but responses dictated by Governments with WHO guidance focus on Individual and collective actions but not much done to address the psychosocial aspects on the individual. This study on selected formal workplaces in Uganda explored these emerging work-related challenges and how effectively employee psychosocial needs can be addressed. Methods:Comparative study of Ugandaâ€™s formal sectors was done with the aim of identifying, analysing & explaining similarities / differences in these responses. Challenges in accessing information and equivalent study parameters were faced. Qualitative and quantitative methods were simultaneously applied, to contextualize findings for comparable data. The information was synthesized based on pre-selected key themes. Data collection was based on available credible sources & methods varied in public and private sectors hence flexible coding criteria. Study design was more observational than experimental and retrospective versus prospective. Results: Based on UBOS Manpower Survey of Uganda, 2016/2017 77% of Ugandaâ€™s formal workplaces are in Private Sector and 23% in Public Sector. Employees & employers were able to articulate the psychosocial occupational challenges associated with the pandemic including job satisfaction, mental health, employee productivity, employer - employee expectations, limited human interactions, need for additional skills for teleworking, etc. This study exposed the need for formal workplaces to acknowledge these emerging workplace challenges and design appropriate on and off job redress measures.","Katusabe, E.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shaw.2021.12.1691","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Safety and Health at Work; 13:S300-S301, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-18","",27104,""
"Organizational Socialization and Wellbeing in workers in Mexico, Peru and Ecuador during covid-19","A correlational and comparative study was carried out on Organizational Socialization (SO) and Labor Well-being (BL) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The total n was 371, of which 126 were Mexicans, 118 Peruvians, and 127 Ecuadorians. The instruments used were the General Labor Well-being Questionnaire based on a two-dimensional well-being model: psychosocial well-being (affects, competencies and expectations) and collateral effects (somatization, attrition and alienation) created for a research on quality of work life, in addition of the Organizational Socialization Inventory of Taormina, which consists of items that measure four dimensions: training, understanding, peer support and future prospects that have been related to mental health and well-being, to verify hypotheses that would support the protective role of OS against the collateral effects of stress, job uncertainty and technological changes, as well as differences between Peruvians and Mexicans with Ecuadorians during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings showed negative correlations between collateral effects and organizational socialization, at different levels according to each country. In Mexico, Ecuador and Peru positive correlations were found with the affect dimension, while somatization, attrition and alienation had medium correlations. When comparing the samples (ANOVA), it was obtained that the affect, somatization and socialization scales showed differences in the samples of the three countries, so it can be concluded that organizational socialization fulfills a rol as a generator of positive emotions and that allows to cushion negative effects of stress.","CalderÃ³n-Mafud, J.

"Global Cry for Strategies to Support the Mental Health and Well Being of Health Care Workers","INTRODUCTION: Health care workers are often at the forefront of most medical scenarios and crisis, the latest being the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to their pledge of service to society and humanity, they suffer from fatigue and mental exhaustion which is attributed to an over expanding health care system. This goes unnoticed due to their acts of kindness whilst their own health and mental well-being is jeopardised. Moreover, they suffer an internal conflict of wanting to do what is right despite their own challenges. METHOD: A group of health care workers that assisted during the COVID-19 outbreak was interviewed. They completed questionnaires on their emotions before and during the start of the pandemic and the availability of any support structures. RESULTS: Overall, health care workers indicated they felt frustrated and fearful as employers exploited and exposed them to many adversities at workplaces. Their extension of working hours, and disappointment at the lack of appreciation was noted. Demands on their energy, strength and resources were placed on them. No support systems were in place to assist with their burnout, mental exhaustion, nor any incentives for additional services rendered. CONCLUSION: Health care workers are the building blocks of any countryâ€™s health system and investigations should be done on their mental health, well-being and challenges. It is critical to develop global policies, wellness strategies and coping mechanisms to ensure emotionally stable persons assist our nations to good health. Employers need to be well informed of such strategies so that early interventions are sought for quick recovery.","Minnie, D.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shaw.2021.12.1676","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Safety and Health at Work; 13:S296, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-18","",27107,""
"Psychological Well-Being and Mental Health in Migrant Job-Seekers with Disabilities","Introduction: Migrant workers seeking employment in a host country often face a variety of stressors that affect their mental health. Studies have shown that depression, insomnia and fear are more likely reported in migrant workers during Sars-Cov-19 pandemic and lockdown process. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a 10-week job-coaching programme for migrant job-seekers with disabilities related to their psychological well-being or mental health. Materials and Methods: A single-group pre-test and-post-test research design type was used. The preliminary baseline results included 21 migrant job seekers with disabilities. The following reliable, validated and internationally accepted scales were used: Short Form Survey Instrument, WHO Well-Being Index (WHO-5), and Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression and Anxiety (PHQ-9). Results: The mean age of the participants was 49 Â± 9. The participants were unemployed for an average of 2.5 Â± 0.8 years and lived in Belgium for a total of 17.9 Â± 6.5 years. The majority of the participants experienced language barrier problems (85.7%);57.1% of the participants had worked as cleaners in the past. A statistically significant negative and high correlation was found between WHO-5 quality of life scores and PHQ-9 depression scores (p &lt; 0.01;r = 0.715). Conclusion: In the baseline measurements, migrant job seekers had moderate depression levels and negative quality of life and well-being. We now will investigate whether psychological health problems of migrant job seekers will increase during the Sars-Cov-19 pandemic period.","Aktas, E.; Godderis, L.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shaw.2021.12.1611","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Safety and Health at Work; 13:S275, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-18","",27108,""
"The Cost of the Covid-19 Pandemic on the Quality of Life of Vulnerable Workers: The Case of the Philippines","Introduction: This paper looks at the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic to vulnerable groups such as informal workers, those engaged in non-standard forms of employment, and women workers. Material and Methods: Key informants were interviewed and available online materials were used. Results: The pandemic has resulted to a significant increase in unemployment. The uncertainty, instability, and insecurity is high particularly those in non-standard forms of employment, and informal workers. This situation has led to low morale and self-esteem, high stress and anxiety. Womenâ€™s vulnerability during the pandemic is multi-dimensional. Denial of access to health services is experienced. As frontline health workers, there is no PPE fit for their ergonomic requirements and are more likely to get infected from the virus than men. They also bear the burden of psychological effects of increased patientsâ€™ death, physical burnout, and long shifts. Those who need to isolate themselves from their families, the feeling of guilt is overwhelming as they are torn between their productive and reproductive roles. Second shift is also a concern for women on work from home arrangement. Their time to rest and sleep are disrupted. For working women living in poverty, the endless anxiety of finding ways to make both ends meet, lack of basic services at home, and cramp spaces make the situation harder to bear. Stress and depression are increasing. Conclusion: The effects of the Covid-19 pandemic are not the same for all workers. It is the vulnerable workers who find it increasingly more difficult to cushion its adverse impact on their quality of life.","Asuncion, R.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shaw.2021.12.1607","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Safety and Health at Work; 13:S274, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-18","",27109,""
"Long commuting time and depressive symptoms among South Korean workers","COVID-19 has changed the way we live and made the future come faster. Although changes such as work from home are changing how we commute, studies on the association between commuting time and mental health are lacking. We used the Korean Working Condition Survey, a nationally representative cross-sectional survey. A total of 23,415 waged workers in 20-59 years of age were selected. It was investigated that the association between commuting time and depressive symptoms which were measured by the World Health Organisation- Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5). Compared with the shortest commuting time (&lt; 30 min), those who spent 60 min or longer commuting had a significantly higher odd ratio (OR) for depressive symptoms (1.16;95% CI: 1.04, 1.29). Among males, workers aged 40â€“49, in the lowest income quartile, unmarried, not having children, having white-collar jobs, working standard hours groups, and without shiftwork showed a significant association between long commuting time and increased depressive symptoms. Among females, workers aged 20â€“29, in the lowest income quartile, having 2 or more children, and shiftwork showed higher ORs for the association between long commuting time and depressive symptoms. In our study, long commuting time was associated with increased depressive symptoms measured by the WHO-5 well-being index. In the future, it is not expected that changes in commuting will equally and simultaneously be applied to workers with various socio-economical statuses. Our study implies that an approach to mental health according to the characteristics is necessary.","Lee, D. W.; Yun, J. Y.; Hong, Y.

"Co-designing the translation of research into practice to support mentally healthy workplaces in agricultural industries","Introduction: Australian agriculture is vulnerable to an ageing and deceasing workforce, increasing technological demands, global markets, climate change and uncertainty. This poses challenges for work demand/control, workplace support, change management, role clarity/conflict, workplace relationships and environmental conditionsâ€”ultimately increasing psychological distress and suicide risk. The Primary Producer Knowledge Network (PPKN) aims to develop practical strategies to prevent work-related mental health risks in agriculture. Method: PPKN engaged in a detailed co-design process with farmers and industry stakeholdersâ€”including stakeholder interviews, online development and feedback workshops, and pilot testing, and delivered online due to COVID19 restrictions. Co-design was informed by mental health research, evidence-based co-design strategies for working with vulnerable consumers, and identified work-related risks to health, wellbeing and safety. Results: 9 recommendations were derived via co-designâ€”guiding development of an interactive web platform, roadshow, and complementary resources to meet varying digital access/expertise. Ongoing solution-focused topic developmentâ€”an iterative process with experts and primary producersâ€”reflects varied needs of industry groups and age cohorts, and drives change in the design/management of work systems.

"Role of Extension Agents in Addressing Farm Stress in Colorado","Introduction: Farmers and ranchers are known to experience high levels of stress related to weather, labor costs and shortages, financial concerns, international trade issues, and government regulations. These stressors can lead to higher risk of suicide and have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic which has influenced supply chains. Extension Agents have been viewed as trusted members of the community and as essential in supporting farmers and ranchers and connecting them with resources. The purpose of this study was to interview Extension Agents in rural counties in Colorado focusing on their perceptions about farm stress and suicide risk, the perspectives and needs of Extension agents to address these concerns, and the communitiesâ€™ readiness to engage in prevention efforts. Materials and Methods: Qualitative interviews were conducted among 5 Extension Agents in 5 counties in rural Colorado. Interviews were conducted using Zoom between March, 2020-September, 2020. Analysis was done using content analysis on the interview response data followed by a general inductive approach to identify themes. Results: Extension Agents believe prevention efforts are headed in the right direction, but stigma around seeking treatment prevents community members, and especially farmers and ranchers, from engaging with mental health resources. Conclusion: Implications for Extension Agents and rural community prevention efforts include increasing mental health literacy within the community to reduce stigma and tailoring resources that address rural communitiesâ€™ unreliable cell service.","Stallones, L.; Besterfield, M.; Valley, M.; Yuma, P.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shaw.2021.12.1550","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Safety and Health at Work; 13:S256, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-18","",27112,""
"The need for strengthening occupational safety and health management approach for healthcare workers in Indonesia primary healthcare centers: Lesson from COVID-19","Introduction:The COVID-19 pandemic has an impact on all people in the world, but burdens more on health workers as frontliners who are directly involved in handling and tackling the pandemic. It is known that a total of 2032 health workers died from being infected with COVID-19 during the pandemic, both health workers who served in hospitals and primary healthcare centers in Indonesia. This calls for a need to strengthen the occupational safety and health management system for health workers in Indonesia. Materials and Methods: A qualitative study was conducted through the focus group discussion method on 18 heads of primary healthcare centers and 18 laboratory workers in Yogyakarta who were selected purposely. Results: There are two important points found in this study. First, although the need for supporting facilities and infrastructure for health workers such as personal protective equipment and personal hygiene facilities is ideally met, most health workers stated that they had experience of being infected with COVID-19 at least 2 times during the pandemic. Second, in addition to the impact on physical health, the mental health of health workers is an important issue that is expected to be paid more attention to in a pandemic situation. Conclusions: Occupational safety and health regulations for health workers at the primary healthcare centers have not been optimally enforced. Improvements in preventive management related to occupational safety and health aspects for health workers at the primary healthcare centers need to be carried out immediately.","Jaladara, V.; Hasanbasri, M.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shaw.2021.12.1437","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Safety and Health at Work; 13:S219-S220, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-18","",27113,""
"Major Depressive Episode and Insomnia Among Hospital Workers Following the First Peak of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Southern Brazil","Introduction: The covid-19 pandemic has increased the overburden and stressors to which hospital workers are exposed. This study aims to describe the prevalence and factors associated with major depressive episode (MDE) and insomnia among hospital workers of a referral hospital for covid-19 in Southern Brazil right after the first peak of the epidemy. Material and Methods: This cross-sectional study evaluated sociodemographic, behavioral and occupational aspects through a self-administered questionnaire. MDE was evaluated by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and insomnia was assessed by the Insomnia Severity Index. The project was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine of the Federal University of Pelotas (Case 4.040.039 evaluated on May 21st 2020). Results: More than 1100 subjects answered the EDM and/or insomnia questionnaires (response rate over 65%) finding a prevalence of 15.4% (95%CI 13.4 to 17.4 n=1146) and 31.2% (95%CI 28.6 to 33.9 n=1154) respectively. Residents, nurses, technicians/nursing assistants had higher prevalence of depression and insomnia than physicians. The prevalence was higher among women, people with a family history of depression, professionals who reported risk factors for to COVID-19 and those who witnessed one or more situations of moral dilemma. Insomnia was also higher among professionals who mostly worked the night shift. Conclusions: Considering the prevalence of MDE and insomnia among hospital workers. it is essential to review work processes in order to reduce occupational stress and to reduce long term effects of the pandemic on health.","Fassa, A.

"Stress, Anxiety and Depression among Physicians during COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia","Introduction: Healthcare systemâ€™s capacity in Indonesia is struggling to accommodate increasing healthcare demands during the COVID-19 pandemic. It has the lowest number of ICUs than other Asian countries, a shortage of mechanic ventilators, a shortage of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and testing capacity. These circumstances may lead to mental health problems such as stress, anxiety, and depression among physicians as the first liner in the system. Material and Methods: This study was a cross-sectional survey of physicians in East Java Province, Indonesia. The online survey was held from 15 September to 01 December 2020. We used the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression, and the Anxiety Questionnaire. Result: Among 516 participants, more than 50% physicians were worried about being exposed at work, compromised their health, and worried about their home life. Path analysis showed that perceptions of the workplace (ÃŸ=0.24, p-value&lt;001) and home (ÃŸ=0.19, p-value&lt;001) were significantly associated with higher scores of anxieties.

"Assessment of Frontline Healthcare Workers Quality of Work Life (QoWL) during the Covid-19 pandemic - A comparative study between China and UK","Introduction: The COVID-19 epidemic left high proportion of healthcare workers (HCWs) faced with considerable levels of anxiety, depression, and insomnia. Previous studies have shown excessive workload and inadequate working conditions are two main issues among HCWs. Assessing QoWL has been considered as an important way of understanding how HCWs evaluate their work environment. Material and Methods: A cross section survey among frontline HCWs from China and UK (n = 345) was undertaken based on seven dimensional QoWL factors : General Well-Being (GWB);Home-Work Interface (HWI);Job & Career Satisfaction (JCS);Control at Work (CAW), Working Conditions (WCS);Stress at Work (SAW);employee engagement (EEN). Cronbach a was used to measure the internal consistency within each domain and to test the exploratory factor structure confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was applied. Descriptive analysis and One-way ANOVA was performed to examine the association between demographic and job characteristics with QoWL. Ethics clearance was granted by faculty ethics committee. Results: Acceptable Cronbach a score, and CFA were achieved. Overall, 72.8% of the HCWs confirmed working under pressure during the pandemic and 54.2% felt excessive level of stress associated with workload. Significant differences were found between gender and three dimensions, i.e. EEN (F = 6.51, p = 0.011), GWB (F = 3.91, p =0.049), HWI (F = 5.22, p = 0.023). Conclusions: The study conclude organisations and related stakeholders should invest in workplace programmes aimed at alleviating stress at work and excessive workload issue among frontline HCWs.","Lu, Y.; Walsh, S.; Anang, D.; Moda, H.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shaw.2021.12.1398","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Safety and Health at Work; 13:S207, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-18","",27116,""
"Salivary cortisol and cortisone as a biomarker in stress research among health-care workers during COVID-19 pandemic : A Moroccan pilot study","Introduction: Since March 2020, health workers in Morocco were at the front line of the COVID-19 response. Our study aims to assess the magnitude of mental health outcomes and associated factors among the emergency professionals during the COVID-19 outbreak and the impact on salivary cortisol as a biomarker for stress. Methods: This cross-sectional study involved 210 health workers in public hospitals among which 40% of nurses, directly involved in the COVID-19 response, in Morocco. An online-based questionnaire was shared with participants twice a month. The degree of depression and anxiety symptoms was assessed using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire and the seven items Generalized Anxiety disorder. Salivary Cortisol and cortisone were quantified using LC/MS. Results: 56.8% were women. A considerable proportion of participants reported symptoms of depression (53.0%) and anxiety (49.8%). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that being a woman, married, and being a parent of children, and involved in work since March 2020, were associated with severe depression and anxiety. Cortisol levels decreased in weekends and throughout the working day, with low values being at midnight. Conclusion: COVID-19 has alarming complications for the psychosocial functioning and mental health of healthcare professionals. This study conducted in Morocco showed that stress among teams of doctors and nurses is a real fact that needs attention from governmental and civic institutions.","Amellah, A.; Menouni, A.; Godderis, L.; Amane, M.; El Jaafari, S.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shaw.2021.12.1366","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Safety and Health at Work; 13:S197, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-18","",27117,""
"Occupational stress at work during the Covid-19 pandemic: hospital nursesâ€™ coping strategies","Introduction: The Covid-19 pandemic has been increasing nursesâ€™ exposure to occupational stress and despite the relevance of organizational strategies, coping strategies may also play role in stress reduction. This study aimed to analyze coping strategies of hospital nurses to deal with occupational stress during the Covid-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: Qualitative-exploratory study performed with hospital nurses in Brazil. We carried out individual online interviews following an open-ended questions script. Data were recorded, transcripted, and analyzed using thematic analysis. All ethical concerns were respected. Results: Based on the theoretical framework, we found three categories: 1) Problem-focused coping strategies: proper use of PPE;better workplace organization;dealing with the problem in work and seeking help from experts to do it;not postponing activities that can be done at the moment;establishing effective communication;reflecting on stress events;reducing workloads when possible. 2) Emotion-focused coping strategies: use of prescribed drugs for depression and anxiety;getting support from families and friends;increase of food and alcohol consumption;watching non work-related movies and TV series;reading;practicing physical activities;making handicrafts;singing and listening to music;praying;enjoying quality time with family and pets. 3) Meaning-focused coping: spirituality;playing with coworkers to relieve the tension;focussing on patients care and on the bright side of things. Conclusions: Coping strategies help nurses to stay at work despite precarious workplace conditions and safety.","Mininel, V.; Sousa, R.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shaw.2021.12.1365","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Safety and Health at Work; 13:S197, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-18","",27118,""

The National University is the main University in Colombia;it has around 30.000 students and 10.000 workers. Due to the Pandemic, many workers had to work from home, which generated consequences that had to be interrupted. Material and Methods: Through the application of many virtual surveys, we could choose the main topics to be included in this strategy. Finally we selected the next ones and worked on them from our office: - biomechanical, due to the new physical ergonomics conditions. - psychosocial, related to many factors as epidemic Pandemic behavior, new family issues at home, addictions, etc. - nutrition facts, because of inadequate eating habits. - cardiovascular, due to the aspects listed above, and sedentary lifestyle. - occupational health facts, remembering the importance of preventing work-related injuries. Results and Conclusions: Many employees and students at our university had been highly motivated to go back on having healthy habits, which, in some cases have had a positive impact on their families;who have been sharing the same home space with the workers during the Pandemic. According to the intervention developed by our Occupational Health Office, in alliance with the UniversityÂ´s Faculty of Medicine, we are improving our workers lifestyle, which will have positive impacts on them and their families. It represents such an important aspect that will ameliorate our community public health results.","RincÃ³n Sarmiento, J.

"Remote workersâ€™ perceived health during the COVID-19 pandemic: a mixed methods study of influencing factors","Introduction: For many workers, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an unexpected overnight switch to remote working. Initial studies conducted during the pandemic indicated that remote workers had poorer health levels than those that remained within their workplaces. Few studies have explored the reasons for this. The current study aimed to determine if workers who had the facility to work remotely during the first year of the pandemic had experienced a change in their perceived health levels and their reasons for this. Material and Methods: An online questionnaire that included both open and closed-ended questions was distributed to the workers of 15 organisations within the IT and communications sector in Malta (N = 459). Qualitative data were analysed via Thematic Analysis. Results: 44% reported that their health had not changed during the first year of the pandemic when compared to the previous year, 33% felt their health had regressed, whilst 23% felt it had got better. In terms of those who reported a change, the reasons for this were linked to five themes: General determinants of health, such as physical activity and nutrition;the development of diseases and disorders, including common mental health disorders;work-related determinants of health, such as social contact and the working environment;pandemic-specific factors, including COVID-19 restrictions;and personal factors, such as caring for children. Conclusions: Remote workersâ€™ health was influenced by a multitude of factors that included those related to work, health behaviours, the situation at home and the wider social environment.","Fiorini, L.

"One year facing Covid Systematic evaluation of factors associated with mental distress among hospital workers in Italy","Introduction: Covid-19 pandemic is a severe challenge for healthcare workers (HCW) mental health. Several studies reported frequent adverse psychological outcomes in HCW. To identify risk factors of psychological impairment (PsI), we systematically examine workers in a University Hospital in Milan (Italy), using psychometric scales in the context of the occupational health surveillance. Methods: We enrolled 990 HCW (Jul20-Jul21), whose psychological wellbeing was screened by a 1st level questionnaire collecting individual/occupational data, personal/familiar/occupational Covid exposure, general psychological discomfort (GHQ-12), post-traumatic stress symptoms (IES-R), anxiety (GAD-7). HCW showing PsI (i.e. &gt; cut-off in at least one among GAD-7, IES-r, GHQ-12) have been further investigated by a 2nd level questionnaire (psycho-diagnostic) composed by PHQ-9, DES-II and SCL-90. Results: 316 workers (32%) showed sign of PsI at the 1st screening. Women, nurses, younger workers, subjects working in Covid area and having an infected family member showed significantly higher PsI risk. PsI prevalence was strongly associated to the pandemic time trends but sensibly decreased after Jan 21, when HCW received vaccination. Only a proportion of subjects with PsI, presented clinically relevant symptoms (2nd level screening). Those symptoms werenâ€™t associated to working in Covid area, with Covid infection in family, with pandemic waves or workersâ€™ vaccination. Conclusions: To evaluate psychological wellbeing of HCW constitutes a unique condition to detect occupational, and non-occupational risk factors for PsI in high stress contexts.","Comotti, A.; Fattori, A.; Riboldi, L.; Colombo, E.; Brambilla, P.; Bonzini, M.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shaw.2021.12.1338","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Safety and Health at Work; 13:S187-S188, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-18","",27125,""
"Who is most vulnerable to psychological distress following working from home? A national survey in US employees during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated broad and extensive changes in the way people live and work, especially regarding working from home rather than commuting to a public workplace. While the general subject of working from home has recently drawn increased attention as a research focus, few studies have assessed which demographic subgroups may be more vulnerable to the potential mental health effects of working from home. Material and Methods: Data were from the Health, Ethnicity, and Pandemic Study (HEAP), a national survey conducted in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic in October 2020. The effects of working from home on psychological distress in 1,577 workers were examined via logistic regression, and stratified analyses were conducted to identify vulnerable subgroups. This analytic research project was reviewed and approved for exemption by the University of California, Los Angeles Institutional Review Board. Results: After adjustment for covariates, compared to workers who were not working from home, those who were working from home had higher odds of psychological distress (OR and 95% CI = 2.74 [1.49, 5.04]). Two subgroups, i.e., younger workers (&lt;45 years) and women were identified to be associated with elevated psychological distress (ORs and 95% CIs were 3.23 [1.82, 5.76] and 3.70 [1.64, 8.34], respectively). Conclusions: Working from home is associated with psychological distress, and these associations are stronger in younger workers and in women. These results have implications for workersâ€™ mental health in the overall transition towards working from home in the COVID-19 pandemic era.","Matthews, T.; Li, J.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shaw.2021.12.1332","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Safety and Health at Work; 13:S186, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-18","",27126,""
"The mental wellbeing of Belgian workers during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction: Measures, such as teleworking and social distancing, strongly affected employees' work and private life during the COVID-19 pandemic. Employees were confronted with reduced social contacts and a challenged work-life balance. We aimed to explore evolutions in psychological experiences, job-resources and mental well-being of employees during the first wave. Material and methods: In a prospective cohort study conducted in a heterogeneous sample, psychological experiences (e.g. job insecurity), job-resources (e.g. managerial support), and well-being indicators (e.g. anxiety and depressive feelings) were addressed. Four online surveys, with a time lag of four weeks, were performed during the first lockdown (T1-T2: March-April 2020) and the first relaxations of the measures (T3-T4: May-June 2020). Results: 1111 out of 9300 employees (12%) completed all questionnaires. Job insecurity remained stable over time (+/-4.5%). Feelings of loneliness decreased, with a large decline at T4 (T1: 9.1%, T2: 8.8%, T3:8.9%, T4: 4.6%).

"Employeesâ€™ worry about workplace measures against COVID-19 and the onset of major depressive episode: A 13-month prospective study of full-time employees","Background: This 13-month prospective study aimed to investigate the impact of employeesâ€™ worry about workplace measures against COVID-19 on the onset of major depressive episode (MDE) during repeated COVID-19 outbreaks in Japan. Methods: Data were collected by using online questionnaires from full-time employees at baseline (May 2020) and the 7th survey (June 2021). The onset of MDE during the follow-up was retrospectively measured at the 7th survey, with a self-report scale developed based on the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.): according to the DSM-IV/DSM-5 criteria. Participants were asked to report the number of workplace measures against COVID-19 in their companies/organizations and their worry about these measures. Multiple logistic regression was conducted of MDE on the number of workplace measures and worry about these, adjusting for demographic and work-related covariates and psychological distress at baseline. Results: Among 968 respondents employed in May 2020, 827 completed the 7th survey in June 2021 (80%). We excluded 75 respondents who reported they had MDE in May 2020 or earlier. Worry about workplace measures was significantly associated with the onset of MDE after adjusting for the covariates (OR, 2.18;95%CI, 1.12-4.25, p=0.022). No significant association was found between the number of the workplace measures and the onset of MDE. Conclusions: Worrying about insufficient workplace measures taken by company/organization may be a risk factor for the onset of MDE among full-time employees during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Kawakami, N.; Sasaki, N.; Asaoka, H.; Kuroda, R.; Tsuno, K.; Imamura, K.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shaw.2021.12.1322","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Safety and Health at Work; 13:S182-S183, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-18","",27129,""
"Psychological stress of teachers during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic - Results of a nationwide survey in Germany","Introduction: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic fundamentally changed school life as well as the professional life of teachers (TE). For example, organizational processes changed (e.g., increase in workload), pedagogical challenges emerged (e.g., distance learning) and hygiene plans had to be implemented and realized. The leading question was: did psychological stress in TE increase during the pandemic? If so, what sociodemographic and work-related variables were associated with this stress? Material and Methods: TE throughout Germany were surveyed online in March 2021. Data on psychological stress and strains were assessed using established (e.g., PHQ-4) and specially developed (e.g., corona-associated anxiety) instruments. After data cleaning, 31,090 participants were included in the analysis. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the relationship between psychological stress (e.g., depressiveness) and sociodemographic (e.g., gender) and work-related variables (e.g., work schedule). Results: A significant increase in likely stress induced psychological symptoms was found compared to pre SARS-CoV-2 pandemic samples. Analyses are currently in progress. Results will be presented at the ICOH conference in 2022. Conclusions: The observed increase in psychological stress of TE during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic represents a call for interventions especially for highly stressed subgroups of TE. These stress reactions in TE have to be interpreted against the background of a likewise increased mental stress in the general population and their relative changes have to be identified in order to provide demand-oriented help.","Koestner, C.; Beutel, T.; Eggert, V.; Kalo, K.; Theresa, D.; Letzel, S.; Dietz, P.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shaw.2021.12.1311","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Safety and Health at Work; 13:S179, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-18","",27130,""
"New emergent risks from Home Working in Pandemic Time â€“ Editing of guideline","Introduction: The Covid-19 pandemic has deeply altered social and working environments in several ways influencing the mental health of citizens and workers.It is evident that this outbreak produced changes in the workplaces and in the way to perform work activities:â€œHome Workingâ€. Workers had to face with a new challenging working scenario;it has been demonstrated that work environment, work organization, and work-related behaviors are factors capable of influencing psycological well-being of workers. There is an increased risk from sedentary work as psycological distress, muskoloskeletal disorders.Studies found several occupational factors as being able to influence workersâ€™ mental health outcomes in the COVID-19 pandemic scenario linked to the increasingly widespred of Home Working as a way to cope the Sars-Cov-2 spread off. Material and methods: In spite of epidemiologic evidences there arenâ€™t any specific guidelines and regulations to prevent and regulate new emergent risks from â€œHome Working"".Scientific articles have been consulted to evaluated â€œHome workingâ€ emergent risks and european legislations have been compared (in Italy the low n.81/2017).

"Impact on Occupational Health by Teleworking during the Coronavirus disease (Covid 19) Pandemic","Introduction: To counteract the spread of COVID, many companies opted for teleworking and thus reduce the number of people exposed. Knowing and regulating its implications is necessary for the health of the working population. Material and Method: a prospective descriptive study was conducted from May to August 2021, through an online questionnaire, which was answered regardless of the line of work, by 202 workers in several companies in Guatemala, who were doing at least one day of teleworking. The questionnaire with 21 questions evaluated work, personal and family aspects, implications for physical and mental health;as well as economic Results: hours of workers were extended in 80%. 27% up to 3 to 4 hours outside the usual, even 83% reported work activity during weekends, 88% having message / call activities outside the regular hours. Around 40% did not have a suitable table and chair for teleworking, which led to 96% reporting at least some physical symptoms, such as neck pain, eye fatigue and back pain. Conclusions: half of the respondents indicated that they were prepared to telecommute, but the same number reported personal life problems with noise, lighting, and temperature, which led to eating and sleeping disorders, and physical conditions. Workers had increases electricity and internet expenses, making 50% of the participants an investment of $50. Although, 81% indicated they agree that teleworking be implemented, 96% consider that it should be regulated.","Arrivillaga, A.; Garcia, W.; Gramajo, G.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shaw.2021.12.1292","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Safety and Health at Work; 13:S173, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-18","",27132,""
"A longitudinal study of frontline health care workers during the pandemic","Introduction: Occupational stressors have continuously varied throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Only a prospective study can fully describe the phenomenon. Material and Methods: A one-year longitudinal study was performed in correspondence with the first three pandemic waves from April 2020 to June 2021 in the intensivists of a COVID-19 hub hospital. Changes in work activity due to the pandemic were measured together with the perception of organizational justice, occupational stress, sleep quality, anxiety, depression, burnout, job satisfaction, happiness, and intention to quit. The participation rate was over 60% in each of the three surveys. The Catholic University Ethics Committee had approved the study (ID 3292). Results: The various pandemic waves have placed different stressors and generated corresponding reactions in the workers. After the 3rd wave, 59.2% reported at least one unprotected exposure to COVID-19 patients and 19.2% had contracted the infection. Confidence in safety measures was low and occupational stressors (excessive workload, isolation, compassion fatigue, lack of time for meditation and physical activity) were present. Consequently, distress (73%), sleep problems (28%), anxiety (25%), and depression rate (64%) remained unacceptably high. Conclusions: Clearly, the situation illustrated in our study calls for preventive and supportive action. Preventive interventions are difficult to implement but cannot be postponed. Participatory involvement in safety procedures, increased intangible rewards, increased attention to meditation and sleep are recommended.","Magnavita, N.; Soave, P.

"Association between workplace bullying and mental health in the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction: The pandemic of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has created a challenging environment for workers. This study aimed to clarify the prevalence of workplace bullying during the pandemic and its relationship with socioeconomic status (SES) or mental health. Methods: We conducted an online cross-sectional survey of 28,000 general residents from August to September 2020. One item of the Brief Job Stress Questionnaire was used to determine whether the respondents had experienced bullying at work, and those who answered ""Yesâ€ were defined as the exposure group. Severe psychological distress (SPD) was measured by K6 (&gt;=13) and suicidal ideation was measured by one item. Gender, age, education, marital status, household income, employment status, industry, office size, job characteristics, and hours worked per week in the past month were measured as individual and occupational characteristics, including SES. Results: The prevalence of workplace bullying (14.9%) was high among males, those without a spouse, those with the lowest annual household income, and corporate executives/regular employees. The risk of SPD was 3.7 times higher and the risk of suicidal ideation was 2.5 times higher in the group exposed to workplace bullying than the non-exposed group (logistic regression analysis, after adjusting all of the individual and occupational characteristics). Conclusions: The prevalence of workplace bullying was higher than previously reported (6.1%). Although workers with low SES are more likely to experience bullying in general, even workers with high SES also experienced bullying during the pandemic.","Tsuno, K.; Tabuchi, T.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shaw.2021.12.1284","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Safety and Health at Work; 13:S170, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-18","",27134,""
"The impact of death of COVID-19 patients on mental health of healthcare workers: a latent profile analysis of post-traumatic stress symptoms","Introduction. The COVID-19 pandemic crisis significantly impacted workplaces across the world. Healthcare workers (HCWs) had to promptly manage unpredictable daily severe critical patients, caring for severely traumatized patients, and frequent witnessing of death of patients. More recently, many studies highlighted how the large number of deaths and the way patients were dying significantly impacted mental health of HCWs, exposing them to the risk of developing post-traumatic stress (PTS) symptoms. The main purpose of this study was to explore subtypes of HCWs on the levels of PTS symptoms, considering those workers who cared for patients who died of COVID-19. Materials and Methods. An online survey was conducted using LimeSurvey. We applied latent profile analysis (LPA) to identify profiles of PTS symptoms in a sample of Italian HCWs (n=543). LPA including one to six latent profiles were estimated by using MPlus 7 robust maximum-likelihood estimator (MLR). Results. LPA showed a three-latent-profile solution: high-PTS symptoms (high levels of intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal;n=35), moderate-PTS (moderate levels of intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal;n=397), and low-PTS (low levels of intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal;n=111). Conclusions. To our knowledge, no studies have yet examined whether distinct subgroups of PTS symptoms can be identified among HCWs exposed to the death of COVID19 patients. Using person-centered methods for the identification of latent patterns of PTS symptoms may potentially have conceptual, diagnostic, and treatment implications.","Portoghese, I.; Galletta, M.; Campagna, M.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shaw.2021.12.1280","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Safety and Health at Work; 13:S169, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-18","",27135,""
"Worker adaptation behaviours and mental health impacts in Irish workplaces arising from COVID-19 â€“ observations of OSH professionals","Introduction: Workers quickly adapted during the COVID-19 pandemic to comply with updated work arrangements, control measures and policies. Understanding adaptation difficulties/fatigue and mental health issues among workers is crucial for OSH professionals to plan for future emergencies. Materials and Methods: As part of a larger COVID-19 workplace study, 16 two-hour focus groups (4-6 participants each) were conducted with OSH professionals (n=60) in Ireland, covering four predetermined themes (organisational preparedness;organisational impacts;worker adaptation behaviour;and the future of OSH post-pandemic). Thematic analysis was conducted using Nvivo. Results: OSH professionals observed many workers rapidly adapted and became involved in organisational COVID-19 outbreak prevention and long-term adaptation, in contrast to some workers that exhibited mental health problems as they struggled to adapt. Adaptation fatigue was observed when staff were sent home to work due to a range of factors: 1) isolation at home 2) no boundary between work and life;and 3) inability to disconnect from negative media coverage. The situation can be alleviated by 1) increasing informal communication to cope with isolation;2) Employee Assistance Programmes;and 3) additional consultation regarding their COVID-19 concerns. Conclusion: Most Irish workplaces focused more on employeesâ€™ physical safety rather than their mental wellbeing. The experiences shared by OSH professionals in this study illustrate their agility and ability to apply their risk management and control skills to any unanticipated public/occupational health crisis that arises.","Chen, Y.; Buggy, C.; Roe, M.; Sripaiboonkij, P.; Drummond, A.; Perrotta, C.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shaw.2021.12.1273","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Safety and Health at Work; 13:S167, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-18","",27136,""
"Work Engagement, Job Demands and Burnout among Croatian Health Care Workers during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic","Introduction: As the world is fighting COVID-19 pandemic, health care workers (HCWs) keep struggling with increased stress at work and consequential mental health disorders. The aim of our study was to assess workplace characteristics and the development of burnout in HCWs during COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: This study was designed, developed and ethically approved by the South East European (SEE) Network on Workers' Health in cooperation with SEE Health Network. During the autumn of 2020, an online anonymous survey was conducted among HCWs in Croatia. A total sample of 300 HCWs answered the Maslach Burnout Inventory, Utrecht Work Engagement Scale and Job Demands and Resources Questionnaires. Results: Hospital nurses made up the majority (68.0%) of participants. The highest level of job demands (3.92Â±0.63) was at physical level: excessive workload at a hospital or unit, time pressure, and lack of staff and supplies. No significant correlations were found between physical job demands and age, gender, work tenure and working hours. The highest significant positive correlation was found between organisational job demands and emotional exhaustion (r=0.455, P&lt;0.001). Emotional job demands moderately and positively correlated with depersonalization (r=0.373, P&lt;0.001). Conclusions: HCWsâ€™ workplaces have significantly changed during the COVID-19 pandemic and become substantially hazardous for mental health. Preventive measures need to be implemented urgently and should be primarily focused on excessive workload reduction with additional emotional support to reduce burnout rates and preserve HCWâ€™s work ability.","Milosevic, M.; Brborovic, H.; Å½aja, R.; Masina, T.; Bislimovska, D.; Stoleski, S.; Mijakoski, D.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shaw.2021.12.1267","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Safety and Health at Work; 13:S165, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-18","",27137,""
"Health Impact and Psychosocial Perceptions of SARS-CoV-2 exposure among French hospital workers: A Cross-Sectional Survey","Introduction: In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had an important effect on healthcare systems, including their healthcare workers (HCW). Studies on HCW well-being and mental health have regularly reported problems associated with their occupational activities during epidemics. The aim of this study is to describe the mental health impact and psychosocial perception of hospital workers one year after the first peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in France. Methods: The validated SATIN questionnaire was used to collect data on health and psychosocial factors. It was sent and self-administered online in July 2021. In a multinomial regression model we included covariates: HCW status, age, gender, frontline worker, SARS-CoV-2 status. Results: Data from a total of 830 participants were included (64% were HCW). We found that worries about infection for oneself is a risk factor for negative perception of global health (OR 1,5 95% CI [1,029-2,199]), work demand (OR 1,8 [1,2-2,5]), work environment (OR 1,8 [1,3-2,5]), organizational context (OR 1,9 [1,1-3,3]), for psychosomatic symptoms (OR 2,1 CI [1,1-3,9]) and stress (OR 1,8 [2,1-1,3]). Conclusion: We have shown that uncertainty about SARS-CoV-2 infection has an high mental health impact in hospitalâ€™ workers.

"Cabin fever syndrome: the emerging indoor environment quality related problems during lockdown in the pandemic era","Introduction: Cabin Fever Syndrome(CFS) describes a group of mental health symptoms that people may experience when they are confined over weeks in their residence for extended periods, such as the lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, Indoor Environment Quality(IEQ) may also affect psychological health problems. Therefore, the hypothesis of this study is that IEQ problems may be related to the occurrence of CFS. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 360 full-time working-from-home workers during lockdown in Bangkok, who were selected via the occupational health(OH) of the work from home project. The data was obtained by a self-administrated online questionnaire. The demographic data and the eight self-perceived IEQ problems, the occurrence of CFS and coping methods were analyzed. Results: CFS was commonly and significantly found among younger people, but there were no differences in terms of gender, education, personality type and accommodation type. The most common IEQ-related problem was an inappropriate temperature. The perception of IEQ problems was risky in terms of CFS occurrence with p&lt; 0.05. This study also found the dose-response between a number of IEQ problems and CFS with p for trend &lt;0.001, but did not identify the specific association with any IEQ problems. There were various coping activities that could decrease CFS, but only their time management was significant at p&lt; 0.05. Conclusions: IEQ problems may be an important factor that may be related to occurrences of CFS. OH providers should be concerned and give advice to resolve this problem in terms of mental health well-being.","Ekpanyaskul, C.; Padungtod, C.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shaw.2021.12.1176","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Safety and Health at Work; 13:S136, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-18","",27139,""
"Post COVID Syndrome in patients with COVID -19 : A Cross-Sectional study","Background: Long COVID is defined as the persistence of symptoms beyond 1 to 3 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. To better understand the long-term course and etiology of symptoms we analysed data of COVID-19 patients post discharge prospectively. Methods: A home care cell monitored COVID-19 patients post discharge. A paramedical staff interviewed the patient using the pretested questionnaire and refer the patient to doctor if required. The doctor spoke with these select cases and offered them treatment, counselling, referral to consultant/ hospital as per the need. Results: We followed up with 4354 (2724 employees and 1630 dependents) patients for 3 months. 592 (13%) patients were hospitalized for COVID and others were under home isolation. 4108 (94%) patients did not have any symptoms post COVID and 239 (6%) were known to have either one or more post COVID symptoms. For 153 (64%) patients symptoms lasted for more than a month post discharge and 86 (36%) patients were symptomatic for more than 2 months post discharge. The most common symptoms identified were fatigue and weakness (69%), dry cough (39%) body ache (31%), fever (23%) shortness of breath (15%) etc. Interpretation: Long COVID symptoms can persist for 1- 3months after recovery, this may lead to long absenteeism and may reduce productivity and quality of life significantly. Post COVID syndrome can also have an adverse effect on the mental health of an individual. Post COVID complications can be severe leading to hospitalization and disability.

"Participatory approach and tools for stress reduction in Japan","Participatory workplace environment improvement programs have been used for applying multifaceted measures such as improvement of work procedures and working conditions, attainment of a comfortable workplace environment for employees, and promotion of mutual support. These programs have been effective for promoting primary prevention for mental health. In the participatory programs, workers review their workplace using action tools such as good practice photos and action checklists and conduct group discussions in small groups in each workplace. Through these processes, employees reflect on the entire workplace from a comprehensive perspective and propose concrete ideas applying an action-oriented approach. Repetition of group discussions with positive attitude has effectively stimulated communication in the workplace. In other words, the use of action tools and participatory approaches can increase the motivation of employees to improve the workplace environment and promote better workplace atmosphere. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed our lifestyles and workstyles. Daily communication in the workplace has reduced due to promoting secure physical distancing, and adaptation to new ICT technologies is needed. In this paper, current methods for developing participatory workplace environment improvement programs incorporating ICT technology as an effective approach for the promotion of primary prevention for mental health in the workplace with and after COVID-19 are discussed. It is important to advance practical methods for reducing stress at work that can be applied to the new-normal working life.","Yoshikawa, E.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shaw.2021.12.1002","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Safety and Health at Work; 13:S83, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-18","",27141,""
"Working in times of Covid-19 psychosocial risks and emotional impact on health centers staff","Introduction: The COVID-19 crisis will have an undeniable impact on the populationÂ´s emotional health. The present study aims to shed light to the psychosocial impact on the Spanish health centres workers during the first and second wave of COVID-19 and possible preventive measures to minimize it. Materials and Methods: Literature review (Pubmed, SCOPUS and Cochrane Library Plus);statistical analysis of the 2019 National Labour Force Survey;41 semi-structured interviews. Results: The review shows that the group most at risk is made of women, nurses or low qualified professionals, aged between 20-30 years, work experience &lt;5 years and without previous crisis training. Working in first line impact on mental health leads to a higher prevalence of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. There are several preventive interventions to be implemented, including those based on peer support and resilience training. The semi-structured interviews confirmed consequences compatible with bibliographic findings and allowed to deepen into the knowledge of the sectorÂ´s preventive system. Conclusions: Working in health centres during the pandemic gives rise to psychosocial risks that require a specialized approach. Exposure to these risks at the workplace can lead to negative effects on people's physical and mental health so that preventive measures are required. Mental health surveillance is key for an early detection and addressing the damage caused by the pandemic.

"Risk analysis of Covid-19 in the workplace: practical approaches by activity sector in Italy","Introduction: Italy was the first among western countries to face the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. The progressive adoption of several containing measures by the Government during the first lockdown period from March 2020, encompassed the temporary suspension of non-essential business activities, resulting in a reduction of about 75% of workers present in their workplaces (including remote workers). Materials and Methods: INAIL developed a methodology for assessing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the workplace to support the Government for a safe reactivation of businesses evaluating the impact of the modular reopening of work activities after the first lockdown period. The average risk classes have been associated to the number of employees by sector to take into account the potential impact on the mobility due to the commuting. Results: Specific protocols for reopening activities have been developed for many sectors;these included administrative, preventive and protective measures to manage the risk in the workplace and mitigate the impacts for the community at large. Practical recommendations were allowed for public transport, manufacturing, meat processing and cutting plants, construction, schools, shopping malls and retail shops, catering services, seaside facilities and personal care services. Conclusions: The proposed methodological framework has been adopted by the Italian Government to guide the prevention strategies and address the prioritization of the vaccination campaign in workplaces, with the final aim to contribute to the fastest achievement of the whole population immunity from Covid-19.","Boccuni, F.; Buresti, G.; Gagliardi, D.; Rondinone, B.

"The European policy context for the management of psychosocial risks at work","Introduction: Policy plays an important role in fostering good practice for the prevention of occupational risks. One of the most challenging areas to address in recent years has been psychosocial risks at work which is also recognised as a key priority in the future of work. This presentation will present key policy development in relation to psychosocial risks and mental health in Europe. Materials and Methods: A review of hard and soft law approaches will be presented with special focus on recent developments aimed at addressing the changing context of work. Results. Policy approaches have become more diversified over the past years and with the increased involvement of several stakeholders in the policy making process. A recent example of a soft law approach aiming to address the changing nature of work is the European Social partner agreement on digitalisation (2020). However, the acceleration of trends in working life with the Covid-19 pandemic have resulted in important gaps that need to be addressed in the future. Conclusions: Policy making needs to become more agile in order to keep at pace with wider technological developments and workforce diversity that have resulted in a more complex landscape in the world of work. There are challenges but also opportunities that need to be urgently considered and addressed in order to engage organisations in good practices going forward.","Leka, S.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shaw.2021.12.928","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Safety and Health at Work; 13:S63, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-18","",27144,""
"Prevention of mental health problems in healthcare workers, from a randomized controlled trial to the implementation in workplaces","Introduction: Healthcare workers have a high risk of developing mental health problems which in turn impact the quality of care provided by them. A workers' health surveillance module targeting the mental health of health care workers was found to improve work functioning and cost-effective from an employersâ€™ perspective. This study was conducted to optimise and evaluate the implementation of the module. Materials and Methods: A pilot implementation in four healthcare organisations was planned, including a context analysis, development of a tailored screening and intervention protocol, training of occupational health professionals, and a helpdesk. The evaluation followed the RE-AIM model, assessing the Reach, Effect, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance of the workersâ€™ health surveillance model. Results: Of the fifteen organisation interested, a start date for the implementation was planned with only two. After the start of the Covid pandemic, these organisations withdrew from the project. We changed the aim of the project and assessed needs, barriers and facilitators for preventive programs aiming to improve the mental health of healthcare workers. Based on literature review, interviews and questionnaires, we developed a practical with implementation advice. Advice for employers included i) embed individual interventions in programs targeting the organisational level, ii) train supervisors, and iii) help workers navigate through the range of available preventive interventions. Conclusions: We were unable to implement workersâ€™ health surveillance to improve the mental health of healthcare workers.","Nieuwenhuijsen, K.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shaw.2021.12.926","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Safety and Health at Work; 13:S63, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-18","",27145,""
"Health conditions of the most vulnerable female workers and their impact on health systems: Pandemic in South Africa","On March 5th, 2020, the first COVID-19 case was diagnosed in South Africa and the President declared a National State of Disaster. Almost two years later, this State of Disaster persists. More than 2.9 million cases of COVID-19 and 87780 fatalities have been recorded. Most women workers are in vulnerable employment as domestic help, traders in the informal economy, and small-scale agriculture with no employment contracts or health insurance cover. Women in formal sector work in the services / retail and healthcare, dealing with the vulnerability of their employment and those infected with COVID-19, with the clinical sequelae. Women accounted for more than 55% of the total burden of COVID-19 infections while 82% of infections in healthcare workers were in women. Women reported more anxiety and depressive symptoms post-infection than men, experiencing stress with a reduction of income and caring for ill family members and taking care of children because schools were closed. There was an increase in gender violence reports. Women in the informal sector experienced reduction earnings by 70%;female healthcare workers experienced longer working hours, anguish and burnout. Regulations were implemented to reduce the risk of COVID-19 workplace transmission and identify vulnerable workers. Infections acquired in the workplace were declared compensable. Vaccination roll-out included pregnant and nursing women. In addition, there were financial incentives, but only for formal work. Despite these initiatives, long-term policies aimed at socioeconomic protection and employment creation that focus on women workers are required.","Naidoo, S.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shaw.2021.12.921","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Safety and Health at Work; 13:S61-S62, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-18","",27146,""
"Migrant Workers and Covid-19","Migrant workers, including internal migrants who move from rural to urban areas searching for employment, face multiple barriers in accessing health and other services, in particular occupational health. The Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the need for coordinated responses by countries and regions that include pandemic preparedness, public health interventions, lockdowns, economic support (food relief, etc) and vaccinations. Disease transmission controls and restrictions due to stringent border management, vaccination certificates and testing have hit migrant workers hard. The health, economic needs and mobility of migrants due to the pandemic may be overlooked in the overall Covid-19 response. The social and working conditions of migrants make them vulnerable to Covid-19. The decline in remittances and lack of employment has negative consequences for their families and communities. Interventions, with Covid-19 messaging appropriately to migrant worker needs, access to health services including vaccinations, and accommodation and food security assistance are important. Mental health needs are crucial due to their precarious work, living conditions and lack of family support. Trade unions and large employers may support workers through workplace Covid-19 interventions. Migrant workers in SMEs and domestic workers are at risk of unemployment due to their employers becoming unemployed or transmission risk fears. Multilateral instruments to protect migrant worker rights should be incorporated into country responses to Covid-19 and future epidemics and disasters to save lives and livelihoods including those of migrant workers.","Kistnasamy, B.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shaw.2021.12.892","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Safety and Health at Work; 13:S53, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-18","",27147,""
"Neurophysiology of sleep in workers' health and safety during Covid19 pandemic","Introduction: Sleep problems appear to have been common and associated with higher levels of psychological distress. Sleep quality, however, has been mainly assessed by the use of self-reported measures, thus limiting clinical usefulness. We review the literature about the sleep quality of workers supported by objective neurophysiological tools, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: We conducted a systematic search of the PubMed database through October 27, 2021, including terms Covid-19, sleep, workers, neurophysiology, polysomnography and actigraphy. Results: A total of 13 studies were included. Out of these, only two studies evaluated sleep problems in workers (Healthcare professionals) with objective neurophysiological tools such as actigraphic evaluation. About 35% of healthcare workers were suffering from sleep disturbances having a sleep efficiency value less than 90% and high PSQI scores with a significant negative correlation between SE and PSQI and a trend of a negative association between SE and age. No other job categories were evaluated. Conclusions: During the lockdown, increases in sleep problems are associated with sense of time and are more pronounced in individuals with higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. People who isolated at home (smart-working) reported significantly earlier sleep onset and wake-up times than actigraphy-defined, tending to overestimate their specific sleep times. It is of utmost relevance to assess sleep by objective measures to set appropriate preventive strategies treating sleep problems, thus also obtaining reduced psychological distress.","Garbarina, S.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shaw.2021.12.759","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Safety and Health at Work; 13:S18, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-18","",27148,""
"Learnings from the MENTUPP Project: The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Mental Health of SME Employees","Introduction: MENTUPP is a multi-level intervention aimed at promoting mental wellbeing in the workplace, addressing clinical and non-clinical mental health issues and reducing stigma in SMEs. Within the context of MENTUPP, a study has been conducted to explore the impacts of COVID-19 on the mental health of SME employees. Materials and Methods: A researcher-designed, semi-structured, online survey was completed anonymously by key stakeholders across nine countries in Europe and Australia. Key stakeholders (N=65) included representatives from academia, SMEs, occupational health associations, labour and advocacy groups, and representatives from the construction, health and information technology sectors. They were from countries with established mental health provisions (Central and Western Europe) and countries with lower resources (Central and Eastern Europe). Results: An overview of the MENTUPP project will be provided, followed by outcomes of the online survey. Stakeholders across different countries and sectors agreed that COVID-19 pandemic has increased clinical and non-clinical mental health issues in SMEs. Experts in Central and Western Europe reported that the capacity of workplaces to promote wellbeing decreased due to COVID-19, and experts from Eastern and Central Europe thought that this did not change much. Mental health stigma has reportedly remained the same, however, mental health awareness may have increased. Conclusions: This study observed that the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted employee mental health indicating the timeliness to introduce a targeted intervention, such as MENTUPP.","Arensman, E.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shaw.2021.12.742","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Safety and Health at Work; 13:S13-S14, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-18","",27149,""
"Quality assurance approach for basic occupational health services provided by Primary Care Units (PCUs) in Thailand, an example for others?","Introduction: Total of 9,815 PCUs in Thailand are as a key mechanism for providing health services for all because their locations are close to the community. Integration of basic occupational health services (BOHS) in this setting is very crucial because high risk community workers can access services easily. Thailand has launched BOHS program in PCUs since 2008. Ten years later, the quality control strategy using the OHS practices standards tool was established. Such standards are divided into 5 components and 25 items including 1) organizational set up, human resources, plans, evaluation and occupational health network collaboration, 2) OHS for health workers of PCUs, 3) pro-active OHS for community workers, 4) in-house OHS and 5) integration of environmental health services (EHS). This work was undertaken to explore the OHS quality control program among PCUs following such standards. Material and Method: The staff of the Regional Office of Disease Prevention and Control (RDDC), and the staff of the Provincial Public Health Office have been trained to audit PCUs. Additionally, the basic OH course has been developed and trained PCUsâ€™ staff. The evaluation system using the web-based has been established since 2019 and the instruction manual for all users have been documented as well. The PCUsâ€™ staff conducted self-assessment and RDDC staff approved their results through such platform. The assessment criteria of the standards have been classified into 4 levels including starting level, good level, very good level and excellent level depending on the performance of PCUs practices. Results: During 2018-2021, 2,456 PCUs (25.7%) participated in the project and conducted self-assessment following OHS standards. Of them, 1,529/ (62.3%) PCUs could pass the criteria approved by the external auditor. Their levels were starting, good, very good and excellent amounting to 262 (17.1%), 585 (38.3%), 321 (21.0%),and 361 (23.6%) respectively. E-learning basic OH curriculum has been developed after gathering training need information from PCUsâ€™ staff. There were 12 study hours and 7 subjects packed in the course including OH policy, walkthrough-survey, risk assessment and control, common occupational diseases (OD), practical BOHS, OD record and related OH laws. This course will plan to begin next year (2022). Conclusions: Participated PCUs could provide BOHS following such criteria. However, they had some limitations, such as 1) the capacity of PCUsâ€™ staff for early diagnosis of OD and EHS provision were limited, 2) common hazards related to health problems have been identified, but control measure still need to be strengthened, Currently, the web-based audit platform was very helpful because of COVID-19 outbreak. Capacity building, training and supervision were the main activities for strengthening the quality assurance system. Recommendations: The future development should be addressed in 4 issues as follow: 1) specification of OHS interventions in the benefit package of universal coverage scheme to support operational finance, 2) training PCUsâ€™ staff to enhance competency, 3) OHS quality continuous development and 4) OHS legislation enforcement.","Untimanon, O.; Boonmeephong, K.; Laplue, A.; Sukanan, K.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shaw.2021.12.737","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Safety and Health at Work; 13:S12, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-18","",27150,""
"Preventing overwork related disorders (â€œKaroshiâ€)","In 2014, the Japanese government established the Karoshi Prevention Measures Promotion Law to take preventive measures against the Karoshi problems. According to the law, Karoshi etc. is defined as: - death due to cerebrovascular disease / heart disease due to excessive workload - death from suicide due to mental illness due to strong psychological burden at work - although not fatal, these cerebrovascular diseases, heart diseases, and mental disorders. Evidence has accumulated showing long working hours leads to heart diseases and stroke. A systematic review conducted as a WHO/ILO project confirms those working at least 55 hours a week are at higher risk of dying from heart disease and stroke. Globally, 488 million people worked excessively long hours, leading to 745,000 heart disease and stroke deaths in 2016 (Pega et al., 2021). Association between long working hours and depression is not evident (Rugulies et al., 2021), but a systematic review indicates that long working hours were associated with depressive symptoms and the estimated risk was larger among Asian countries where long working hours are more prevalent compared with other regions (Virtanen et al., 2018). Overall association of long working hours with adverse health outcomes is modest (Ervasti et al., 2021). However, as the prevalence of long working hours is so large that the impact on health problems cannot be ignored (Li and Siegrist, 2021). During the pandemic of COVID-19, overwork of essential workers has become a big issue. Working from home (tele-working) is also considered to lead to long working hours. Long working hours may lead to morbidity through both exposure of adverse working conditions and loss of necessary leisure time activities. The adverse working conditions include hazardous factors including psychosocial stress. Activities lost due to long working hours are healthy behaviours such as physical activities and sleep. The most important function during leisure time is to provide the time for recovery. Long working hours have been shown to affect both quantity and quality of sleep: which prevent recovery and influence hormonal regulations. Based on the Karoshi Prevention Measures Promotion Law, the Japanese Cabinet decided ""Outline of Measures to Prevent Death from Overwork"" in 2018 and revised it in 2021. The outline stipulates various measures to prevent Karoshi by taking into consideration anticipated work-style changes that going with the spread of the new coronavirus disease. According to this new outline, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan will continue to work on the measures toward the realization of â€œzero Karoshiâ€ society in cooperation with related ministries and agencies. Karoshi cannot be prevented by reducing working hours alone. Research pointed out that the impact of long working hours on health problems was larger among workers of lower socioeconomic status than those of higher socioeconomic status (Li et al., 2020). Business practices and general consumption behaviours may also be related to working hours. To prevent Karoshi, continuous and multi-faceted efforts, including increased public understanding, are necessary.","Tsutsumi, A.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shaw.2021.12.735","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Safety and Health at Work; 13:S11-S12, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-18","",27151,""

"Occupational health for migrant workers in Spain, why does it matter?","Spain is the fourth country with the largest number of immigrants in Europe, resulting in a large proportion of migrant workers. Women constitute 48% of international migrants who suffer poor working conditions linked to the positions they mainly occupy within certain fields such as the domestic sector and caregiving services. In this connection, Spain is the second country in Europe with the highest number of domestic workers (619,600 people). In addition, 95% of caregivers in Spain are Latin American women. It also should be noted that during the COVID-19 pandemic, women have been the most affected, making up 54.8% of the total infected. They have been frequently working under unsafe and hazardous OHS conditions, often without the necessary personal protective equipment (PPE) and many being exposed to significant risks due to their direct personal contact with patients with COVID-19. To date, many researchers have examined the working conditions of immigrants in Spain who are known to have to deal with adverse working conditions. The main objective of this research is to investigate the patterns of work and working conditions of immigrants living in Spain and to understand how these factors may affect their health. Many of our results have showed: In general, four employment sectors were most commonly occupied by these immigrants, including caregiving and food service for women and agriculture and construction for men. Most immigrants were from Latin America, either unemployed or working part-time jobs, and not hired under an employment contract. Most worked in low-qualified jobs, and were exposed to occupational hazards such as falls from heights, manual handling of materials, and psychological strain. The lack of training on occupational risk prevention and labour rights were related to a low identification of work-related situations leading to a negative impact on the health of immigrants. In caregiving sector (mainly occupied by women) the main risks identified were biological risks, physical attacks, falls, wounds and musculoskeletal complaints related to handling patients and carrying out household chores. Most of them had not taken an occupational health test and did not report accidents occurring in the workplace for fear of losing their jobs. The main health problems were related to physical and mental health (such as musculoskeletal diseases and stress). During the current COVID 19 pandemic, women have been the main providers of care and domestic work in the homes where they have been confined, renouncing their own freedom of movement and social interaction. They have been responsible of all the domestic work, resulting in non-stop working days during the lockdown.","de Diego-Cordero, R.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shaw.2021.12.720","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Safety and Health at Work; 13:S6, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-18","",27153,""
"Worker health and safety in a changing climate","Scientific reports on the advance of climate change signal â€˜code red for humanityâ€™ according to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. The threats to the health and well-being of workers mirror those faced by the population at large, but with important differences. In some sectors, such as maintenance of utilities and emergency services, exposures to climate hazards are not discretionary. Those paid by piece work may be forced, under extreme conditions, to risk personal well-being in order to protect incomes. Given their long-term connections with land and place, farmers are especially susceptible to mental health issues caused by environmental degradation. Workers will also be affected in particular ways by steps taken to prevent climate change: closure of industries that rely on fossil fuels will expose millions of workers to transitions and disruptions that may have significant effects on health, if poorly managed. The future is challenging. It is projected the intensity and frequency of heat waves and floods and storms will increase. The structure of human mortality is changing as heat-related causes of mortality and morbidity prevail over conditions that are cold-related. Compounding exposures, such as the conjunction of climate instability and the COVID-19 pandemic, will multiply. In these circumstances it will be necessary to radically strengthen measures to protect health and safety at work.","Woodward, A.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shaw.2021.12.715","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Safety and Health at Work; 13:S4, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-18","",27154,""
"Age differences in the association between loneliness and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic","Loneliness and associated mental health problems are of particular concern during the COVID-19 pandemic due to physical distancing and lockdown restrictions. Loneliness is most common among young adults and women during the pandemic, but it is unclear if the association between loneliness and mental health problems, notably anxiety, is strongest in these groups. The objective of this study was to examine whether the association between loneliness and anxiety differed by age and/or gender during the pandemic. We analyzed data from a multi-wave national online survey of Canadians aged 18+ years from May 2020 to March 2021 (n=7,021). Multivariable modified least-squares regression was used to examine whether the association between loneliness and moderate to severe anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 10+) differed by age and/or gender on the additive scale, controlling for socio-demographic factors, depression, hopefulness, and survey wave. Age significantly moderated the association between loneliness and anxiety symptoms while gender did not. Loneliness was associated with anxiety symptoms for all age groups, but the association was not as strong among those aged 70+ years compared to other age groups. Evidence-based loneliness interventions that target younger adults are needed to mitigate the mental health effects of infectious disease events such as COVID-19.","McDonald, AndrÃ© J.; Wickens, Christine M.; Bondy, Susan J.; Elton-Marshall, Tara, Wells, Samantha, Nigatu, Yeshambel T.; Jankowicz, Damian, Hamilton, Hayley A.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114446","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatry Research;: 114446, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-18","",27155,""
"Racial and Demographic Disparities in Emergency Department Utilization for Mental Health Concerns Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic","This study investigated whether emergency department (ED) visits for mental health concerns increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, taking a health disparities lens. ED encounters from the only academic medical center in Mississippi were extracted from March-December 2019 and 2020, totaling 2842 pediatric (ages 4-17) and 17887 adult (ages 18-89) patients. Visits were coded based on primary ED diagnosis. For adults, there were fewer depression/anxiety ED visits during the pandemic, not moderated by any demographic factor, but no differences for serious mental illness or alcohol/substance use. For youth, there were significantly fewer ED visits for behavior problems during the pandemic among children in the lower socioeconomic status (SES) category;there were no differences for depression/anxiety. Regardless of year, adults in the lower SES category were more likely to visit the ED for mental health, Black adults were less likely to visit the ED for depression/anxiety or alcohol/substance use, and Black children were less likely to visit the ED for behavioral concerns. Results suggest that access to outpatient and telehealth services remains critical for mental health care during the pandemic and underline the importance of race- and SES-related factors in use of the ED for mental health concerns beyond the pandemic.","Penner, Francesca, Rajesh, Aishwarya, Kinney, Kerry L.; Nayfa, Kara L.; Barajas, Kimberly G.; McKenna, Kevin R.; Lim, Crystal S.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114442","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatry Research;: 114442, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-18","",27156,""
"Adverse effects of loneliness but no effect of gaming on mental health in gamers during three UK COVID-19 lockdowns","Current consensus is that poor mental health outcomes are a likely outcome of the multiple stay-at-home mandates (i.e., â€˜lockdownsâ€™) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Such lockdowns are characterised by loneliness, which is known to adversely impact mental health. Other factors, such as video gaming, have previously been associated with positive mental health outcomes. Indeed, evidence suggests that lockdowns led to a substantial increase in the number of people engaging with gaming. Therefore, in the present paper, we investigated the relationship between video gaming, loneliness, and mental health outcomes using online survey measures during three national lockdowns. We found that depression, anxiety, and stress increased from baseline during the first lockdown only, while loneliness increased relative to baseline in all three lockdowns. Time spent gaming had no direct relationship with mental health outcomes, nor was this relationship moderated by loneliness. While lockdown alone did not impact mental health, loneliness during lockdown was consistently associated with poor mental health outcomes. Our results add to the existing body of literature and emphasise the need for targeted public mental health interventions to improve public mental health following the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods: Students who first visited the psychiatric department of the university health care center during the period from April 1, 2016 to March 31, 2019, consecutive patients were the study participants. The period before the brain fatigue campaign is April 1, 2016 to March 31, 2018, and the period during the campaign is April 1, 2018 to March 31, 2019.

Examine age, gender, problem content, GHQ-12 total score, and stigma score as independent variables and use logistic regression analysis to see if campaign interventions affect the time to psychiatric consultation was analyzed. Results&Conclusions: The results of logistic regression analysis using data that met the eligibility and inclusion/exclusion criteria (185 and 189 students, respectively) showed that the proportion of students with DUI (time between the onset of illness and medical examination) of less than 2 weeks during the intervention period was significantly higher than that during the BL period, suggesting that the intervention promotes early medical examination. Although there are limitations such as the lack of a control group, the results suggest that a university-wide campaign may promote earlier medical treatment behavior.","Kei Hirai et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0215-F74-446","20220218","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; help-seeking behavior; mental health; stigma; university student; psychiatry","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-18","",27158,""
