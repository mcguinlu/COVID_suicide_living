"Care Burden of Home Caregivers of Patients with COVID-19","Background and purpose: Caring for patients with COVID-19 at home is mainly the responsibility of the family which leads to high burden of care. The burden of care refers to psychological pain, physical problems, financial and social pressures, disruption of family relationships, feelings of hopelessness, and other negative consequences of care tasks. The aim of this study was to determine the care burden in caregivers of patients with COVID-19 at home. Materials and methods: This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study was carried out in 390 family caregivers of patients with COVID-19 attending medical centers in Gorgan, Iran 2021, using convenience sampling. Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI) was administered which consists of five domains and a score range of 24-120. Data were analyzed in SPSS V18 applying equivalent nonparametric tests. Results: The mean total score for care burden was 52.70Â±17.03 and the mean scores for other subscales were as follows: 14.90Â±6.22 for time dependence=, 10.80Â±4.88 for developmental, 9.60Â±4.36 for physical burden, 7.80Â±2.91 for social burden, and 9.60Â±3.84 for emotional burden. As the age of the caregivers increase, the burden of time dependence increased. Women and caregivers with low educational backgrounds perceived a higher burden of care. There was a significant relationship between the burden of care and patient's economic status and the health status of the caregiver (P&lt;0.05). Conclusion: Family caregivers of patients with COVID-19 at home received a moderate burden of care that could negatively affect their health and wellbeing. Family caregivers need to be supported psychosocially and financially by formal community health systems.

"Anxiety and Depression Symptoms and Associated Factors in Pregnant and Breast Feeding Women During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Rasht, Iran, 2020","Background and purpose: The spread of COVID-19 can cause anxiety and depression and lead to adverse outcomes in perinatal period. This study aimed to evaluate anxiety and depression symptoms and associated factors in pregnant and breast feeding women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and methods: This cross-sectional study included 450 pregnant and breast feeding women in Rasht, Iran during the second and third wave of COVID-19 (June-November 2020). Data were collected using convenience and multi-stage sampling in a teaching hospital and six healthcare centers. Anxiety and depression were evaluated by Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and Patient Health Questionnaire-9, respectively. Descriptive statistics and analytical statistics, including independent t-test, Chi-square test, and logistic regression were used to analyze the data. Results: Generalized anxiety was seen in 16.9% of pregnant women and 10.7% of breast feeding women (P=0.057). Expectant mothers were 6.64 times more likely to have depressive symptoms compared with breast feeding women (ORAdj=6.64, 95% CI: 2.08-21.15). Comorbid anxiety-depressive symptoms were higher in pregnant women than breast feeding women (6.2% vs. 0.9%, P=0.002). Anxiety was found to be significantly associated with an unemployed husband, having chronic diseases, thinking about COVID-19, and high-risk individuals in the family (P&lt;0.05). Also, there was a significant relationship between depression and pregnancy, less educated husband, and high-risk individuals in the family (P&lt; 0.05). Conclusion: In this study, pregnant and breast feeding women showed more anxiety symptoms than depression symptoms during COVID-19. Expectant mothers were more likely to have depressive symptoms than breast feeding women. These results emphasize the importance of mental health monitoring to improve perinatal-care quality during epidemics/social crises.

"Work and Nonwork Contributory Factors to Health Care Workers' Mental Health","In this cross-sectional survey of 828 participants, they report that insufficient personal protective equipment (PPE);experiences of discrimination, violence, and harassment;not receiving family support;experiencing financial strain;and having to isolate because of COVID-19 were each associated with an increased prevalence ratio of probable depression cases. [...]working on COVID-1 9 or intensive care wards is a particular risk factor,1,2 whereas concerns have been raised about differential access to PPE based on one's role, sex, and ethnicity.3 One postulation from Silva et al. is that community health care workers were no longer able to visit community homes, potentially alleviating some work demands and reducing their exposure risk or vulnerability to violence and discrimination. Because ill mental health is a factor in the global challenge to retain health care workers, we need better research, policies, and support to understand, capture, and model these differences. [...]building support is an important resource for health care workers to draw on and to mitigate the detrimental impact that demanding work environments can have on their mental health.5,6 A SYSTEMS PN1 -https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/UhuwM?_a=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%2BgIBToIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDIyMDUxODEyNDIwMTMwMDo5OTI2MzY%3D&_s=%2BTB5DoMLaFgpkVf8XhHojdnxVis%3D ERSPECTIVE ON HEALTH CARE WORKERS' MENTAL HEALTH The six potential pandemic-related contributing factors shift the narrative of health care worker well-being away from only the individual, emphasizing the responsibility of governments and health care leaders. Too often, research on health care workers' well-being has focused on individual factors (such as psychological states and traits) as antecedents to their well-being, neglecting the various other organizational and societal factors they are exposed to.7 Although the lack of PPE and job type are work-related contributing factors to probable cases of depression, the contributing role of family support and financial strain highlights how nonwork factors are also important. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been evident that we can no longer clearly delineate work from our nonwork lives.","Teoh, Kevin R. H. PhD, Vasconcelos, Alina G. PhD, Lima, Eduardo P.

"Working Memory, Attention, and Inhibitory Control in Adolescents with Suicidal Behavior: A Pilot Study","Suicide in people between the ages of 15 and 24 is one of the top three causes of death. The aim of this research is to compare and associate performance in working memory, attention, and inhibitory control with the presence of suicidal behavior in adolescents. Research design was cross-sectional and the convenience sample consisted of 65 adolescents from the city of Temuco, Chile. The instruments used for data collection were: 1) the Okasha Suicidality Scale, 2) span of direct and indirect digits, and 3) the Stroop test. The results show that 49.3% of the adolescents had suicidal ideation. In terms of the groups, an association and significant differences were found in the Stroop test;this occurred specifically in the female sex (p &lt; .05). In the rest of the tasks that measured memory and attention, no differences were observed (p &gt; .05). It is concluded that suicidal behavior is associated with a lower performance in inhibitory control tasks for females.Alternate : El suicidio en personas entre 15 y 24 aÃ±os es una de las tres primeras causas de muerte.

"Illness severity and risk of mental morbidities among patients recovering from COVID-19: a cross-sectional study in the Icelandic population","ObjectiveTo test if patients recovering from COVID-19 are at increased risk of mental morbidities and to what extent such risk is exacerbated by illness severity.DesignPopulation-based cross-sectional study.SettingIceland.ParticipantsA total of 22 861 individuals were recruited through invitations to existing nationwide cohorts and a social media campaign from 24 April to 22 July 2020, of which 373 were patients recovering from COVID-19.Main outcome measuresSymptoms of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire), anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder Scale) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD;modified Primary Care PTSD Screen for DSM-5) above screening thresholds. Adjusting for multiple covariates and comorbidities, multivariable Poisson regression was used to assess the association between COVID-19 severity and mental morbidities.ResultsCompared with individuals without a diagnosis of COVID-19, patients recovering from COVID-19 had increased risk of depression (22.1% vs 16.2%;adjusted relative risk (aRR) 1.48, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.82) and PTSD (19.5% vs 15.6%;aRR 1.38, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.75) but not anxiety (13.1% vs 11.3%;aRR 1.24, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.64). Elevated relative risks were limited to patients recovering from COVID-19 that were 40 years or older and were particularly high among individuals with university education.

Conciliation travail universitaire et famille pendant la pandÃ©mie de la COVID-19","Introduction The shift to remote working/learning to slow transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has had widespread mental health impacts. We aimed to describe how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the mental health of students and faculty within a health sciences faculty at a central Canadian university. Methods Via an online survey, we queried mental health in the first four months of the COVID-19 pandemic quantitatively (scale: 1 (most negative)-100 (most positive)) and qualitatively. Results The sample (n = 110) was predominantly women (faculty 39/59;[66.1%];students 46/50;[92.0%]). Most faculty were married/common law (50/60;[84.8%]) and had children at home (36/60;[60.0%]);the opposite was true for most students. Faculty and students self-reported comparable mental health (40.47Â±24.26 and 37.62Â±26.13;respectively). Amongst women, those with vs. without children at home, reported significantly worse mental health impacts (31.78Â±23.68 vs. 44.29Â±27.98;respectively, p = 0.032). Qualitative themes included: â€œSharing resources,â€ â€œspending money,â€ â€œfew changes,â€ for those without children at home;â€œworking at home can be isolating,â€ including the subtheme, â€œbalancing actâ€: â€œworking in isolation,â€ â€œworking more,â€ for those with children at home.

"Age disparities in mental health during the COVID19 pandemic: The roles of resilience and coping","Background The COVID19 pandemic has caused a mental health crisis worldwide, which may have different age-specific impacts, partly due to age-related differences in resilience and coping. The purposes of this study were to 1) identify the disparities in mental distress, perceived adversities, resilience, and coping during the COVID-19 pandemic among four age groups (18â€“34, 35â€“49, 50â€“64, and 65+);2) assess the age-moderated time effect on mental distress, and 3) estimate the effects of perceived adversities on mental distress as moderated by age, resilience and coping. Methods Data were drawn from a longitudinal survey of a nationally representative sample (nÂ =Â 7830) administered during the pandemic. Weighted mean of mental distress and adversities (perceived loneliness, perceived stress, and perceived risk), resilience, and coping were compared among different age groups. Hierarchical random-effects models were used to assess the moderated effects of adversities on mental distress. Results The youngest age group (18â€“34) reported the highest mental distress at baseline with the mean (standard error) as 2.70 (0.12), which showed an incremental improvement with age (2.27 (0.10), 1.88 (0.08), 1.29 (0.07) for 35â€“49, 50â€“64, and =65 groups respectively). The older age groups reported lower levels of loneliness and perceived stress, higher perceived risk, greater resilience, and more relaxation coping (psÂ &lt;Â .001). Model results showed that mental distress declined over time, and the downward trend was moderated by age group. Perceived adversities, alcohol, and social coping were positively associated with mental distress, whereas resilience and relaxation were negatively associated with it. Resilience and age group moderated the slope of each adversity on mental distress. Conclusions The youngest age group appeared to be most vulnerable during the pandemic. Mental health interventions may provide training to build resilience from everyday adversities for the vulnerable individuals and empower them to achieve personal growth that challenges age boundaries.","Na, Ling, Yang, Lixia, Mezo, Peter, Liu, Rong","https://www.google.com/search?q=Age+disparities+in+mental+health+during+the+COVID19+pandemic:+The+roles+of+resilience+and+coping","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Social science & medicine (1982);2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-27","",31961,""
"Comparison of years of life lost to 1,565 suicides versus 10,650 COVID-19 deaths in 2020 in Sweden: four times more years of life lost per suicide than per COVID-19 death","Background: The burden of disease from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is large;however, suicide affects the population year after year. From a public health perspective, it is important to not neglect contributors to the total burden of disease. The aim of this paper is to compare years of life lost (YLL) to suicide with those lost to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: A nationwide cohort study in 2020, in Sweden. YLL was measured as the sex- and age-specific remaining life expectancy at the time of the personâ€™s death based on the death risks that pertained to the Swedish population in 2019. YLL to suicide was compared to YLL to COVID-19 and presented by sex and age groups. Suicide deaths in 2020 were estimated as the annual average of suicides in 2015â€“2019. Results: Annual average of suicide was 1,565, whereof 1,076 (68.8%) men and 489 (31.2%) women. In 2020, 10,650 persons died of COVID-19, whereof 5,681 (53.3%) men and 4,969 (46.7%) women. Estimated total YLL to suicide and COVID-19 in 2020 was 53,237 and 90,116, respectively. The COVID-19 YLL to suicide YLL ratio in 2020 was 1.69 (90,116/53,237). Men accounted for 67.1% of suicide YLL and of 56.4% of COVID-19 YLL. Those 44 years or younger accounted for 60.3% of suicide YLL and 3.9% of COVID-19 YLL. Those 75 years and older accounted for 2.9% of suicide YLL and 60.9% of COVID-19 YLL. On average, each suicide generates 34 YLL (53,237/1,565), and each COVID-19 death generates 8.5 YLL (90,116/10,650). Conclusions: YLL to suicide affects Sweden year after year, foremost attributable to the younger age groups, whereas YLL to COVID-19 is foremost attributable to the elderly. On average, each suicide generates four times more YLL than a COVID-19 death. Enormous efforts and resources have been put on tackling the pandemic, and without these, the burden would probably have been much larger. However, from a public health perspective, it is important to not neglect other contributors to the total burden of disease where national efforts also may have an impact.","Ljung, Rickard, GrÃ¼newald, Maria, SundstrÃ¶m, Anders, Sundbom, Lena Thunander, Zethelius, BjÃ¶rn","https://www.google.com/search?q=Comparison+of+years+of+life+lost+to+1,565+suicides+versus+10,650+COVID-19+deaths+in+2020+in+Sweden:+four+times+more+years+of+life+lost+per+suicide+than+per+COVID-19+death","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Upsala Journal of Medical Sciences; 127, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-27","",31962,""
"Eating alone and weight change in community-dwelling older adults during the coronavirus pandemic: A longitudinal study","Objectives : It is likely that the number of older adults who eat alone has increased during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Older adults who eat alone tend to experience weight fluctuations. Weight loss and underweight in older adults cause health problems. The study objective was to longitudinally investigate the association between changes in eating alone/together and body weight status in older adults. Research Methods & Procedures : This longitudinal cohort study was conducted in March and October 2020 in Minokamo city, Gifu Prefecture, Japan. Questionnaire data for 1,071 community-dwelling older adults were analyzed. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was performed using changes in eating alone/together as the independent variable and body weight status as the dependent variable. The analysis was adjusted for age, sex, living arrangements, educational level, diseases receiving medical treatment, cognitive status, depression, and instrumental activities of daily living. Missing data were imputed using multiple imputation. Results : The average age of participants was 81.1 years (standard deviationÂ =Â 4.9 years).

"Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase as a Therapeutic Target for Neuropsychiatric Disorders","It has been found that soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH;encoded by the EPHX2 gene) in the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) plays a key role in inflammation, which, in turn, plays a part in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders. Meanwhile, epoxy fatty acids such as epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), epoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (EEQs), and epoxyeicosapentaenoic acids (EDPs) have been found to exert neuroprotective effects in animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders through potent anti-inflammatory actions. Soluble expoxide hydrolase, an enzyme present in all living organisms, metabolizes epoxy fatty acids into the corresponding dihydroxy fatty acids, which are less active than the precursors. In this regard, preclinical findings using sEH inhibitors or Ephx2 knock-out (KO) mice have indicated that the inhibition or deficiency of sEH can have beneficial effects in several models of neuropsychiatric disorders. Thus, this review discusses the current findings of the role of sEH in neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD), and stroke, as well as the potential mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of sEH inhibitors.","Jiajing, Shan, Hashimoto, Kenji","https://www.google.com/search?q=Soluble+Epoxide+Hydrolase+as+a+Therapeutic+Target+for+Neuropsychiatric+Disorders","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Molecular Sciences; 23(9):4951, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-27","",31964,""
"Further Improving Analysis of Date-Based COVID-19 Surveillance Data/Respond","[...]the authors state ""many estimations methods [for infection date] homogenize substantial heterogeneities,"" but they disregard this in their demonstration of recovering infection date in Figure 2: ""infection dates were estimated as symptom onset dates minus a median incubation period. ""1(p2129) Although this is straightforward to calculate, it ignores the ""substantial heterogeneities,"" and leads to invalid conclusions.2 Forthose interested in obtaining infection date, we would suggest deconvolution, which has been applied in infectious disease surveillance for decades,3 and has also been implemented for estimating the reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 during the pandemic.2,4 There is another issue with these data that must be dealt with before making any inferences about the outbreak: outcome misclassification.4,5 Such errors will primarily be underreporting (i.e., suboptimal sensitivity of the surveillance program) through asymptomatic infection orthose symptomatic and unable or unwilling to test, but there may also be issues with diagnostic accuracy, including both false positives and false negatives.

"The Case for Supervised Injection Sites in the United States","[...]the number of annual overdose deaths increased by 37% to more than 96,000 from 2020 to 2021.1,2 Overdose deaths are so high that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has introduced harm reduction initiatives that have historically been controversial: needle exchange programs to slow the spread of bloodborne diseases and provision of fentanyl test strips to help people who inject drugs identify contaminated street drugs.3 However, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services stopped short of supporting supervised injection sites, a harm reduction strategy that has been proven to save lives in other countries.4 Supervised injection sites have been legally operating in Europe, Canada, and Australia since 1986.4 With the 2021 opening of the nation's first supervised injection sites in New York City and a growing movement advocating for expanding them to other U.S. cities, family physicians should be knowledgeable about the potential impacts of these sites.5,6 These facilities are over-seen by health care personnel who provide sterile injection supplies, counseling on safe injection techniques, emergency care in the event of an overdose, primary medical care, and referrals to appropriate social and addiction services.7 The personnel in the facilities are able to offer services to people who would otherwise inject drugs in public spaces.8 Unfortunately, because of legal considerations, the U.S. Justice Department has fought to prevent the opening of supervised injection sites despite evidence that they lower death rates and decrease disease transmission.3 Supervised injection sites improve health outcomes. The American Academy of Family Physicians issued a policy statement supporting these facilities.15 Although federal support is lacking, individual cities and states are leading the efforts to increase harm reduction strategies to prevent overdose deaths. In 2021, Rhode Island became the first state to legalize supervised injection sites, with locations to be decided in 2022.16 Family physicians have several opportunities to promote this needed change, including speaking in support of the sites at town halls, working with local advocacy groups to promote efforts to create the sites, and working with physician organizations such as the American Academy of Family Physicians to develop supportive policies.","Finke, Jorge, Chan, Jie","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Case+for+Supervised+Injection+Sites+in+the+United+States","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: American Family Physician; 105(5):454-455, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-27","",31966,""
"POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER","The new global situation of COVID-19 affects the whole world in all aspects of life including mental health. The study's goal is to detect the relationship between post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and Emotion Regulation (ER) difficulties under the COVID-19 condition. Methods: University students were asked to complete: 1) Emotion Regulation Difficulties Questionnaire (DERS) 2) PTSD Checklist (PCL- 5). 3) Life Events Checklist for DSM-5 (LEC-5). Results: There were 441 students with suspected COVID-19 symptoms out of 1195 students. When compared to students who did not have suspected COVID-19 symptoms, those who did had a greater prevalence of PTSD symptoms (18.2% vs. 4.7%) and DERS (34.5% vs. 23.3%). Additionally, correlation studies demonstrated a significant positive link (Ps&lt; .01) between the PCL, the overall DERS, and all six categories of emotion regulation difficulties. Conclusion: Students with suspected COVID-19 symptoms have more difficulty with emotion regulation and post-traumatic stress disorder than students without such symptoms. This research recommends that during the pandemic, health professionals should implement a suitable psychological intervention for students who exhibit COVID-19 symptoms.","Elbarazi, Amani Safwat","https://www.google.com/search?q=POST-TRAUMATIC+STRESS+DISORDER","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Evidence - Based Psychotherapies; 22(1):87-101, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-27","",31967,""
"Children and youth mental health: not all equal in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic","This article reviews the empirical evidence gathered in the past 2 years on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health for children and youth. Grounded in a social justice framework, this review highlights that all are not equal in the face of the pandemic, and that children, youth and families living in precarious contexts have been impacted most. Practice and policy measures moving forward must take this reality into account to help all children and youth thrive and recover from this unprecedented worldwide crisis. Key points â€¢ The pandemic has had a detrimental impact on children's and youth's mental health.â€¢ Social isolation from peers and significant adults are key factors that have negatively impacted young people's mental health status.â€¢ Research also indicates social disparities have expanded since COVID, and many families have accumulated multiple stressors that are impacting their well-being and functioning.â€¢ Children and youth with pre-existing mental health disorders, living in financially precarious situations, from racialized groups, and/or involved with child protection services experienced lower levels of resilience when faced with the COVID-19 pandemic.â€¢ Practice and policy measures moving forward must take this reality into account to minimize long-term mental health consequences for young people.","Collin-VÃ©zina, Delphine, Fallon, Barbara, Caldwell, Johanna","https://www.google.com/search?q=Children+and+youth+mental+health:+not+all+equal+in+the+face+of+the+COVID-19+pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Reference Module in Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Psychology;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-27","",31968,""

"Stress, Anxiety and Mental well-being among Nursing students: A Descriptive-Correlational study","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected everyone's health and well-being and has resulted in the shift of conventional face-to-face classes to online instruction. This has had major negative effects on students who are facing the difficulty of online classes in terms of their physical and mental health. Objectives: The study determined the relationship between stress and anxiety on emotional social and psychological well-being among nursing students. Methods: The study utilized descriptive cross-sectional research and a purposive sample of 210 nursing students was included in the study. The data were collected from November 2020 to December 2020. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), General Anxiety Disorders Scale (GAD-7), and Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF) (which measures emotional, psychological, and social well-being) were used to collect the necessary data. Frequency, percentage, mean, standard deviation, and Pearson's r correlation were utilized to analyze the gathered data. Results: The participants were shown to have a moderate level of stress (M=19.53;SD=Â±3.29), moderate level of anxiety (M=14.43;SD=Â±7.62), and moderate mental health. Further, stress was shown to have a significant negative correlation with emotional well-being (r= -0.218;p=0.000), social well-being (r= -0.175;p=0.000), psychological well-being (r= -0.219;0.000), and the over-all mental well-being (r= -0.222, p=0.000). Also, it was noted that anxiety has a significant negative relationship with emotional well-being (r= -0.418;p=0.000), social well-being (r= -0.280;p=0.000), psychological well-being (r= -0.331;p=0.000) and over-all mental well-being (r= -0.362;p=0.000). Conclusion: In light of mental health concerns among nursing students, faculty and administrators have a professional responsibility to address foreseeable psychological stressors and promote the mental well-being of students in their institution. The protection and development of mental well-being will allow students to maintain academic excellence and facilitate future success.","Calong, Kathyrine Calong, Comendador, Judalyn","https://www.google.com/search?q=Stress,+Anxiety+and+Mental+well-being+among+Nursing+students:+A+Descriptive-Correlational+study","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Health and Caring Sciences; 3(1):33-42, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-27","",31970,""

"The effects of COVID-19 on Canadian surgical residentsâ€™ education and wellness Les effets de la COVID-19 sur la formation et le bien-Ãªtre des rÃ©sidents en chirurgie au Canada","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged health care systems. We sought to comprehend the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on surgical residentsâ€™ education and mental well-being across Canada. Methods An online 51-question survey was distributed to surgical residents across all 17 Canadian post- graduate surgical residency programs. The questionnaire contained questions concerning demographic factors, perceived effects of COVID-19 pandemic on surgical training and residentsâ€™ mental health (categorically demonstrating whether it improved, stayed the same, or worsened). Health habits were measured as continuous variables and compared before and during the pandemic. Additionally, participants reported the performance of wellness officesâ€™ response to their needs during this crisis. Results A total of 122 out of 650 (19%) residents from all surgical specialities anonymously completed the survey. The majority (68%) reported a worsening in their surgical training. 94% of participants favored online teaching as a complementary method to in-person teaching. As to health habits, 38% reported a rise in their alcohol consumption and time spent seated. Only a minority (25%) felt happier and 41% reported experiencing more anxiety in comparison to surgical training pre-COVID-19. Merely 14% reported benefitting from wellness programs. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic had a negative effect on the perceived quality of surgical training, education, and resident mental health. There is an urgent need to reconsider the implemented measures in medical education and urge us to develop better agendas to face the current or future waves.","Alam, Peter, Salimi, Ali, ElHawary, Hassan, Sioufi, Krystelle, Papanastasiou, Constantine, Thibaudeau, Stephanie","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+effects+of+COVID-19+on+Canadian+surgical+residentsâ€™+education+and+wellness+Les+effets+de+la+COVID-19+sur+la+formation+et+le+bien-Ãªtre+des+rÃ©sidents+en+chirurgie+au+Canada","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Canadian medical education journal; 13(2):50-56, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-27","",31972,""
"Role of COVID-19 pandemic in the academic life and well-being of private sector university students: an exploratory qualitative study","The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a drastic impact on students' life, causing physical and emotional sufferings. Considering the relevance of unprecedented conditions, we explored perceptions and attitudes of students towards their academic life and well-being amid the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted an exploratory qualitative study using a purposive sampling approach conducted at a single-centre private nursing institution in Karachi, Pakistan. The current study used in-depth interviews with female university students. Study data were analysed manually using the thematic analysis approach. The primary outcome is to explore perception of students on academic life and well-being amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 10 in-depth interviews were conducted between August and September 2020. Four overarching themes were identified: (1) impact of COVID-19 on students' well-being; (2) effect of COVID-19 on students' academic life; (3) current coping mechanisms adopted by students and (4) recommendations to address students' concerns. The pandemic-related stressors served as a major impediment on students' motivation, concentration span and socioeconomic conditions which negatively influenced their well-being and academic life. However, students have adopted diverse coping mechanisms to combat unstable circumstances that include connecting with family and relatives, indulging in diverse activities, and getting academic support from faculty, senior students, and university administration. Students also recommended the need for arranging online mental health services, integrating e-learning mediums in existing academia, and constant efforts by the government to address electricity and internet connectivity issues to promote virtual learning. University students have been struck hard due to rapid pandemic-related transitions in their life. The study finding served as the potential guide for educational institutions and government officials to employ appropriate psychological interventions and provide infrastructure and technical facilities to provide support with their academic journey and overcoming the ongoing pandemic repercussions.","Ali, Feroz, Akber, Khoja","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-055678","20220526","COVID-19; public health; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-27","",31973,""

Research is needed to test the feasibility and effectiveness of yoga as a therapeutic option when delivered virtually. The primary aim of the mind and yoga for IBS randomised controlled trial is to determine the effects of an 8-week virtual meditation and yoga intervention on IBS symptom severity compared with an advice-only active control group. Adults diagnosed with IBS will be randomised to receive either a Upa Yoga intervention or an advice-only control group. The intervention will consist of weekly online classes for 8Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks delivered by a facilitator using Microsoft Office Teams and daily home practice. Feasibility will be evaluated by examining recruitment and attrition rates, adherence, participant satisfaction with the programme and safety. The primary outcome is IBS symptom severity, and key secondary outcomes include (but not limited to) quality of life, anxiety and depression symptoms, COVID-19-related stress and anxiety, and fatigue. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 4Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks and 8Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks. An embedded design experimental model substudy will be conducted post intervention using qualitative research methods to identify participants' experiences in the yoga programme.

"SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells associate with inflammation and reduced lung function in pulmonary post-acute sequalae of SARS-CoV-2","As of January 2022, at least 60 million individuals are estimated to develop post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). While elevated levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells have been observed in non-specific PASC, little is known about their impact on pulmonary function which is compromised in the majority of these individuals. This study compares frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells and inflammatory markers with lung function in participants with pulmonary PASC and resolved COVID-19 (RC). Compared to RC, participants with respiratory PASC had between 6- and 105-fold higher frequencies of IFN-ÃŽÂ³- and TNF-ÃŽÂ±-producing SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood, and elevated levels of plasma CRP and IL-6. Importantly, in PASC participants the frequency of TNF-ÃŽÂ±-producing SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which exhibited the highest levels of Ki67 indicating they were activity dividing, correlated positively with plasma IL-6 and negatively with measures of lung function, including forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), while increased frequencies of IFN-ÃŽÂ³-producing SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells associated with prolonged dyspnea. Statistical analyses stratified by age, number of comorbidities and hospitalization status demonstrated that none of these factors affect differences in the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 T cells and plasma IL-6 levels measured between PASC and RC cohorts. Taken together, these findings demonstrate elevated frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in individuals with pulmonary PASC are associated with increased systemic inflammation and decreased lung function, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells contribute to lingering pulmonary symptoms. These findings also provide mechanistic insight on the pathophysiology of PASC that can inform development of potential treatments to reduce symptom burden.","Littlefield, Watson, Schneider, Neff, Yamada, Zhang, Campbell, Falta, Jolley, Fontenot, Palmer","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1010359","20220526","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-27","",31975,""

Results indicate that particularly individuals living alone and being unable to work reported a lower frequency of (face-to-face) contact in comparison with participants living with others or working. Impaired social contact was indirectly associated with a negative development in well-being (life satisfaction, anxiety and depression) over time, and this relation was mediated via relatedness. Moreover, the frequency of face-to-face and phone communication during lockdown was positively associated with relatedness and well-being; however, digital communication was not.

"The working conditions for personal support workers in the Greater Toronto Area during the COVID-19 pandemic: a mixed-methods study","During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, personal support workers (PSWs) were heralded as healthcare 'heroes' as many of them cared for high-risk, vulnerable older populations, and worked in long-term care, which experienced a high number of COVID-19 outbreaks and deaths. While essential to the healthcare workforce, there is little understanding of PSW working conditions during the pandemic. The aim of our study was to examine the working conditions (including job security, work policies, and personal experiences) for PSWs in the Greater Toronto Area during the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspectives of PSWs. This study used a mixed-methods design. From June to December 2020, we conducted a survey of 634 PSWs to understand their working conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Semi-structured interviews with 31 survey respondents were conducted from February to May 2021 to understand in greater depth how working conditions were impacting the well-being of PSWs. We found PSWs faced a range of challenges related to COVID-19, including anxiety about contracting COVID-19, reduced work hours, taking leaves of absences, concerns about job security, and losing childcare. While the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the PSW workforce and their importance to the healthcare system (especially in the long-term care system), pre-existing poor work conditions of insecure jobs with no paid sick days and benefits exacerbated COVID-19-related challenges. Despite these hardships, PSWs were able to rely on their mental resilience and passion for their profession to cope with challenges. Significant changes need to be made to improve PSW working conditions. Better compensation, increased job security, decreased workload burden, and mental health supports are needed.

RÃƒÂ©SULTATS: Nous avons constatÃƒÂ© que les PAB ont connu de nombreuses difficultÃƒÂ©s en lien avec la COVID-19, dont lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢anxiÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© Ãƒ lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢idÃƒÂ©e de transmettre la COVID-19, les heures de travail rÃƒÂ©duites, la prise de congÃƒÂ©s, les craintes pour leur sÃƒÂ©curitÃƒÂ© dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢emploi et la perte de services de garde. Bien que la pandÃƒÂ©mie de COVID-19 ait braquÃƒÂ© les projecteurs sur les PAB et leur importance pour le systÃƒÂ¨me de soins de santÃƒÂ© (surtout dans le systÃƒÂ¨me de soins de longue durÃƒÂ©e), leurs mauvaises conditions de travail prÃƒÂ©existantes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ des emplois prÃƒÂ©caires sans congÃƒÂ©s de maladie payÃƒÂ©s ni avantages sociaux Ã¢â‚¬â€œ ont exacerbÃƒÂ© les problÃƒÂ¨mes posÃƒÂ©s par la COVID-19. MalgrÃƒÂ© ces ÃƒÂ©preuves, les PAB ont pu compter sur leur rÃƒÂ©silience mentale et leur passion pour la profession pour faire face aux difficultÃƒÂ©s. CONCLUSION: DÃ¢â‚¬â„¢importants changements doivent ÃƒÂªtre apportÃƒÂ©s pour amÃƒÂ©liorer les conditions de travail des PAB.

"Internalizing problems before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in independent samples of Dutch children and adolescents with and without pre-existing mental health problems","The aim of the study was to assess internalizing problems before and during the pandemic with data from Dutch consortium Child and adolescent mental health and wellbeing in times of the COVID-19 pandemic, consisting of two Dutch general population samples (GS) and two clinical samples (CS) referred to youth/psychiatric care. Measures of internalizing problems were obtained from ongoing data collections pre-pandemic (N<sub>GS</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°35,357; N<sub>CS</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4487) and twice during the pandemic, in Apr-May 2020 (N<sub>GS</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3938; clinical: N<sub>CS</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1008) and in Nov-Dec 2020 (N<sub>GS</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1489; N<sub>CS</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1536), in children and adolescents (8-18Ã‚Â years) with parent (Brief Problem Monitor) and/or child reports (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System<sup>Ã‚Â®</sup>). Results show that, in the general population, internalizing problems were higher during the first peak of the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic based on both child and parent reports. Yet, over the course of the pandemic, on both child and parent reports, similar or lower levels of internalizing problems were observed. Children in the clinical population reported more internalizing symptoms over the course of the pandemic while parents did not report differences in internalizing symptoms from pre-pandemic to the first peak of the pandemic nor over the course of the pandemic. Overall, the findings indicate that children and adolescents of both the general and clinical population were affected negatively by the pandemic in terms of their internalizing problems. Attention is therefore warranted to investigate long-term effects and to monitor if internalizing problems return to pre-pandemic levels or if they remain elevated post-pandemic.","Fischer, Tieskens, Luijten, Zijlmans, van Oers, de Groot, van der Doelen, van Ewijk, Klip, van der Lans, De Meyer, van der Mheen, van Muilekom, Hyun Ruisch, Teela, van den Berg, Bruining, van der Rijken, Buitelaar, Hoekstra, Lindauer, Oostrom, Staal, Vermeiren, Cornet, Haverman, Bartels, Polderman, Popma","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-022-01991-y","20220526","Anxiety; COVID-19; Children and adolescents; Coronavirus; Depression; Internalizing problems; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-27","",31979,""
"Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on LGBTQ+'s Sexual Behaviors in Turkey: ""Everything about Sex Had Become A Black Box""","The COVID-19 pandemic has forced changes in the behavior patterns of many population groups due to restrictive measures all over the world. In this study, qualitative research method based on a phenomenological approach was used to determine the changes in the sexual behavior of a group of LGBTQ+ people living in Turkey. The COVID-19 pandemic has culminated in changes in the sexual life of LGBTQ+s. It has been determined that feelings such as the need of emotional support, loneliness, devaluation and helplessness were experienced, and quarantine and curfew restrictions were effective on sexuality and sexual behaviors. In addition, it has been determined that LGBTQ+s have changed in the standards of determining partners during the pandemic process. The use of sex toys has increased, the sensitivity toward self-care and hygiene rules has increased, the tendency to have sexual fantasies has changed, the sexual behavior of people in their social environment has changed, and the disruptions in health services have posed negative effects. It is recommended to carry out studies focusing on the sexual behavior of LGBTQ+s and to develop counseling services regarding the sexual behaviors of LGBTQ+s and the situations that occur in their sexual lives.","Kara, KarataÃ…Å¸, Duyan","https://doi.org/10.1080/00918369.2022.2072255","20220526","COVID-19; LGBTQ; Pandemic; sex life; sexual behaviors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-27","",31980,""
"Integration of medication for opioid use disorder training into graduate nursing education","The COVID-19 pandemic has further limited access to treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD). Advanced practice registered nurses can reduce opioid related complications and overdose by obtaining a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) regulated X-waiver that allows for prescription of medications for OUD (MOUD) in general medical settings. Graduate nursing education, where advanced practice nurse practitioner (NP) students are educated, has not incorporated this content into standard curricula. We describe an innovative approach to incorporate DEA X-waiver training in a required community health NP in partnership with addiction medicine clinicians. Advanced practice NP students (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°114) either completed fully online or hybrid (virtual didactic and online) X-waiver training on MOUD. We describe how an interprofessional partnership to incorporate MOUD education into graduate nursing curricula is a feasible method for training students to treat OUD in the context of the pandemic. This approach is responsive to the crucial need for more health care providers to address the opioid overdose crisis.","Barcelona, Wischik, Marshall, Tetrault","https://doi.org/10.1111/nuf.12753","20220526","education; health promotion; public health; social determinants of health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-27","",31981,""
"Opioid Use Disorder and COVID-19: Treatment and Recovery Factors among Vulnerable Populations at the Intersection of Two US Epidemics","Social inequities made some sociodemographic groups - including those of older age, minoritized race/ethnicity, and low socioeconomic status - disproportionately vulnerable to morbidity and mortality associated with the opioid epidemic and COVID-19 pandemic. Given shared vulnerability to these public health crises, it is critical to understand how COVID-19 impacts substance use disorder (SUD) treatment and recovery among people with these characteristics. The current study examined COVID-19's perceived impact on treatment factors and psychosocial outcomes by sociodemographic vulnerability. Patients receiving SUD treatment with a history of opioid misuse were recruited. Participants completed self-report questionnaires regarding the impact of COVID-19 on treatment indicators and mood and substance use symptoms. Most participants reported that COVID-19 decreased their treatment access and quality. There were no sociodemographic differences in treatment factors. Those with high sociodemographic vulnerability reported greater pandemic-related increases in depression and demonstrated greater mood symptoms. Post-hoc analyses demonstrated that unmet basic needs were significantly associated with lower treatment access and quality, greater mood symptoms, and higher substance use. Findings suggest pandemic-related stressors and barriers affected those across the sociodemographic spectrum. Treatment systems must address socioeconomic barriers to care exacerbated by the pandemic and bolster integrated treatment options for opioid use and mood disorders.","Banks, Paschke, Li, Fentem, Rich, Szlyk, Cavazos-Rehg","https://doi.org/10.1080/02791072.2022.2079443","20220526","COVID-19; opioid overdose; socioeconomic status; substance use treatment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-27","",31982,""
"Web-based training for post-secondary student well-being during the pandemic: a randomized trial","<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic has been a highly stressful period where post-secondary education moved to online formats. Coping skills like decentering and reappraisal appear to promote stress resilience, but limited research exists on cultivating these skills in online learning contexts.<b>Methods:</b> In a three-arm randomized trial design, we evaluated three-week, web-based interventions to gauge how to best cultivate mindfulness and stress-reappraisal skills and whether the proposed interventions led to improved mental health. Undergraduate participants (<i>N</i> = 183) were randomly assigned to stress mindset, mindfulness meditation, or mindfulness with choice conditions.<b>Results:</b> At the study level (baseline vs. post-intervention), decentering improved across all conditions. Mindfulness with choice significantly decreased negative affect and rumination compared to stress mindset, while stress mindset significantly enhanced stress mindset skills compared to both mindfulness groups. At the daily level (three sessions per week), stress mindset significantly increased positive affect compared to mindfulness meditation.<b>Conclusions:</b> Results suggest that student mental health can be remotely supported through brief web-based interventions. Mindfulness practices seem to be effective in improving students' negative mood and coping strategies, while stress mindset training can help students to adopt a stress-is-enhancing mindset. Additional work on refining and better matching students to appropriate interventions is needed.","Wang, Farb","https://doi.org/10.1080/10615806.2022.2079637","20220526","Mindfulness; coping; mental health; reappraisal; stress mindset; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-27","",31983,""
"Managing COVID-19 Pandemic in the Community: A Primary Health Clinic Experience","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected several countries worldwide, including Malaysia, with the first reported case occurring in January 2020. Terengganu, a state on the east coast of Malaysia, is finding it challenging to contain the disease by aggressively instituting all public health measures to reduce the number of COVID-19 cases and community transmission. Our primary health clinic, which is situated in a semi-rural district in Terengganu, is also involved in the implementation of containment measures, community risk measurement, and the initial management of COVID-19 cases. The health clinic changed the clinic system for the delivery of healthcare services to avoid overcrowding of patients and adapted innovative ways of providing medical services, such as telemedicine and ""drive-through"" pharmacy. It also provided continuous health education and awareness regarding COVID-19 to both patients and clinic attendees. The essential element of combating the infection is the effective control of infection in a small, isolated clinic in which space and adequate facilities are known challenges. This study aimed to highlight the flow of COVID-19 management starting from screening, triaging, and management based on protocol, implementation of infection control measures, and training of healthcare workers in our health clinic. The mental health of these workers was managed by the Mental Health and Psychosocial Support Unit, as recommended by the Ministry of Health Malaysia. The role of primary care clinics in the ongoing pandemic is currently increasing. Hence, higher authority and the government must increase the number of facilities, human resources, and financial budget to ensure that all initiatives can be implemented effectively.","Yusof, Juhari, Daud, Pauzi, Ngah","https://doi.org/10.4082/kjfm.21.0062","20220526","COVID-19 Pandemic; Infection Control; Residence Characteristics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-27","",31984,""
"The effects of sustained COVID-19 emergency and restrictions on the mental health of subjects with serious mental illness: A prospective study","Few longitudinal studies have so far investigated the impact of sustained COVID-19 among people with pre-existing psychiatric disorders. We conducted a prospective study involving people with serious mental illness (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°114) and healthy controls (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°41) to assess changes in the Perceived Stress Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire, and Specific Psychotic Experiences Questionnaire scores 18 months after the COVID-19 pandemic outset. Subjects underwent interviews with a mental health professional in April 2020 and at the end of the local third wave (October 2021).

"Addictive social media use during Covid-19 outbreak: Validation of the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale (BSMAS) and investigation of protective factors in nine countries","Since the Covid-19 outbreak, addictive social media use increased in many countries. To better understand this development, a universal instrument for the assessment of addictive social media use is required. Against this background, we examined the psychometric properties of the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale (BSMAS) in representative population samples in nine countries (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°9418, age range: ""18 to 24 years"" (youngest group), ""55 years and older"" (oldest group): China, France, Germany, Poland, Russia, Spain, Sweden, U.K., U.S.). Furthermore, we investigated potential factors and mechanisms that could be associated with addictive social media use. Our cross-national findings show that the BSMAS is a unidimensional reliable and valid instrument. Moreover, they reveal that the negative association between positive mental health and addictive social media use is mediated by sense of control in seven of the nine countries (exception: China, Russia). Thus, it can be hypothesized that activities which increase positive mental health could indirectly contribute to the decrease of addictive social media use. We identified conscious engagement in physical activity and a regular sleep rhythm during the pandemic as such potential activities. The fostering of both by governmental programs could enhance positive mental health and reduce addictive social media use.","Brailovskaia, Margraf","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-03182-z","20220526","Addictive social media use; Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale (BSMAS); Covid-19; Cross-national; Protective factors; Validation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-27","",31987,""
"Changes and correlates of screen time in adults and children during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Screen time has increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and several correlates have been associated with these increases. These changes, however, have not been aggregated. It was the aim of this review to (a) aggregate changes in screen time in adults and children, and (b) report on variables in relation to screen time during the COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic review of major databases was undertaken for studies published from inception to 06/12/2021, using a pre-published protocol (PROSPERO ID: CRD42021261422). Studies reporting (a) screen time pre-versus-during the pandemic, (b) screen time percentage change, or (c) correlates of screen time during the pandemic were included. A random effects meta-analysis was undertaken with subgroup analysis by age group and type of screen time. After review, 89 studies (<i>n</i>Ã‚Â <i>=</i>Ã‚Â 204,734; median age=20Ã‚Â·6; median female=53Ã‚Â·3%) were included. The majority of studies were cross-sectional. With regards to total screen time, primary aged children (6-10 years) reported largest increases (1Ã‚Â·4Ã‚Â hrs/day; 95%CI 1Ã‚Â·1-1Ã‚Â·7), followed by adults (&gt;18 years; 1Ã‚Â·0Ã‚Â hrs/day; 95%CI 0Ã‚Â·7-1Ã‚Â·2), adolescents (11-17 years; 0Ã‚Â·9Ã‚Â hrs/day; 95%CI 0Ã‚Â·3-1Ã‚Â·5), and young children (0-5 years; 0Ã‚Â·6Ã‚Â hrs/day 95%CI 0Ã‚Â·3-0Ã‚Â·9Ã‚Â hrs/day). For leisure screen time (non-work/non-academic), primary aged children reported largest increases (1Ã‚Â·0Ã‚Â hrs/day 95%CI 0Ã‚Â·8-1Ã‚Â·3), followed by adults (0Ã‚Â·7hr/day 95%CI 0Ã‚Â·3-1Ã‚Â·2), young children (0Ã‚Â·6Ã‚Â hrs/day; 95%CI 0Ã‚Â·4-0Ã‚Â·8), with adolescents reporting the lowest increase (0Ã‚Â·5Ã‚Â hrs/day 95%CI 0Ã‚Â·3-0Ã‚Â·7). Several correlates were associated with reported increases in screen time, including adverse dietary behaviours, sleep, mental health, parental health, and eye health. Pooled evidence suggest that primary aged children reported the highest increase in both total and leisure screen time during COVID-19. It is recommended that screen time should be reduced in favour of non-sedentary activities.

"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on sleep quality in healthcare workers in Turkey","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused serious concerns and psychological distress globally. Healthcare workers remain one of the most affected groups due to life threatening risks in addition to increased working hours and labor intensity. All these factors may affect sleep quality of this population. The aim of this study is to evaluate the sleep behaviors of healthcare professionals working in secondary and tertiary hospitals in a large population in Turkey and to show how sleep quality is affected during the pandemic process using the easily applicable Jenkins Sleep Scale (JSS). The population of this cross-sectional descriptive study consists of two pandemic hospitals determined in KahramanmaraÃ…Å¸ province. In our questionnaire, we asked subjective sleep quality, sleep time, time to fall asleep, total sleep time, and medication use. We also used JSS Turkish version (JSS-TR) to assess sleep quality and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) for increased daytime sleepiness. Healthcare workers who participated in our survey reported that they started to go to bed later, fell asleep later (mean: 41.75Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°35.35Ã‚Â min), their total sleep time (mean: 6.67Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.88Ã‚Â h) was shortened, and they needed medication to sleep more (5.7%) after the COVID-19 pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, bedtime behavior after 24:00 decreased from 80.1 to 43.9% of those who previously went to bed before 24:00. For those who went to bed after 24:00 before, it increased from 19.9 to 56.1%. In addition, sleep quality as assessed by subjective and JSS significantly deteriorated after the COVID-19 pandemic. Excessive daytime sleepiness increased. Those with ESSÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°10 before and after COVID-19 were 3.9% and 14.1%, respectively (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001).

"Mental health profiles of autistic children and youth during the COVID-19 pandemic","Canadian province-wide lockdowns have challenged children's mental health (MH) during the COVID-19 pandemic, with autistic children being at particular risk. The purpose of our study was to identify sub-groups of autistic children with distinct mental health change profiles, to understand the child-, parent-, and system-specific factors associated with such profiles in order to ultimately inform future interventions. Data were drawn from a large Canadian cohort (N=1,570) across Ontario, resulting in 265 autistic children (mean age=10.9 years, 76% male). K-means clustering analyses were employed to partition distinct MH profiles in six MH measures (mood, anxiety, OCD symptoms, irritability, inattention, hyperactivity) and group differences were examined with reference to the above factors. Additionally, we investigated the characteristics of children who accessed acute MH services. The optimal number of clusters was two; one included those experiencing MH deterioration across all six MH measures (61.3%, 95% confidence interval [CI]=54.9 to 67.4), and a second included youth that did not experience MH changes (38.7%, 95%CI=32.6 to 45.1). Child-specific factors associated with MH deterioration included higher pre-existing internalizing symptoms, high levels of COVID stress. Parental MH challenges and system-specific factors, such as the loss of learning supports, access to physicians and material deprivation, were also associated with MH deterioration. Access to acute MH services were primarily associated with financial insecurity and loss of services. More than half of autistic children experienced MH deterioration, and person-specific (pre-existing MH, COVID related stress), parent-specific (Parent MH) and system-level (loss of services and material deprivation) characteristics were associated with such decline, providing clinical and policy opportunities for intervention at multiple levels.","Charalampopoulou, Choi, Korczak, Cost, Crosbie, Birken, Charach, Monga, Kelley, Nicolson, Georgiades, Ayub, Schachar, Iaboni, Anagnostou","https://doi.org/10.1093/pch/pxab111","20220526","Autism; COVID; Children; Mental health; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-27","",31990,""
"Opioid Use Disorder Curriculum: Preclerkship Pharmacology Case-Based Learning Session","During the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, over 93,000 Americans lost their lives to a preventable overdose. Medications for opioid use disorder (OUD) have been shown to decrease mortality in OUD but are underutilized. Through this case-based learning exercise, first-year medical students applied physiologic and pharmacologic principles to the diagnosis and treatment of OUD. Faculty facilitated a case discussion over a 1-hour large-group case-based learning (CBL) session. Facilitators utilized PowerPoint slides to illustrate graphs and figures while discussing the case. To evaluate students on the CBL learning objectives, three pharmacology exam questions were administered; students also evaluated the CBL's effectiveness in meeting educational objectives on three Likert-scale questions and via open-ended feedback. First-year medical students (<i>n</i> = 200) completed the CBL. The mean score on the exam questions was 91%. Students agreed or strongly agreed that the CBL was an effective way to learn pharmacology principles (69%), that it reinforced pharmacologic fundamentals (70%), and that it showed how pharmacology fundamentals were important in the real world of clinical medicine (86%).

"Exploring the potential of delivering mental health care services using digital technologies in Bangladesh: A qualitative analysis","Bangladesh is a lower-middle-income country affected by a severe lack of mental health service availability due to a scarcity of mental health experts, limited mental health literacy, and community stigma. In other low and middle-income countries, the online provision of mental health care services has addressed issues affecting service availability, accessibility, mass awareness of services, and stigma. The current study sought to understand stakeholders' perceptions of the potential of digital media-based mental health care delivery in strengthening Bangladesh's mental health system. Online in-depth interviews were conducted with seven psychiatrists and eleven people with lived experiences of mental health issues. In addition, two online focus groups were conducted with ten psychologists and nine mental health entrepreneurs. A thematic analysis of the audio transcriptions was used to identify themes. Stakeholders perceived that the benefits of digital media-based mental health services included the potential of increasing the awareness, availability, and accessibility of mental health services. Participants recommended: the rehabilitation of existing pathways; the use of social media to raise awareness; and the implementation of strategies that integrate different digital-based services to strengthen the mental health system and foster positive mental health-seeking behaviors. Growing mental health awareness, combined with the appropriate use of digital media as a platform for distributing information and offering mental services, can help to promote mental health care. To strengthen mental health services in Bangladesh, tailored services, increased network coverage, and training are required on digital mental health.","Koly, Saba, Muzaffar, Modasser, M, Colon-Cabrera, Warren","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2022.100544","20220526","Bangladesh; CMD, Common Mental Health Disorders; COREQ, Consolidated Reporting Criteria for Qualitative Studies; COVID-19, Coronavirus Disease 2019; DALYs, Disability-Adjusted Life-Years; Digital technology; E-mental health; FGD, Focus Group Discussions; HIC, High Income Country; Health system; IDI, In-Depth Interviews; IRB, Institutional Review Board; Internet; KII, Key Informant Interviews; LMIC, Low and Middle-Income Country; MH, Mental Health; Mental health; PWLE, People with Lived Experiences of Mental Health Issues; UHC, Universal Health Coverage; WHO, World Health Organization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-27","",31992,""
"A Qualitative Study of Older Adults' Experiences of Embedding Physical Activity Within Their Home Care Services in Ireland","Physical activity has been shown to improve older adults' functional capacity, independence, and quality of life. In a feasibility study, we embedded a movement approach within older adults existing home care services through ""Care to Move"" (CTM). The aim of this qualitative study is to explore older adults' experiences of CTM within their home care support services and to identify the strengths and barriers of engaging in CTM from the perspective of the older recipient. We conducted semi-structured telephone interviews with 13 older adults and one informal carer. Topics covered included participants' overall experiences of CTM, changes to their overall activity and participation, aspects of CTM that they found valuable and issues that were challenging. Interview transcripts were coded and analyzed thematically to capture barriers and facilitators to the approach delivery. Four themes were developed: i) ""I have good days and bad days"", ii) ""safety and security is the name of the game"", iii) ""we're a team as it stands', iv) ""it's [COVID-19] depressing for everybody at the moment"". Older adults identified benefits of CTM engagement including improvements in physical and psychological wellbeing. However, subjective frailty and self-reported multimorbidity influenced overall engagement. Participants expressed concerns around the logistics of delivering CTM and competing care staff interests. The broader role of care staff in supporting CTM was highlighted, as well as the emotional support that staff provided to older adults. Care staff continuity was identified as a barrier to ongoing engagement. The impact of COVID-19 on older adults physical and mental health negatively impacted the delivery of the approach. Our findings suggest that embedding CTM within home care services is feasible and that older adults enjoyed engaging in CTM. Addressing care staff continuity and adopting individual approaches to CTM delivery may enhance the implementation of services.","Burton, Horgan, Cummins, Warters, Swan, O'Sullivan, Skelton, Townley, Doyle, Jabakhanji, Sorensen, Rooney, Murphy, Galvin","https://doi.org/10.2147/JMDH.S351714","20220526","barriers; community care; home support; motivation; movement; older people","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-27","",31993,""
"The COVID-19 Stress Perceived on Social Distance and Gender-Based Implications","The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented event entailing long-term consequences on population health and welfare. Those who contracted the coronavirus may have suffered from both physical and mental health issues that unfold the need for tailored intervention strategies. Hence, our study aims to investigate the psychological and social consequences of COVID-19 on a sample of 86 participants, encompassing 43 patients (clinical group; 25 women; mean age = 50.4 Ã‚Â± 10.1 years) recruited from Bari University Hospital, 19 of whom were hospitalized due to the disease. The remaining 43 were individuals not fallen ill with COVID-19 to date (control group; 25 women; mean age = 50.4 Ã‚Â± 10.1 years). The investigation yielded significant gender differences in post-traumatic stress symptoms, depression, and representation of interpersonal distance (IPD), evaluated through the IES-R, the BDI-II, and the IVAS task, respectively. This pattern of results was not replicated in the control group. In general, participants who reported having experienced the most intense post-traumatic symptoms also presented a greater mood deflection and, more specifically, within the clinical group women obtained the highest scores on both scales. Women reported higher IES-R and BDI-II scores compared to men, that could indicate that women who have contracted COVID-19 are more exposed to post-traumatic and depressive symptoms. Our results also showed a significant effect of COVID-19 on IPD with a tendency of disease-experienced individuals to increase their preferred IPD from adults, children, and elderly people. Regarding gender differences in mood and proxemic behavior, a correlation between depressive symptoms and probable PTSD and a further correlation between probable PTSD and greater IPD were found in women from both clinical and control group. Overall, these findings might contribute to a better understanding of gender-based implications of the current pandemic on mental health, also leading to the development of integrated yet personalized intervention strategies.","Taurisano, Lanciano, Alfeo, Bisceglie, Monaco, Sbordone, Abbatantuono, Costadura, Losole, Ruggiero, Iachini, Vimercati, Vacca, De Caro, Curci","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.846097","20220526","depression; gender; interpersonal distance; post-traumatic symptoms; psychological implications","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-27","",31994,""
"The Upside of Negative Emotions: How Do Older Adults From Different Cultures Challenge Their Self-Growth During the COVID-19 Pandemic?","The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has raised increased challenges for older adults' personal growth in diverse cultural settings. The aim of this study was to analyze negative emotions and their role on older adults' self-growth in Mexico, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, during the COVID-19 pandemic. For this purpose, a cross-national qualitative research was carried out. Data were collected from 338 community-dwelling participants aged 65 years and older, using a semi-structured interview protocol. Older adults were asked about negative emotions that significantly contribute to their self-growth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Content analysis was used to identify key themes. Seven main negative emotions (fear, sadness, anger, grief, boredom, loneliness, and shame) significantly contributed to seven themes of self-growth, across the samples: sharing difficult experiences with others, supportive partner, spiritual practices, engagement with life, generativity, volunteering activities, and intimacy and sexual satisfaction. Sharing difficult experiences with others was most pertinent to Mexican (13.9%) and to Italian (3.0%) participants, and a supportive partner to Portuguese (12.1%), and to Spanish participants (6.5%). The findings of this study indicate that negative emotions during the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to their older adults' self-growth. This study highlighted the cultural diversity of experiences during the pandemics and underlined the upside of negative emotions and its relation to older adults' self-growth during this period.","von Humboldt, Mendoza-Ruvalcaba, Arias-Merino, Ribeiro-GonÃƒÂ§alves, Cabras, Low, Leal","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.648078","20220526","Covid-19 pandemic; cross-cultural; negative emotions; older adults; positive psychology; qualitative research; self-growth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-27","",31995,""
"Barriers and Strategies for Type 1 Diabetes Management Among Emerging Adults: A Qualitative Study","Individuals in the emerging adult age group (18-30Ã¢â‚¬â€°years) with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) have unique medical and social needs. The purpose of this study was to observe barriers and strategies for diabetes management among emerging adults with T1DM. A qualitative grounded theory model was utilized. An open-ended approach with a telephone interview was designed to allow a deeper understanding of the T1DM experience. The participants were from a larger survey-volunteer participant group and were asked to complete 1 interview in spring 2020 (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°21, diagnosed age: mean 15.00Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°8.00, females, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°19). The data were analyzed for cohesive themes using grounded theory. Participants indicated three main barrier themes (physiology, environment, and insurance) and 3 barrier subthemes (mental health, lack of social support, and weather). Three main strategy themes to diabetes management were recognized (medical technology, access to social support, and physical activity). There were 2 strategy subthemes (social media and social accountability). Regular use of social media can be a key tool for social accountability while lack of social support and physiological shifts can be barriers to management of T1DM. Physical activity should be considered as part of an individualized plan for management of diabetes.","Sawyer, Hilliard, Hackney, Stastny","https://doi.org/10.1177/11795514221098389","20220526","Anxiety; COVID-19; environment; glycemic variability; physical activity; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-27","",31996,""
"The Impact of Post-traumatic Stress of SARS-CoV-2 Affliction on Psychological and Mental Health of Student Survivors: Cross Sectional Study","COVID-19 survivor's population is often associated with a long term impact on mental and psychological health. Recent included studies have also stated affliction of mental health due to fear of virus and preventive policies among the college students. The research was conducted to find the psychological and mental impacts of SARS-CoV-2 affliction among the students' survivors in the university. The study design of the experiment was cross-sectional, sampling technique was non probability and sampling method being applied was convenience sampling. IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 20 was used for analyses. Descriptive data was examined and results were showed as mean and standard deviations, percentages, frequencies for continuous variables of IES-R scale (Intrusion, Avoidance, and Hyperarousal) using the total sample of <i>n</i> = 34. Out of 34 only 24 student survivors responded to the online survey post COVID-19 recovery, with an overall participation level of 71%. Grading was given for the total IES-R score which was subdivided into a predefined range. Out of 24 participants, 9 (38%) participants showed the symptoms of mild (<i>n</i> = 2)-severe (<i>n</i> = 7) psychological impacts. On correlation of factors total IES-R score and taste and sense of smell were moderately correlated. The ordinal regression for complete loss of sense of taste and smell was also significant. The results from IES-R evaluation clearly outlines the presence of psychological sequels post recovery of COVID-19 episodes among the young college survivors. Complete loss of sense of smell and taste may be an indicator of psychological sequelae as compared to reduce sense of smell.","Dixit, Musa, Sillva, Reddy, Abohashrh, Kakaraparthi, Asiri, Caruso, Govindappa, Mohammed","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.845741","20220526","SARS-CoV-2; cognitive impact; post-traumatic stress; post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD); psychological impact","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-27","",31997,""
"Mental health assessment of youth with sickle cell disease and their primary caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic","Youth with sickle cell disease (SCD) and their caregivers are susceptible to stress and depression, perhaps exacerbated by pandemic-associated health and economic concerns. Most of the 50 youth-caregiver dyads enrolled in the multisite trial, Hydroxyurea Adherence for Personal Best in Sickle Cell Treatment (HABIT), took an online survey of self-reported mental health symptoms and food insecurity during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to largely pre-pandemic results, prevalence of mental health symptoms in dyad members appeared to have shifted: fewer youth and more caregivers were affected during the pandemic; many of both groups lacked optimism.

"Factors influencing fatigue in UK nurses working in respiratory clinical areas during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic: An online survey","This study explores UK nurses' experiences of working in a respiratory clinical area during the COVID-19 pandemic over winter 2020. During the first wave of the pandemic, nurses working in respiratory clinical areas experienced significant levels of anxiety and depression. As the pandemic has progressed, levels of fatigue in nurses have not been assessed. A cross-sectional e-survey was distributed via professional respiratory societies and social media. The survey included Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD7), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9, depression), a resilience scale (RS-14) and Chalder mental and physical fatigue tools. The STROBE checklist was followed as guidance to write the manuscript. Despite reporting anxiety and depression, few nurses reported having time off work with stress, most were maintaining training and felt prepared for COVID challenges in their current role. Nurses reported concerns over safety and patient feedback was both positive and negative. A quarter of respondents reported wanting to leave nursing. Nurses experiencing greater physical fatigue reported higher levels of anxiety and depression. Nurses working in respiratory clinical areas were closely involved in caring for COVID-19 patients. Nurses continued to experience similar levels of anxiety and depression to those found in the first wave and reported symptoms of fatigue (physical and mental). A significant proportion of respondents reported considering leaving nursing. Retention of nurses is vital to ensure the safe functioning of already overstretched health services. Nurses would benefit from regular mental health check-ups to ensure they are fit to practice and receive the support they need to work effectively. A high proportion of nurses working in respiratory clinical areas have been identified as experiencing fatigue in addition to continued levels of anxiety, depression over winter 2020. Interventions need to be implemented to help provide mental health support and improve workplace conditions to minimise PTSD and burnout.","Roberts, McAloney-Kocaman, Lippiett, Ray, Welch, Kelly","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.16375","20220526","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; fatigue; nursing; respiratory","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-27","",31999,""
"South Korean validation of the COVID-related-PTSD scale in a non-clinical sample exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic","The threat of COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea and around the globe challenged not only physical health but also mental health, increasing the chances of disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Such pandemic situation can be referred to a traumatic event for citizens. The present study aims to examine the psychometric properties of the PTSD Checklist (PCL-5), which is named the K-COVID-related-PTSD. The scale measures PTSD symptomology in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea. A total of 1434 South Korean citizens were included in this study. The data were statistically analyzed using SPSS 21.0 and Mplus 8.0. The results of confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated a superior fit for the seven-factor hybrid model (x<sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1425.445 (dfÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°149), CFIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.950, TLIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.937, SRMRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.033, RMSEAÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.077) consisting of re-experiencing, negative affect, anxious arousal, dysphoric arousal, avoidance, anhedonia, and externalizing behaviors.

"The mediating effect of psychological capital on the relationship between psychological stress and distress among chinese nursing students: a cross-sectional study","With the COVID-19 outbreak in China, the Chinese government took measures to prevent and control the spread of the virus. In-person teaching was replaced by distance learning, which was an unknown challenge for students. In this context, little is known about the perceived distress of nursing students and the relationship between psychological capital, perceived distress, and psychological stress. This study examined the relationship between psychological capital, psychological distress, and perceived stress, and the mediating role of psychological capital in the relationship between perceived stress and psychological distress among nursing students. This cross-sectional survey was conducted between January and December 2020 using a convenience sampling method involving 359 undergraduate and specialist nursing students at a tertiary hospital in Shandong Province. Standardised instruments were used to measure psychological capital, psychological stress, and perceived stress. We used SPSS 24.0 and PROCESS macro to analyse the data. There was a statistically significant difference in perceived stress among students based on whether they liked the nursing profession (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). Relative to nursing college students, undergraduates experienced significantly higher levels of perceived stress (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). Nevertheless, there were no significant differences in perceived stress according to gender, place of residence, and being an only child. Psychological distress was positively correlated (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.632, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) with perceived stress (rÃ‚Â =-0.662, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), whereas it was negatively correlated with psychological capital. Psychological capital played a potential mediating role in the relationship between psychological distress and perceived stress. Psychological distress was negatively correlated with psychological capital, and positively correlated with perceived stress. Mediation analyses indicated that psychological capital partially mediated the relationship between perceived stress and psychological distress. Educators should therefore heed students' perceived stress and develop appropriate mental health counselling programmes for students in the curriculum that could help them reduce their psychological distress. In clinical practice, nursing managers must take effective measures, such as skills training, to improve the psychological capital of nursing students and reduce the negative impact of their psychological distress.","Sun, Wang, Xue, Su, Hu, Lu","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12912-022-00915-0","20220525","China; Mediation; Nursing students; Perceived stress; Psychological capital; Psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-27","",32001,""
"Low awareness of risk mitigation prescribing in response to dual crises of COVID-19 and overdose deaths among people who use unregulated drugs in Vancouver, Canada","When the novel coronavirus pandemic emerged in March 2020, many settings across Canada and the USA were already contending with an existing crisis of drug overdoses due to the toxic unregulated drug supply. In response, the Canadian province of British Columbia (BC) released innovative risk mitigation prescribing (RMP) guidelines for medical professionals to prescribe pharmaceutical alternatives to unregulated drugs in an effort to support the self-isolation of people who use unregulated drugs (PWUD) in preventing both SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and overdoses. We sought to assess the level of awareness of RMP and identify factors associated with this awareness among PWUD in Vancouver, BC. Cross-sectional data were derived from participants enrolled in three community-recruited prospective cohort studies of PWUD in Vancouver, interviewed between July and November 2020. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with awareness of RMP. Among 633 participants, 302 (47.7%) had heard of RMP. Of those 302 participants, 199 (65.9%) had never tried to access RMP services, ten (3.3%) made an unsuccessful attempt to access RMP, and 93 (30.8%) received RMP. In the multivariable analysis, participants who had awareness of RMP guidelines were more likely to self-identify as white (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.47; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01, 2.13), to have completed secondary school education or higher (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.67; 95% CI: 1.16, 2.39), to have used drugs at a supervised consumption or overdose prevention site in the past six months (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.66; 95% CI: 1.10, 2.52), and to have received opioid agonist therapy as treatment for opioid use disorder in the past six months (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.51; 95% CI: 1.02, 2.24). At least four months after the release of the guidelines, RMP was known to less than half of our study participants, warranting urgent educational efforts for PWUD, particularly among racialized groups and those who were not accessing other harm reduction services. Furthermore, the majority of participants who were aware of RMP guidelines had never tried to access the service, suggesting the need to improve perceived accessibility and knowledge of eligibility criteria.","Moshkforoush, DeBeck, Brar, Fairbairn, Cui, Milloy, Buxton, Oldenburger, McLellan, Kendall, Sedgemore, Wilson, Kerr, Hayashi","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-022-00632-6","20220525","COVID-19; Drug overdose; Harm reduction; Safe supply","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-27","",32002,""
"Factors associated with a change in smoking habit during the first COVID-19 lockdown: an Italian cross-sectional study among ever-smokers","The COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown period lasted from March to May 2020, resulted in a highly stressful situation yielding different negative health consequences, including the worsening of smoking habit. A web-based cross-sectional study on a convenient sample of 1013 Italian ever smokers aged 18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years or more was conducted. Data were derived from surveys compiled by three different groups of people: subjects belonging to Smoking Cessation Services, Healthcare Providers and Nursing Sciences' students. All institutions were from Northern Italy. The primary outcome self-reported worsening (relapse or increase) or improvement (quit or reduce) of smoking habit during lockdown period. Multiple unconditional (for worsening) and multinomial (for improving) logistic regressions were carried out. Among 962 participants, 56.0% were ex-smokers. Overall, 13.2% of ex-smokers before lockdown reported relapsing and 32.7% of current smokers increasing cigarette intake. Among current smokers before lockdown, 10.1% quit smoking and 13.5% decreased cigarette intake. Out of 7 selected stressors related to COVID-19, four were significantly related to relapse (OR for the highest vs. the lowest tertile ranging between 2.24 and 3.62): fear of being infected and getting sick; fear of dying due to the virus; anxiety in listening to news of the epidemic; sense of powerlessness in protecting oneself from contagion. In addition to these stressors, even the other 3 stressors were related with increasing cigarette intensity (OR ranging between 1.90 and 4.18): sense of powerlessness in protecting loved ones from contagion; fear of losing loved ones due to virus; fear of infecting other.

In this study, we used the US Department of Veterans Affairs national healthcare databases to build a cohort of 33,940 individuals with BTI and several controls of people without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including contemporary (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4,983,491), historical (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5,785,273) and vaccinated (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2,566,369) controls. At 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°months after infection, we show that, beyond the first 30Ã¢â‚¬â€°days of illness, compared to contemporary controls, people with BTI exhibited a higher risk of death (hazard ratio (HR)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.75, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.59, 1.93) and incident post-acute sequelae (HRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.50, 95% CI: 1.46, 1.54), including cardiovascular, coagulation and hematologic, gastrointestinal, kidney, mental health, metabolic, musculoskeletal and neurologic disorders. The results were consistent in comparisons versus the historical and vaccinated controls. Compared to people with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were not previously vaccinated (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°113,474), people with BTI exhibited lower risks of death (HRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.66, 95% CI: 0.58, 0.74) and incident post-acute sequelae (HRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.85, 95% CI: 0.82, 0.89). Altogether, the findings suggest that vaccination before infection confers only partial protection in the post-acute phase of the disease; hence, reliance on it as a sole mitigation strategy may not optimally reduce long-term health consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The findings emphasize the need for continued optimization of strategies for primary prevention of BTI and will guide development of post-acute care pathways for people with BTI.","Al-Aly, Bowe, Xie","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-022-01840-0","20220525","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-27","",32005,""
"Symptom burden correlates to impairment of diffusion capacity and exercise intolerance in long COVID patients","After acute infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a considerable number of patients remains symptomatic with pathological changes in various organ systems. This study aimed to relate the physical and mental burden of symptoms of long COVID patients to the findings of a somatic evaluation. In patients with persistent long COVID symptoms three months after acute infection we assessed physical and mental health status using the SF-36 questionnaire. The cohort was dichotomised by the results (upper two quartiles vs. lower to quartiles) and compared with regard to transthoracic echocardiography, body plethysmography (including diffusion capacity), capillary blood gas analysis and 6-min walk test (6-MWT). From February 22 to September 13, 2021, 463 patients were prospectively examined, of which 367 completed the SF-36 questionnaire. A positive correlation between initial disease severity (need for hospitalization, intensive care medicine) and resulting symptom burden at follow-up could be demonstrated. Patients with impaired subjective physical and mental status were significantly more likely to be women. There was a significant correlation between symptom severity and reduced exercise tolerance in the 6-MWT (495.6Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°83.7Ã‚Â m vs 549.7Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°71.6Ã‚Â m, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (85.6Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°14.3% of target vs 94.5Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°14.4, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). In long COVID patients, initial disease severity is correlated with symptom burden after at least 3Ã‚Â months of follow-up. Highly symptomatic long COVID patients show impaired diffusion capacity and 6-MWT despite average or mildly affected mechanical lung parameters. It must be further differentiated whether this corresponds to a transient functional impairment or whether it is a matter of defined organ damage.","Kersten, Wolf, Hoyo, HÃƒÂ¼ll, Tadic, AndreÃƒÅ¸, d'Almeida, Scharnbeck, Roder, Beschoner, Rottbauer, Buckert","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-12839-5","20220525","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-27","",32006,""
"Honor endorsement and increased firearm purchasing behavior and intentions during the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from three investigations of US males","Objective: Firearm sales in the U.S. have surged throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Consistent with pre-pandemic trends, individuals tended to purchase firearms for self-protection during COVID-19. In addition to perceptions of both general and pandemic-specific threats motivating protective ownership, this form of ownership is also motivated by those that endorse masculinity norms in U.S. honor cultures. The present research examined the relative motivating influences of various threat perceptions and masculine honor endorsement in predicting reasons for non-COVID-19 firearm ownership, firearm purchasing during COVID-19, and purchase intentions. Method: Three separate samples (total N=2,483) of mostly White U.S. men completed online surveys during different months of COVID-19. Results: Honor endorsement was higher among (1) protective firearm owners compared to non-owners and non-protective owners, (2) firearm owners who purchased a firearm during COVID-19 compared to non-owners and non-purchasing owners, and (3) firearm owners with intentions to purchase firearms in the next year compared to those without intentions and undecided owners. Relative to other predictors (e.g., COVID-19 concerns, dangerous world beliefs), honor endorsement was consistently the strongest predictor of these outcomes. Conclusions: Findings add to the literature by highlighting the strength of honor-endorsement in motivating (protective) firearm ownership. Implications for interpersonal violence and suicide are discussed.","Jarrod E.

"Social bonding boosts health behaviour and psychological wellbeing","At times of turmoil â€“ such as during natural disasters, social upheavals or pandemics â€“ our social bonds can be key to receiving support and gaining certainty about the right course of action. In an analysis combining two global datasets (N= 13,264) collected during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, this study examined how social bonds with close social circles (i.e., family, friends) and extended groups (i.e., country, government, humanity) relate to engagement in health behaviours and psychological wellbeing. Results revealed that only family bonding promoted engagement in health behaviours. Being strongly bonded with both close circles and extended groups predicted less anxiety and depression and better wellbeing, particularly for those who were bonded with a greater number of groups. These findings highlight that close and extended social bonds offer different sources of support and direction during challenging circumstances, and that continuous investment is needed to forge and maintain both.","Bahar Tuncgenc et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E003C-AEA-04A","20220526","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Well-being; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Engineering Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Influence; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; pandemic; cohesion; social connection; depression; wellbeing; social bonding; mental health; identity; fusion; covid-19; anxiety","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-27","",32008,""
