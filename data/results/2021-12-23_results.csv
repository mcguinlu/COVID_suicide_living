"Courting Innovative Diplomacy for Health Safety and Security Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic;the Case of South Africa (preprint)","Notwithstanding its level of socio-economic development, health failure is a threat to any country. Globally, the COVID-19 pandemic is believed to be the greatest threat to the existentiality of humanity since the end of World War II. The level of global interconnectivity also made it the most destructive to human existence. The accelerating growth of the pandemic in South Africa has devastated effects on its economy and cuttingly intensified prior socio-economic challenges and inadvertently, presented South Africa with an unseen and formidable enemy that does not know the differences between South African Black, Coloured, Indian or White. The study used a qualitative research approach, underpinned by the rationality for South Africa, to embrace innovative diplomacy as a means to an end for its health safety and security amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The paper argued that South Africa must innovatively engage the acceptable global mechanisms and other health security measures with focus on its commitment to the goals of its national interests, while strengthening the efficiency of its health initiatives through better-quality governance where both local and international investors are allowed to participate actively in state socio-economic activities that respond to the safety and health security of the emotionalized publics. Thus, in a globalised system of innovation, South Africa needs to see the innovation environment as a steady pipeline of its domestic ability to control the negative effect of COVID-19 on its national health security. The paper concludes that South Africa must begin to invest, modify, and localise the biotechnology industry, and thus serving as a source of employment for the teaming unemployed South Africans.","Adetiba, Toyin Cotties","https://www.google.com/search?q=Courting+Innovative+Diplomacy+for+Health+Safety+and+Security+Amidst+the+COVID-19+Pandemic;the+Case+of+South+Africa+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-23","",24231,""
"Housing, Financial Conditions and Mental Health during a Pandemic (preprint)","The COVID-19 pandemic has been recognised to heavily affect mental health. Because of the nature of the pandemic response, characterised by lockdowns and social distancing, housing has had a particularly important role. Within the British context, this paper looks at the relationship between housing, financial conditions and mental health in the pandemic period along three dimensions: tenure, falling behind with housing payments and access to outdoor space. Using a series of difference-in-differences set ups, I document that the pronounced cross-sectional gradient in reported mental health found in pre-pandemic times across tenure types, with outright homeowners faring best and renters worst, stays largely the same in the pandemic period too. Moreover, existing differences across ability to pay for housing and access to outdoor space are not persistently altered either. In fact, apart from sizeable but short-lived exceptions, the difference in mental health is remarkably constant across the different dimensions, following a same trend over time.","Felici, Marco","https://www.google.com/search?q=Housing,+Financial+Conditions+and+Mental+Health+during+a+Pandemic+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-23","",24232,""
"Does M-Health Based Exercise (Guidance Plus Education) Improve Efficacy in Patients with Chronic Low-Back Pain<U+FF1F>A Preliminary Report on The Interventionâ€™s Significance (preprint)","Background:  The utilization of mobile health (m-health) has rapidly expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic, and there is still a lack of relevant clinical data pertaining to chronic low-back pain(CLBP)management. This study was designed to compare the effectiveness of m-health based exercise (via guidance plus education) versus exercise (via guidance) during CLBP management. Methods: : Participants (n = 40) were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. The intervention group received m-health based exercise (via guidance plus education), whereas the control group received m-health based exercise (via guidance). The exercise prescription video and educational content were sent to participants by the application (app), Ding Talk . Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to test the baselineâ€™s intervention effects, 6-week follow-up, and 18-week follow-up. We selected function(Roland and Morris Disability Questionnaire)and pain intensity (current, mean, and most severe Numeric Rating Scale in the last 2 weeks)as the primary outcomes, changes of negative emotion (depression, anxious), and quality of life as the secondary outcomes. Results: : Timeâ€™s significant effect was found in pain, function, and health-related quality of life in both groups, but time did not show significant interaction effects. Participants were able to use m-based education with their anxiety and depression after treatment, but the relief only lasted until Week 6. No differences were found on the aspect of mental health-related quality of life. Conclusion:  M-health based exercise (via guidance) is a convenient and effective method to treat CLBP. Additionally, plus education is more helpful in improving treatment adherence than guidance only. However, at the last follow-up(18-week), no significant differences were found between the intervention and control groups. Trial registration: The trial was prospectively registered with the Chinese Clinical Trials Registry Number: ChiCTR2000041459(12/26/2020).","Zheng, Fu-ming, Liu, Shu-feng, Zhang, Shanshan, Yu, Qiu-hua, Lo, Wai Leung Ambrose, Li, Ting-ni, Wang, Chuhuai","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-488182/v2","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-23","",24233,""
"Emotion Regulation in Times of COVID-19: A Person-Centered Approach Based on Self-Determination Theory (preprint)","Although the COVID-19 crisis is a worldwide threat to individualsâ€™ physical health and psychological well-being, not all people are equally susceptible to increased ill-being. One potentially important factor in individualsâ€™ vulnerability (versus resilience) to ill- being in the face of stress is emotion regulation. On the basis of Self-Determination Theory, this study examined the role of three emotion regulation styles in individualsâ€™ mental health during the COVID-19 crisis, that is, integration, suppression, and dysregulation. Participants were 6584 adults (77 % female, M age = 45.16 years) who filled out well-validated measures of emotion regulation, depression, anxiety, life satisfaction, and sleep quality. To examine naturally occurring combinations of emotion regulation strategies, hierarchical k-means clustering was performed, yielding 3 profiles: (a) low scores on all strategies (indicating rather low overall levels of worry;27%), (b) high scores on integration only (41%), and (c) high scores on suppression and dysregulation (33%). Participants in the profiles scoring high on suppression and dysregulation displayed a less favorable pattern of outcomes (high ill-being, low life satisfaction, and poorer sleep quality) compared to the other two groups. Between- cluster differences remained significant even when taking into account the corona- related worries experienced by people. Overall, the findings underscore the important role of emotion regulation in individualsâ€™ mental health during mentally challenging periods such as the COVID-19 crisis. Practical implications and directions for future research are discussed.","Waterschoot, Joachim, MorbÃ©e, Sofie, Vermote, Branko, Brenning, Katrijn, Flamant, Nele, Vansteenkiste, Maarten, Soenens, Bart","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/n6hw7","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-23","",24234,""
"Mental health following an initial period of COVID-19 restrictions: findings from a cross-sectional survey in the Republic of Ireland (preprint)","Background : We assessed the mental health of individuals in the general population, during an initial period of easing of COVID-19 restrictions in the Republic of Ireland (RoI). Methods: Data were collected through a nationally representative cross-sectional telephone survey, during the first period of easing of restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic between May and July 2020. Mental health was examined using the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety Depression Scale. Poisson regression analyses were conducted to estimate risk ratios with robust variance estimation of the association between selected demographic factors and the risk of having depression and anxiety symptoms. Results : Of the 1,983 participants, 27.7% (n = 549;95% CI: 0.26 - 0.30) reported depression and anxiety symptoms, while 74 (3.8%;95% CI: 0.03 - 0.05) disclosed self-harm and/or suicidal thoughts. Females (RR: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.37 - 1.87, p &lt; 0.0005), employed individuals who experienced a change in work status (RR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.24 - 1.82, p &lt; 0.0005), participants cocooning due to a health condition (RR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.08 - 1.66, p&lt; 0.01), participants who were self-isolating (RR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.03 - 1.51, p=0.025) and moderate-heavy drinkers (RR: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.09 - 1.47, p&lt;0.01) were at increased risk of depression and anxiety. Young people aged 18-29 years and those in the two lowest income categories were most likely to report self-harm and/or suicidal thoughts. Conclusion : As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, with further waves and associated restrictions, the impact on mental health in the population as a whole and in specific subgroups must be considered.

"Adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures among dental care workers in Vietnam: an online cross-sectional survey (preprint)","An online cross-sectional survey using a ""snowball"" sampling method was carried out to assess the adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures among dental care workers (DCWs) during the pandemic. Six questions concerning the COVID-19 preventive guidelines issued by the Vietnam Ministry of Health were used to evaluate DCWs adherence to preventive measures at dental care clinics. The quality of life of DCWs was assessed using the WHO-5 questionnaire and was defined as low if the total score was less than 13 points. Factors relating to adherence to COVID-19 prevention measures of DCWs were determined by multivariate linear regression analysis. In total, 514 DCWs completed the questionnaire. 37% DCWs rated their quality of life as low. Regression analysis suggested that older age, better quality of life, living in an urban area, and training on COVID-19 prevention were associated with better adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures, while being a dentist and lack of personal protective equipment was associated with less adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures. The pandemic had a significant negative impact on the physical and mental health of DCWs. Therefore, specific national guidelines for the prevention and control of the spread of COVID-19 in dental facilities should be issued.","Tran, Tai Tan, Vo, Thang Van, Hoang, Tuyen Dinh, Hoang, Minh Vu, Tran, Nhu Thi Quynh, Colebunders, Robert","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1160815/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-23","",24236,""
"Relationship Between Sedentary Behavior and Depression Among Japanese Medical Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic: a Cross-sectional Online Survey (preprint)","Background:  Sedentary behavior, particularly prevalent during the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has been shown to lead to depression. In medical students, this could negatively affect the provision of healthcare. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the association between sedentary behavior and depression in Japanese medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: : An online cross-sectional survey was conducted from July 30 to August 30, 2021, using anonymous questionnaire system to assess respondentsâ€™ sociodemographic characteristics, physical activity, sedentary behavior among 1000 Japanese university students. Depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2). The data of 484 respondents (48.4%) were included in a stepwise analysis, where we set the difference between medical and non-medical students as Model 1 and that between medical students with and without depression as Model 2. Results: : In Model 1, medical students were less physically active ( p &lt;0.001), had longer sedentary time ( p &lt;0.001), and had higher PHQ-2 scores ( p =0.048) than non-medical students. Moreover, Model 2 showed that longer sedentary time (OR=1.001, p =0.036) and screen time for leisure (OR=1.003, p =0.002) were associated with depression among medical students. Conclusions: : Based on these results, it is evident that reducing Japanese medical studentsâ€™ sedentary time and leisure screen time can help combat depression during COVID-19 pandemic;thus, these results can guide the development of appropriate interventions to prevent and treat depression.","Tashiro, Tsubasa, Maeda, Noriaki, Tsutsumi, Shogo, Komiya, Makoto, Arima, Satoshi, Mizuta, Rami, Fukui, Kazuki, Nishikawa, Yuichi, Urabe, Yukio","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1095493/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-23","",24237,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 school closure on adolescentsâ€™ use of mental healthcare services in Sweden (preprint)","Background School closures used to contain the COVID-19 pandemic may have negative impacts on studentsâ€™ mental health but credible evidence is scarce. Sweden moved upper-secondary students to remote learning but, as the only country in the OECD, kept schools at lower levers open throughout the pandemic. Methods Using nationwide register data, we estimate the difference in the use of mental healthcare services between upper- and lower-secondary students during the pandemic, and relate this to the same group difference prior to the pandemic. For the main analysis, this difference-in-difference approach is applied to the period April-June 2020 when upper-secondary schools were fully closed. We also study the periods July-December 2020 when upper-secondary schools were largely open, and January-March 2021 when they were partially closed. We study the impact on all contacts with hospitals and specialist psychiatric care due to mental and behavioral disorder, as well as prescriptions for antidepressants, insomnia, and ADHD drugs. Findings Compared with expected rates, the use of mental healthcare services among upper-secondary students fell by -3.71 [CI95 -5.52 to -1.91] cases per 1000 during April-June 2020, largely due to a reduction in depression and anxiety-related diagnoses (-1.49;CI95 [-2.36 to -0.63]) and prescriptions (-1.80;CI95 [-2.93 to -0.68]). This reduction in the use of mental healthcare services corresponds to a 4.36% CI95 [-6.47 to -2.25]) decrease compared to the level prior to the pandemic. The decrease compared to expected rates persists through July-December 2020 (-3.55%;CI95 [-5.38 to -1.71]) and January-March 2021 (-5.23%;CI95 [-7.24 to -3.21]). The reduction is stronger among students in the 2 nd (-5.06%;CI95 [-8.02 to -2.09]) and 3 rd (-4.86%;CI95 [-8.19 to -1.53]) year of upper-secondary school. The decrease is concentrated to students who was not in contact with mental healthcare services earlier in the academic year (-16.70%;CI95 [-22.20 to -11.20]). The relative reduction is largest for unplanned care (-13.88%;CI95 [-19.35 to -8.42]) and care at emergency units (-18.19%;CI95 [-26.44 to -9.92]). Interpretation Closing upper-secondary schools in Sweden reduced use of mental healthcare services. There is no indication of this being due to reduced accessibility. In a setting with no strict lockdown, moving to online teaching for a limited period did not worsen mental health among students in upper-secondary schools.","Svaleryd, Helena, BjÃ¶rkegren, Evelina, Vlachos, Jonas","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.12.21267684","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-23","",24238,""
"Going outdoors, neighbourhood satisfaction and mental health and wellbeing during a COVID-19 lockdown: A fixed-effects analysis (preprint)","The COVID-19 pandemic led to national lockdowns in countries around the world. Whilst lockdowns were shown to be effective in reducing the spread of disease, they were also associated with adverse effects on peopleâ€™s mental health and wellbeing. Previous studies have suggested that time spent outside may have played a role in mitigating these negative effects, but research on this topic remains limited. Therefore, this study was designed to explore the longitudinal associations between going outdoors and peopleâ€™s mental health and wellbeing during the first national lockdown (March-May 2020) in the UK. Data from 35,301 participants from the COVID-19 Social Study were analysed. Fixed effects regression was used to explore the longitudinal association between changes in going outdoors (the number of days spent outside) and changes in depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, life satisfaction and loneliness. A range of household and neighbourhood moderators were examined. Results show that an increase in the number of days spent outside was associated with decreases in depressive and anxiety symptoms and an increase in life satisfaction. No longitudinal association was found with loneliness. Further analysis revealed some moderating effects of household and neighbourhood factors, including living arrangement, perceived walkability satisfaction, and satisfaction with green space/park within neighbourhood. Overall, our analyses showed a positive association between going outdoors and improved mental health and wellbeing during the first COVID-19 lockdown in the UK. Associations were more salient amongst people living with others, and those with greater satisfaction with their neighbourhood walkability and green spaces. These findings are important for formulating guidance for people to stay well at home during pandemics and for the on-going nature-based social prescribing scheme.","Stock, Sarah, Bu, Feifei, Fancourt, Daisy, Mak, Hei Wan","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/8pjmt","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-23","",24239,""
"Psychological Distress among Bangladeshi Dental Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)","Background:  Psychological sufferings are observed among dental students during their academic years, which had been intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objectives: This study assessed the levels and identified factors associated with psychological distress, fear and coping experienced by dental undergraduate students in Bangladesh. Methods: A cross sectional online survey was conducted during October-November, 2021. The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K-10), Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) and Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS) were used in order to assess psychological distress, fear and coping strategies respectively. Results: A total of 327 students participated;the majority (72%) were 19-23 years old and females (75%). One in five participants were infected with COVID-19 and 15% reported contact with COVID-19 cases. Negative financial impact (AOR 3.72, 95%CIs 1.28-10.8), recent or past COVID-19 infection, contact with COVID-19 cases were associated with higher levels of psychological distress;but being a 3rd year student (0.14, 0.04-0.55) and being satisfied about current social life (0.11, 0.03-0.33) were associated with lower levels of psychological distress. Being a 3rd year (0.17, 0.08-0.39) and a 4th year student (0.29, 0.12-0.71) were associated with lower levels of fear. Health care service use and feeling positive about life were associated with medium to high resilience coping.

"Mental Health During COVID-19: A Qualitative Study with Ethnically Diverse Healthcare Workers in the United Kingdom (preprint)","ABSTRACT Introduction Healthcare workers are experiencing deterioration in their mental health due to COVID-19. Ethnic minority populations in the United Kingdom are disproportionately affected by COVID-19, with a higher death rate and poorer physical and mental health outcomes. It is important that healthcare organisations consider the specific context and mental, as well as physical, health needs of an ethnically diverse healthcare workforce in order to better support them during, and after, the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We undertook a qualitative work package as part of the United Kingdom Research study into Ethnicity and COVID-19 outcomes among healthcare workers (UK-REACH). As part of the qualitative research, we conducted focus group discussions with healthcare workers between December 2020 and July 2021, and covered topics such as their experiences, fears and concerns, and perceptions about safety and protection, while working during the pandemic. The purposive sample included ancillary health workers, doctors, nurses, midwives and allied health professionals from diverse ethnic backgrounds. We conducted discussions using Microsoft Teams. Recordings were transcribed and thematically analysed. Findings We carried out 16 focus groups with a total of 61 participants. Several factors were identified which contributed to, and potentially exacerbated, the poor mental health of ethnic minority healthcare workers during this period including anxiety (due to inconsistent protocols and policy);fear (of infection);trauma (due to increased exposure to severe illness and death);guilt (of potentially infecting loved ones);and stress (due to longer working hours and increased workload). Conclusion COVID-19 has affected the mental health of healthcare workers. We identified a number of factors which may be contributing to a deterioration in mental health across diverse ethnic groups. Healthcare organisations should consider developing strategies to counter the negative impact of these factors. This paper will help employers of healthcare workers and other relevant policy makers better understand the wider implications and potential risks of COVID-19 and assist in developing strategies to safeguard the mental health of these healthcare workers going forward, and reduce ethnic disparities. Key messages What is already known about this subject Healthcare Workers (HCWs) are experiencing deterioration of their mental health due to COVID-19 Ethnic minority populations and HCWs are disproportionately affected by COVID-19 More research is needed on the specific factors influencing the mental health of ethnically diverse healthcare workforces What are the new findings Prominent factors influencing the mental health and emotional wellbeing of this population include: anxiety (due to inconsistent protocols and policy) fear (of infection) trauma (due to increased exposure to severe illness and death) guilt (of potentially infecting loved ones) stress (due to longer working hours and increased workload) How might this impact on policy or clinical practice in the foreseeable future Healthcare organisations should consider the specific circumstances of these staff and develop strategies to counter the negative impact of these factors and help safeguard the mental health of their staff","Qureshi, Irtiza, Gogoi, Mayuri, Al-Oraibi, Amani, Wobi, Fatimah, Chaloner, Jonathan, Gray, Laura, Guyatt, Anna, Nellums, Laura, Pareek, Manish","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.13.21267718","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-23","",24241,""
"Assessing equity and the determinants of socio-economic impacts of COVID-19: Results from a cross-sectional survey in three counties in Kenya (preprint)","Background: COVID-19 mitigation measures have major ramifications on all aspects of peopleâ€™s livelihoods. Based on data collected in February 2021, we present an analysis of the socio-economic impacts of COVID-19 mitigation measures in three counties in Kenya. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional phone-based survey in three counties in Kenya to assess the level of disruption across seven domains: income, food insecurity, schooling, domestic tension/violence, communal violence, mental health, and decision-making. An overall disruption index was computed from the seven domains using principal component analysis. We used a linear regression model to examine the determinants of vulnerability to disruptions as measured by the index. We used concentration curves and indices to assess inequality in the disruption domains and the overall disruption index. Results: The level of disruption in income was the highest (74%), while the level of disruption for domestic tension/violence was the lowest (30%). Factors associated with increased vulnerability to the overall disruption index included: older age, being married, belonging in the lowest socio-economic tertile and receiving COVID-19 related assistance. The concentration curves showed that all the seven domains of disruption were disproportionately concentrated among households in the lowest socio-economic tertile, a finding that was supported by the concentration index of the overall disruption index (CI = - 0.022;p = 0.074). Conclusion: The COVID-19 mitigation measures resulted in unintended socio-economic effects that unfairly affected certain vulnerable groups such as those in the lowest socio-economic group and the elderly. Measures to protect households against the adverse socio-economic effects of the pandemic should be scaled up and targeted to the most vulnerable, with attention to the constantly evolving nature of the pandemic.","Oyando, Robinson, Orangi, Stacey, Mwanga, Daniel, Pinchoff, Jessie, Abuya, Timothy, Muluve, Eva, Mbushi, Faith, Austrian, Karen, Barasa, Edwine","https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.17367.1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-23","",24242,""
"The Effects of Family-Centered Empowerment Model on Depression, Anxiety, and Stress of the Family Caregivers of Patients with COVID-19: A Randomized Clinical Trial (preprint)","Background:  Taking care of patients with Covid-19 is regarded as a challenging task for family caregivers. A family-centered empowerment model (FCEM) should help them achieve greater psychological strength in the care process. Methods: : Seventy caregivers were randomized to FCEM (n= 35) or control (n= 35). The four-stage of FCEM in four online sessions through WhatsApp was provided to the intervention group from the patient's discharge until 2 weeks later. The demographic information questionnaire and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 were employed both before and five days after the FCEM sessions to gather the necessary data. Results: : Caregivers included 55.8% women and 44.2% men, with a mean age of 42.5 years. The results demonstrated a substantial difference in the average score of stress (p=0.023), anxiety (p=0.003), and depression (p=0.012). Conclusions: : The combination of a face-to-face orientation session and online methods of FCEM is likely to lower stress, anxiety, and depression among caregivers.

"The impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on older adults with an intellectual disability during the first wave of the pandemic in Ireland (preprint)","Background: People with intellectual disability have increased risk of exposure to and adverse outcomes from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).They also face challenges to mental health and well-being from COVID-19-related social restrictions and service closures. Methods: Data from a supplemental COVID-19 survey from the Intellectual Disability Supplement to the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (IDS-TILDA) (n=710) was used to assess outcomes from the first infection wave of COVID-19 among adults with intellectual disability aged 40+ years in Ireland. Data was gathered on testing, for symptoms and outcomes;procedures to manage COVID-19;and both stress/anxiety and positive experiences during the pandemic. Demographic and health-related data from the main IDS-TILDA dataset was included in analyses. Results: High rates were identified of health conditions associated with poorer COVID-19 outcomes, including overweight/obesity (66.6%, n=365), high cholesterol (38.6%, n=274) and cardiovascular disease (33.7%, n=239). Over half (53.5%, n=380) reported emotional, nervous or psychiatric disorders. Almost two-thirds (62.4%, n=443) were tested for COVID-19, with 10% (n=71) reporting symptoms and 2.5% (n=11) testing positive. There were no instances of COVID-19 related mortality. Common symptoms included fatigue, fever, and cough. Some participants (7.8%, n=55) moved from their usual home, most often to isolate (n=31) or relocate to a family home (n=11). Three-quarters (78.7%) of those who were symptomatic or who tested positive had plans to manage self-isolation and two-thirds were able to comply with guidelines. Over half (55%, n=383) reported some COVID-19 related stress/anxiety;and a similar proportion reported positive aspects during this period (58%, n=381). Conclusions: Our data suggests that people with intellectual disability avoided the worst impacts of COVID-19 during the first infection wave in Ireland. Nevertheless, participantsâ€™ health profiles suggest that this population remains at high risk for adverse infection outcomes. Repeated measures are needed to track health and well-being outcomes across multiple infection waves.","McCarron, Mary, McCausland, Darren, Luus, Retha, Allen, Andrew, Sheerin, Fintan, Burke, Eilish, McGlinchy, Eimear, Flannery, Fidelma, McCallion, Philip","https://doi.org/10.12688/hrbopenres.13238.2","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-23","",24244,""
"Stressors, Manifestations and Course of COVID-19 Related Distress Among Nurses and Midwives in Tasmania (preprint)","Introduction:  The deleterious effects relating to the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of healthcare workers has now been widely established. Understanding how COVID-19 affects their work and life is complex and multidimensional. This longitudinal study describes the critical stressors and how they manifest within both the work and larger social environment for nurses and midwives in Tasmania, Australia. Methods This longitudinal, descriptive survey explores the trajectory of the psychological health of Tasmanian public sector nurses and midwives during the COIVD-19 pandemic. The survey was distributed at 3 timepoints over a 12-month period and consisted of a battery of psychological tests which included the Patient Health Questionnaire, General Anxiety Disorder, Insomnia Severity Index, and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised, together with free text comments. Analysis The associations between outcome and predictor variables were assessed using mixed effects linear regression and linear mixed model analyses. Free text comments were themed. Results High levels of stress and mental exhaustion were attributed to threatened workplace team culture;compromised quality of patient care;the impact on family, home, financial and economic domains;lack of clear communication;issues surrounding personal protective equipment;and female gender. Study data show younger nurses and midwives suffered higher levels of stress and mental exhaustion than older. Conclusion This study highlights the need for stable and functional relationships at home and at work for nurses and midwives. Factors which will help preserve the mental health of nurses and midwives include strong workplace culture with ongoing processes to monitor organisational burnout;building resilience, particularly among younger nurses and midwives;protection of healthcare worker safety;clear communication processes and supporting stable and functional relationships at home. The health service has an imperative to ensure optimum service delivery by safeguarding staff, despite the inevitable health stress imposed by the nature of the work.","Marsden, Kathryn, Porter, Julie, Robertson, I.

"The global prevalence of depression, anxiety, stress and insomnia among general population during COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis (preprint)","This study aimed to examine research findings related to depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study also explored periodic changes in the prevalence of depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia among the general people during this pandemic. We performed a meta-analysis by searching articles from several sources (PubMed, MEDLINE, and GOOGLE SCHOLAR). We used the random-effects models, subgroup analysis, and heterogeneity test approaches. Results show that the prevalence of depression, stress, and insomnia increased during March to April 2020 (30.51%, 29.4%, and 25% respectively) compared to the study period before February 2020 (25.25%, 16.27%, and 22.63% respectively) and followed in May to June 2020 (16.47%, 5.1%, and 19.86 respectively). The prevalence of depression and anxiety from k= 30 studies was 28.18% (95% CI: 23.81-32.54), and 29.57% (95% CI: 24.67-34.47), respectively. And the prevalence of stress (k=13) was 25.18% (95% CI: 14.82 â€“ 35.54) and the prevalence of insomnia (k=12) was 23.50% (95% CI: 16.44 â€“ 30.57). These prevalence estimates during the pandemic are very high compared to normal times. Hence, the governments and policymakers should apply proven strategies and interventions to avoid psychological adversity and improve overall mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Mahmud, Sultan, Mohsin, Md, Dewan, Md Nayem, Muyeed, Abdul","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1136589/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-23","",24246,""
"Acute COVID-19 severity and 16-month mental morbidity trajectories in patient populations of six nations (preprint)","BACKGROUND The aim of this multinational study was to assess the development of adverse mental health symptoms among individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 in the general population by acute infection severity up to 16 months after diagnosis. METHODS Participants consisted of 247 249 individuals from seven cohorts across six countries (Denmark, Estonia, Iceland, Norway, Scotland, and Sweden) recruited from April 2020 through August 2021. We used multivariable Poisson regression to contrast symptom-prevalence of depression, anxiety, COVID-19 related distress, and poor sleep quality among individuals with and without a diagnosis of COVID-19 at entry to respective cohorts by time (0-16 months) from diagnosis. We also applied generalised estimating equations (GEE) analysis to test differences in repeated measures of mental health symptoms before and after COVID-19 diagnosis among individuals ever diagnosed with COVID-19 over time. FINDINGS A total of 9979 individuals (4%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period and presented overall with a higher symptom burden of depression (prevalence ratio [PR] 1.18, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.03-1.36) and poorer sleep quality (1.13, 1.03-1.24) but not with higher levels of symptoms of anxiety or COVID-19 related distress compared with individuals without a COVID-19 diagnosis. While the prevalence of depression and COVID-19 related distress attenuated with time, the trajectories varied significantly by COVID-19 acute infection severity. Individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 but never bedridden due to their illness were consistently at lower risks of depression and anxiety (PR 0.83, 95% CI 0.75-0.91 and 0.77, 0.63-0.94, respectively), while patients bedridden for more than 7 days were persistently at higher risks of symptoms of depression and anxiety (PR 1.61, 95% CI 1.27-2.05 and 1.43, 1.26-1.63, respectively) throughout the 16-month study period.

"Mental health indicators in Sweden over a 12-month period during the COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)","Background The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the lives of people globally and is expected to have profound effects on mental health. Yet, self-reported large-scale online surveys on mental health are still relatively uncommon. Here we aim to describe the mental health burden experienced in Sweden using baseline data of the Omtanke2020 Study. Method Self-reported baseline data collected over a 12-month period (June 9, 2020-June 8, 2021) from the longitudinal online survey of the Omtanke2020 Study including 27,950 adults in Sweden. Participants were volunteers or actively recruited through existing cohorts and after providing informed consent responded to monthly online questionnaires on socio-demographics, mental and physical health, COVID-19 infection, and impact. Poisson regression was fitted to assess the relative risk of high mental health burden (depression, anxiety, and COVID-19 specific PTSD). Result The overall proportion of persons with high level of symptoms was 15.6%, 9.5% and 24.5% for depression, anxiety, and COVID-19 specific PTSD, respectively. Overall, 43.4% of the participants had significant, clinically relevant symptoms for at least one mental health outcome and 7.3% had significant symptoms for all three outcomes. We also observed differences in the prevalence of these symptoms across strata of sex, age, recruitment type, COVID-19 status, region, and seasonality. Conclusion While the proportion of persons with high mental health burden remains higher than in pre-pandemic publications, our estimates are lower than previously reported levels of depression, anxiety, and PTSD during the pandemic in Sweden and elsewhere.","Lovik, AnikÃ³, GonzÃ¡lez-HijÃ³n, Juan, KÃ¤hler, Anna, ValdimarsdÃ³ttir, Unnur, Frans, Emma, Magnusson, Patrik, Pedersen, Nancy, Hall, Per, Czene, Kamila, Sullivan, Patrick, Fang, Fang","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.10.21267338","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-23","",24248,""
"The Effect of the Baduanjin Exercise on the Covid-19-Related Anxiety, Psychological Well-being and Lower Back Pain of College Students During the Pandemic (preprint)","Background:  Baduanjin exercise is recognized as having a beneficial effect on both physical and mental health. However, studies lacked consideration of its potential advantageous outcomes during the coronavirus pandemic. This study aimed to examine the effect of Baduanjin exercise on the COVID-19-related anxiety, psychological well-being, and the lower back pain of college students during the coronavirus pandemic in China. Methods Participants consisted of 387 people, ranging in age from 20 to 30 years (M = 23.55;SD = 3.13), and were randomly divided into two groups: 195 participated in the 12-week Baduanjin exercise program, and 192 learned health knowledge during this time. Subsequently, the two groups were analyzed and compared in terms of an intervention effect on the COVID-19-related anxiety, psychological well-being, and lower back pain. Results The intervention effect on the Baduanjin exercise group was remarkably better than that of the control group (p &lt; 0.05). With the intervention of the Baduanjin exercise, the COVID-19-related anxiety score decreased from 5.22Â±0.45 to 5.07Â±0.27. The total psychological well-being score increased from 70.11Â±8.65 to 84.12Â±7.38, and the prevalence of low back pain decreased from 22.45Â±1.67 to 18.35Â±1.05 among college students. Conclusion During the pandemic, the Baduanjin exercise contributes to the reduction of the perceived anxiety related to the COVID-19, decreases the prevalence of the lower back pain, and improves the psychological well-being of college students.","Li, Keqiang, Walczak-Kozlowska, Tamara, Lipowski, Mariusz, Li, Jianye, Krokosz, Daniel, Fan, Hongying","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1137006/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-23","",24249,""
"Extended Cohort for E-health, Environment and DNA (EXCEED) COVID-19 focus (preprint)","Background: New data collection in established longitudinal population studies provides an opportunity for studying the risk factors and sequelae of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), plus the indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on wellbeing. The Extended Cohort for E-health, Environment and DNA (EXCEED) cohort is a population-based cohort (N&gt;11,000), recruited from 2013 in Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland. EXCEED includes consent for electronic healthcare record (EHR) linkage, spirometry, genomic data, and questionnaire data. Methods: Between May 2020 and July 2021, a new questionnaire was deployed in EXCEED, which captured COVID-19 symptoms, general physical and mental health, plus socioeconomic and environmental factors during the pandemic. An online system was developed to invite new participants to join EXCEED, with informed consent being provided online. New and existing participants then completed the COVID-19 questionnaire online. A subset of the new questionnaire respondents were invited to participate in COVID-19 serology substudies, using home antibody testing kits. Results: In total, 3,693 participants provided COVID-19 infection status (median age 62.9 (IQR 54.7-69.2), 58.9% female). Trends of monthly incidence proportions of COVID-19 in EXCEED (self-report or symptom-predicted) approximated local and national figures. Regression analysis of 2,768 participants with linked EHR data showed no obvious monotonic relationship between number of chronic diseases (of 16 pre-specified diseases) and COVID-19 infection. There were 2,144 participants with valid results from a kit allowing differentiation between antibodies due to vaccination or infection. Of these, 8.5% had results consistent with previous COVID-19 infection, and 85.9% had evidence of COVID-19 vaccination, but without evidence of infection. Conclusions: Enriching EXCEED with a new COVID-19 questionnaire and serology data may improve understanding of the risk factors, clinical sequelae and broader impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population.

"Is sobriety from alcohol necessary for evaluation of patients presenting with suicidal ideation? (preprint)","Background It is commonly assumed that patients intoxicated with alcohol are unreliable with respect to their statements of suicidal intent, however no prior literature evaluates the impact of sobriety on suicidal ideation (SI). In typical emergency department (ED) settings, a common practice is to wait until intoxicated suicidal individuals have reached a legally sober limit (ethanol level less than 80 mg/dL) to evaluate safety. We are not aware of any study that establishes the diagnostic reliability of the clinical suicidal ideation evaluation as a function of alcohol intoxication. Methods This study is a retrospective review of medical records for patients evaluated in a pre-COVID Midwestern ED for one calendar year. Cases were generated for review based on criteria of having a Psychiatric SW (Social Work) consult and blood alcohol level drawn while in the ED on every Wednesday and Friday of 2017 which produced 1084 cases for review. Chi-square analysis was used for comparison of variables of suicidal ideation with or without alcohol intoxication as defined by blood alcohol level (BAL) =80 mg/dL. Results In reference to our initial hypothesis, patients presenting with suicidal ideation and concurrent alcohol intoxication were no longer reporting suicidal ideation at sobriety in 69% of cases, compared to 38% for patients without alcohol levels on presentation. Chi-square analysis demonstrated p=0.000012. Conclusion The goal of the present study was to demonstrate, with empirical data, a relationship between alcohol intoxication and suicidal ideation. Our data suggests that patients presenting to the ED with complaints related to suicidal behavior who are found to have concurrent alcohol intoxication are more likely to deny suicidal ideation when sober than patients with similar presenting complaints and no alcohol intoxication.","Keyes, Daniel, Hardin, Blake, Moore, Brandon","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.06.21267365","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-23","",24251,""
"Back to Life, Back to Reality: A Multi-Level Dynamic Network Analysis of Student Mental Health Upon Return to Campus During the COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)","Lockdown measures during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in drastic disruptions of university studentsâ€™ everyday life and study mode, such as marked reductions in face-to-face teaching activities. Previous research on student mental health during the pandemic found that prolonged campus relocation had negative effects on studentsâ€™ mental well-being. However, these studies focussed on the initial lockdown period, or periods of active lockdown measures. This longitudinal study collected 456 observations of 23 undergraduate students in the Netherlands using ecological momentary assessment data on mental health related items (anxiety, stress, social context) during the first two weeks of on-campus teaching after prolonged lockdown measures. Using multi-level dynamic network modelling, we analysed the temporal and contemporaneous interplay of studentsâ€™ mental health factors following the return to campus in September 2021. On average, students reported low to medium scores on stress and anxiety both before and after the assessment period. Results of network analyses showed that students experienced social unease in relation to accumulating difficulties at university and vice versa. Furthermore, there were clusters of different states of social unease next to clusters of stress, anger, loss of control, and feeling upset. Lastly, we found beneficial effects of self-efficacy on experiencing social comfort in university. We discuss implications for potential interventions in universities, such as the promotion of self-efficacy, providing guidance in structuring study load, as well as help with stress management.","Karnbach, Katharina, Witkowski, Michal, Ebrahimi, Omid, Burger, Julian","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/hekas","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-23","",24252,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Stress and Other Psychological Factors in Pregnant Women Giving Birth During the First Wave of the Pandemic (preprint)","Background:  The onset of mental illness such as depression and anxiety disorders in pregnancy and postpartum period is common. The coronavirus induced disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the resulting public policy responses represent an exceptional situation worldwide and there are hints for adverse psychosocial impact, hence, the study of psychological effects of the pandemic in women during hospitalization for delivery and in the postpartum period is highly relevant. MethodsPatients who gave birth during the first wave of the Corona pandemic in Germany (March to June 2020) at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of WÃ¼rzburg, Germany, were recruited at hospital admission for delivery. Biosamples were collected for analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and various stress hormones and interleukin-6 (IL-6). In addition to sociodemographic and medical obstetric data, survey questionnaires in relation to concerns about and fear of COVID-19, depression, stress, anxiety, loneliness, maternal self-efficacy and the mother-child bonding were administered at T1 (delivery stay) and T2 (3-6 month postpartum).ResultsIn total, all 94 recruited patients had a moderate concern of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) at T1 with a significant rise at T2. This concern correlated with low to low-medium general psychosocial stress levels and stress symptoms, and the women showed a significant increase of active coping from T1 to T2. Anxiety levels were low and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale showed a medium score of 5 with a significant (T1), but only week correlation with the concerns about SARS-CoV-2. In contrast to the overall good maternal bonding without correlation to SARS-CoV-2 concern, the maternal self-efficiency correlated negatively with the obstetric impairment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. ConclusionObstetrical patients` concerns regarding SARS-CoV-2 and the accompanying pandemic increased during the course of the pandemic correlating positively with stress and depression. Of note is the increase in active coping over time and the overall good mother-child-bonding.

"Resilience And Mental Health Among Young Adults In The Context of Lockdown Due To The COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)","Purpose:  Psychological resilience is defined as the ability of an individual to adapt to adverse situations and in a certain way regulate mental health. Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures implemented to avoid infection are considered risk agents for the development of mental disorders. The objective of this study is to explore the relationship between resilience capacity and the presence of depressive symptoms and poor sleep quality in the context of lockdown due to the pandemic. Methods: : The sample consisted of n = 8,426 young adults who were recruited via convenience sampling. Sociodemographic and mental health data was collected through online surveys. Previously validated test were used to collect information on depression and sleep quality. Restriction of mobility was evaluated using information from Google Mobility Reports. Results: : Most of participants were highly educated women. Independently from sex, age and other confounders, individuals with psychological resilience were less likely to develop depressive symptoms or sleep disorders during confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, higher mobility restriction was associated with depression but not with bad sleep quality. In this way, a longest stay at home and a higher restriction of mobility to groceries and pharmacies were related to depression. Conclusions: : These results show evidence of the importance of psychological resilience on mental health, and can contribute to the development of preventive public health interventions to face the negative effects of confinement on mental health.","Guerrero-Vaca, DarÃ­o, Carpio-Arias, Valeria, RodrÃ­guez-Betancourt, AndrÃ©s, Ruiz, Patricio Inca, Vinueza-Veloz, AndrÃ©s Fernando, Loza-Chiriboga, Juan SebastiÃ¡n, PÃ©rez-Haro, JÃ©ssica, Vinueza-Veloz, MarÃ­a Fernanda","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-879006/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-23","",24254,""
"Network Analyses of the Symptoms in the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) and its Associations with Depression, Anxiety, Stress and Alcohol Use (preprint)","Background:  The Covid-19 Pandemic and subsequent actions taken by national/international organizations has generated a large amount of anxiety which may roam into the realm of pathology â€“ COVID Anxiety. In order to measure this phenomenon, measures such as the CAS have been developed. The CAS being a self-report measure of anxiety-related physiologically symptoms that are aroused by information and thoughts related to COVID-19. However, as the CAS is fairly new tit requires validation and examination. This study fulfils this need through the use of Network Analysis. Methods The study used regularized partial correlation network analysis (EBICglasso) to examine the network structure of ratings of COVID anxiety symptoms as presented in the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) and how these symptoms are related to distress (combination of depression, anxiety, stress) and alcohol use. A total of 968 adults from an Australian community sample completed the CAS, and measures of depression, anxiety, stress and alcohol use. Results The findings showed that the most central CAS symptom was abdominal distress, followed by tonic immobility. The symptom with the lowest strength centrality value was dizziness. Also, the network revealed at least moderate effect size connections for tonic immobility with dizziness, sleep disturbances abdominal distress, and for abdominal distress with appetite loss. Additionally, distress was associated positively with dizziness, tonic immobility and appetitive loss. Alcohol use was associated positively with dizziness and abdominal distress, and negatively with tonic immobility and appetitive loss. Conclusions Overall, the findings showed a novel understanding of the structure of the COVID anxiety symptoms in the CAS, and how these symptoms are associated with distress and alcohol use.

Results Of 780 participants, 50% reported that COVID had a negative effect on personal income and 58.3% reported loss in access to TNB peer or friend gatherings (in person or online). Depression and anxiety symptoms increased from pre-pandemic to follow-up, and most participants were above measurement cut-offs for clinical levels during the pandemic. Changes in finances and access to peer gatherings were associated with depression symptoms during the pandemic, but effects depended on level of pre-pandemic depression. For participants with high pre-pandemic depression, financial stability was not protective against increased depression at follow-up. Participants experiencing unprecedentedly high levels of depression during COVID may have pursued more TNB gatherings. Neither financial change nor access to TNB gatherings were associated with pandemic anxiety. Conclusion Findingss: uggest need for a multifaceted approach to mental health programmes and services to address structural barriers, including financial support and meaningful TNB community engagement.","Ghabrial, Monica, Scheim, Ayden, Chih, Caiden, Santos, Heather, Adams, Noah James, Bauer, Greta","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.13.21267077","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-23","",24256,""
"Implementation of telemedicine consultations for people with mental health conditions in the community: a protocol for a systematic review (preprint)","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic response has led to an exponential increase in the use and spread of telemedicine internationally. In community mental health care settings, telemedicine services were implemented within a few weeks, with little time for rigorous planning. Despite the reported acceptability of telemedicine by patients and clinicians, barriers to its implementation have come to light. There is now a need to investigate these barriers, and facilitators, as telemedicine begins to show potential promise beyond the pandemic. We propose a review that aims to identify the factors affecting the implementation of telemedicine consultations for patients with mental health conditions in the community. Methods: A systematic review will be conducted and reported according to the PRISMA guidelines. Five electronic databases will be searched using a pre-defined search strategy from 2016 to 2021. Only studies of synchronous, interactive telemedicine consultations conducted via video, phone or live messaging between patients and providers will be included. Quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods studies will be eligible for inclusion. Only studies published in the English language will be included. Titles and abstracts will be screened by two reviewers. Full text articles will be screened by a single reviewer, with a random 20% sample screened by a second reviewer. The methodological quality of studies will be assessed using the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool (MMAT) by two reviewers. Data will be extracted and tabulated to address the aims of the review. A narrative synthesis will be conducted and reported factors will be mapped to the domains of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Conclusion: By identifying the factors that influence the implementation of telemedicine consultations for patients with mental conditions in the community, consideration can be given to both barriers and facilitators that could be addressed in future mental health services planning.

"Gay, Bisexual and other Men who have Sex with Men (GBMSM) remote mental health help-seeking during Covid-19 (preprint)","Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) experience far worse mental health (MH) than wider society. This disparity was exacerbated by additional â€˜unique to sexual minority statusâ€™ COVID-19 stressors. This sequential, mixed-methods study examined MH help-seeking among GBMSM in the UK and Ireland during the first COVID-19 lockdown. Quantitative survey data (n=1,368), analysed with logistic regression, suggested GBMSM experiencing moderate-to-severe anxiety and those with a past MH diagnosis were most likely to seek MH support. Thematic analysis of qualitative interview (n=18) data identified multiple barriers and enablers to GBMSM seeking MH help, who focused on GBMSM-facing organisations and population-wide online resources. Finally, the behaviour change wheel was used to generate theoretically informed recommendations to promote MH help-seeking among GBMSM in Scotland. We discuss how applying these recommendations in the short, medium and long term will begin to address GBMSMâ€™s MH needs, post COVID-19.","Frankis, Jamie, Strongylou, Dimitra, Kincaid, Ross Andrew, McKenna, Ruth, McDaid, Lisa, Heng, Julian, Hammoud, Mo, Flowers, Paul","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/s76f5","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-23","",24258,""
"Knowledge, Attitudes, Practices and Perceived Barriers Among Mental Health Professionals in Sudanese Psychiatric Hospitals Regarding COVID-19 Outbreak (preprint)","Background:  Since March 11, 2020, COVID-19 has been declared as a pandemic by WHO, it has caused substantial morbidity and mortality globally thus knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) related to the COVID-19 outbreak are one of the priorities in such a pandemic. KAP in a non-COVID facility, such as a psychiatric institution needs to be addressed. Aims: : To assess mental health professionals knowledge, attitude, and practice working Sudanese in psychiatric facilitates Methods:  A cross-sectional self-administered questionnaire targeting the whole population of mental health professionals(MHPs) which is 141, was conducted at three psychiatric facilities in Khartoum state , Sudan. 89 agreed to participate in the study consisting of psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and psychiatric nurses staff participated in the study. Results:  70.8% of MHPâ€™s in this study had adequate knowledge of COVID-19 symptomatology, transmission, management, and preventive measures. 44.9% were not willing to take COVID19 vaccine. Good practices like maintaining quarantine during outbreak and wearing a medical mask were observed. The significant difference found in Spearmanâ€™s correlation was between knowledge and attitude which was negative correlation. Findings showed that MHPs (37.1%,N=33) had positive Practice,(57.3%,N=51) had positive attitude regarding COVID-19. MHPs perceived that lack of an official specialized in infection control ,overcrowding in psychiatric patientsâ€™ room and Lack of policy procedures of infection control practice were the major barriers to infection control. Inferential analysis indicated that Social workers showing higher knowledge (mean=57.95) than other MHPs (P=0.009) and psychiatrist showed higher attitude (62.63). Conclusions:  This study found that MHPs in Sudan have good knowledge, and suggest a special need to scale up facilitiesâ€™ infection control materials to meet the required good practice.","Elhashimi, Fajr, Ibrahim, Mohammed, Taha, Bhaga","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1155614/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-23","",24259,""
"The evolution of depressive symptomatology across three waves of the COVID-19 pandemic: A 17-month representative longitudinal study of the adult population (preprint)","This 17-month longitudinal study on a representative sample of 4,361 Norwegian adults employs an observational ABAB design across six repeated assessments and three pandemic waves to systematically investigate the evolution of depressive symptomatology across all modifications of viral mitigation protocols (VMPs) from their onset to termination. Using Latent Change Score Models to analyze 26,166 observations, the study empirically corroborates that critical fluctuations in depressive symptomatology within and across individuals occur during the first three months of the pandemic, after which symptom trajectories are predominantly consolidated throughout the pandemic period. Contrary to established belief, female sex, young age, lower education and preexisting psychiatric diagnosis only served as adequate predictors of the initial shocks to symptomatology observed during the onset of the pandemic, and did not adequately predict subsequent change and the critical fluctuations observed in symptoms within and across individuals. Population-level trajectories demonstrated that symptom levels increased in accordance with the presence and strictness of VMPs. Upon predominant termination of VMPs, population-level symptoms began declining, while large heterogeneity was present across the adult population. Detrimental long-term adversities were revealed by 10% of the adults. These individuals displayed chaotic adaptation to the pandemic and its VMPs, exhibiting substantial increases in clinical levels of symptomatology ensuing partial re-opening of society and through the remainder of the pandemic, with these deleterious symptoms further projected to remain heightened ahead. Number of times exposed to quarantine was incrementally tied with increases in contemporaneously experienced and long-term depressive adversities, while information obtainment through unmonitored sources was associated with contemporaneous but not long-term states of heightened symptomatology.","Ebrahimi, Omid, Bauer, Daniel, Hoffart, Asle, Johnson, Sverre Urnes","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/kqm4j","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-23","",24260,""
"COVID-19 in French Nursing Homes during the Second Pandemic Wave: A Mixed-Methods Cross-Sectional Study (preprint)","ABSTRACT Introduction French nursing homes were deeply affected by the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, with 38% of all residents infected and 5% dying. Yet, little was done to prepare these facilities for the second pandemic wave, and subsequent outbreak response strategies largely duplicated what had been done in the spring of 2020, regardless of the unique needs of the care home environment. Methods A cross-sectional, mixed-methods study using retrospective, quantitative data from residents of 14 nursing homes between November 2020 and mid-January 2021. Four facilities were purposively selected as qualitative study sites for additional in-person, in-depth interviews in January and February 2021. Results The average attack rate in the 14 participating nursing facilities was 39% among staff and 61% among residents. One-fifth (20) of infected residents ultimately died from COVID-19 and its complications. Failure-to-Thrive-Syndrome (FTTS) was diagnosed in 23% of COVID-positive residents. Those at highest risk of death were men (HR=1.78;IC95: 1.18 â€“ 2.70;p=0.006) with FTTS (HR=4.04;IC95: 1.93 â€“ 8.48;p&lt;0.001) in facilities with delayed implementation of universal FFP2 masking policies (HR=1.05;IC95: 1.02 â€“ 1.07;p&lt;0.001). The lowest mortality was found in residents of facilities with a partial (HR=0.30;IC95: 0.18 â€“ 0.51;p&lt;0.001) or full-time physician on staff (HR=0.20;IC95: 0.08 â€“ 0.53;p=0.001). Significant themes emerging from qualitative analysis centered on (i) the structural, chronic neglect of nursing homes, (ii) the negative effects of the top-down, bureaucratic nature of COVID-19 crisis response, and (iii) the counterproductive effects of lockdowns on both residents and staff. Conclusion Despite high resident mortality during the first pandemic wave, French nursing homes were ill-prepared for the second, with risk factors (especially staffing, lack of medical support, isolation/quarantine policy etc) that affected case fatality and residentsâ€™ and caregiversâ€™ overall well-being and mental health. SUMMARY BOX What is already known? Though much was learned about COVID-19 in nursing homes during the first pandemic wave (Spring 2020), descriptions of the second wave in these facilities is nearly absent from the scientific literature. Prior COVID-19 research in nursing homes has rarely been qualitative and has almost never interviewed care home residents themselves. First-wave research indicated that much stronger outbreak and infection prevention was urgently needed to bolster nursing facilitiesâ€™ preparedness. Higher staff-to-resident ratios, less staff turnover, more masks, better organization, more medical support, and more epidemiological tools were found to reduce COVID-19â€™s impact. What are the new findings? Our results document a lack of preparedness for the second wave, with attack rates among staff (39% overall) and residents (61% overall) similar to levels seen during the first wave peak. Despite authoritiesâ€™ claims to have reinforced these structuresâ€™ readiness, and despite much research into the needs in these environments, preventive measures (like strict lockdowns) remained largely unchanged and had a direct impact on residents, with 23% of COVID-positives also diagnosed with Failure-to-Thrive Syndrome. Qualitative results detailed how ill-suited and inflexible some preventive measures were for residents and staff alike. Participants described precarious and understaffed living and working conditions as substantial and long-standing difficulties that became critical risks during the COVID-19 outbreak, and compromised the response. What do the new findings imply? These results suggest that knowledge gained during the first pandemic wave was not consistently applied to care home policy or practice in France, and that these nursing homes were not always safe environments that considered residentsâ€™ mental health and well-being alongside infection prevention. Despite the high mortality of th first pandemic wave, French nursing homes were ill-prepared for the second. As a 5 th wave descends on France (albeit with much higher COVID-19 vaccination rates), applying the lessons from previous periods (especially with regard to staffing, isolation of the elderly, medical supplies, standard of care procedures) must be prioritized.","Dujmovic, Morgane, Roederer, Thomas, Frison, SÃ©verine, Melki, Carla, Lauvin, Thomas, Grellety, Emmanuel","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.12.21267681","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-23","",24261,""
"Identifying the research advances on COVID-19, the economy and the environment: network- bibliometric analysis and statistical validation (preprint)","The COVID-19 outbreak dictates urgent research responses. The corpus of scientific publications on COVID- 19 is rapidly growing. Differently from health and technical sciences, social and environmental sciences risk to be neglected in this process. Similarly, Environmental Economics falls behind in terms of COVID-19 scholarship. The research note in hand examines and maps up-to-date research progress on the occurring Coronavirus disease, the economy and the environment. To this end, a bibliometric analysis of these three intertwined areas is performed. We constructed a database of the key publications and extracted the keywords co-occurrence network characterising each work. Thus, we studied the structural characteristics â€“ i.e. the density and the centre â€“ sorting from the co-occurrence network. This exercise identifies four communities of relevant keywords, including environmental health, economic impact and lifestyle, which present the maximal mutual interconnection. It is discovered that relevant possibilities and urgency to examine the relationship between the Coronavirus, the economy and the environment exist on the issues and, broadly, in the field of Environmental Economics. The study of environmental facets and environment-economy interplay within the current Coronavirus pandemic claims a larger academic production, resulting not yet relevant and scarcely explored and signals the need to boost public and environmental health scholarship response.

"The impact of screen time and green time on mental health in children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the life of children and adolescents in an unpredecented way, limiting, among others, everyday activities with direct social contacts to mitigate the spread of the virus. These limitations have been associated with worse mental health. Yet, little is known about the underlying mechanisms. In the present study, we focused on two activities that have been likely affected by mitigation measures: screen time and green time. We investigated how screen time and green time influenced each during the pandemic, how they affected childrenâ€™s and adolescents' mental health, and which role socio-demographic characteristics have in predicting screen time, green time, and mental health. We used data collected over between autumn 2020 and spring 2021 from 844 participants aged 5 to 19 of a population-based, prospective cohort study in Ticino, Switzerland. We analyzed the data using an extended version of the Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model with time-invariant socio-demographic covariates and mental health as outcome. Results showed that, at the between-person level, screen time was a risk factor and green time a protective factor of mental health. However, within-person deviations of screen time and green time during the pandemic did not consistently predict mental health. Furthermore, they did not influence each other over time. Gender, age, socio-economic background, Body Mass Index and the availability of green space nearby all influenced stable measures of green time and screen time (i.e., random intercepts). Our results highlight the need for targeted actions to promote green time and raise awareness about the detrimental effect of screen time on childrenâ€™s and adolescentsâ€™ mental health.","Camerini, Anne-Linda, Albanese, Emiliano, M, L.","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/ehbsn","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-23","",24264,""
"A remote lecture series roadmap to equity, diversity, and inclusion in STEM (preprint)","Within a year of the shutdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual meetings transformed from an auxiliary service to an essential work platform for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Universities rapidly accelerated adoption of virtual platforms for remote conferences, classes, and seminars amidst a second crisis testing institutional commitment to the principles of equity, diversity, and inclusion. Here we present thorough guidelines for drawing out hope from the Pandora's box of virtual programming now open to the world. We review milestones from our first year organizing the Diversity and Science Lecture series (DASL) and explore insights into equity, diversity, and inclusion in STEM gleaned from hosted speakers' talk content. Nearly every speaker highlighted the importance of social or interpersonal support to their career progression, and three-fifths of speakers commented on race or ethnicity. Other recurring topics each received attention from a minority of speakers: immigrant identity, gender identity, mental health, sexual minorities, disability, and rural or agricultural background. We conclude with generalizable advice on creating new remote lecture series that benefit executive team members, speakers, and attendees.

"The effect of intolerance of uncertainty on anxiety and depression, and their symptom networks, during the COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)","Individuals vary in their ability to tolerate uncertainty. High intolerance of uncertainty is a known risk factor for mental health problems. In the current study we examined the degree to which intolerance of uncertainty predicted depression and anxiety symptoms and their interrelations across the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined these associations across three time points (May 2020 â€“ April 2021) in an international sample of adults (N = 2087, Mean age = 41.13) from three countries (UK, USA, Australia) with varying degrees of COVID-19 risk. We found that individuals with high and moderate levels of intolerance of uncertainty reported reductions in depression and anxiety symptoms over time. However, symptom levels remained significantly elevated compared to individuals with low intolerance of uncertainty. Individuals with low intolerance of uncertainty had low and stable levels of depression and anxiety across the course of the study. Network analyses further revealed that the relationships between depression and anxiety symptoms became stronger over time among individuals with high intolerance of uncertainty and identified that feeling afraid showed the strongest association with intolerance of uncertainty. Our findings are consistent with previous work identifying intolerance of uncertainty as an important risk factor for mental health problems, especially in times marked by actual health, economic and social uncertainty. The results highlight the need to explore ways to foster resilience among individuals who struggle to tolerate uncertainty, as ongoing and future geopolitical, climate and health threats will likely lead to continued exposure to significant uncertainty.","Andrews, Jack, Li, Meiwei, Minihan, Savannah, Songco, Annabel, Fox, Elaine, Ladouceur, Cecile, Mewton, Louise, moulds, michelle, Pfeifer, Jennifer, Van Harmelen, Anne-Laura, Schweizer, Susanne","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/gtekh","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-23","",24267,""
"Food insecurity and common mental disorders in perinatal women living in low socio-economic settings in Cape Town, South Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cohort study (preprint)","Background:  Common mental disorders (CMDs) such as depression and anxiety are highly prevalent during the perinatal period, and are associated with poverty, food insecurity and domestic violence. We used data collected from perinatal women at two time-points during the COVID-19 pandemic to test the hypotheses that (1) socio-economic adversities at baseline would be associated with higher CMD prevalence at follow-up and (2) worse mental health at baseline would be associated with higher food insecurity prevalence at follow-up. Methods Telephonic interviews were conducted with perinatal women attending healthcare facilities in Cape Town, South Africa. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to model the associations of baseline risk factors with the prevalence of household food insecurity and CMD at 3 months follow-up. Results At baseline 859 women were recruited, of whom 217 (25%) were pregnant, 106 (12%) had probable CMD, and 375 (44%) were severely food insecure. At follow-up (n=634), 22 (4%) were still pregnant, 44 (7%) had probable CMD, and 207 (33%) were severely food insecure. In the multivariable regression model, after controlling for confounders, the odds of being food insecure at follow-up were greater in women who were unemployed [OR=2.05 (1.46-2.87);p&lt;0.001] or had probable CMD [OR=2.37 (1.35-4.18);p=0.003] at baseline;and the odds of probable CMD at follow-up were greater in women with psychological distress [OR=2.81 (1.47-5.39);p=0.002] and abuse [OR=2.47 (1.47-4.39);p=0.007] at baseline.
