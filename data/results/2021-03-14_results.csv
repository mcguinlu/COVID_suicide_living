"Rapid implementation of a cohort for the study of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19","BACKGROUND: As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues and millions remain vulnerable to infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), attention has turned to characterizing post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). METHODS: From April 21 to December 31, 2020, we assembled a cohort of consecutive volunteers who a) had documented history of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positivity; b) were [&ge;] 2 weeks past onset of COVID-19 symptoms or, if asymptomatic, first test for SARS-CoV-2; and c) were able to travel to our site in San Francisco. Participants learned about the study by being identified on medical center-based registries and being notified or by responding to advertisements. At 4-month intervals, we asked participants about physical symptoms that were new or worse compared to the period prior to COVID-19, mental health symptoms and quality of life. We described 4 time periods: 1) acute illness (0-3 weeks), 2) early recovery (3-10 weeks), 3) late recovery 1 (12-20 weeks), and 4) late recovery 2 (28-36 weeks). Blood and oral specimens were collected at each visit. RESULTS: We have, to date, enrolled 179 adults. During acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, 10 had been asymptomatic, 125 symptomatic but not hospitalized, and 44 symptomatic and hospitalized. In the acute phase, the most common symptoms were fatigue, fever, myalgia, cough and anosmia/dysgeusia. During the post-acute phase, fatigue, shortness of breath, concentration problems, headaches, trouble sleeping and anosmia/dysgeusia were the most commonly reported symptoms, but a variety of others were endorsed by at least some participants. Some experienced symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress, as well as difficulties with ambulation and performance of usual activities. The median visual analogue scale value rating of general health was lower at 4 and 8 months (80, interquartile range [IQR]: 70-90; and 80, IQR 75-90) compared to prior to COVID-19 (85; IQR 75-90). Biospecimens were collected at nearly 600 participant-visits. CONCLUSION: Among a cohort of participants enrolled in the post-acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we found many with persistent physical symptoms through 8 months following onset of COVID-19 with an impact on self-rated overall health. The presence of participants with and without symptoms and ample biological specimens will facilitate study of PASC pathogenesis. Similar evaluations in a population-representative sample will be needed to estimate the population-level prevalence of PASC.","Michael J. Peluso; J. Daniel Kelly; Scott Lu; Sarah A.

"Socio-economic impact on epilepsy outside of the nation-wide COVID-19 pandemic area","To identify people with epilepsy (PWE) who required extensive care before the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that had world-wide impacts on medical care and on socio-economic conditions. Consecutive PWE who were treated at the epilepsy center of Hiroshima University Hospital, which was located in the COVID-19 non-pandemic area, between March 2019 and August 2020 were enrolled. We evaluated clinical and socioeconomic factors that were associated with seizure exacerbation (an increase in seizure frequency) during the first 6Ã¢â‚¬Â¯months after the COVID-19 pandemic started compared with the previous 6Ã¢â‚¬Â¯months. Among the 196 PWE who were evaluated (mean age was 37.8Ã¢â‚¬Â¯Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬Â¯16.2Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years), there were 33 PWE (16.8%) whose seizure frequency had increased after the pandemic began. People with epilepsy with a seizure increase showed a significant association with living alone (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001), a higher seizure frequency (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001), negative findings on MRI (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.020), history of dissociative seizure (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001), mood disorders (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001), insomnia (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001), and high psychological stress levels (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.024) at baseline compared with PWE without seizure exacerbation. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that &quot;living alone&quot; (odds ratio (OR) 3.69; 95%CI 1.29-10.52), &quot;high seizure frequency at baseline&quot; (OR 4.53; 95%CI 1.63-12.57), and &quot;comorbidity of insomnia&quot; (OR 9.55; 95%CI 3.71-24.55) were independently associated with seizure exacerbation. Even in the non-pandemic area, PWE had seizure exacerbation, suggesting that clinicians should screen patients' mental health before the outbreak to provide care, reduce the burden, and prevent social isolation in PWE. This should be addressed particularly in patients with medically refractory seizures with insomnia who live alone.","Neshige, Aoki, Shishido, Morino, Iida, Maruyama","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.107886","20210313","Depression; Epidemic; Insomnia; Psychiatric nonepileptic seizure; Social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-14","",11892,""
"The disparate impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of female and male caregivers","Caregiver mental health is crucial to the wellbeing of children. This is most apparent when caregivers face high levels of stress or life adversity. To study this phenomenon in the current global context, this study examined the relation between stress/disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic and the mental health of female and male caregivers. Pre-pandemic childhood adversity was considered as a moderator of this association. A multi-national sample (United Kingdom, 76%; United States, 19%; Canada, 4%, and Australia, 1%) was recruited in May 2020, of whom 348 female and 143 male caregivers of 5-18 year-old children provided data on the constructs of interest. At this time, caregivers reported on their history of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and COVID stress/disruption. About two months later (July 2020) caregiver mental health was evaluated. We examined differences between female and male caregivers on ACEs, COVID stress/disruption, and mental health (distress, anxiety, substance use, and posttraumatic stress). Main and interactive effects of ACEs and COVID stress/disruption on each mental health outcome were examined. Female caregivers reported higher COVID stress/disruption, more ACEs, and greater distress, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress symptoms compared to male caregivers. Among female caregivers, higher COVID stress/disruption and more adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) independently predicted all mental health outcomes, consistent with a stress accumulation model. Among male caregivers, a pattern of interactions between COVID stress/disruption and ACEs suggested that the effects of COVID stress/disruption on mental health was stronger for those with higher ACEs, especially for substance use, consistent with a stress sensitization model. Higher levels of stress and mental health difficulties among female caregivers suggests a disproportionate burden due to pandemic-related disruption compared to male caregivers. Findings speak to the disparate effects of COVID-19 on the mental health of female compared to male caregivers, and the role of pre-existing vulnerabilities in shaping current adaptation.","Wade, Prime, Johnson, May, Jenkins, Browne","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.113801","20210313","ACEs; COVID-19; Caregivers; Early adversity; Mental health; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-14","",11893,""

"The impact of COVID-19 lockdown on disordered eating behaviors: the mediation role of psychological distress","This study aimed to explore the early associations between the experienced psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis during lockdown, depressive symptomatology, anxiety/stress levels, and disordered eating behaviors in adults during a first COVID-19 lockdown period. This was aÃ‚Â community-basedÃ‚Â cross-sectional studyÃ‚Â assessing 254 Portuguese adults (82.7% women; 35.82Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°11.82Ã‚Â years) 1 week after the end of the first mandatory COVID-19 lockdown in Portugal. An online survey was conducted to evaluate psychological distress, disordered eating, and psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Pearson correlations and Structural Equation Modeling were performed. Participants reported the presence of meal skipping (52.8%), grazing eating behavior (80.9%), overeating (81.0%), loss of control over eating (47.2%), and binge eating episodes (39.2%) during lockdown. Structural equation modeling analyses, controlling for age and sex, indicated that there was a significant indirect effect of the experienced psychosocial impact of COVID-19 pandemic on disordered eating behaviors mediated through psychological distress. The psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis may lead to disordered eating, and this relation may occur through the elevation of psychological distress. These findings can be used to inform interventions, to enhance mental health and manage disordered eating during similar future situations.

"A pilot study of burnout and long covid in senior specialist doctors","Covid-19 has placed unprecedented demand on healthcare systems and on healthcare professionals. There have been concerns about the risk of distress, moral injury and burnout among healthcare professionals, especially doctors. To assess the effect of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic on Irish doctors by investigating the incidence of burnout and long covid among senior medical staff in Ireland. This is a cross-sectional pilot study of the prevalence of burnout and long covid among senior physicians. A survey was sent by email to members of the Irish Hospital Consultant's Association. The survey included measures of mental and physical health and the 2-item Maslach Burnout Scale (MBS-2). The study explored the experience of delivering health care in the context of a pandemic and experience of the long covid syndrome. A total of 114 responses were received. Three-quarters 77% (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 88) screened positive for burnout on the MBS, with mean score of 5.6 (SD3.3), nearly double the cut-off for burnout. Nearly two-thirds (64%, nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 72) reported that Covid-19 has had an adverse effect on their mental health. One-quarter reported that they or colleagues had experience of 'long-covid' secondary to the virus. More comprehensive evaluation of the effect of the pandemic on front-line staff is needed to identify the extent of the problem and the factors which contribute to it. This will inform measures to mitigate these effects.","Doherty, Colleran, Durcan, Irvine, Barrett","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11845-021-02594-3","20210313","Burnout; Covid-19; Emotional exhaustion; Moral distress; Resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-14","",11896,""
