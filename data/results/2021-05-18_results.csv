"Mitigating the psychological impacts of COVID-19 restrictions: The Behavioural Activation in Social Isolation (BASIL) pilot randomised controlled trial to prevent depression and loneliness among older people with long term conditions","Background Older adults with long-term conditions have become more socially isolated (often due to advice to shield to protect them from COVID-19) and are thus at particular risk of depression and loneliness. There is a need for brief scalable psychosocial interventions to mitigate the psychological impacts of social isolation. Behavioural Activation is a plausible intervention, but a trial is needed. Methods We undertook an external randomised pilot trial (ISRCTN94091479) designed to test recruitment, retention and engagement with, and the acceptability and preliminary effects of the intervention. Participants aged [&ge;] 65 years with two or more long-term conditions were recruited between June and October 2020. Behavioural Activation was offered to intervention participants (n=47), and control participants received usual care (n=49). Findings Remote recruitment was possible and 45/47 (95.7%) randomised to the intervention completed one or more sessions (median 6 sessions). 90 (93.8%) completed the one month follow-up, and 86 (89.6%) completed the three month follow-up. The between-group comparison for the primary clinical outcome at one month was an adjusted between group mean difference of -0.50 PHQ-9 points (95% CI -2.01 to 1.01), but only a small number of participants had completed the intervention at this point. At three months, the PHQ-9 adjusted mean difference was 0.19 (95% CI -1.36 to 1.75). When we examined loneliness, the between-group difference in the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness scale at one month was 0.28 (95% CI -0.51 to 1.06), and there was statistically significant between group difference at three months (-0.87; 95% CI -1.56 to -0.18). Participants who withdrew had minimal depressive symptoms at entry. Interpretation Behavioural Activation is a plausible intervention to mitigate the psychological impacts of COVID-19 isolation for older adults. The intervention can be delivered remotely and at scale, but should be reserved for older adults with evidence of depressive symptoms. The significant reduction in loneliness is unlikely to be a chance finding, and this will now be confirmed in a fully powered RCT.

"THE US MIDLIFE MORTALITY CRISIS CONTINUES: INCREASED DEATH RATES FROM CAUSES OTHER THAN COVID-19 DURING 2020","COVID-19 has prematurely ended many lives, particularly among the oldest Americans, but the pandemic has also had an indirect effect on health and non-COVID mortality among the working-age population, who have suffered the brunt of the economic consequences. This analysis quantifies the changes in mortality for selected causes of death during the COVID 19 pandemic up to December 31, 2020, and investigates whether the levels of excess mortality varied by age group. The data comprise national-level monthly death counts by age group and selected causes of death from January 1999 to December 2020 combined with annual mid-year population estimates over the same period. A negative binomial regression model was used to estimate monthly cause-specific excess mortality during 2020 controlling for the pre-pandemic mortality patterns by age, calendar year, and season. To determine whether excess mortality varied by age, we tested interactions between broad age groups and dichotomous indicators for the pre-pandemic (January-February) and the pandemic (March-December) portions of 2020. In relative terms, excess all cause mortality (including COVID-19) peaked in December at ages 25-44 (RR=1.58 relative to 2019, 95% CI=1.50-1.68). Excluding COVID-19, all of the excess mortality occurred between ages 15 and 64, peaking in July among those aged 25-44 (RR=1.45, 95% CI 1.37-1.53). We find notable excess mortality during March-December 2020 for many causes (i.e., influenza/pneumonia, other respiratory diseases, diabetes, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, kidney disease, and external causes), but almost exclusively among young and midlife (aged 25-74) Americans. For those aged 75 and older, there was little excess mortality from causes other than COVID-19 except from Alzheimer's disease. Excess non-COVID mortality may have resulted, at least partly, from incorrectly classified COVID-19 deaths, but neither misclassification nor an atypical flu season that disproportionately affected younger people is likely to explain the increase in mortality from external causes, which was evident even during January-February 2020. Exploratory analyses suggest that drug-related mortality may be driving the early rise in external mortality. The growth in drug overdoses well before there was any hint of a pandemic suggests it is probably not solely an indirect effect of COVID-19, although the pandemic may have exacerbated the problem.","Dana A Glei","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.17.21257241","20210518","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-18","",13760,""
