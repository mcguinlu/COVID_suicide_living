"Black and Native Overdose Mortality Overtook that of White Individuals During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Drug overdose mortality rates have increased sharply during the COVID-19 pandemic. In recent years, overdose death rates were rising most rapidly among racial/ethnic minority communities. The pandemic has disproportionately affected communities of color in a wide swath of health, social, and economic outcomes. Careful attention is therefore warranted to trends in overdose mortality by race/ethnicity during COVID-19. We calculated total drug overdose death rates per 100,000 population by race/ethnicity for the 1999-2020 time period. We find that Black overdose mortality overtook that of White individuals in 2020 for the first time since 1999. Between 2019 and 2020 Black individuals had the largest percent increase in overdose mortality, of 48.8%, compared to 26.3% among White individuals. In 2020, Black overdose death rates rose to 36.8 per 100,000, representing 16.3% higher than the rate for White individuals for the same period. American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) individuals experienced the highest rate of overdose mortality in 2020, of 41.4 per 100,000, representing 30.8% higher than the rate among White individuals. Our findings suggest that drug overdose mortality is increasingly becoming a racial justice issue in the United States and appears to have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Providing individuals with a safer supply of drugs, closing gaps in access to MOUD and harm reductions services, and ending routine incarceration of individuals with substance use disorders represent urgently needed, evidence-based strategies that can be employed to reduce rising inequalities in overdose.","Joseph Friedman; Helena Hansen","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.11.02.21265668","20211103","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-04","",19826,""
"The impact of the initial and 2nd national COVID-19 lockdown on mental health in young people with and without pre-existing depressive symptoms","Background The evidence on mental well-being and loneliness among young people during the initial lockdown is mixed, and little is known about the long-lasting impact of the sequential lockdowns. We examine changes in young peoples mental health from before to during the initial and second more prolonged lockdown, and whether women and those with pre-existing depressive symptoms were disproportionally impacted. Methods Participants reported on mental health indicators in an ongoing 18-year data collection in the Danish National Birth Cohort and in a COVID-19 survey, including 8 data points: 7 in the initial lockdown, and 1 year post. Changes in quality of life (QoL), mental well-being, and loneliness were estimated with random effect linear regressions on longitudinal data (N=32,985), and linear regressions on repeated cross-sections (N=28,579). Findings Interim deterioration in mental well-being and loneliness was observed during the initial lockdown, and only in those without pre-existing depressive symptoms. During the second lockdown, a modest deterioration was again observed for mental well-being and loneliness. QoL likewise only declined among those without pre-existing symptoms, where women showed a greater decline than men. QoL did not normalise during the initial lockdown and remained at lower levels during the second lockdown. These findings were not replicated in the repeated cross-sections. Interpretation Except for an interim decrease in mental health during lockdown, and only in those without pre-existing depressive symptoms, this studys findings do not suggest a substantial detrimental impact of the lockdowns. Potential methodological differences in-between studies are a possible explanation for the mixed evidence.

"[Increase of depressive symptoms among adolescents during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Germany : Results from the German family panel pairfam]","The COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed social life within aÃ‚Â very short time. Lockdown policies often consider the tradeoff between containing the spread of the pandemic and negative consequences for the economy. Policymakers should pay more attention to the psychological and social impacts of the lockdown. How did the mental health of adolescents in Germany change during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown? Analyses are based on longitudinal data from nationwide randomly selected anchors of the German family panel pairfam. The age group considered here, born between 2001 and 2003, was surveyed for the first time in 2018/2019 in the course of aÃ‚Â refreshment sample, and 854 of these adolescents and young adults aged 16-19 also participated in the COVID-19 supplementary survey from May to July 2020 (first lockdown). Depressiveness is assessed with the State-Trait Depression Scale. During the first lockdown, adolescents show aÃ‚Â significant increase in depressive symptoms. Prior to the lockdown, 10.4% had clinically relevant depressive symptoms [95% CI: 8.4; 12.5]. In spring 2020, the prevalence increased to 25.3% [95% CI: 22.4; 28.2]. Young women have aÃ‚Â significantly higher risk of developing depressive symptoms than men of the same age. Immigrant background is an equally strong risk factor. The prevalence of depressive symptoms among adolescents with an immigrant background increased from 11% to 33%. To address this increased mental health risk and the inequalities, policymakers and society should ensure access and availability of target-group-specific and low-threshold prevention and counselling. HINTERGRUND: Die COVID-19-Pandemie (Corona Virus Disease 2019) hat innerhalb kÃƒÂ¼rzester Zeit das gesellschaftliche Leben grundlegend verÃƒÂ¤ndert. Bei politischen Entscheidungen steht oft die AbwÃƒÂ¤gung zwischen der PandemiebekÃƒÂ¤mpfung und den mÃƒÂ¶glichen negativen wirtschaftlichen Konsequenzen im Vordergrund. Zunehmend finden jedoch auch die psychologischen und sozialen Auswirkungen des Lockdowns Beachtung. Wie hat sich die psychische Gesundheit von Jugendlichen und jungen Erwachsenen in Deutschland wÃƒÂ¤hrend der ersten Welle der COVID-19-Pandemie und der dadurch bedingten KontaktbeschrÃƒÂ¤nkungen in Deutschland verÃƒÂ¤ndert?

Die DepressivitÃƒÂ¤t wird mit der State-Trait Depression Scale erhoben. WÃƒÂ¤hrend des ersten Lockdowns zeigte sich bei den jungen Menschen ein deutlicher Anstieg depressiver Symptome: Vor dem Lockdown hatten 10,4Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% klinisch relevante depressive Symptome [95Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%-KI: 8,4; 12,5], im FrÃƒÂ¼hjahr 2020 stieg dieser Anteil auf 25,3Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% [95Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%-KI: 22,4; 28,2]. Das Risiko, depressive Symptome zu entwickeln, war bei weiblichen Jugendlichen und jungen Frauen erhÃƒÂ¶ht.

"[Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among children and adolescents in Germany-an overview]","SARS-CoVÃ¢â‚¬â€˜2 serologic studies complement and expand findings from confirmed COVID-19Ã‚Â cases through identification of undetected cases. This article summarizes previous results on SARS-CoVÃ¢â‚¬â€˜2 prevalence from seroepidemiological studies in Germany focusing on children and adolescents and complements the already existing overview on seroprevalence in adults from general population samples and especially blood donors in Germany. The results are based on an ongoing systematic search in study registries, in literature databases, of preprint publications, and of media reports of seroepidemiological studies in Germany and their results. As of 17 September 2021, we are aware of 16Ã‚Â German seroepidemiological studies focusing on children and adolescents. Results are available for nine of these studies. For almost all settings studied, SARS-CoVÃ¢â‚¬â€˜2 seroprevalence was well below 1% for preschool and elementary school children in the first COVID-19 wave and below 2% for adolescents. As the pandemic progressed, higher seroprevalences of up to 8% were found in elementary school children. Results of SARS-CoVÃ¢â‚¬â€˜2 antibody studies in children and adolescents in Germany are scarce so far and are based on non-representative samples at local or regional level. In future studies, it is necessary on the one hand to estimate which proportion of children and adolescents has already either had an infection or has been vaccinated. On the other hand, it is important to investigate physical and mental health impairments that occur after an infection.

"Elevated depressive symptoms among newer and younger healthcare workers in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic","Depression is a frequent outcome of long-term stress, but no studies have examined depression rates among Japanese healthcare workers fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we conducted a web-based interview of hospital employees to assess depression prevalence and factors. This observational cohort study was conducted from July to August, 2020, as part of a mandatory health checkup of Juntendo University Hospital employees (Tokyo, Japan). A total of 4239 participants completed a web-based questionnaire on medical history and current health status. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was used for self-assessment, with a score of Ã¢â€°Â¥16 considered to indicate depression. Among all employees, the proportion of depression was 31.3% in 2020, the highest measured in the last 10Ã‚Â years and substantially greater than the pre-pandemic value in 2019 (27.5%). The proportion of depression for 2020 was significantly higher in new recruits than in employees with more than 2Ã‚Â years of experience (47.0% vs 29.9%, respectively, PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .0001) and in new recruits in 2019 (26.4%, PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .0001). When subdivided by occupation, nurses demonstrated the highest depression rate (43.2%), followed by paramedics (35.1%) and clerks (31.6%), whereas residents (22.9%), doctors (20.4%), teaching staff (18.0%), and part-time staff (15.3%) reported lower depression rates. The positive CES-D score significantly correlated with age (PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .0001). Younger and newer employees demonstrated the highest rates of depression independent of occupation. Therefore, mental healthcare programs focusing on these vulnerable groups need to be established.","Katsuta, Ito, Fukuda, Seyama, Hori, Shida, Nagura, Nojiri, Sato","https://doi.org/10.1002/npr2.12217","20211103","COVID-19; Japan; SARS-COVID-2; clinical; depression; epidemiology of mental disorders; healthcare workers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-04","",19831,""
"Attitudes and Intentions of US Veterans Regarding COVID-19 Vaccination","Compared with the general population, veterans are at high risk for COVID-19 and have a complex relationship with the government. This potentially affects their attitudes toward receiving COVID-19 vaccines. To assess veterans' attitudes toward and intentions to receive COVID-19 vaccines. This cross-sectional web-based survey study used data from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Survey of Healthcare Experiences of Patients' Veterans Insight Panel, fielded between March 12 and 28, 2021. Of 3420 veterans who were sent a link to complete a 58-item web-based survey, 1178 veterans (34%) completed the survey. Data were analyzed from April 1 to August 25, 2021. Veterans eligible for COVID-19 vaccines. The outcomes of interest were veterans' experiences with COVID-19, vaccination status and intention groups, reasons for receiving or not receiving a vaccine, self-reported health status, and trusted and preferred sources of information about COVID-19 vaccines. Reasons for not getting vaccinated were classified into categories of vaccine deliberation, dissent, distrust, indifference, skepticism, and policy and processes. Among 1178 respondents, 974 (83%) were men, 130 (11%) were women, and 141 (12%) were transgender or nonbinary; 58 respondents (5%) were Black, 54 veterans (5%) were Hispanic or Latino, and 987 veterans (84%) were non-Hispanic White. The mean (SD) age of respondents was 66.7 (10.1) years. A total of 817 respondents (71%) self-reported being vaccinated against COVID-19. Of 339 respondents (29%) who were not vaccinated, those unsure of getting vaccinated were more likely to report fair or poor overall health (32 respondents [43%]) and mental health (33 respondents [44%]) than other nonvaccinated groups (overall health: range, 20%-32%; mental health: range, 18%-40%). Top reasons for not being vaccinated were skepticism (120 respondents [36%] were concerned about side effects; 65 respondents [20%] preferred using few medications; 63 respondents [19%] preferred gaining natural immunity), deliberation (74 respondents [22%] preferred to wait because vaccine is new), and distrust (61 respondents [18%] did not trust the health care system). Among respondents who were vaccinated, preventing oneself from getting sick (462 respondents [57%]) and contributing to the end of the COVID-19 pandemic (453 respondents [56%]) were top reasons for getting vaccinated. All veterans reported the VA as 1 of their top trusted sources of information. The proportion of respondents trusting their VA health care practitioner as a source of vaccine information was higher among those unsure about vaccination compared with those who indicated they would definitely not or probably not get vaccinated (18 respondents [26%] vs 15 respondents [15%]). There were no significant associations between vaccine intention groups and age (Ãâ€¡24Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.90; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.21) or gender (Ãâ€¡22Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.99; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.14). These findings provide information needed to develop trusted messages used in conversations between VA health care practitioners and veterans addressing specific vaccine hesitancy reasons, as well as those in worse health. Conversations need to emphasize societal reasons for getting vaccinated and benefits to one's own health.","Jasuja, Meterko, Bradshaw, Carbonaro, Clayman, LoBrutto, Miano, Maguire, Midboe, Asch, Gifford, McInnes, Elwy","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.32548","20211103","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-04","",19832,""

"Changes in Self-Reported Web-Based Gambling Activity During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional Study","The COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜19 pandemic has affected not only somatic health with over 3.7 million deaths worldwide, but also has had a huge impact on psychological health, creating what amounts to a mental health crisis. The negative effect of the pandemic on traditional addictions is well described and concerning, and the same has been seen for gambling. This study explores self-reported web-based gambling behavior during the COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜19 pandemic in Sweden. We investigated overall changes, but also changes in specific web-based gambling types, and whether they are associated with certain risk factors or lifestyle changes. Our study is based on an anonymous web-based survey of web panel participants in Sweden (N=1501) designed to study a range of behavioral changes during the COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜19 pandemic. Increases in gambling were analyzed using logistic regression models against sociodemographic data and psychological distress. The majority of the respondents who gambled reported no changes in their gambling habits during the COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜19 pandemic. We found significant associations with the problem gambling severity index (PGSI), the Kessler score (indicating psychological distress), employment status, changes in alcohol habits, and self-exclusion when looking at overall changes in gambling activity in the pandemic. In the subgroup that reported an increase in gambling activity, we found an association with both the PGSI and Kessler scores. The PGSI score was also an independent predictor for all specific web-based gambling (horses, sports, poker, and casino) whereas the Kessler score only had a significant impact on changes in casino gambling. In addition, male gender was an independent predictor for gambling on sports and casino gambling. The majority of respondents who gambled reported no changes in their gambling activity during the COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜19 pandemic. The group that reported an increase in overall gambling activity during the COVID-19 pandemic represent a group with gambling problems and psychological distress. The group that reported increased sports and casino gambling were often male, and this group seemed to experience more psychological distress.","Claesdotter-Knutsson, HÃƒÂ¥kansson","https://doi.org/10.2196/30747","20211103","COVID-19; gender; pandemic; psychological distress; web-based gambling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-04","",19834,""
"Supporting older people experiencing anxiety through non-pharmacological interventions","Anxiety is a debilitating condition that adversely affects people's quality of life. It is challenging to differentiate anxiety from other physical and mental health conditions in older people, particularly those with co-morbid dementia or depression. The coronavirus 2019 pandemic has compounded social isolation and loneliness in older people, causing increased levels of anxiety. Nurses need to be able to detect and assess anxiety in older people and offer short, low-intensity interventions to support older people's mental health or refer them to specialist assessment and treatment. While research on anxiety in older people is lacking, cognitive behavioural therapy, mindfulness, yoga, music therapy and pleasant activities have shown potential as non-pharmacological interventions for alleviating anxiety in older people.

"Suicide associated with COVID-19 infection: an immunological point of view","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic and leading cause of death. Beyond the deaths directly caused by the virus and the suicides related to the psychological response to the dramatic changes as socioeconomic related to the pandemic, there might also be suicides related to the inflammatory responses of the infection. Infection induces inflammation as a cytokine storm, and there is an increasing number of studies that report a relationship between infection and suicide. We searched the World Health Organization status report and the PubMed database for keywords (COVID-19, suicide, infection, inflammation, cytokines), and reviewed five cytokine pathways between suicide and inflammation using two meta-analyses and two observational studies starting from November 31, 2020, focusing on the relationship between suicide and inflammation by infection. First, we discussed existing evidence explaining the relationship between suicidal behaviors and inflammation. Second, we summarized the inflammatory features found in COVID-19 patients. Finally, we highlight the potential for these factors to affect the risk of suicide in COVID-19 patients. Patients infected with COVID-19 have high amounts of IL-1ÃŽÂ², IFN-ÃŽÂ³, IP10, and MCP1, which may lead to Th1 cell response activation. Also, Th2 cytokines (e.g., IL-4 and IL-10) were increased in COVID-19 infection. In COVID-19 patients, neurological conditions, like headache, dizziness, ataxia, seizures, and others have been observed. COVID-19 pandemic can serve as a significant environmental factor contributing directly to increased suicide risk; the role of inflammation by an infection should not be overlooked.","Choi, Yang, Lee, Kim, Oh, Lee, Stubbs, Lee, Koyanagi, Hong, Ghayda, Hwang, Dragioti, Jacob, Carvalho, Radua, Thompson, Smith, Fornaro, Stickley, Bettac, Han, Kronbichler, Yon, Lee, Shin, Lee, Solmi","https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202110_27013","20211103","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-04","",19836,""

Studies addressing caregivers of adolescents with a mental health diagnosis were small-scale, although suggested virtual modalities are positively received and viable alternatives to other delivery methods with potential for equivalent outcomes. Five randomized control trials involving caregivers of 'at-risk' adolescents reported improved parental knowledge, but mixed effects on family functioning. Preliminary evidence suggests flexible online options including professional and peer support, to respond to carers' busy lives are needed to maximize benefits. Content that is sufficiently individualized and targeted to address the diverse needs of parents, as well as other caregivers, is also required. Well-being and self-care, in addition to parenting skills should be given more consideration in online interventions. Examination of the value of support from peers is also warranted.","Migliorini, Lam, Harvey","https://doi.org/10.1111/eip.13230","20211103","Carers; adolescent (13-18); internet-based intervention; mental health; young adult (19-24)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-04","",19838,""
"Nursing home staff mental health during the Covid-19 pandemic in the Republic of Ireland","Nursing homes for older adults have been disproportionately affected by the Covid-19 pandemic with increased mortality of residents and staff distress. To quantify the mental health of nursing home staff during the Covid-19 pandemic in the Republic of Ireland. /Methods: Cross-sectional anonymous study of Republic of Ireland nursing home staff (n=390) during the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Online survey collecting demographic information, Covid-19 exposure history and mental health measures. There were significant differences between nurses, healthcare assistants (HCA) and nonclinical staff history in age, ethnicity, years' experience, history of Covid-19 infection and contact with Covid-19 positive acquaintances. Moderate-severe post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms were found in 45.1% (95%CI 40.2-50.1%) of all staff. A World Health Organisation-5 (WHO-5) wellbeing index score Ã¢â€°Â¤32, indicating low mood, was reported by 38.7% (95% CI, 33.9-43.5%) of staff; significantly more nurses reported low mood. Suicidal ideation and suicide planning were reported respectively by 13.8% (95% CI, 10.4-17.3%) and 9.2% (95% CI, 6.4-12.1%) of participants with no between-group differences. HCAs reported a significantly higher degree of moral injury than nonclinical staff. Nurses were more likely to use approach coping styles than nonclinical staff. Work ability was insufficient in 24.6% (95% CI 20.3-28.9%) of staff. Nursing home staff report high levels of post-traumatic stress, mood disturbance and moral injury during the Covid-19 pandemic. Differences in degree of moral injury, wellbeing and coping styles were found between staff groups, which need to be incorporated into planning supports for this neglected workforce.

"The COVID-19 pandemic's impact on older adults' mental health: Contributing factors, coping strategies, and opportunities for improvement","The COVID -19 pandemic caused a dramatic and unexpected shift in healthcare needs, daily routines and lifestyles that impacted the health and wellbeing of many people, but particularly in the older adult population. Abundance of literature have surfaced describing the negative impact of the pandemic on mental health. Many factors influence the risk of mental illness in older adults during physical distancing, including demographics, socioeconomic status, location, and pre-existing medical and psychiatric comorbidities. This article highlights a summary of these factors, lessons learned throughout this year, and opportunities to mitigate the negative effects of physical isolation in this population.

"Homeless encampments: connecting public health and human rights","The COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbating longstanding issues related to homelessness, including lack of affordable housing, unemployment, poverty, wealth inequality, and ongoing impacts of colonization. Homelessness is often accompanied by narratives rooted in individual blame, criminalization, and reinforcement of substance use and mental health-related stigma. Visible homelessness, in the form of encampments, is a manifestation of government policy failures that neglect to uphold the human right to housing, and demonstrate eroding investments in affordable housing, income and systemic supports. Encampments make visible that some in our community lack basic determinants of health such as food, water, sanitation, safety, and the right to self-determination. In order for public health to effectively and equitably promote health and enact commitments to social justice, we argue that public health must adopt a human rights approach to housing and to homeless encampments. Embracing a human rights perspective means public health would advocate first and foremost for adequate housing and other resources rooted in self-determination of encampment residents. In the absence of housing, public health would uphold human rights through the provision of public health resources and prohibition on evictions of encampments until adequate housing is available.

"Altered Sleep Duration and Poor Quality of Sleep Among Pharmacy Students Amidst COVID-19 Lockdown: A South-Indian Study","The nationwide lockdown enforced due to the spread of coronavirus disease-2019 had a definite impact on sleep. To observe any changes in the duration, pattern and quality of sleep among pharmacy students due to the lockdown. A google form-based cross-sectional and descriptive study was carried out after approval was obtained from the ethical committee in the month of July 2021 among 310 pharmacy students. The validated form was electronically administered after obtaining the informed consent. All the data pertaining to duration, pattern and quality of sleep before and during the lockdown was collected and analyzed using STATA version 16.0. Out of 310 participants, the study revealed an increase in the time needed to fall asleep (<i>p</i> valueÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and in the total duration of sleep (<i>p</i> valueÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001).

"nnTwo-Stage Deep Learning Framework for Discrimination between COVID-19 and Community-Acquired Pneumonia from Chest CT scans","COVID-19 stay threatening the health infrastructure worldwide. Computed tomography (CT) was demonstrated as an informative tool for the recognition, quantification, and diagnosis of this kind of disease. It is urgent to design efficient deep learning (DL) approach to automatically localize and discriminate COVID-19 from other comparable pneumonia on lung CT scans. Thus, this study introduces a novel two-stage DL framework for discriminating COVID-19 from community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) depending on the detected infection region within CT slices. Firstly, a novel U-shaped network is presented to segment the lung area where the infection appears. Then, the concept of transfer learning is applied to the feature extraction network to empower the network capabilities in learning the disease patterns. After that, multi-scale information is captured and pooled via an attention mechanism for powerful classification performance. Thirdly, we propose an infection prediction module that use the infection location to guide the classification decision and hence provides interpretable classification decision. Finally, the proposed model was evaluated on public datasets and achieved great segmentation and classification performance outperforming the cutting-edge studies.","Abdel-Basset, Hawash, Moustafa, Elkomy","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patrec.2021.10.027","20211103","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-04","",19843,""
"Assuaging COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Among Mental Health Clinicians: The Potential of Self-Care","Undoubtedly, the 2019 novel coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, has put mental health clinicians under stress. Despite the promise of self-care in assuaging stress, very few, if any, studies have investigated the impact of self-care on stress among mental health professionals. This <i>exploratory</i> study examined COVID-19 related distress, self-care, and the predictive relationship between the two. Primary data were collected from a sample of mental health social work clinicians in one southeastern state (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1568). Results indicate that participants were experiencing mild peritraumatic distress associated with COVID-19. Participants who were married, identified as heterosexual or straight, financially stable, and in good physical/mental health were experiencing less distress than other mental health clinicians in the sample. Analyses revealed that higher self-care practices predict significantly less distress. Overall, data suggest that self-care can be integral to assuaging distress among mental health clinicians. This study offers insight into how to support mental health practitioners during COVID-19.","Miller, Barnhart, Robinson, Pryor, Arnett","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10615-021-00815-x","20211103","COVID-19; Clinicians; Distress; Mental health; Self-care; Social work","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-04","",19844,""
"[Psychological impact of involvement of medical and psychological emergency unit professionals in the medical and psychological care system of the COVID-19Ã‚Â epidemic]","COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences have put into great difficulty health professionals, and the general population, fostering the emergence of various psychological and psychiatric disorders. Medical and psychological emergency units' mission is the medical and psychological emergency care of people impacted during a traumatic event. Given their expertise in crisis management, they set up an important medical and psychological support system adapted to the health crisis' characteristics. The unusual modalities of intervention, the specific clinic that these professionals faced in this context of great tension may have unsettled workers and generate a psychological impact. This study aims to assess the existence of such repercussions among medical and psychological emergency unit professionals involved in this new system. In all, 313 medical and psychological emergency unit professionals agreed to participate at the online survey. They filled surveys and visual analog scales assessing the difficulties encountered in the system, as well as their level of satisfaction, post-traumatic stress, burnout, level of anxiety and depression and coping strategies put in place. Results show few significant emotional difficulties. However higher scores are found among women, among professionals who felt a negative impact on their personal lives, as well as for those who thought they had been infected with COVID-19. The establishment of coping strategies such as active coping, planning, expressing feelings, positive reinterpretation and acceptance helped to decrease the level of emotional complexities and brought more compassionate satisfaction. We note that participants with more medical and psychological emergency unit experience tend to show less emotional hardship and more compassionate satisfaction. It appears that older as well as younger professionals have lower burnout scores, as do workers who conducted more interviews for the same person. Likewise, participants who were satisfied of the system organization and of the support -Ã‚Â a majority in this studyÃ‚Â - report less emotional challenges and more compassionate satisfaction. Psychological impact in this new system among medical and psychological emergency unit professionals is overall low. It appears that some coping strategies, perceived usefulness, satisfaction with the organization and the received support are associated with a lower level of emotional difficulties. A supportive framework and an operative organization of the medical and psychological emergency unit system in times of crisis has a protective effect on the participants.","Neff, Vancappel, Moioli, Ducrocq, El-Hage, Prieto, Abgrall","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2021.10.006","20211103","Covid-19; Feedback; Health professional; Medical and psychological emergency unit; Psychic adjustment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-04","",19845,""
"COVID-19 Public Stigma Scale (COVID-PSS): development, validation, psychometric analysis and interpretation","Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, social stigma towards COVID-19 infection has become a major component of public discourse and social phenomena. As such, we aimed to develop and validate the COVID-19 Public Stigma Scale (COVID-PSS). National-based survey cross-sectional study during the lockdown in Thailand. We invited the 4004 adult public to complete a set of measurement tools, including the COVID-PSS, global fear of COVID-19, perceived risk of COVID-19 infection, Bogardus Social Distance Scale, Pain Intensity Scale and Insomnia Severity Index. Factor structure dimensionality was constructed and reaffirmed with model fit by exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses and non-parametric item response theory (IRT) analysis. Psychometric properties for validity and reliability were tested. An anchor-based approach was performed for classifying the proper cut-off scores. After factor analysis, IRT analysis and test for model fit, we created the final 10-item COVID-PSS with a three-factor structure: stereotype, prejudice and fear. Face and content validity were established through the public and experts' perspectives. The COVID-PSS was significantly correlated (Spearman rank, 95% CI) with the global fear of COVID-19 (0.68, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.70), perceived risk of COVID-19 infection (0.79, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.80) and the Bogardus Social Distance Scale (0.50, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.53), indicating good convergent validity. The correlation statistics between the COVID-PSS and the Pain Intensity Scale and Insomnia Severity Index were &lt;0.2, supporting the discriminant validity. The reliability of the COVID-PSS was satisfactory, with good internal consistency (Cronbach's ÃŽÂ± of 0.85, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.86) and test-retest reproducibility (intraclass correlation of 0.94, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.96). The proposed cut-off scores were as follows: no/minimal (Ã¢â€°Â¤18), moderate (19-25) and high (Ã¢â€°Â¥26) public stigma towards COVID-19 infection. The COVID-PSS is practical and suitable for measuring stigma towards COVID-19 in a public health survey.

They completed the IES-R, PHQ-9, GAD-7 to assess PTSS, depressive and anxiety symptoms respectively, and the WSAS to investigate functioning impairment. A total of 23.5% of HCWs reported severe PTSS, 22.4% moderate-severe anxiety symptoms, 19.3% moderate-severe depressive symptoms and 22.8% impairment on global functioning impairment. HCWs from the high-exposed regions reported significantly higher scores in all the instruments than those in low-exposed regions. In a multiple linear regression model, PTSS, depressive and anxiety symptoms presented a significant positive association with the functioning impairment. Both PTSS and depression resulted to be independently related to functioning impairment. The cross-sectional design and the use of self-report instruments.

Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, we collected data from 1,511 participants. assessed with demographic information, sleep quality and anxiety symptoms. The participants were asked to compare their recent sleep and sleep during the first outbreak. The Zung's Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) was used to assess their current insomnia severity. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to analyze the association between COVID-19 epidemic and risk of sleep disturbance and anxiety symptom. The overall prevalence of sleep disturbance and anxiety symptoms were 50.8% and 15.3% respectively. People had significantly shorter sleep duration during the second wave of COVID-19(7.3Ã‚Â±1.3) h than the first outbreak (7.5Ã‚Â±1.4)h (p&lt;0.001).

"Depressive symptoms among primary healthcare workers during the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic in the Muscat governorate","With the unprecedented spread of the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, primary healthcare workers (PHCWs) are having to shoulder the increasing weight of this ongoing pandemic. This study explored the rate and covariates of depressive symptoms among PHCWs in the Muscat governorate. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted from 10 May to 10 June 2020 among PHCWs working in all primary healthcares across the Muscat governorate. Data on sociodemographic and risk factors of having at least one underlying physical health condition, a psychiatric history, family history of psychiatric disorders, and direct involvement with COVID-19 positive patients were sought. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was then used to solicit the presence of depressive symptoms. Those with a cutoff point Ã¢â€°Â¥10 were considered as showing depressive symptoms. Logistic regression was used to determine risk factors associated with depressive symptoms in PHCWs after adjusting for all sociodemographic factors. A total of 432 (72%) out of 600 PHCWs with an average age of 39.2 years (SD = 7.8 years) ranging between 25.0 and 75.0 years responded to the survey.

The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of anxiety, depressive symptoms, irritability and loneliness in the elderly aged 60Ã¢â‚¬â€°years and older as a group exposed to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to analyze the relationships between loneliness and mental health of the respondents and sociodemographic variables and chronic diseases. The study was conducted in Poland among 221 individuals aged 60+. The study material was collected using a sociodemographic questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-M) and a revised University of California Los Angeles loneliness scale (R-UCLA). Women accounted for 47.51% and men for 52.49% of study participants; the mean age was 65.18 (SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.06). In total, according to HADS-M, depressive symptoms were present in 19.15% of the participants and borderline states in 14.18% of them. Based on R-UCLA, moderate and moderately high sense of loneliness was present in 58.83% of the participants. Sense of loneliness was significantly correlated with the prevalence of depressive symptoms (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). In this study, one in five participants experienced anxiety and depressive symptoms. Two out of three participants experienced a moderate sense of loneliness. Individuals who displayed a higher level of loneliness also had a higher severity of anxiety level depressive symptoms and irritability. Elderly individuals should be under special care due to their high risk of experiencing physical and mental effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Dziedzic, Idzik, Kobos, Sienkiewicz, Kryczka, Fidecki, WysokiÃ…â€žski","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-12029-4","20211103","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Irritability; Loneliness; Older people 60Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°; Social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-04","",19852,""
"Associations between screen time, physical activity, and depressive symptoms during the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak among Chinese college students","The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerges in China, which spreads rapidly and becomes a public health emergency of international concern. Chinese government has promptly taken quarantine measures to block the transmission of the COVID-19, which may cause deleterious consequences on everyone's behaviors and psychological health. Few studies have examined the associations between behavioral and mental health in different endemic areas. This study aimed to describe screen time (ST), physical activity (PA), and depressive symptoms, as well as their associations among Chinese college students according to different epidemic areas. The study design is cross-sectional using online survey, from 4 to 12 February 2020, 14,789 college students accomplished this online study, participants who did not complete the questionnaire were excluded, and finally this study included 11,787 college students from China. The average age of participants was 20.51 Ã‚Â± 1.88 years. 57.1% of the college students were male. In total, 25.9% of college students reported depression symptoms. ST &gt; 4 h/day was positively correlated with depressive symptoms (ÃŽÂ² = 0.48, 95%CI 0.37-0.59). COVID-19ST &gt; 1 h/day was positively correlated with depressive symptoms (ÃŽÂ² = 0.54, 95%CI 0.43-0.65), compared with COVID-19ST Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.5 h/day. Compared with PA Ã¢â€°Â¥ 3 day/week, PA &lt; 3 day/week was positively associated with depression symptoms (ÃŽÂ² = 0.01, 95%CI 0.008-0.012). Compared with low ST and high PA, there was an interaction association between high ST and low PA on depression (ÃŽÂ² = 0.31, 95%CI 0.26-0.36). Compared with low COVID-19ST and high PA, there was an interaction association between high COVID-19ST and low PA on depression (ÃŽÂ² = 0.37, 95%CI 0.32-0.43). There were also current residence areas differences. Our findings identified that high ST or low PA was positively associated with depressive symptoms independently, and there was also an interactive effect between ST and PA on depressive symptoms.","Zhang, Wu, Tao, Li, Ma, Yu, Sun, Li, Tao","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12199-021-01025-0","20211103","COVID-19; COVID-19ST; College students; Depression; Physical activity; Screen time","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-04","",19853,""
"Dental Emergencies: Perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and wellbeing of dental teams in the UK","The burden of the COVID-19 pandemic has and continues to stretch the healthcare systems and the workforce alike, both nationally and internationally. This is equally true of the dental care systems and the dental workforce which had to respond and act promptly.This paper examines the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and wellbeing of dental teams in the UK and provides insight into not only this impact, but the early signs of mental ill health commonly triggered by life events, anxiety and fear, and often exacerbated by stresses. A sample of an established body of literature and recognised sources are considered. Finally, extracts of common threads from meaningful conversations will be alluded to, shining a light on the current state of the mental health and wellbeing of many in dentistry and the need for intervention and longer-term plans. We are often reminded that this period in time is a marathon not a sprint, the same could perhaps be said about a national response to mental health and wellbeing, as it will take time, but the time to begin is now.","Ellwood","https://doi.org/10.1177/20501684211029425","20211103","COVID-19; Mental health; dental team; dentistry; pandemic; stress; wellbeing; workplace","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-04","",19854,""
"Dentists deployed: an insider's perspective of life on the NHS front line","The COVID-19 pandemic has stretched and overburdened healthcare services within the UK. This national crisis has led to the widespread redeployment of healthcare workers and reorganization of services throughout the NHS in the UK. The flexible and altruistic nature of healthcare workers has been inspiring, and central in the UK's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This article describes the 'first-hand' experience of a secondary care dentist, highlighting the redeployment journey to the emergency department (ED) of a major trauma hospital in the North-West of England during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Powell","https://doi.org/10.1177/20501684211034013","20211103","COVID-19; PPE; mental health; redeployment; triage","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-04","",19855,""
"A comparative study of the psychological impacts of tasks related and unrelated to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on nurses","This study assessed the psychological impact of the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on university hospital nurses. It provides an assessment of mental health issues, including depression, anxiety, distress, and burnout of nurses dealing directly and indirectly with COVID-19. In a web-based, cross-sectional study, 111 nurses from Daegu Catholic University Hospital in Korea were enrolled from August 4 to August 9, 2020. Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Impact of Event Scale-Revised, and Maslach Burnout Inventory were used to assess the psychological symptoms of depression, anxiety, psychological distress, and burnout among the study participants. Of 111 nurses, 35 (31.5%), nine (8.1%), 26 (23.4%), and 49 (44.1%) experienced depression, anxiety, distress, and burnout, respectively. Nurses who performed COVID-19-related tasks were more likely to have moderate depression (related vs. unrelated, 52.0% vs. 25.6%; p=0.037). There were no differences in anxiety, distress, and burnout between nurses with and without COVID-19-related tasks. More than 50% of the participants showed receptive and positive attitudes toward caring for COVID-19 patients. Nurses who performed COVID-19-related tasks had a higher risk of depression. There were no significant differences in anxiety, distress, and burnout between the two groups. Since nurses who perform COVID-19-related tasks are more prone to psychological distress, continued psychiatric interventions are required for infectious disease outbreaks with a high mortality rate for healthcare workers who are emotionally vulnerable.","Kim, Lee","https://doi.org/10.12701/yujm.2021.01361","20211103","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Distress; Psychological burnout","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-04","",19856,""

"Quality can improve as productivity increases: Machining as proof","Increasing productivity is a crucial task, especially during a crisis when a shortage of products occurs. In addition, a major concern related to higher productivity is the loss of quality that may result in an even worse situation than when there is no product. However, this general common sense is not always true. Beyond their roles during a crisis, quality and productivity are key players after the crisis for competitive advantages and economic recovery. It was initially thought that quality and productivity are opposite to each other and need to be compromised. Once an economic crisis occurred in the 1970s, a novel perspective on the qualityâ€“productivity relationship was proposed and played a prominent role in the recovery from that crisis. Researchers such as Deming proposed that productivity can in fact increase as quality increases. This perspective helped people in that crisis and has so far been continually explored in industry and academia. Now, herein, we propose a new perspective that is the reverse of the aforementioned perspective and has its own benefits. We examine it in machining that is a process used in almost all industrial activities. We consider the cutting speed as a productivity (and throughput) measure and the workpiece temperature as a quality metric. We show that why the workpiece temperature may decrease at higher cutting speeds. From various experimental data in the literature, we also realize that the behavior of the workpiece temperature versus the cutting speed is steeper before the peak than that after the peak. We analytically try to explain this observation as well. Then, we analyze our general perspective from three aspects. First, we propose and implement a volume partition analysis. Second, we introduce a new dimension in Taguchiâ€™s view of quality. Third, we introduce the circuit model in the realm of quality and productivity, based on which we develop the mutual interactions between quality and productivity. The proposed perspective in this study is expected to be a helpful mindset change in manufacturing both during and after the COVID-19 crisis.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2021.06.033","20210101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-04","",19859,""
