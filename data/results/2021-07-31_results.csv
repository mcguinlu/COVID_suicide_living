"A Longitudinal Study on the Changes in Mental Health of Healthcare Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic","<i>Objective</i>: This study examines Argentinean health care workers in order to 1) test self-perceived job performance levels and the presence of psychological symptoms compatible with common mental disorders, and 2) examine within-person changes in general discomfort and psychological distress, adjusting for demographic factors, region, and health-related factors during two time points of the COVID-19 pandemic.<i>Method</i>: This longitudinal study comprised 305 healthcare workers who completed a survey at two time points approximately 4 months apart. We used the General Health Questionnaire and the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale to measure mental health outcomes. To address the first aim we calculated differences (Student's <i>t</i> test for paired samples) and correlations (Pearson's <i>r</i> coefficient). To address the second aim we used fixed effects model by means of a multilevel approach, a linear model that considers dependency in the data.<i>Results</i>: Self-perceived job performance deteriorated across time. From the first measurement to the four-month follow-up, more health care workers presented common mental disorders (40% vs 45.57%), depression, and/or anxiety (52.46% vs 62.62%). A meaningful worsening of mental health was observed in healthcare workers who expressed concern about being infected with COVID-19, whether asymptomatic (greater general discomfort and psychological distress) or symptomatic (greater general discomfort). Likewise, there were significant interactions between a history of mental disorder and concern about COVID-19 infection.<i>Conclusions</i>: Among healthcare workers, the uncertainty about the COVID-19 infection may have larger negative mental health impacts than actually being infected.","LÃƒÂ³pez Steinmetz, Herrera, Fong, Godoy","https://doi.org/10.1080/00332747.2021.1940469","20210730","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-31","",16683,""
"The effectiveness of cognitive-motor training on reconstructing cognitive health components in older male adults, recovered from the COVID-19","The incidence of COVID-19 disease in the elderly can accelerate normal degenerative process of cognitive functions. Interactive cognitive-motor training (CMT) is an intervention that integrates cognitive and motor tasks to promote individuals' physical and psychological health. The present study aimed to examine the effect of CMT on reconstructing cognitive health components in older men, who have recently recovered from COVID-19. This study is a quasi-experimental repeated measure (without control group). Participants were 42 elderly men (65-80Ã‚Â years) who recovered from the COVID-19 disease that individually participated in a 4-week CMT program twice a week. The cognitive health components of the participants were assessed by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-2) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) at 3 stages before the beginning of the intervention (baseline assessment); 2Ã‚Â weeks after the intervention (short-term follow-up); and 3Ã‚Â months after the intervention (long-term follow-up). The results showed that the scores of depression, anxiety, physical symptoms, and social performance components and the overall GHQ score improved significantly in short-term follow-up (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05) and also in long-term follow-up compared to baseline assessment (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). It was also found that attention and calculation, recall, lingual skill, and action performance components and the overall score of MMSE were also improved at three stages of assessments. Other components did not differ among stages. This study adds to the research on the effectiveness of using CMT for reconstructing cognitive health components in older adults, recovered from the COVID-19, and supports CMT as a viable intervention practice.","Amini, Vaezmousavi, Shirvani","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-021-05502-w","20210730","COVID-19; Cognitive function; Dual-task; Elderly; General health; Training","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-31","",16684,""
"Efficacy of the Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA) for Unhealthy Alcohol Use Among Adults with HIV in Zambia: Results from a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial","This randomized controlled trial tested the efficacy of a multi-session, evidence-based, lay counselor-delivered transdiagnostic therapy, the Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA), in reducing unhealthy alcohol use and comorbidities among persons living with HIV (PLWH) in Zambia. Adult PLWH with (a) unhealthy alcohol use plus mental health or substance use comorbidities, or (b) severe unhealthy alcohol use were randomized to receive a single-session alcohol brief intervention (BI) alone or BI plus referral to CETA. Outcomes were measured at baseline and a 6-month follow-up and included Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) score (primary), depression and trauma symptoms, and other substance use (secondary). We enrolled 160 participants; 78 were randomized to BI alone and 82 to BI plus CETA. Due to COVID-19, the trial ended early before 36 participants completed. Statistically and clinically significant reductions in mean AUDIT score from baseline to 6-month follow-up were observed in both groups, however, participants assigned to BI plus CETA had significantly greater reductions compared to BI alone (-Ã‚Â 3.2, 95% CI -Ã‚Â 6.2 to -Ã‚Â 0.1; Cohen's d: 0.48). The CETA effect size for AUDIT score increased in line with increasing mental health/substance use comorbidity (0 comorbidities dÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.25; 1-2 comorbidities dÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.36; 3+ comorbidities dÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.6). Significant CETA treatment effects were observed for depression, trauma, and several other substances. BI plus referral to CETA was feasible and superior to BI alone for unhealthy alcohol use among adults with HIV, particularly among those with comorbidities. Findings support future effectiveness testing of CETA for HIV outcomes among PLWH with unhealthy alcohol use.Clinical Trials Number: NCT03966885.","Kane, Sharma, Murray, Chander, Kanguya, Skavenski, Chitambi, Lasater, Paul, Cropsey, Inoue, Bosomprah, Danielson, Chipungu, Simenda, Vinikoor","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10461-021-03408-4","20210730","HIV; Randomized controlled trial; Substance use; Unhealthy alcohol use; Zambia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-31","",16685,""
"Self-guided Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Apps for Depression: Systematic Assessment of Features, Functionality, and Congruence With Evidence","Mental health disorders affect 1 in 10 people globally, of whom approximately 300 million are affected by depression. At least half of the people affected by depression remain untreated. Although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment, access to mental health specialists, habitually challenging, has worsened because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Internet-based CBT is an effective and feasible strategy to increase access to treatment for people with depression. Mental health apps may further assist in facilitating self-management for people affected by depression; however, accessing the correct app may be cumbersome given the large number and wide variety of apps offered by public app marketplaces. This study aims to systematically assess the features, functionality, data security, and congruence with evidence of self-guided CBT-based apps targeting users affected by depression that are available in major app stores. We conducted a systematic assessment of self-guided CBT-based apps available in Google Play and the Apple App Store. Apps launched or updated since August 2018 were identified through a systematic search in the 42matters database using CBT-related terms. Apps meeting the inclusion criteria were downloaded and assessed using a Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro (Android 9) and iPhone 7 (iOS 13.3.1). Apps were appraised using a 182-question checklist developed by the research team, assessing their general characteristics, technical aspects and quality assurance, and CBT-related features, including 6 evidence-based CBT techniques (ie, psychoeducation, behavioral activation, cognitive restructuring, problem solving, relaxation, and exposure for comorbid anxiety) as informed by a CBT manual, CBT competence framework, and a literature review of internet-based CBT clinical trial protocols. The results were reported as a narrative review using descriptive statistics. The initial search yielded 3006 apps, of which 98 met the inclusion criteria and were systematically assessed. There were 20 well-being apps; 65 mental health apps, targeting two or more common mental health disorders, including depression; and 13 depression apps. A total of 28 apps offered at least four evidence-based CBT techniques, particularly depression apps. Cognitive restructuring was the most common technique, offered by 79% (77/98) of the apps. Only one-third of the apps offered suicide risk management resources, whereas 17% (17/98) of the apps offered COVID-19-related information. Although most apps included a privacy policy, only a third of the apps presented it before account creation. In total, 82% (74/90) of privacy policies stated sharing data with third-party service providers. Half of the app development teams included academic institutions or health care providers. Only a few self-guided CBT-based apps offer comprehensive CBT programs or suicide risk management resources. Sharing of users' data is widespread, highlighting shortcomings in health app market governance. To fulfill their potential, self-guided CBT-based apps should follow evidence-based clinical guidelines, be patient centered, and enhance users' data security.","Martinengo, Stona, Griva, Dazzan, Pariante, von Wangenheim, Car","https://doi.org/10.2196/27619","20210730","CBT; apps; cognitive behavioral therapy; depression; mHealth; mobile applications; mobile phone; self-guided CBT-based apps; self-management; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-31","",16686,""
"A Mobile Peer Intervention for Preventing Mental Health and Substance Use Problems in Adolescents: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial (The Mind Your Mate Study)","Anxiety, mood, and substance use disorders have significant social and economic impacts, which are largely attributable to their early age of onset and chronic disabling course. Therefore, it is critical to intervene early to prevent chronic and debilitating trajectories. This paper describes the study protocol of a CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials)-compliant randomized controlled trial for evaluating the effectiveness of the Mind your Mate program, a mobile health (mHealth) peer intervention that aims to prevent mental health (focusing on anxiety and depression) and substance use problems in adolescents. Participants will consist of approximately 840 year 9 or year 10 students (60 students per grade per school) from 14 New South Wales high schools in Sydney, Australia. Schools will be recruited from a random selection of independent and public schools across the New South Wales Greater Sydney Area by using publicly available contact details. The intervention will consist of 1 introductory classroom lesson and a downloadable mobile app that will be available for use for 12 months. Schools will be randomly allocated to receive either the mHealth peer intervention or a waitlist control (health education as usual). All students will be given web-based self-assessments at baseline and at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. The primary outcomes of the trial will be the self-reported use of alcohol and drugs, anxiety and depression symptoms, knowledge about mental health and substance use, motives for not drinking, and willingness to seek help. Secondary outcomes will include positive well-being, the quality of life, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Analyses will be conducted using mixed-effects linear regression analyses for normally distributed data and mixed-effects logistic regression analyses for categorical data. The Mind your Mate study was funded by an Australian Rotary Health Bruce Edwards Postdoctoral Research Fellowship from 2019 to 2022. Some of the development costs for the Mind your Mate intervention came from a seed funding grant from the Brain and Mind Centre of the University of Sydney. The enrollment of schools began in July 2020; 12 of 14 schools were enrolled at the time of submission. Baseline assessments are currently underway, and the first results are expected to be submitted for publication in 2022. The Mind your Mate study will generate vital new knowledge about the effectiveness of a peer support prevention strategy in real-world settings for the most common mental disorders in youth. If effective, this intervention will constitute a scalable, low-cost prevention strategy that has significant potential to reduce the impact of mental and substance use disorders.

"Perceived Need for Mental Health Treatment and the Mental Health Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States","<i>Objective</i>: Population-based information on the extent of perceived need for mental health treatment and clinically significant psychological distress can help inform strategies for responding to the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.<i>Methods</i>: A representative sample of U.S. adults, age 20 and over (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1,957), completed surveys in May and June 2020. Potential target populations were distinguished based on perceived need for mental health treatment and psychological distress, assessed by the Kessler-6, among those without perceived need. Populations were characterized with respect to demographic characteristics and prior mental health treatment history using logistic regression models.<i>Results</i>: The prevalence of perceived need for mental health treatment was 21%. Perceived need was strongly associated with pre-pandemic treatment history; compared to those with no treatment history, perceived need was dramatically higher among those in treatment when the pandemic began (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 53.8 95% CI 28.2-102.8) and those with pre-pandemic treatment history (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 9.3, 95% CI 5.1-16.8). Among the 79% who did not perceive need, moderate or greater distress was reported by 19% and was associated with younger age and Hispanic ethnicity (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.1, 95% CI 1.2-3.6).<i>Conclusions</i>: In the U.S., where mental health treatment is relatively common, mental health treatment response during the pandemic, and perhaps other crises, should target people with a history of mental health treatment. Outreach to people less likely to seek care on their own despite clinically significant distress should target Hispanic populations.","Breslau, North, Finucane, Roth, Collins","https://doi.org/10.1080/00332747.2021.1940470","20210730","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-31","",16688,""
"Psychological outcomes amongst family medicine healthcare professionals during COVID-19 outbreak: A cross-sectional study in Croatia","Healthcare professionals (HCPs) in family medicine (FM) in Croatia work in a demanding environment caused by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Besides particular circumstances in healthcare, an unknown virus, social distancing, and homeschooling, the capital was hit with the earthquake during the lockdown. To assess the prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and the influence of demographic characteristics, professional differences, medical history, and specific stressors on the psychological outcomes. A cross-sectional study with the online questionnaire containing the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) was conducted from 1st to 15 May 2020 in FM. HCPs (534, 35% response rate), predominantly female (84.5%), participated in the research. High prevalence of stress (30.9%), anxiety (33.1%), depression (30.7%), and PTSD (33.0%) were found. Female participants had higher results in the anxiety subscale of DASS-21 and IES-R scores. Pre-existing conditions were associated with higher levels of stress, anxiety, depression, and PTSD. The IES-R score for PTSD showed borderline correlation (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.053) with working in regions with the highest incidence of COVID-19. Having schoolchildren made a difference on a stress subscale in DASS-21 (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.043), but the earthquake did not have an impact. Family physicians and nurses in FM in Croatia are under a great mental load during the COVID-19 outbreak.

"Internalizing symptoms impede adolescents' ability to transition from in-person to online mental health services during the 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic","Online mental health services were previously found to be effective in many studies. However, this method was not generally used in Israel. By the end of 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic erupted, forcing mental health services to transition to online meetings to maintain the standard of care. In this cross-sectional study, we investigated the attitudes of adolescent patients toward this involuntary new mode of care. Forty-four adolescents (mean age 14.62Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.12 years, 54.5% females) and 40 of their primary caregivers completed a battery of questionnaires that included the telemedicine satisfaction questionnaire, session evaluation questionnaire, working alliance inventory, and pediatric symptom checklist. Both adolescents and their caregivers reported a reasonable experience with the online medium and a feeling that the meetings were overall powerful, helpful, and comfortable as demonstrated by medium to high scores on the telemedicine satisfaction questionnaire and session evaluation questionnaire questionnaires. A therapeutic alliance was generally maintained according to working alliance inventory scores. However, working alliance inventory scores were negatively correlated with higher levels of internalizing symptoms and parental stress. Our findings point to the possibility that anxious/depressed adolescents will have greater difficulties re-establishing therapeutic alliance when transitioned from in-person to online meetings. This may be due to the introduction of an ""invisible"" third party to the therapeutic setting-the computer. Psychologists and psychiatrists should be aware of these difficulties and respond adequately to maintain the standard of care.","Mekori-Domachevsky, Matalon, Mayer, Shiffman, Lurie, Gothelf, Dekel","https://doi.org/10.1177/1357633X211021293","20210730","COVID-19; adolescent; eHealth; mental health; teleconsulting; telehealth; telemedicine; telepsychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-31","",16690,""

"Coping with job stress for hospital nurses during the Covid-19 crisis: The joint roles of micro-breaks and psychological detachment","To examine a mediated moderation of the effects of micro-break activity and psychological detachment on the relationship between job stress and work engagement among hospital nurses. Nursing burnout, compassion fatigue, and job stress have been relatively constant issues in nursing for at least the past decade - and the pervasiveness of the COVID-19 pandemic is intensifying them, which may lead to new challenges to work engagement. We tested our model using a time-lagged design to collect data from supervisor-subordinate dyads in seven public hospitals located in southern China, and 263 nurses and 58 head nurses in this survey. Confirmatory factor analysis, Pearson's correlation and hierarchical multiple regression were carried out. The results showed that the adverse impact of job stress on work engagement disappeared when nurses engaged in high levels of micro-break activity. Moreover, the moderating role of micro-break activity was mediated by psychological detachment. Micro-break activity and psychological detachment play joint roles in helping nurses to cope with job stress. Nurse managers should change their negative attitude toward micro-break activity (if it exists) and help nurses find opportunities for detachment under high-pressure environment.","Wang, Xu, Liang, Li","https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13431","20210730","Job stress; Micro-break activity; Psychological detachment; Work engagement","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-31","",16694,""
"New-onset and exacerbated insomnia symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in US military veterans: A nationally representative, prospective cohort study","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on physical and mental health worldwide. While pandemic-related stress has also been linked to increased insomnia, scarce research has examined this association in nationally representative samples of high-risk populations, such as military veterans. We evaluated pre- and pandemic-related factors associated with new-onset and exacerbated insomnia symptoms in a nationally representative sample of 3,078 US military veterans who participated in the National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study. Veterans were surveyed in the USA in 11/2019 (pre-pandemic) and again in 11/2020 (peri-pandemic). The Insomnia Severity Index was used to assess severity of insomnia symptoms at the pre- and peri-pandemic assessments. Among veterans without clinical or subthreshold insomnia symptoms pre-pandemic (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2,548), 11.5% developed subthreshold (10.9%) or clinical insomnia symptoms (0.6%) during the pandemic; among those with subthreshold insomnia symptoms pre-pandemic (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1,058; 26.0%), 8.0% developed clinical insomnia symptoms. Pre-pandemic social support (21.9% relative variance explained), pandemic-related stress related to changes in family relationships (20.5% relative variance explained), pre-pandemic chest pain (18.5% relative variance explained) and weakness (11.1% relative variance explained), and posttraumatic stress disorder (8.2% relative variance explained) explained the majority of the variance in new-onset subthreshold or clinical insomnia symptoms during the pandemic. Among veterans with pre-pandemic subthreshold insomnia, pandemic-related home isolation restrictions (59.1% relative variance explained) and financial difficulties (25.1% relative variance explained) explained the majority of variance in incident clinical insomnia symptoms.

Over time, it has been found to affect other organs due to its ability to bind to the ACE2 receptor (type 2 angiotensin-converting enzyme), which can be found in various tissues, including the central nervous system. In addition, a large formation of pro-inflammatory cytokines responsible for various lesions was observed during the evolution of this disease. Our objective was to demonstrate the molecular mechanisms involved in the infection that may demonstrate the relationship between COVID-19 and the development of depressive conditions. Based on the main medical databases (LiLacs, SciELO, Bireme, Scopus, EBSCO, and PubMed) and using the terms 'coronavirus infections' AND 'Inflammation' AND 'depression' AND 'cytokines', we conducted an integrative review of articles published in 2020. Considering this stage of Covid-19 and the inflammatory component of depression, this review showed a relationship between these two conditions based on common pathophysiological mechanisms indicating possible depressive disorders in surviving patients, especially in the most severe cases. The role of inflammatory cytokines and the presence of ACE-2 receptors on the cell surface appear to be the common pathophysiological mechanism between COVID-19 and depression.","da Silva Lopes, Silva, de Sousa Lima, de AraÃƒÂºjo Costa, Barros, Silva-NÃƒÂ©to","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13760-021-01748-5","20210730","COVID-19; Coronavirus infections; Cytokines; Depression; Inflammation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-31","",16696,""
"[Loneliness during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic-results of the German National Cohort (NAKO)]","Early during the pandemic and the following protective countermeasures, an interest in the consequences of the enacted restriction of social contacts for the mental health of the population arose. Loneliness describes the perceived quality of one's own contacts and relationships with other individuals. Several prior studies reported associations of loneliness with different somatic and psychiatric disorders. To analyse the frequency of loneliness and its association with depression and anxiety symptoms in the first wave of the pandemic in Germany in May 2020. The German National Cohort (NAKO) had recruited and examined 205,000 individuals aged 20 to 69Ã‚Â years in 18Ã‚Â study centres across Germany between 2014 and 2019. The follow-up examination was temporarily stopped due to the pandemic between March and July 2020. In this period aÃ‚Â COVID-related questionnaire was developed and sent to all participants. We analysed the first 113,928 questionnaires that were sent back within fourÃ‚Â weeks in May 2020. Loneliness was assessed with the three-item UCLA Loneliness Scale and anxiety and depression symptoms were collected using the PHQÃ¢â‚¬â€˜9 and GADÃ¢â‚¬â€˜7 scales from the Patient Health Questionnaire. Among the NAKO participants, 31.7% reported to be lonely in May 2020. Women and young adults reported more loneliness than men and older adults. With increasing scores of loneliness, the severity of depression and anxiety symptoms also steadily increased. Individuals who were lonely during the pandemic had already reported higher PHQÃ¢â‚¬â€˜9 and GADÃ¢â‚¬â€˜7 scores during the baseline examination on average 2.5Ã‚Â years earlier, compared to those who did not feel lonely. Among participants of the German National Cohort, we observed an increase in loneliness during the first wave of the SARS-CoVÃ¢â‚¬â€˜2 pandemic in spring 2020 and aÃ‚Â strong relationship of increasing loneliness with decreasing mental health. HINTERGRUND: Mit Beginn der SARS-CoV-2-Pandemie und der nachfolgenden MaÃƒÅ¸nahmen zu ihrer EindÃƒÂ¤mmung im FrÃƒÂ¼hjahr 2020 ist rasch die Frage nach Auswirkungen der BeschrÃƒÂ¤nkung sozialer Kontakte auf die psychische Gesundheit der BevÃƒÂ¶lkerung aufgekommen. Einsamkeit beschreibt eine wahrgenommene QualitÃƒÂ¤t der eigenen Kontakte und Beziehungen zu anderen Menschen. Zahlreiche Studien haben einen Zusammenhang von Einsamkeit mit somatischen und psychischen Erkrankungen aufgezeigt. ZIEL: Auswertung der HÃƒÂ¤ufigkeit von Einsamkeit und ihrer Beziehung zu Angst- und Depressionssymptomen in der ersten Welle der Pandemie im Mai 2020. Zwischen 2014 und 2019 hat die NAKO-Gesundheitsstudie 205.000 Personen im Alter zwischen 20 und 69Ã‚Â Jahren in 18Ã‚Â Studienzentren in Deutschland rekrutiert und untersucht. Die nachfolgende Zweituntersuchung musste aufgrund der Pandemie im FrÃƒÂ¼hjahr 2020 unterbrochen werden. In dieser Zeit wurde ein COVID-19-bezogener Fragebogen entwickelt und an alle Teilnehmenden verschickt. Ausgewertet wurden die 113.928 FragebÃƒÂ¶gen, die innerhalb der ersten 30Ã‚Â Tage zurÃƒÂ¼ckgeschickt wurden. Einsamkeit wurde mit der 3Ã¢â‚¬â€˜Item UCLA Loneliness Scale, Angst und Depression mit den PHQ-9- und GAD-7-Skalen des Patient Health Questionnaire erhoben. Im Mai 2020 nahmen sich 31,7Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% der NAKO-Teilnehmenden als einsam wahr. Frauen und junge Menschen waren hÃƒÂ¤ufiger als MÃƒÂ¤nner und ÃƒÂ¤ltere Personen betroffen. Mit steigender Wahrnehmung von Einsamkeit nahm der Schweregrad von Depressions- und Angstsymptomen stetig zu. Einsame Personen wÃƒÂ¤hrend der Pandemie hatten bereits zur NAKO-Basisuntersuchung mehr depressive und Angstsymptome angegeben als NAKO-Teilnehmende, die sich in der Pandemie nicht einsam fÃƒÂ¼hlten.

"Mental health of parents of children with autism spectrum disorder during COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review","Children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may have great difficulties when their routines change, and this may affect the psychological well-being of their parents. For this reason, it is important to examine studies that address the mental health of parents in order to adapt to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. To determine the mental health status of parents with children diagnosed with ASD in the COVID-19 pandemic. The study, which is a systematic review, was conducted between December 15, 2020 and December 30, 2020 by scanning articles in English. The Scopus, Science Direct, PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases were used for scanning. The keywords COVID-19 AND (""autism"" OR ""autistic"" OR ""autism spectrum disorder"") AND parent AND (""mental health"" OR ""anxiety"" OR ""stress"") were used in the search process. The inclusion criteria in the study were findings regarding the mental health of parents with children diagnosed with ASD in the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing their anxiety and stress situations, being a research article, and accessing the full text of the article. In the study, a total of 6389 articles were reached, and the full texts of 173 articles were evaluated for eligibility. After the articles excluded by the full-text search were eliminated, 12 studies involving 7105 parents were included in the analysis. The findings obtained from the articles containing data on mental health in the COVID-19 pandemic of parents with children with autism spectrum disorder were discussed in three groups. These were findings on the experiences of parents with children with ASD in the COVID-19 pandemic regarding the areas where parents with children with ASD need support in the COVID-19 pandemic and methods of coping with the COVID-19 pandemic for parents with children with ASD. In the systematic review, it was determined that the anxiety and stress of the parents increased, they needed more support compared to the pre-pandemic period, and they had difficulty coping. In this systematic review, it was concluded that the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected the mental health of the parents of children with ASD.","YÃ„Â±lmaz, Azak, Ã…Å¾ahin","https://doi.org/10.5498/wjp.v11.i7.388","20210730","Autism spectrum disorder; COVID-19; Mental health; Pandemic; Parents","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-31","",16699,""
"Role of perceived family support in psychological distress for pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused major public panic in China. Pregnant women may be more vulnerable to stress, which may cause them to have psychological problems. To explore the effects of perceived family support on psychological distress in pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 2232 subjects were recruited from three cities in China. Through the online surveys, information on demographic data and health status during pregnancy were collected. Insomnia severity index, generalized anxiety disorder 7-item scale, patient health questionnaire-9, somatization subscale of the symptom check list 90 scale, and posttraumatic stress disorder checklist were used to assess the psychological distress. A total of 1015 (45.4%) women reported having at least one psychological distress. The women who reported having inadequate family support were more likely to suffer from multiple psychological distress (Ã¢â€°Â¥ 2 psychological distress) than women who received adequate family support. Among the women who reported less family support, 41.8% reported depression, 31.1% reported anxiety, 8.2% reported insomnia, 13.3% reported somatization and 8.9% reported posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which were significantly higher than those who received strong family support. Perceived family support level was negatively correlated with depressive symptoms (<i>r =</i> -0.118, <i>P &lt;</i> 0.001), anxiety symptoms (<i>r =</i> -0.111, <i>P &lt;</i> 0.001), and PTSD symptoms (<i>r =</i> -0.155, <i>P &lt;</i> 0.001).

"Impact of SARS-CoV-2 on neuropsychiatric disorders","Evolving data show a variable expression of clinical neurological manifestations in patients suffering with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from early disease onset. The most frequent symptoms and signs are fatigue, dizziness, impaired consciousness, ageusia, anosmia, radicular pain, and headache, as well as others. Based on the high number of series of cases reported, there is evidence for the implication of the immune system in the pathological mechanism of COVID-19. Although the exact role of the immunological mechanism is not elucidated, two main mechanisms are suggested which implicate the direct effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in the central nervous system and neuroinflammation. In the context of neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19, neuropsychiatric disorders show an exacerbation and are described by symptoms and signs such as depression, anxiety, mood alterations, psychosis, post-traumatic stress disorder, delirium, and cognitive impairment, which appear to be common in COVID-19 survivors. A worsened score on psychopathological measures is seen in those with a history of psychiatric comorbidities.

"Psychological and mental health impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers in China: A review","The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has put healthcare workers in an unprecedented situation, increasing their psychological and mental health distress. Much research has focused on the issues surrounding anxiety, depression, and stress among healthcare workers. The consequences of mental health problems on healthcare workers' physical health, health-compromising behaviours, suicide ideation<i>,</i> family relationships, and job satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic are not well studied. Enhanced psychological stress has known effects on an individual's physical health. In healthcare workers with pre-existing comorbidities, psychological stressors may exacerbate their current health problems. Healthcare professionals are known to have a high risk of substance use, hence they may be at risk of development of substance use addiction or vulnerable to addiction relapse.

"Change in mental health, physical health, and social relationships during highly restrictive lockdown in the COVID-19 pandemic: evidence from Australia","A novel coronavirus first reported in Wuhan City in China in 2019 (COVID-19) developed into a global pandemic throughout 2020. Many countries around the world implemented strict social distancing policies to curb the spread of the virus. In this study we aimed to examine potential change in mental/physical health and social relationships during a highly restrictive COVID-19 lockdown period in Australia during April 2020. Our survey (<i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 1,Ã‚Â 599) included questions about concerns, social behaviour, perceived change in relationship quality, social media use, frequency of exercise, physical health, and mental health during COVID-19 lockdown (April, 2020). When estimating their mental health for the previous year 13% of participants reported more negative than positive emotion, whereas this increased to 41% when participants reflected on their time during COVID-19 lockdown. A substantial proportion (39-54%) of participants reported deterioration in mental health, physical health, financial situation, and work productivity. However, most of these participants reported 'somewhat' rather than 'a lot' of deterioration, and many others reported 'no change' (40-50%) or even 'improvement' (6-17%). Even less impact was apparent for social relationships (68% reported 'no change') as participants compensated for decreased face-to-face interaction via increased technology-mediated interaction. The psychological toll of COVID-19 on Australians may not have been as large as other parts of the world with greater infection rates. Our findings highlight how technology-mediated communication can allow people to adequately maintain social relationships during an extreme lockdown event.","Rogers, Cruickshank","https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.11767","20210730","COVID-19; Communication; Exercise; Face-to-face communication; Lockdown; Mental health; Physical health; Social distancing; Social relationships; Technology-mediated communication","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-31","",16703,""

"Impact of COVID-19 on lifestyle habits and mental health symptoms in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in Canada","The COVID-19 pandemic created an environment of restricted access to health and recreation services. Lifestyle habits including sleep, eating, exercise, and screen use were modified, potentially exacerbating adverse mental health outcomes. This study investigates the impact of COVID-19 on lifestyle habits and mental health symptoms in paediatric attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in Canada. An online survey was distributed across Canada to caregivers of children with ADHD (children aged 5 to 18 years) assessing depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), ADHD (SNAP-IV), and lifestyle behaviours. Data were analyzed by gender (male/female) and age category (5 to 8, 9 to 12, and 13 to 18 years). Spearman's correlations between lifestyle habits and mental health outcomes were conducted. A total of 587 surveys were completed. Mean child age was 10.14 years (SD 3.06), including 166 females (28.3%). The PHQ-9 and GAD-7 indicated that 17.4% and 14.1% of children met criteria for moderately severe to severe depression and anxiety symptoms respectively. Children met SNAP-IV cut-off scores for inattention (73.7%), hyperactivity/impulsivity (66.8%), and oppositional defiant disorder (38.6%) behaviours. Caregivers reported changes in sleep (77.5%), eating (58.9%), exercise (83.7%), and screen use (92.9%) in their ADHD child, greatly impacting youth. Sleeping fewer hours/night, eating more processed foods, and watching TV/playing videogames &gt;3.5 hours/day correlated with greater depression, anxiety and ADHD symptoms, and exercising &lt;1 hour/day further correlated with depression symptoms (P<i>&lt;</i>0.01).

"Impact of SARS-CoV-2 on training and mental well-being of surgical gynecological oncology trainees","The SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic has caused a crisis disrupting health systems worldwide. While efforts are being made to determine the extent of the disruption, the impact on gynecological oncology trainees/training has not been explored. We conducted an international survey of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on clinical practice, medical education, and mental well-being of surgical gynecological oncology trainees. In our cross-sectional study, a customized web-based survey was circulated to surgical gynecological oncology trainees from national/international organizations from May to November 2020. Validated questionnaires assessed mental well-being. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Fisher's exact test were used to analyse differences in means and proportions. Multiple linear regression was used to evaluate the effect of variables on psychological/mental well-being outcomes. Outcomes included clinical practice, medical education, anxiety and depression, distress, and mental well-being. A total of 127 trainees from 34 countries responded. Of these, 52% (66/127) were from countries with national training programs (UK/USA/Netherlands/Canada/Australia) and 48% (61/127) from countries with no national training programs. Altogether, 28% (35/125) had suspected/confirmed COVID-19, 28% (35/125) experienced a fall in household income, 20% (18/90) were self-isolated from households, 45% (57/126) had to re-use personal protective equipment, and 22% (28/126) purchased their own. In total, 32.3% (41/127) of trainees (16.6% (11/66) from countries with a national training program vs 49.1% (30/61) from countries with no national training program, p=0.02) perceived they would require additional time to complete their training fellowship. The additional training time anticipated did not differ between trainees from countries with or without national training programs (p=0.11) or trainees at the beginning or end of their fellowship (p=0.12). Surgical exposure was reduced for 50% of trainees. Departmental teaching continued throughout the pandemic for 69% (87/126) of trainees, although at reduced frequency for 16.1% (14/87), and virtually for 88.5% (77/87). Trainees reporting adequate pastoral support (defined as allocation of a dedicated mentor/access to occupational health support services) had better mental well-being with lower levels of anxiety/depression (p=0.02) and distress (p&lt;0.001). Trainees from countries with a national training program experienced higher levels of distress (p=0.01). Mean (SD) pre-pandemic mental well-being scores were significantly higher than post-pandemic scores (8.3 (1.6) vs 7 (1.8); p&lt;0.01). SARS-CoV-2 has negatively impacted the surgical training, household income, and psychological/mental well-being of surgical gynecological oncology trainees. The overall clinical impact was worse for trainees in countries with no national training program than for those in countries with a national training program, although national training program trainees reported greater distress. COVID-19 sickness increased anxiety/depression. The recovery phase must focus on improving mental well-being and addressing lost training opportunities.","Gaba, Blyuss, Rodriguez, Dilley, Wan, Saiz, Razumova, Zalewski, Nikolova, Selcuk, Bizzarri, Theofanakis, Lanner, Pletnev, Gurumurthy, Manchanda","https://doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2021-002803","20210730","COVID-19; surgery","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-31","",16709,""
"Early effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on fertility preferences in the United States: an exploratory study","To explore early disparate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on fertility preferences DESIGN: Cross-sectional study SETTING: Online survey questionnaire PATIENT(S): A total of 440 female participants who were trying to conceive (TTC) in the past year or currently are TTC. No interventions administered. Change in fertility preference RESULT(S): Approximately 1 in 3 participants reported changing their fertility preferences because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of those that reported changing their fertility preferences, 23.9% reported TTC earlier and 61.6% reported TTC later. Preliminary findings show the odds of changing fertility preferences in black or African American women were 5.45 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.50-19.90) times that of white women and in nonheterosexual women were 2.76 (95% CI, 1.41-5.42) times that of heterosexual women. Furthermore, every 1 unit increase in state anxiety and depressive symptoms was associated with a 26% (95% CI, 3%-54%) or 17% (95% CI, 5%-31%) increase in odds of pushing back TTC, respectively. This exploratory study highlights how the fertility preferences of racial and ethnic minorities, sexual minorities, and those experiencing mental health issues may be disparately influenced by the pandemic. Research is needed to examine further the disparate effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on fertility preferences.","Naya, Saxbe, Dunton","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2021.05.092","20210730","COVID-19; Coronavirus; disparity; fertility preference; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-31","",16710,""
"COVEPIC (Cognitive and spOrt Virtual EPIC training) investigating the effects of home-based physical exercise and cognitive training on cognitive and physical functions in community-dwelling older adults: study protocol of a randomized single-blinded clinical trial","In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdown and social distancing measures are applied to prevent the spread of the virus. It is well known that confinement and social isolation can have a negative impact on physical and mental health, including cognition. Physical activity and cognitive training can help enhance older adults' cognitive and physical health and prevent the negative collateral impacts of social isolation and physical inactivity. The COVEPIC study aims to document the effects of 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°months of home-based physical exercise alone versus home-based physical exercise combined with cognitive training on cognitive and physical functions in adults 50Ã¢â‚¬â€°years and older. One hundred twenty-two healthy older adults (&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°50Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old) will be recruited from the community and randomized to one of the two arms for 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°months: (1) home-based physical exercises monitoring alone and (2) combined physical exercises monitoring with home-based cognitive training. The primary outcome is cognition, including general functioning (Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score), as well as executive functions, processing speed, and episodic memory (composite Z-scores based on validated neuropsychological tests and computerized tasks). The secondary outcome is physical functions, including balance (one-leg stance test), gait and mobility performance (Timed Up and Go, 4-meter walk test), leg muscle strength (5-time sit-to-stand), and estimated cardiorespiratory fitness (Matthews' questionnaire). Exploratory outcomes include mood, anxiety, and health-related quality of life as assessed by self-reported questionnaires (i.e., Geriatric depression scale-30 items, Perceived stress scale, State-trait anxiety inventory-36 items, Perseverative thinking questionnaire, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale 10, and 12-item Short Form Survey). This trial will document the remote monitoring of home-based physical exercise alone and home-based physical combined with cognitive training to enhance cognitive and physical health of older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Remote interventions represent a promising strategy to help maintain or enhance health and cognition in seniors, and potentially an opportunity to reach older adults in remote areas, where access to such interventions is limited. Clinical trial Identifier NCT04635462 . COVEPIC was retrospectively registered on November 19, 2020.","Dupuy, Besnier, Gagnon, Vincent, GrÃƒÂ©goire, Blanchette, Saillant, Bouabdallaoui, Iglesies-Grau, Payer, Marin, Belleville, Juneau, Vitali, Gayda, Nigam, Bherer","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13063-021-05476-2","20210730","Aging; COVID; Cognition; Cognitive training; Home-based training; Physical exercise; Remote monitoring","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-31","",16711,""
"Matching Digital Intervention Affordances with Tasks: The Case of a Zoom and WhatsApp Mental Health Intervention for Seniors during the COVID-19 Pandemic","During the first COVID-19 wave, we conducted a Zoom and WhatsApp digital group intervention that promoted community-dwelling seniors' mental health. A total of 82 community-dwelling adults participated in this intervention. Based on the media richness theory (MRT) and the affordances approach, we used netnography to explore how group moderators and technical support team members (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 9), but not the seniors themselves, perceived the ways Zoom and WhatsApp technological affordances/constraints matched intervention tasks and increased intervention performance. We identified four Zoom and WhatsApp affordances: temporality, interactivity, multimediality, and portability. Empirically, our findings represent a first step in creating a conceptual framework for analyzing digital intervention performances that addresses users' perceptions of technologies and intervention goals. Theoretically, our synergic analysis of MRT and the affordances approach offers a cohesive framework that shifts from a focus on users' interactions with one type of media to their interactions with all media that are used in attaining intervention goals.","Yeshua-Katz, Shapira, Aharonson-Daniel, Clarfield, Sarid","https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2021.1956071","20210730","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-31","",16712,""
