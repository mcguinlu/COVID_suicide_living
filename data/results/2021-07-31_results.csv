"A need for trauma informed care curriculum: Experiences from Pakistan","Trauma is a major global health problem. Currently a trauma curriculum, from a psychological perspective, has not been uniformly incorporated in medical education. Nonetheless, professionals from various medical disciplines have an integral role in providing trauma care to survivors. The current COVID-19 pandemic only underscores the relevance and urgent need of this training, as studies show an uptick in mental health disorders due to this trauma. This article will present a discussion on the need for trauma curriculum for health care professionals, using information gained through trauma informed care workshops for healthcare personnel at Aga Khan University Hospital Pakistan.","Nadeem, Asad, Hamid, Mahr, Baig, Pirani","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2021.102791","20210729","Curriculum; Health care professionals; Pakistan; Trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-30","",16623,""
"Alcohol use, cannabis use, and psychopathology symptoms among college students before and after COVID-19","College students have experienced significant disruptions related to COVID-19, and limited international data suggest they may be at elevated risk for mental health symptom increases related to COVID. Given their potentially elevated risk, our aim was to evaluate differences from pre-college closures to post-closure in mental health symptoms, alcohol, and cannabis use. Participants (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 4749) were from seven U.S. public universities/colleges. They were 70.1Ã‚Â % female and 48.5Ã‚Â % white, non-Hispanic/Latino, with 48.1Ã‚Â % in their first college/university year. 30-day retrospective assessments of alcohol and cannabis use, and past 2-week retrospective assessments of anxiety, depression, anger, and insomnia were captured at the time of the survey. We examined differences between those providing data pre- and post-university closure via linear and negative binomial regressions. Alcohol and cannabis use days were 13Ã‚Â % and 24Ã‚Â % higher, respectively, from pre-to post-university closure; also, prevalence of any 30-day alcohol use and alcohol use consequences were both higher in the post-closure sample (odds ratiosÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.34 and 1.31, respectively). In contrast, days of binge alcohol use were 4Ã‚Â % lower in the post-closing sample. Depressive symptoms and anger were both modestly higher in post-closing participants (dÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.1), with no differences in anxiety symptoms or insomnia. The modest differences in substance use and mental health from pre-closure through two months post-college closure suggest unexpected resilience in a large and diverse sample of students. College health providers will need to identify those students experiencing the greatest increases in mental health symptoms and substance use, using innovative outreach and treatment.","Schepis, De Nadai, Bravo, Looby, Villarosa-Hurlocker, Earleywine","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.07.040","20210729","Anxiety; COVID-19; College student; Depressive symptoms; Substance use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-30","",16624,""
"Changes in characteristics of drug overdose death trends during the COVID-19 pandemic","Reports analyzing drug overdose (OD) mortality data during the COVID-19 pandemic are limited. Outcomes across states are heterogenous, necessitating assessments of associations between COVID-19 and OD deaths on a state-by-state level. This report aims to analyze trends in OD deaths in Massachusetts during COVID-19. Analyzing 3,924 death records, we characterize opioid-, cocaine-, and amphetamine-involved OD mortality and substance co-presence trends from March 24-November 8 in 2020 as compared to 2018 and 2019. OD deaths involving amphetamines increased by 85% from 2019 to 2020 (61 vs. 113; P&lt;0.001) but were steady from 2018 to 2019. Heroin's presence continued to decrease (341 in 2018, 247 in 2019, 157 in 2020; P&lt;0.001); however, fentanyl was present in more than 85% of all OD deaths across all periods. Among OD deaths, alcohol involvement consistently increased, present in 250 deaths in 2018, 299 in 2019 (P=0.02), and 350 in 2020 (P=0.04). In 2019, 78% of OD decedents were White and 7% were Black, versus 73% and 10% in 2020 (P=0.02). Increased deaths involving stimulants, alcohol, and fentanyl reflect concerning trends in the era of COVID-19. Rising OD death rates among Black residents underscore that interventions focused on racial equity are necessary.","DiGennaro, Garcia, Stringfellow, Wakeman, Jalali","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2021.103392","20210729","Alcohol; COVID-19; Fentanyl; Opioids; Overdose death; Stimulants","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-30","",16625,""
"Identifying and preventing burnout in young oncologists, an overwhelming challenge in the COVID-19 era: a study of the Spanish Society of Medical Oncology (SEOM)","Young oncologists are at particular risk of professional burnout, and this could have a significant impact on their health and care of their patients. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has forced rapid changes in professionals' jobs and training, with the consequent physical and psychological effects. We aimed to characterize burnout levels and determinants in young oncologists, and the effects of the pandemic on their training and health. Two online surveys were conducted among oncology residents and young oncology specialists in Spain. The first addressed professional burnout and its determinants before the COVID-19 pandemic, while the second analyzed the impact of the pandemic on health care organization, training, and physical and psychological health in the same population. In total, 243 respondents completed the first survey, and 263 the second; 25.1% reported significant levels of professional burnout. Burnout was more common among medical oncology residents (28.2%), mainly in their second year of training. It was significantly associated with a poor work-life balance, inadequate vacation time, and the burnout score. Nearly three-quarters of respondents (72%) were reassigned to COVID-19 care and 84.3% of residents missed part of their training rotations. Overall, 17.2% of this population reported that they had contracted COVID-19, 37.3% had scores indicating anxiety, and 30.4% moderate to severe depression. Almost a quarter of young oncologists (23.3%) had doubts about their medical vocation. Burnout affects a considerable number of young oncologists. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on causes of burnout, making it even more necessary to periodically monitor it to define appropriate detection and prevention strategies.","JimÃƒÂ©nez-Labaig, Pacheco-Barcia, CebriÃƒÂ , GÃƒÂ¡lvez, Obispo, PÃƒÂ¡ez, QuÃƒÂ­lez, Quintanar, Ramchandani, Remon, Rogado, SÃƒÂ¡nchez, SÃƒÂ¡nchez-CÃƒÂ¡novas, Sanz-GarcÃƒÂ­a, Sesma, Tarazona, CotÃƒÂ©s, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez, Bosch-Barrera, FernÃƒÂ¡ndez, Felip, Vera, RodrÃƒÂ­guez-Lescure, Ãƒâ€°lez","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2021.100215","20210729","COVID-19; cancer care; professional burnout; residents; young oncologists","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-30","",16626,""
"Anxiety and burnout in anesthetists and intensive care unit nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study","This study aimed to measure the levels of anxiety and burnout among healthcare workers, including attending physicians, residents, and nurses, in intensive care units during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This is a cross-sectional survey analysis of healthcare workers in our institution. Data were collected on demographic variables, COVID-19 symptoms and test, disease status, anxiety level (assessed by the Beck Anxiety Inventory), and burnout level (measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory). Subscales of the burnout inventory were evaluated separately. A total of 104 participants completed the survey. Attending physicians, residents, and nurses constituted 25%, 33.7%, and 41.3% of the cohort, respectively. In comparison to untested participants, those tested for COVID-19 had a lower mean age (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€° 0.02), higher emotional exhaustion and depersonalization scores (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬Å  0.001, 0.004, respectively), and lower personal accomplishment scores (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€° 0.004). Furthermore, moderate to severe anxiety was observed more frequently in tested participants than untested ones (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€° 0.022). Moderate or severe anxiety was seen in 23.1% of the attending physicians, 54.3% of the residents, and 48.8% of the nurses (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€° 0.038). Emotional exhaustion, personal accomplishment, and depersonalization scores differed depending on the position of the healthcare workers (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€° 0.034, 0.001, 0.004, respectively). This study revealed higher levels of anxiety and burnout in younger healthcare workers and those tested for COVID-19, which mainly included residents and nurses.

"Dimethyl sulfoxide reduces the stability but enhances catalytic activity of the main SARS-CoV-2 protease 3CLpro","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), one of the most challenging global pandemics of the modern era. Potential treatment strategies against COVID-19 are yet to be devised. It is crucial that antivirals that interfere with the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle be identified and developed. 3-Chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) is an attractive antiviral drug target against SARS-CoV-2, and coronaviruses in general, because of its role in the processing of viral polyproteins. Inhibitors of 3CLpro activity are screened in enzyme assays before further development of the most promising leads. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is a common additive used in such assays and enhances the solubility of assay components. However, it may also potentially affect the stability and efficiency of 3CLpro but, to date, this effect had not been analyzed in detail. Here, we investigated the effect of DMSO on 3CLpro-catalyzed reaction. While DMSO (5%-20%) decreased the optimum temperature of catalysis and thermodynamic stability of 3CLpro, it only marginally affected the kinetic stability of the enzyme. Increasing the DMSO concentration up to 20% improved the catalytic efficiency and peptide-binding affinity of 3CLpro. At such high DMSO concentration, the solubility and stability of peptide substrate were improved because of reduced aggregation. In conclusion, we recommend 20% DMSO as the minimum concentration to be used in screens of 3CLpro inhibitors as lead compounds for the development of antiviral drugs against COVID-19.","Ferreira, Fadl, Ilter, Pekel, Rezgui, Sensoy, Rabeh","https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.202100994","20210729","3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro); COVID-19; DMSO; SARS-CoV-2; initial velocity; thermodynamic stability","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-30","",16628,""
"Food insecurity and mental health of women during COVID-19: Evidence from a developing country","This study examines the association between food insecurity and mental health of women during the COVID-19 pandemic in a resource poor setting. Data were collected at two time-points (wave 1 and 2) from 2402 women, one per household, participating in a larger study during extended COVID-19 lockdown in the rural areas of the southwest region of Bangladesh. The primary outcome of the analyses is the association between food insecurity, measured using the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES), and stress level, measured using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), for women during the lockdown. General awareness about COVID-19 and attitude towards prescribed preventive measures were also measured since COVID-19 health concerns could exacerbate food insecurity. An individual-level evaluation of the effect of wave 2 FIES score on PSS score showed that worsening of the food security status increasing the stress level of the participants (95% CI: 1.61; 2.13; p-value: &lt;0.001). Additionally, a significant negative association was observed between the PSS score and change in food security status between the two waves (Coefficient: -1.15, 95% CI: -1.30; -0.99, p-value: &lt;0.001), indicating that deterioration in food security status over the pandemic period increasing the stress level. At the village level, the results showed a similar pattern. General awareness around ways coronavirus spreads was high, yet there were misperceptions at a higher level. Maintaining hand hygiene, wearing face masks outside the home, and going outside only when necessary were widely practised. Fewer respondents could maintain a 1.5-metre distance from others in the outside and maintained cough and sneeze etiquette. The results indicate a higher stress level, a potential contributor to poor mental health, as food insecurity deteriorated. Policy initiatives in ameliorating immediate food insecurity during crises, improving long-term wellbeing, and expanding the reach of mental health support are warranted.","Rahman, Hasnain, Islam","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255392","20210729","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-30","",16629,""
"Psychological adjustment of Spanish adolescents and their parents during COVID-19 lockdown: A mixed method approach","Previous literature on the psychological impact of COVID-19 has shown a direct relationship between family conflicts and psychological distress among parents and their children during the domestic lockdown and social isolation; but there are also opportunities to enhance family bonding, encourage collective problem-solving and improve personal relationships. This study aimed to explore psychological adjustment processes of Spanish adolescents and their parents during the first month of lockdown by analyzing their narratives, perceived outcomes, protection and risk factors. A total of 142 people agreed to participate in this study. Of all participants, 61 were adolescents (M = 13.57; SD = 1.74; 57% women) and 81 were parents (M = 46.09; SD = 4.72; 91% mothers). All were Spanish residents and completed an online survey during the domestic lockdown in March 2020. From a qualitative design, methodology followed a mixed approach to analyze data. The results showed three different types of adaptation to lockdown and social isolation in both adolescents and their parents: 1) positive adjustment, 2) moderate adjustment, and 3) maladjustment. Most participants reported a good adjustment and only a 20% of parents and a 16% of adolescents stated that they had not been able to achieve a positive psychological adjustment. There are few significant quantitative differences between adolescents and their parents. The qualitative analysis of data showed that adolescents reported less psychological distress than their parents. The two most important protective factors were social support and keeping busy during lockdown. The most significant risk factors were loss of mobility and social isolation. The conclusions stressed that regarding psychological maladjustment, parents experienced feelings of uncertainty whereas adolescents experienced a kind of mourning process. These findings can be used to design and implement effective intervention measures for mental health and psychological well-being in such a difficult situation as domestic lockdown.","Postigo-Zegarra, JuliÃƒÂ¡n, Schoeps, Montoya-Castilla","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255149","20210729","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-30","",16630,""
"Forecasting suicide rates in India: An empirical exposition","Suicide is a major social and health issue in India. Yearly statistics show a concerning increasing pattern of suicidal deaths in India which is higher in comparison to the global trend. There is limited evidence regarding historical analysis of suicide or any forecasting for suicide in India towards predicting the possible risks of death due to suicide. This paper examines the trend of suicide rate and characteristics of suicide victims in India, based on the longitudinal time series data over the last 50 years-collected from the National Crime Record Bureau Reports (1969 to 2018) of the Government of India. In our analysis, we have used the time series model to forecast the suicide rates in India for the next decade. ARIMA (4,1,0) model is found to be the best fit model for forecasting the data. There has been an observable and rising trend of suicide rates in India over the last five decades. The forecast indicates a continuance of rising suicide cases for an upcoming couple of years in India with a limited decline in the following years. The prediction model indicates a future relatively consistent pattern of suicide in India which does not seem to be a very encouraging trend. As we have not included the period staring the year 2020 onwards affected by Covid-19 and which has several disruptions in personal and family spaces, the projected suicide trend during the period of next two to three years (2020-22) may rise far high and then it may show a declining path. Along with this, there is a shift in means of suicide in the last couple of decades. Constituting the second-highest number of cases, Illness associated suicide was visibly a serious concern. The present analysis finds that there is no visible substantial relief for suicide deaths during the coming years in India. On the other hand, more extensive exploration of sample cases may provide important information for suicide prevention. Availability of detailed and more inclusive data will be highly useful for analysis and suicide preventive policies. Investment in public health care and other welfare activities like education and employment generation will yield visible positive results in suicide control.","Swain, Tripathy, Priyadarshini, Acharya","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255342","20210729","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-30","",16631,""
"Health worries, life satisfaction, and social well-being concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic: Insights from Lebanon","The COVID-19 outbreak has struck Lebanon in its worst period of instability, not only impacting physical health, but also increasing psychological distress. Using an online survey enhanced by response time measurement, this study describes the overall patterns in mental well-being outcomes and examines their association with sociodemographic characteristics during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, it identifies significant predictors for COVID-19 good practices. A total of 988 Lebanese were surveyed, with participants providing written online consent prior to filling the survey. Regression-based models were estimated. Findings show that individuals with higher education levels exhibit lower health concerns. People with children face higher health worries than those without. Men are more worried than women about their health and they are less satisfied with their lives during the pandemic. Descriptive statistics show that most Lebanese are very satisfied with their families (93.1%), but they are highly dissatisfied with their country (63%). Young adults and individuals who live alone exhibit significantly higher social well-being concerns. Age and having children were strong predictors for good COVID-19 practices. The odds of having good practices for older adults are 3.13 times higher than that of youth, while the odds for those with children are 3.18 times higher than those without. The findings of this study could pave the way for a well-coordinated national strategy and increased collaboration with public health professionals to mitigate the pandemic's adverse effects on mental health in the long-term.","Bou-Hamad, Hoteit, Harajli","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254989","20210729","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-30","",16632,""
"The psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis is higher among young Swiss men with a lower socioeconomic status: Evidence from a cohort study","The present study aimed to investigate whether the psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis varied with regards to young Swiss men's pre-crisis level of education and socioeconomic status and to changes in their work situation due to it. A cohort of 2345 young Swiss men (from 21 out of 26 Swiss cantons; mean age = 29) completed survey-based assessments shortly before (April 2019 to February 2020) and early on during the COVID-19 crisis (May to June 2020). Outcomes measured were psychological outcomes before and during the COVID-19 crisis (depression, perceived stress and sleep quality), and the fear, isolation and psychological trauma induced by it. We investigated associations between these outcomes and their predictors: pre-crisis socioeconomic status (relative financial status, difficulty paying bills, level of education), changes in work situation during the crisis (job loss, partial unemployment, working from home, change in workload) and working in contact with potentially infected people, both inside and outside the healthcare sector. For outcomes measured before and during the crisis, the analyses were adjusted for their pre-crisis levels. About 21% of participants changed their employment status (job loss, partial unemployment or lost money if self-employed) and more than 40% worked predominantly from home during the COVID-19 crisis. Participants with a lower relative socioeconomic status already before the crisis experienced a higher psychological impact due to the COVID-19 crisis, compared to participants with an average socioeconomic status (major depression (b = 0.12 [0.03, 0.22]), perceived stress (b = 0.15 [0.05, 0.25]), psychological trauma (b = 0.15 [0.04, 0.26]), fear (b = 0.20 [0.10, 0.30]) and isolation (b = 0.19 [0.08, 0.29])). A higher impact was also felt by participants who lost their job due to the COVID-19 crisis, the partially unemployed, those with an increased workload or those who worked mainly from home (e.g. depression b = 0.25 [0.16, 0.34] for those working 90%+ at home, compared to those not working at home). Even in a country like Switzerland, with relatively high social security benefits and universal healthcare, the COVID-19 crisis had a considerable psychological impact, especially among those with a lower socioeconomic status and those who experienced deteriorations in their work situation due to the COVID-19 crisis. Supporting these populations during the crisis may help to prevent an amplification of inequalities in mental health and social status. Such support could help to lower the overall impact of the crisis on the mental well-being of Switzerland's population.","Marmet, Wicki, Gmel, Gachoud, Daeppen, Bertholet, Studer","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255050","20210729","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-30","",16633,""
"Understanding the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and containment measures: An empirical model of stress","Epidemics such as COVID-19 and corresponding containment measures are assumed to cause psychological stress. In a survey during the lockdown in Switzerland (n = 1565), we found substantially increased levels of stress in the population. In particular, individuals who did not agree with the containment measures, as well as those who saw nothing positive in the crisis, experienced high levels of stress. In contrast, individuals who are part of a risk group or who are working in healthcare or in essential shops experienced similar stress levels as the general public. The psychological mechanisms that determine stress, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and containment measures, are not yet clear. Thus, we conducted a path analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the psychological mechanisms that lead to stress. Experiencing fear of the disease is a key driver for being worried. Our model further shows that worries about the individual, social, and economic consequences of the crisis, strongly boost stress. The infection rate in the canton (i.e., state) of residence also contributes to stress. Positive thinking and perceived social, organizational, and governmental support mitigate worries and stress. Our findings indicate that containment measures increase worries and stress, especially for those who feel that these measures either are not sufficient or go too far. Thus, highlighting positive aspects of the crisis and convincing people of the effectiveness and necessity of mitigation measures can, not only promote compliance, but also reduce stress. Our model suggests that people who feel protected by the authorities have fewer worries, which can, in turn, limit the negative impact of the crisis on mental health.","Wissmath, Mast, Kraus, Weibel","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254883","20210729","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-30","",16634,""
"Post-intensive care syndrome after a critical COVID-19: cohort study from a Belgian follow-up clinic","Many patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) required critical care. Mid-term outcomes of the survivors need to be assessed. The objective of this single-center cohort study was to describe their physical, cognitive, psychological, and biological outcomes at 3Ã‚Â months following intensive care unit (ICU)-discharge (M3). All COVID-19 adults who survived an ICU stayÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°7Ã‚Â days and attended the M3 consultation at our multidisciplinary follow-up clinic were involved. They benefited from a standardized assessment, addressing health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-3L), sleep disorders (PSQI), and the three principal components of post-intensive care syndrome (PICS): physical status (Barthel index, handgrip and quadriceps strength), mental health disorders (HADS and IES-R), and cognitive impairment (MoCA). Biological parameters referred to C-reactive protein and creatinine. Among the 92 patients admitted to our ICU for COVID-19, 42 survived a prolonged ICU stay and 32 (80%) attended the M3 follow-up visit. Their median age was 62 [49-68]Ã‚Â years, 72% were male, and nearly half received inpatient rehabilitation following ICU discharge. At M3, 87.5% (28/32) had not regained their baseline level of daily activities. Only 6.2% (2/32) fully recovered, and had normal scores for the three MoCA, IES-R and Barthel scores. The main observed disorders were PSQIÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°5 (75%, 24/32), MoCAÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°26 (44%, 14/32), BarthelÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°100 (31%, 10/32) and IES-RÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°33 (28%, 9/32). Combined disorders were observed in 13/32 (40.6%) of the patients. The EQ-5D-3L visual scale was rated at 71 [61-80].

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and well-being of adults with mental health conditions in the UK: a qualitative interview study","People with mental health conditions have been identified as particularly vulnerable to poor mental health during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, why this population have faced these adverse effects, how they have experienced them and how they have coped remains under-explored. To explore how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the mental health of people with existing mental health conditions, and to identify coping strategies for positive mental health. Semi-structured qualitative interviews with 22 people with mental health conditions. Participants were purposively recruited via social media, study newsletters and third sector mental health organisations. Data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Participants were aged 23-70 (mean age 43), predominantly female (59.1%) and of white ethnicity (68.2%). Fifty percent were unable to work due to illness and the most frequently reported mental health condition was depression. Five pandemic-related factors contributed to deteriorating mental health: (i) feeling safe but isolated at home; (ii) disruption to mental health services; (iii) cancelled plans and changed routines; (iv) uncertainty and lack of control; (v) rolling media coverage. Five coping strategies were identified for maintaining mental health: (i) previous experience of adversity; (ii) social comparison and accountability; (iii) engaging in hobbies and activities; (iv) staying connected with others; (v) perceived social support. Challenges were identified as a direct result of the pandemic and people with severe mental illnesses were particularly negatively affected. However, some found this period a time of respite, drew upon reserves of resilience and adapted their coping strategies to maintain positive well-being.","Burton, McKinlay, Aughterson, Fancourt","https://doi.org/10.1080/09638237.2021.1952953","20210729","Mental health; qualitative; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-30","",16637,""
"Human emotions during COVID-19: A lens through Kubler-Ross Grief theory","The COVID-19 pandemic has constituted an extreme danger to global wellbeing and has become one of the major sources of morbidity and mortality around the world these days. It is quite challenging to accept and adapt to the drastic ongoing changes which have made people suffer from grief. The purpose of this commentary is to outline the Kubler-Ross Grief theory, explain its stages in the light of COVID-19, and consider factors that contribute to good health. It is more useful to examine responses to the pandemic utilizing contextualized grief and trauma aspects than to pathologize those reactions, particularly for those without existing mental health issues. Inability to address the squeezing needs of those encountering grief may bring about poor mental and physical wellbeing. Perceiving the uniqueness of every person and their stage of grief will allow providing individualized measures that encourage smooth adaptation to acceptance and promote psychological wellness and prosperity in this pandemic.

"Psychological and spiritual outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic: A prospective longitudinal study of adults with chronic disease","This prospective longitudinal study examined whether coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to changes in psychological and spiritual outcomes among adults with chronic disease. Participants (N = 302) were a stratified, nonrandom sample of adults (Mage = 64.46, SD = 10.86, 45.7% female). The sample was representative of the chronically ill, U.S. adult population in gender, race/ethnicity, region, and religious affiliation but older in age and higher in socioeconomic status. Participants completed online-administered measures 1 month before the March 11 pandemic declaration (T1) and then 1 and 3 months after it (T2 and T3). At T1 through T3, they completed measures of depression, anxiety, personal suffering, psychological well-being, trait resilience, optimism, hope, grit, spiritual struggles, spiritual fortitude, and positive religious coping. At T2 and T3, they also completed measures of social support, physical health, resource loss, perceived stress, and COVID-19 fears and exposure. Overall, people did not change substantially in psychological or spiritual outcomes over time. However, trait resilience increased and personal suffering declined. People highest in prepandemic suffering increased in spiritual fortitude. Racial/ethnic minorities increased in religious importance. Roughly half (48.9%) of participants exhibited psychological resilience (no/minimal depression or anxiety symptoms) at both T2 and T3. Perceived stress and psychological resource loss were associated with adverse mental health outcomes, but social support and physical health were not. COVID-19 fears contributed more to mental health than COVID-19 exposure. Even among vulnerable populations such as adults with chronic disease, during pandemic conditions like COVID-19, many people may exhibit-or even increase slightly in-psychological and spiritual resilience.

"An action plan to address the mental health impact of COVID-19 on communities: Five effective strategies","The 2019 coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted the physical and mental health of individuals and communities worldwide. While research is being conducted in real-time to address the unique impacts of COVID-19, this moment is also an opportunity to learn from previous infectious disease outbreaks. The goal of this paper is to review the literature on previous infectious disease outbreaks to better understand and identify effective interventions that may help mitigate the psychological impact and collective trauma on a given community. Five strategies are recommended for developing a plan of action: (1) engage and partner with community leaders and community-based organizations; (2) establish (and re-establish) community support networks including self-help groups; (3) conduct community outreach, education, and training on the signs and symptoms of mental health issues, how to access mental health resources, and effective supportive and coping skills; (4) deploy Community Health Workers to access, engage, and educate community members; and (5) use a community capacity-building and community empowerment-oriented approach. When implemented together, these strategies have been shown to help communities reduce the mental health impact and heal from the collective trauma of an infectious disease outbreak and increase the collective efficacy of a community, resulting in increased resiliency and preparedness for future outbreaks.

"Looking after each other in a crisis-Lessons from Novichok and the parallels with Covid-19","In March 2018, three patients were admitted to the Emergency Department of a District General Hospital. Originally suspected of having suffered an opiate overdose, it became clear that they were the victims of anti-cholinesterase poisoning-the Soviet era poison Novichok. Twenty-fiveÃ¢â‚¬â€°days later, two further patients were admitted with the same symptoms. One of these patients died 8Ã¢â‚¬â€°days later and the second remained in hospital for 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks. A Clinical Psychologist was present on the unit throughout the major incident and all staff directly involved received psycho-educational support regarding self-care. To examine the psychological impact of the longest running major incident in NHS history on the staff directly involved. A cross-sectional design was used, with structured questionnaires administered retrospectively. A link to an electronic survey was emailed to every member of staff in the organization. The survey included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Maslach Burnout Inventory, the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (to both the March and June events). 540/4000 hospital staff responded (13.5% response rate) with a 29/59 (49%) response rate in intensive care staff. Frontline staff had significantly lower scores on anxiety (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05 for the June incident), depressive symptoms (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05 March and June) and subscales of burnout than managers (depersonalization PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05). On the remaining two burnout subscales and on anxiety scores for those involved in March, results trended towards significance (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.1).

"The myth of pre-operative isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic","The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic called for the restructuring of National Health Service (NHS) surgical departments across the country. Initial guidance advised that patients undergoing elective surgery isolate for 14Ã¢â‚¬â€°days prior to their operation. As we learnt more about COVID-19 and its incubation period, at the Princess Royal University Hospital this guidance has been decreased to 72Ã¢â‚¬â€°h. We collected retrospective data for two patient cohorts that underwent elective surgery in June and September 2020, isolating for 14Ã¢â‚¬â€°days and 72Ã¢â‚¬â€°h, respectively. We followed-up these patients with several questions allowing us to categorise the cohorts into three groups based on their compliance with isolation measures and also to assess their satisfaction with the isolation process. Our data shows that only 16% of the June cohort and 53% of the September cohort isolated in accordance with the guidelines whilst patient satisfaction was 16% and 64% respectively. These results highlight a suboptimal compliance to pre-operative guidelines as well as an adverse effect on patient mental health and raise the issue of both patient and NHS staff safety. With the possibility of a COVID-19 second wave and for future pandemics, a clear evidence-based plan for pre-operative isolation is vital. Furthermore, consideration of patient adherence and satisfaction is key in deciding which guideline will be most effective.","Mijovic, James, Thomas, Bhatia, Lafaurie, Hafeez, Smedley","https://doi.org/10.1177/00368504211026155","20210729","COVID-19; elective surgery; general surgery; pandemic; pre-operative isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-30","",16644,""
"Perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on child and adolescent psychiatric services after 1 year (February/March 2021): ESCAP CovCAP survey","In April 2020, the European Society for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (ESCAP) Research Academy and the ESCAP Board launched the first questionnaire of the CovCAP longitudinal survey to estimate the impact of COVID-19 on child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) services in Europe. In this brief report, we present the main findings from the second questionnaire of the survey, one year after the COVID-19 pandemic began to hit Europe (i.e., February/March 2021). While service delivery to patients and their families was affected in a major way (reported by 68%) at the beginning of the pandemic, the majority of respondents (59%) in this second survey only reported a minor impact on care delivery. The use of telemedicine remained widespread (91%) but the proportion of CAP services partially closed or transformed to accommodate COVID-19 patients (59% in 2020) dropped to 20%. On the other hand, the perceived impact on the mental health and psychopathology of children and adolescents dramatically increased from ""medium"" (&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°50%) in 2020 to ""strong"" or ""extreme"" (80%) in 2021. Four nosographic entities were particularly impacted: suicidal crises, anxiety disorders, eating disorders and major depressive episodes. Accordingly, this was associated with a substantial increase in the number of referrals or requests for assessments (91% reported an increase in 2021 while 61% reported a decrease in 2020). Finally, heads of the CAP departments expressed strong concerns regarding the management of the long-term consequences of this crisis, especially regarding the provision of care in light of the perceived increase in referrals.","Revet, Hebebrand, Anagnostopoulos, Kehoe, Gradl-Dietsch, Klauser, Anderluh, Armando, Askenazy, Banaschewski, Bender, Bernardon, Brunner, Cortese, Delorme, Deschamps, Dodig-Ã„â€ urkoviÃ„â€¡, Drobnic Radobuljac, Dubicka, Falkenberg Krantz, Fernandez, Fonseca Pinto, Franic, Fricke, Gerardin, Gindt, KumperÃ…Â¡Ã„Âak, Goldschmidt, Herpertz-Dahlmann, Kapp, Kotsis, LÃƒÂ¡zaro, Margari, Margari, Mazzone, Mira Coelho, MÃƒÂ¶hler, Ozyurt, Pamias Massana, Pastore, PÃƒÂ szthy, Pereira da Rocha, Pinho, Plener, Podlipny, Polnareva, Poustka, Purper-Ouakil, Rapado-Castro, Seker, Serdari, Skrypnyk, Torres, Trebaticka, von Plessen, Walitza, Yurteri, Zepf","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-021-01851-1","20210729","Adolescents; COVID-19; Child and adolescent psychiatry; Children; Europe; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-30","",16645,""
"Influence of Body Mass Index on Eating Habits and Food Choice Determinants Among Brazilian Women During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Changes in emotional state due to the COVID-19 pandemic may potentially modify eating habits, which may differ as a function of body mass index (BMI). Using a self-reported, questionnaire-based survey we evaluated Brazilian women during the pandemic for: (i) the influence of BMI on changes in eating habits, food choice determinants, and psychological symptoms; (ii) associations between eating habits, food choice determinants and psychological symptoms. General characteristics, anthropometric data, eating habits before and during the pandemic, food choice determinants and psychological symptoms during the pandemic were collected between June and September, 2020. Participants (<i>n</i> = 1,183) were normal weight (60.4%), overweight (26.2%) and obese (13.4%). A higher frequency of ""cooking"" (72.3-77.6%, <i>p</i> = 0.004) and ""use of delivery service"" (29.8-48.8%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) was reported during, in comparison to before the pandemic.

"Building Resilience During COVID-19: Recommendations for Adapting the DREAM Program - Live Edition to an Online-Live Hybrid Model for In-Person and Virtual Classrooms","In standard times, approximately 20% of children and youth experience significant emotional, behavioral, or social challenges. During COVID-19, however, over <i>half</i> of parents have reported mental health symptoms in their children. Specifically, depressive symptoms, anxiety, contamination obsessions, family well-being challenges, and behavioral concerns have emerged globally for children during the pandemic. Without treatment or prevention, such concerns may hinder positive development, personal life trajectory, academic success, and inhibit children from meeting their potential. A school-based resiliency program for children (DREAM) for children was developed, and the goal of this study was to collaborate with stakeholders to translate it into an online-live hybrid. Our team developed a methodology to do this based on Knowledge Translation-Integration (KTI), which incorporates stakeholder engagement throughout the entire research to action process. KTI aims to ensure that programs are acceptable, sustainable, feasible, and credible. Through collaboration with parents and school board members, qualitative themes of concerns, recommendations and validation were established, aiding in meaningful online-live translation. Even though the original program was developed for intellectually gifted children, who are at greater risk for mental health concerns, stakeholders suggested using the program for both gifted and non-gifted children, given the universal applicability of the tools, particularly during this pandemic time period when mental health promotion is most relevant. An online-live approach would allow students studying at home and those studying in the classroom to participate in the program.

"The Perceived Impact of COVID-19 on Student Well-Being and the Mediating Role of the University Support: Evidence From France, Germany, Russia, and the UK","The rapid and unplanned change to teaching and learning in the online format brought by COVID-19 has likely impacted many, if not all, aspects of university students' lives worldwide. To contribute to the investigation of this change, this study focuses on the impact of the pandemic on student well-being, which has been found to be as important to student lifelong success as their academic achievement. Student well-being has been linked to their engagement and performance in curricular, co-curricular, and extracurricular activities, intrinsic motivation, satisfaction, meaning making, and mental health. The purpose of this study was to examine how student perceptions of their degree completion and future job prospects during the pandemic impact their well-being and what role university support plays in this relationship. We used the conservation of resources theory to frame our study and to develop five hypotheses that were later tested via structural equation modeling. Data were collected from 2,707 university students in France, Germany, Russia, and UK via an online survey. The results showed that university support provided by instructors and administration plays a mediating role in the relationship between the perceived impact of COVID-19 on degree completion and future job prospects and levels of student well-being. Student well-being is decreased by their concerns for their degree completion but not by their concerns for future job prospects. In turn, concerns for future job prospects affect student well-being over time. These results suggest that in a ""new normal,"" universities could increase student well-being by making support to student studies a priority, especially for undergraduates. Also, universities should be aware of the students' changing emotional responses to crisis and ensure visibility and accessibility of student support.","Plakhotnik, Volkova, Jiang, Yahiaoui, Pheiffer, McKay, Newman, ReiÃƒÅ¸ig-Thust","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.642689","20210729","COVID-19; job prospects; subjective well-being; university students; university success","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-30","",16649,""
"Psychological Responses of the Patients in Cabin Hospital to the COVID-19 Outbreak: A Comparative Epidemiologic Analysis","The building of cabin hospitals in Wuhan has been proven to be clinically successful in curing mild-symptom COVID-19 patients shortly after the outbreak of COVID-19 in late 2019. At the same time, the psychological effect of patients being treated in cabin hospitals and the features of the psychological status of the whole society remained ambiguous. This study adopted a self-administrated questionnaire to investigate the stress, depression, and anxiety status of patients in cabin hospitals (<i>n</i> = 212) and healthy participants outside of Hubei province (<i>n</i> = 221) in a population level from February 29 to March 01, 2020. The research measured participants' stress response, depression level, and anxiety level as well as their social support system and their resilience level. Results indicated that in this sudden outbreak of an unknown pandemic, all people (whether or not infected) showed a generally high level of stress, depression, and anxiety, regardless of age, gender, education level, and employment. It also showed that people with a lower level of psychological resilience and social support reported more severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Moreover, the research also found a positive effect of cabin hospitals on the psychological recovery of COVID-19 patients. Stress response of patients increased after entering into cabin hospitals, while after 3-4 weeks' treatment, patients showed a decrease in their depression and anxiety levels. This research advances the understanding of COVID-19 and gives suggestions to optimize the design and the allocation of resources in cabin hospitals and better deal with the unknown pandemics in the future.","Wang, Zhang, Yin, Wang, Yang, Hu, Xu, Wang, Li, He, Hu, Luo, Ren","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.641167","20210729","COVID-19; anxiety; cabin hospital; depression; psychological assistance; psychological responses; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-30","",16650,""
"Exploring the Perceived Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic Social Distancing Measures on Athlete Wellbeing: A Qualitative Study Utilising Photo-Elicitation","Countries all over the globe have implemented mandatory social distancing measures in an attempt to suppress and control the spread of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This enforced period of isolation, disruption to normal training routines and competition cancellation, could be having an adverse effect on the mental health and wellbeing of athletes. This study sought to explore the perceived impact of the COVID-19 social distancing measures on athlete wellbeing. Fourteen elite athletes who were unable to train or compete due to government imposed lockdown measures were recruited to participate in this qualitative study. Utilising the photo elicitation method, participants were asked to take a series of photographs that represented their experiences as athletes living in lockdown. These photographs were used to guide discussions in follow up unstructured interviews. Reflexive inductive thematic analysis identified three main themes that captured athletes' experience of social distancing measures and the implications for their wellbeing: (1) threats to wellbeing; (2) adapting routines and maintaining motivation; and (3) reflecting on participation in competitive elite sport. The initial sudden loss of sport in the athlete's lives posed a threat to their wellbeing, but over the duration of the lockdown period the athletes developed numerous strategies to protect their wellbeing. Furthermore, their time away from sport encouraged them to reflect on their athletic identity and to make life changes that would protect their wellbeing during the rest of the lockdown period and when they returned to sport. A number of immediate practical recommendations are offered for athlete support personnel working with athletes during the crisis, these include developing self-care strategies and social networks, adapting routines, setting new goals and encouraging the pursuit of dual-careers. Future research is encouraged to investigate how practitioners can deliver effective psychological support through tele-consulting, and to consider whether their support is best focused on therapeutic counselling or mental skills training during the pandemic.","Woodford, Bussey","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.624023","20210729","COVID-19; Coronavirus; athlete wellbeing; mental health; photo elicitation; reflexive thematic analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-30","",16651,""
"Using Peer Support to Strengthen Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Review","<b>Background:</b> The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had a significant impact on society's overall mental health. Measures such as mandated lockdowns and physical distancing have contributed to higher levels of anxiety, depression, and other metrics indicating worsening mental health. Peer support, which is peer-to-peer provided social and emotional support, is an underutilized and effective mental health resource that can potentially be used to ameliorate mental health during these times. <b>Objective:</b> This review aims to summarize the toll that this pandemic has had on society's mental health as found in peer-reviewed literature from October 2019 to March 2021, as well as suggest the utility of peer support to address these needs. <b>Methods:</b> References for this review were chosen through searches of PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar for articles published between October 2019 and March 2021 that used the terms: ""coronavirus,"" ""COVID-19,"" ""mental health,"" ""anxiety,"" ""depression,"" ""isolation,"" ""mental health resources,"" ""peer support,"" ""online mental health resources,"" and ""healthcare workers."" Articles resulting from these searches and relevant references cited in those articles were reviewed. Articles published in English, French and Italian were included. <b>Results:</b> This pandemic has ubiquitously worsened the mental health of populations across the world. Peer support has been demonstrated to yield generally positive effects on the mental health of a wide variety of recipients, and it can be provided through numerous accessible mediums. <b>Conclusions:</b> Peer support can overall be beneficial for improving mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic and may be an effective tool should similar events arise in the future, although the presence of a few conflicting studies suggests the need for additional research.","Suresh, Alam, Karkossa","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.714181","20210729","COVID-19; coronavirus pandemic; distress; healthcare workers; isolation; lockdown; mental health; peer support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-30","",16652,""
"The Prevalence of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms, Sleep Problems, and Psychological Distress Among COVID-19 Frontline Healthcare Workers in Taiwan","The adverse effect of COVID-19 pandemic among individuals has been very disturbing especially among healthcare workers. This study aims to examine the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, sleep problems, and psychological distress among COVID-19 frontline healthcare workers in Taiwan. Hence, a total of 500 frontline healthcare workers were recruited to participate in this cross-sectional study. They responded to measures on fear of COVID-19, depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, PTSD, perceived stigma, and self-stigma. The results indicated a prevalence rate of 15.4% for PTSD symptoms, 44.6% for insomnia, 25.6% for depressive symptoms, 30.6% for anxiety symptoms, and 23.4% for stress among the participants. There were significantly positive interrelationships between all these variables. Anxiety symptoms and fear of COVID-19 predicted PTSD whereas symptoms of anxiety, fear of COVID-19, and stress predicted insomnia. The prevalence rates of the psychological problems reveal a worrying view of mental health challenges among Taiwanese frontline healthcare workers. Anxiety symptoms and fear of COVID-19 are the common predictive factors of PTSD and sleep problems suggesting that mental healthcare services for them may help prevent future occurrence of psychological problems by allaying fears of healthcare workers. Therefore, there should be mental healthcare services for healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lu, Ahorsu, Kukreti, Strong, Lin, Kuo, Chen, Lin, Chen, Ko, Ko","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.705657","20210729","COVID-19; healthcare workers; insomnia; post-traumatic stress disorder; psychological distress; stigma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-30","",16653,""

"Body Mass Index, Practice of Physical Activity and Lifestyle of Students During COVID-19 Lockdown","Several factors influence the student's physical activity and lifestyle. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) lockdown has restricted student's activity and altered their routine lifestyle. This prospective cohort study aimed to determine the significant changes in body mass index (BMI), physical activity, and lifestyle of the students including diet, sleep, and mental health before and during COVID-19 lockdown. The study participants were 628 students studying bachelor's degree programs, between 18 and 30 years of age, both genders from the university of Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia. The lockdown began on 23 March and ended on 21 June 2020 in Saudi Arabia. The students were interviewed before (March 2020) and during (June 2020) lockdown. The structured tool included baseline information of the students, anthropometric data, global physical activity questionnaire (GPAQ), dietary recall, Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), and perceived stress scale (PSP). Chi-square tests were used to associate the baseline information with BMI changes during the lockdown. BMI of the students showed that 32% increased their weight, 22% lost their weight and 46% maintained the same weight during COVID-19 lockdown. The physical activity significantly decreased and sedentary time increased (<i>p</i> = 0.0001). Regarding the lifestyle components, fast and fried food consumption decreased, and calorie intake increased significantly (<i>p</i> = 0.001). Stress level (<i>p</i> = 0.001) significantly decreased, and sleep level (<i>p</i> = 0.001) increased during lockdown. The variables associated with weight changes were the level of students (p &lt; 0.05) and time spent on social media per day (p &lt; 0.0001). Though half of the students maintained the same BMI during the lockdown, students who increased BMI were associated with physical activity and lifestyle. Hence, health awareness on weight maintenance, active physical activities, and a healthy lifestyle must be created among the students, which help in creating and implementing policies in the future.","Jalal, Beth, Al-Hassan, Alshealah","https://doi.org/10.2147/JMDH.S325269","20210729","COVID-19; body mass index; lifestyle; lockdown; physical activity; weight changes","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-30","",16655,""
"Mental health crisis in healthcare providers in the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional facility-based survey","During a pandemic, healthcare providers experience increased mental and physical burden. Burnout can lead to treatment errors, patient mortality, increased suicidal ideation and substance abuse as well as medical malpractice suits among medical staff. This study aimed to investigate the occurrence of burnout, acute stress disorder, anxiety disorder and depressive disorder among healthcare providers at the third month of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional facility-based survey. Hospitals around the country with different levels of care. A total of 1795 respondents, including 360 men and 1435 women who participated in the survey. Burnout was assessed using the Physician Work Life Study. A score of Ã¢â€°Â¥3 implied burnout. Of the 1795 respondents, 723 (40.3%) reported burnout, and 669 (37.3%) cared for patients with COVID-19. Anxiety levels were mild in 185 (10.3%) respondents, moderate in 209 (11.6%) and severe in 1401 (78.1%).

"Resiliency Engagement and Care in Health (REaCH): a telephone befriending intervention for upskilled rural youth in the context of COVID-19 pandemic-study protocol for a multi-centre cluster randomised controlled trial","The lockdown associated with the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to impact people's mental health, especially those from economically disadvantaged and vulnerable sections of society. Mental health can be affected by many factors, including fear of disease transmission, from response measures against the pandemic like social distancing, movement restriction, fear of being in quarantine, loneliness, depression due to isolation, fear of losing work and livelihood and avoiding health care due to fear of being infected. Telephonic befriending intervention by non-specialists will be used to provide social and emotional support to the youth from the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDUGKY), an initiative of the Government of India. This study aims to promote mental wellbeing and reduce depressive symptoms by assisting participants to mobilise social support from family, friends and significant others by using the telephonic befriending intervention. In this article, we report the design and protocol of a multi-centre cluster randomised controlled trial. In total, 1440 participants aged 18-35 years who have recently completed their course out of the DDU-GKY initiative will be recruited in the study from 12 project-implementing agencies (PIAs) across six geographical zones of India. Participants from 6 of these agencies will be assigned to the telephonic befriending intervention arm, and the other six agency participants will be assigned to the general enquiry phone call arm (control). The primary outcomes of this study are mental wellbeing, depressive symptoms and perceived social support. Baseline assessments and follow-up assessments will be carried out 1 month following the intervention using WHO-5, PHQ and MSPSS-12 questionnaires. The befriending intervention will be provided by DDU-GKY staff, whom a virtual training programme will train. This trial will help assess whether participants who are offered emotional, social and practical support through befriending will experience lesser symptoms of depression and better mental health compared to participants who do not receive this intervention through mobilised social support from friends, family and others.

"Opioid use disorder treatment disruptions during the early COVID-19 pandemic and other emergent disasters: a scoping review addressing dual public health emergencies","During public health emergencies, people with opioid use disorder (PWOUD) may be particularly impacted. Emergent disasters such as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupt already-strained harm reduction efforts and treatment availability. This study aims to answer three research questions. How do public health emergencies impact PWOUD? How can health systems respond to novel public health emergencies to serve PWOUD? How can the results of this scoping review be contextualized to the province of Alberta to inform local stakeholder responses to the pandemic? We conducted a scoping review using the 6-stage Arksey and O'Malley framework to analyse early-pandemic and pre-pandemic disaster literature. The results of the scoping review were contextualized to the local pandemic response, through a Nominal Group Technique (NGT) process with frontline providers and stakeholders in Alberta, Canada. Sixty one scientific journal articles and 72 grey literature resources were included after full-text screening. Forty sources pertained to early COVID-19 responses, and 21 focused on OUD treatment during other disasters. PWOUD may be more impacted than the general population by common COVID-19 stressors including loss of income, isolation, lack of rewarding activities, housing instability, as well as fear and anxiety. They may also face unique challenges including threats to drug supplies, stigma, difficulty accessing clean substance use supplies, and closure of substance use treatment centres. All of these impacts put PWOUD at risk of negative outcomes including fatal overdose. Two NGT groups were held. One group (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°7) represented voices from urban services, and the other (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4) Indigenous contexts. Stakeholders suggested that simultaneous attention to multiple crises, with adequate resources to allow attention to both social and health systems issues, can prepare a system to serve PWOUD during disasters. This scoping review and NGT study uncovers how disasters impact PWOUD and offers suggestions for better serving PWOUD.","Henderson, McInnes, Mackey, Bruised Head, Crowshoe, Hann, Hayward, Holroyd, Lang, Larson, Leonard, Persaud, Raghavji, Sarin, Virani, Wadsworth, Whitman, McLane","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11495-0","20210729","Coronavirus; Disaster planning; Emergency; Health services; Medication assisted treatment; Opioid agonist treatment; Opioid epidemic; Review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-30","",16658,""
"Symptoms of anxiety/depression during the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown in the community: longitudinal data from the TEMPO cohort in France","To cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing restrictions where implemented in France, which could have led to social isolation. This is expected to have affected the mental health situation, including increasing risk of symptoms of anxiety and depression in the general population. Persons with prior mental health difficulties could be an especially vulnerable group, however, few studies have tested this empirically considering preexisting mental health difficulties. We examine the association between preexisting symptoms of anxiety/depression and anxiety/depression during lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic in a longitudinal community sample. A longitudinal follow-up during lockdown (data collection March-June 2020) was implemented among participants of the TEMPO cohort. Prior knowledge of anxiety/depression was included from prior waves of data collection. Generalized estimation equations models were used to estimate the association between preexisting symptoms of anxiety/depression and symptoms of anxiety/depression during lockdown among 662 mid-aged individuals. Individuals with symptoms of anxiety/depression measured prior to lockdown had 6.73 higher odds [95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.45-10.17] of symptoms of anxiety/depression during lockdown. Additionally, the likelihood of symptoms of anxiety/depression during lockdown was elevated among women (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.07 [95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.32-3.25]), subjects with low household income (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.28 [1.29-4.01]) and persons who reported being lonely (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.94 [95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.47-6.28]).

"Perceptions, emotional reactions and needs of adolescent psychiatric inpatients during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews","The new coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has been accompanied by severe psychological pressure on the entire population. However, little is known about how this pandemic could affect the more vulnerable population with severe mental illness. To explore adolescent psychiatric inpatients' perceptions, emotional reactions and needs during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Individual in-depth interviews were conducted with nine psychiatric inpatients aged 12-17Ã¢â‚¬â€°years. Through open-ended questions, interviewers initiated five themes: (a) knowledge about coronavirus pandemic, (b) changes in everyday routine due to the pandemic, (c) adolescents' feelings about the pandemic, (d) adolescents' positive thoughts and behaviors, and (e) how the social environment can help adolescents deal with the pandemic-related situation. A thematic analysis was conducted using line-by-line open coding. Regarding their knowledge of the impact of the current pandemic, almost all adolescents focused on information about the nature of coronavirus and on existing crisis management practices. Almost all patients identified predominantly negative changes due to the quarantine state, including restrictions on both social life and personal freedom as well as excessive contact with family members during home isolation. As far as their emotions were concerned, adolescents did acknowledge anxiety about self-harm and harming their loved ones as well as mood swings within the family nucleus; anxiety was also manifested about the unknown and the management of the pandemic in other countries. Avoidance of thought rumination about the coronavirus and its consequences, positive thinking and looking towards the future were reported as constructive strategies for coping with challenging emotions. Additionally, a sense of belongingness seems to have been playing a pivotal role in the adolescents coping strategies. Trust in the authorities and the community was another quite noteworthy point that emerged during the interviews. Lastly, our findings indicated adolescents' benefit from receiving balanced health messaging coupled with balanced thinking within their social and family environment. Enhanced comprehension of possible mediating psychological pathways is needed to help clinicians, researchers, and decision-makers to avert the deterioration of mental disorders and overall functioning, as well as additional stress-related disorders.","Giannakopoulos, Mylona, Zisimopoulou, Belivanaki, Charitaki, Kolaitis","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03378-w","20210729","Adolescents; COVID-19; Mental health; Pandemic; Psychiatric inpatient unit","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-30","",16660,""

The outbreak in Saudi Arabia worsened when the number of cases and deaths rose in March and April of 2020, leading to a national lockdown. This study aimed to assess the factors associated with mental health symptoms in a sample of people residing in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted an observational cross-sectional study using an online survey distributed via social media, completed by 3032 respondents from all Saudi regions. We collected demographic data, illness history, and scores of validated self-report scales to assess mental health symptoms, intolerance of uncertainty, and coping strategies. In total, respondents indicated moderate to very severe symptoms during the pandemic as follows: 20.9% for depression, 17.5% for anxiety, and 12.6% for stress. Younger age, female gender, and history of mental illness were associated with higher levels of depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia. Intolerance of uncertainty and certain coping strategies (such as denial or self-blame) were associated with more severe symptoms.

"COVID-19 pandemic related long-term chronic stress on the prevalence of depression and anxiety in the general population","The COVID-19 pandemic has lasted for more than 1Ã‚Â year, causing far-reaching and unprecedented changes in almost all aspects of society. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on depression and anxiety, and explore the factors associated with it. A cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted to assess mental health problems from February 2 to February 9, 2021 by using patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and generalized anxiety disorder-7 (GAD-7). The insomnia severity index (ISI), demographic data and COVID-19 related variables were measured by a self-designed questionnaire. The factors associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms were identified by Pearson chi-square test and binary logistic regression analysis. In the study that 1171 participants enrolled, the overall prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms among general people was 22.6 and 21.4% respectively in the present study. Living alone was a potential risk factor for depressive symptoms, while regular exercises was a potential protective factor. The prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms was significantly associated with the severity of insomnia symptoms and the negative feelings about pandemic. COVID-19 pandemic- related chronic stress has brought about profound impacts on long-term mental health in the general population. The level of insomnia and a negative attitude towards the pandemic are significantly correlated with unfavorable mental health. However, we failed to found a significant association of age and gender with the mental health symptoms, although they were recognized as well-established risk factors during the outbreak by some other studies. This discrepancy may be because the acute and chronic effects of the pandemic are influenced by different factors, which reminds that more attention should be paid to the intrinsic psychological factors and physical reactions towards COVID-19.","Qi, Hu, Ge, Zhou, Li, Jiang, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03385-x","20210729","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Long-term stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-30","",16662,""
"Impacts of COVID-19 on Mental Health Safety Net Services for Youths: A National Survey of Agency Officials","Mental health agencies provide critical safety net services for youths. No research has assessed impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on services these agencies provide or youths they serve. This study sought to characterize agency officials' perceptions of the pandemic's impacts on youths and challenges to providing youth services during the pandemic and to examine associations between these challenges and impacts. Surveys were completed in September-October 2020 by 159 state or county mental health agency officials from 46 states. Respondents used 7-point scales (higher rating indicated more severe impact or challenge) to rate the pandemic's impact on youth mental health issues, general service challenges, and telepsychiatry service challenges across patient, provider, and financing domains. Multiple linear regression models estimated associations between service challenges (independent variables) and pandemic impacts (dependent variables). Most agency officials perceived the pandemic as having disproportionately negative mental health impacts on socially disadvantaged youths (serious impact, 72%; mean rating=5.85). Only 15% (mean=4.29) perceived the pandemic as having a seriously negative impact on receipt of needed youth services. Serious service challenges were related to youths' lack of reliable equipment or Internet access for telepsychiatry services (serious challenge, 59%; mean=5.47) and the inability to provide some services remotely (serious challenge, 42%, mean=4.72). In regression models, the inability to provide some services remotely was significantly (pÃ¢â€°Â¤0.01) associated with three of five pandemic impacts. Officials perceived the COVID-19 pandemic as exacerbating youth mental health disparities but as not having a dramatic impact on receipt of needed services.","Purtle, Nelson, Horwitz, Palinkas, McKay, Hoagwood","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202100176","20210729","Child psychiatry/general; Coronavirus/COVID-19; Public health; Public policy issues; Service delivery systems","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-30","",16663,""
"Embitterment as a Specific Mental Health Reaction during the Coronavirus Pandemic","Embitterment can occur as a reaction to perceived injustice. During the pandemic and restrictions in daily living due to infection risk management, a range of many smaller or severe injustices have occurred. The aim of this study is to investigate what characterizes persons with high embitterment, mental illness, embitterment and mental illness, and those without embitterment or mental health problems. We conducted an online survey including persons from the general population in November 2020 and December 2020, the phase during which a second lockdown took place, with closed shops, restaurants, cultural and activity sites. 3,208 participants (mean age 47 years) gave self-ratings on their present well-being, burdens experienced during the pandemic, embitterment, wisdom, and resilience. Embitterment occurred among 16% of the sample, which is a high rate in comparison with 4% during pre-pandemic times. Embitterment was weakly correlated with unspecific mental well-being. There were more persons with embitterment than those with embitterment and a mental health problem. Persons with embitterment reported less coronavirus-related anxiety than persons without embitterment. However, embittered persons reported more social and economic burdens and more frequent experiences of losses (job loss and canceling of medical treatments). Embittered persons perceive their own wisdom competencies on a similar level as persons with mental health problems or persons without mental health problems.

"Association of sleep quality and psychological aspects with reports of bruxism and TMD in Brazilian dentists during the COVID-19 pandemic","Dentists are exposed to contamination by SARS-CoV-2 due to dental interventions, leading to a state of alert and potential risk of negative impact in mental health and sleep quality, associated with Temporomandibular Disorder (TMD) and bruxism. to evaluate the psychosocial status, sleep quality, symptoms of TMD, and bruxism in Brazilian dentists (DSs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample (n=641 DSs) was divided into three groups (quarantined DSs; DSs in outpatient care; and frontline professionals), which answered an electronic form containing the TMD Pain Screening Questionnaire (Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders - DC/TMD), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), and the sleep and awake bruxism questionnaire. ANOVA test and Mann Whitney post-test were used, with Bonferroni adjustment (p&lt;0.016) and a 95% confidence level. Probable TMD was found in 24.3% (n=156) of the participants, while possible sleep and awake bruxism were diagnosed in 58% (n=372) and 53.8% (n=345) of them, respectively. Among all variables evaluated, only symptoms of depression were significantly greater in the quarantined DSs group when compared to those who were working at the clinical care (p=0.002). Working DSs were significantly less likely (OR=0.630, p=0.001) to have depressive symptoms. Those who were not worried or less worried about the pandemic were less likely to experience stress (OR=0.360), anxiety (OR=0.255), and poor sleep quality (OR=0.256). Sleep had a strong positive and moderate correlation with psychological factors on frontline workers and DSs in outpatient care, respectively. The results suggest confinement may have a more negative impact on the life of DSs than the act of being actively working. The concern about Covid-19 and poor sleep quality was significantly prevalent and may negatively affect the quality of life of DSs. Thus, further research on the topic is needed.","Peixoto, Resende, Almeida, Almeida-Leite, Conti, Barbosa, Barbosa","https://doi.org/10.1590/1678-7757-2020-1089","20210728","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-30","",16666,""
"Long COVID, a comprehensive systematic scoping review","To find out what is known from literature about Long COVID until January 30, 2021. We undertook a four-step search with no language restriction. A preliminary search was made to identify the keywords. A search strategy of all electronic databases resulted in 66 eligible studies. A forward and backward search of the references and citations resulted in additional 54 publications. Non-English language articles were translated using Google Translate. We conducted our scoping review based on the PRISMA-ScR Checklist. Of 120 papers, we found only one randomized clinical trial. Of the 67 original studies, 22 were cohort, and 28 were cross-sectional studies. Of the total 120 publications, 49.1% focused on signs and symptoms, 23.3% on management, and 10.8% on pathophysiology. Ten publications focused on imaging studies. The results are also presented extensively in a narrative synthesis in separated sections (nomenclature, diagnosis, pathophysiology, risk factors, signs/symptoms, management). The controversies in its definition have impaired proper recognition and management. The predominant symptoms were: fatigue, breathlessness, arthralgia, sleep difficulties, and chest pain.

"A Rapid Ethnographic Assessment of the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health Services Delivery in an Acute Care Medical Emergency Department and Trauma Center","A rapid ethnographic assessment of delivery of mental health services to patients at a Level I trauma center in a major metropolitan hospital undergoing a COVID-19 surge was conducted to assess the challenges involved in services delivery and to compare the experience of delivering services across time. Study participants were patients and providers who interacted with or otherwise were observed by three clinicians engaged in the delivery of care within the Emergency Department (ED) and Trauma Center at Harborview Medical Center from the COVID-19-related ""surge"" in April to the end of July 2020. Data were collected and analyzed in accordance with the Rapid Assessment Procedures-Informed Clinical Ethnography (RAPICE) protocol. Community and institutional efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus created several challenges to providing mental health services in an acute care setting during the April surge. Most of these challenges were successfully addressed by standardization of infection control protocols, but new challenges emerged including an increase in expenses for infection control and reduction in clinical revenues due to fewer patients, furloughs of mental health services providers and peer specialists in the ED, services not provided or delayed, increased stress due to fear of furloughs or increased workload of those not furloughed, and increases in patients seen with injuries due to risky behavior, violence, and substance use. These findings illustrate the rapidly shifting nature of the pandemic, its impacts on mental health services, and the mitigation efforts of communities and healthcare systems.","Palinkas, Engstrom, Whiteside, Moloney, Zatzick","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10488-021-01154-2","20210728","COVID-19; Ethnography; Mental health services; Rapid assessment; Trauma care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-30","",16668,""
"Issue in Remote Assessment of Lung Disease and Impact on Physical and Mental Health (RALPMH): Protocol for Prospective Observational Study","Chronic Lung disorders like Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are characterised by exacerbations which are a significant problem: unpleasant for patients, and sometimes severe enough to cause hospital admission (and therefore National Health Service (NHS) pressures) and death. Reducing the impact of exacerbations is very important. Moreover, due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the vulnerable populations with these disorders are at high risk and hence their routine care cannot be done properly. Remote monitoring offers a low cost and safe solution of gaining visibility into the health of people in their daily life. Thus, remote monitoring of patients in their daily lives using mobile and wearable devices could be useful especially in high vulnerability groups. A scenario we consider here is to monitor patients and detect disease exacerbation and progression and investigate the opportunity of detecting exacerbations in real time with a future goal of real time intervention. The primary objective is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of remote monitoring using wearable and mobile phones in patients with pulmonary diseases. The aims will be evaluated over these areas: Participant acceptability, drop-out rates and interpretation of data, Detection of clinically important events such as exacerbations and disease progression, Quantification of symptoms (physical and mental health), Impact of disease on mood and wellbeing/Quality-of-Life(QoL) and The trajectory-tracking of main outcome variables, symptom fluctuations and order. The secondary objective of this study is to provide power calculations for a larger longitudinal follow-up study. Power calculations will be centered around understanding the number of exacerbations according to sample size and duration. Participants will be recruited from 2 NHS sites in 3 different cohorts - COPD, IPF and Post hospitalised Covid. A total of 60 participants will be recruited, 20 in each cohort. Data collection will be done remotely using the RADAR-Base (Remote Assessment of Disease And Relapse) mHealth (mobile health) platform for different devices - Garmin wearable devices, smart spirometers, mobile app questionnaires, surveys and finger pulse oximeters. Passive data collected includes wearable derived continuous heart rate, oxygen saturation (SpO2), respiration rate, activity, and sleep. Active data collected includes disease-specific Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs), mental health questionnaires and symptoms tracking to track disease trajectory in addition to speech sampling, spirometry and finger Pulse Oximetry. Analyses are intended to assess the feasibility of RADAR-Base for lung disorder remote monitoring (include quality of data, cross-section of passive and active data, data completeness, the usability of the system, acceptability of the system). Where adequate data is collected, we will attempt to explore disease trajectory, patient stratification and identification of acute clinically interesting events such as exacerbations. A key part of this study is understanding the potential of real-time data collection, here we will simulate an intervention using the Exacerbation Rating Scale (ERS) to acquire responses at-time-of-event to assess the performance of a model for exacerbation identification from passive data collected. RALPMH study provides a unique opportunity to assess the use of remote monitoring in the study of lung disorders. The study is set to be started in mid-June 2021. The data collection apparatus, questionnaires and wearable integrations have been set up and tested by clinical teams as of 24th April 2021. While waiting for ethics approval, real-time exacerbation identification models are currently being constructed. The models will be pre-trained daily on previous days data but the inference will be run in real-time (with inputs from the wearable sensor data collected which is real-time) to acquire responses at-time-of-event to assess the performance of a model. Remote Assessment of Lung Disease and Impact on Physical and Mental Health (RALPMH) will provide a reference infrastructure for the use of wearable data for monitoring lung diseases. Specifically information regarding the feasibility and acceptability of remote monitoring and the potential of real-time remote data collection and analysis in the context of chronic lung disorders. Moreover, it provides a unique standpoint to look into the specifics of novel coronavirus without burdensome interventions. It will help plan and inform decisions in any future studies that make use of remote monitoring in the area of Respiratory health.

"The diversity of opinion among general practitioners regarding the threat and measures against COVID-19 - Cross-sectional survey","After the 'first wave' in spring 2020, opinions regarding the threat and measures against COVID-19 seemed to vary among German general practitioners (GPs). To systematically investigate opinions and to identify subgroups of GPs sharing similar views. A questionnaire was sent to all 210 practices accredited for undergraduate teaching of family medicine at the Medical Faculty of the Technical University of Munich. Questions addressed personal opinions regarding risks, dilemmas, restrictions and their relaxation associated with COVID-19, and personal fears, symptoms of depression and anxiety. Patterns of strong opinions ('archetypes') were identified using archetypal analysis, a statistical method seeking extremal points in the multidimensional data. One hundred and sixty-one GPs sent back a questionnaire (response rate 77%); 143 (68%) with complete data for all 38 relevant variables could be included in the analysis. We identified four archetypes with subgroups of GPs tending in the direction of these archetypes: a small group of 'Sceptics' (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°12/8%) considering threats of COVID-19 as overrated and measures taken as exaggerated; 'Hardliners' (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°34/24%) considering threats high and supporting strong measures; 'Balancers' (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°77/54%) who also rated the threats high but were more critical about potentially impairing the quality of life of elderly people and children; and 'Anxious' GPs (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°20/14%) tending to report more fear, depressive and anxiety symptoms. Among the participants in this survey, opinions regarding the threat and the measures taken against COVID-19 during the 'first wave' in Germany in spring 2020 varied greatly.","Linde, Bergmaier, Torge, Barth, Schneider, Hapfelmeier","https://doi.org/10.1080/13814788.2021.1954155","20210729","COVID-19; attitudes; general practice; infectious diseases; survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-30","",16670,""
"An exploration of the impact of COVID-19 on mental health in South Africa","In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, South Africa implemented a strict stay-at-home order. The mental health effects of the pandemic and related containment measures are minimally documented in this region. This study examines the association between COVID-19 related stressors and mental health during a strict stay-at-home order in South Africa. A total of 860 self-selected participants residing in the Western Cape province completed an online survey from 20-31 May 2020. This sample consisted mainly of higher socioeconomic and higher educated segments of the population. Structural equation modelling was used to assess how sociodemographic factors, membership of vulnerable groups and COVID-19 related stressors were associated with PHQ-9 (depression) and GAD-7 (anxiety) scores. 46.0% and 47.2% of participants met the diagnostic threshold of anxiety and depressive disorder, respectively. Considerable daily life repercussions were linked to these scores. Among these participants, less than 20% consulted a formal practitioner and this was 12% for participants without a pre-existing mental health condition. Distress related to containment measures and distress about being infected were significantly associated with more anxiety and depressive symptoms. Having a pre-existing mental health condition was associated with poorer mental health, but being an active health worker was not. Younger age, being female, and living in a non-rural area were associated with poorer mental health. Our findings suggest a considerable mental health impact of this pandemic and related containment measures, but low attendance of mental health services. The accessibility to tailored mental health support is essential under these circumstances, especially for vulnerable groups.","De Man, Smith, Schneider, Tabana","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2021.1954671","20210728","COVID-19; South Africa; anxiety; containment measures; depression; mental health; vulnerable populations","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-30","",16671,""
"Resilience moderates the relationship between the psychological impact of COVID-19 and anxiety","Psychological resilience is considered to constitute an important factor for protecting mental health, especially during times of crises, like the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. However, there is a lack of research on the potential buffering effect of resilience on the psychological impact of COVID-19 as related to mental health. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to examine protective effects of resilience on mental health during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in Austria. Analysis was based on data collected from 4,113 Austrian residents, who participated in an anonymous online survey. The survey addressed sociodemographic data, the subjective response to COVID-19 (Impact of Event Scale; IES-R), mental health status (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale; DASS-21), and resilience (Resilience-Scale; RS-11). Structural equation modelling showed significant positive associations between the IES-R score and depressive symptoms, stress and anxiety, respectively. Resilience was significantly negatively associated with depression, stress, and anxiety. Furthermore, resilience moderated the relation between the impact of COVID-19 and anxiety symptoms. However, there was no moderating effect of resilience on the relationship between IES-R and both depression and stress. The psychological impact of COVID-19 on anxiety symptoms seems to vary with the level of resilience. Moderating effects of resilience on the relation between impact of COVID-19 and stress and depression symptoms could not be confirmed. Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term effects of resilience on stress and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","TraunmÃƒÂ¼ller, Stefitz, Schneider, Schwerdtfeger","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2021.1955137","20210728","COVID-19 pandemic; mental health; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-30","",16672,""
"Prevalence of Burnout among Dental Students during COVID-19 Lockdown in UAE","To estimate the prevalence of burnout among dental students in two major universities in the United Arab Emirates during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) lockdown. In this cross-sectional observational study, the burnout clinical subtype questionnaire (BCSQ-12-SS) (English version) was used. It consists of 12 questions covering domains of overload (4 questions), lack of development (4 questions), and neglect (4 questions). The questionnaire was sent to 500 dental students from the University of Sharjah (UOS) and Ajman University of Science and Technology (AUST). The association between burnout and sociodemographic variables was also investigated. The majority of responders were females (74%). Socio-demographic and study characteristics of dental students from both universities were not remarkably different. However, the responses to the BCSQ-12-SS questions were not very different. In this study, there was no significant association between burnout and demographic variables, such as age, gender, relationships, distance from family, residency, year of study, studying hours, and number of failed subjects. However, there was a significant association between burnout and receiving a scholarship and family support. Identifying individuals at risk for burnout may provide a potential intervention strategy and counseling to assist in dental student development, as it has good psychometric properties. Burnout among dental students could develop into anxiety and depressive disorders. Early identification and prevention will protect the psychological well-being of dentists.

"Mentoring in the Time of COVID-19: An Analysis of Online Focus Groups with Mentors to Youth","This study explored the experiences of mentors to youth during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study aims were to examine (1) the role of the pandemic on mentor-mentee interactions and relationships and (2) the ways in which mentors could be supported during the health crisis to better meet youth needs. Six online focus groups were conducted with 39 mentors. Mentor participants included 26 females and 11 males (two did not disclose gender), and 51% identified as white. Any mentor currently in a mentoring relationship, regardless of type, was eligible. Using Facebook groups, moderators posted questions and prompts, and mentor participants responded using textual comments. The text from each group was recorded, extracted, and coded and analyzed using thematic analysis. As mentors transitioned to a primarily online format, text and video chat became the most common communication methods. Mentees' access to technology and privacy were the biggest challenges faced. Mentor concerns for their mentees varied, including mental health, school, family finances, and access to instrumental support and food. Mentor help involved routinely connecting with mentees and providing academic support. Mentors requested ideas and resources for connecting with mentees and an online mentor support group. During the early weeks of the pandemic, mentors continued to engage with mentees, offering valuable support during a confusing and scary time. Mentoring programs can broaden their approach, intentionally integrating online connecting in an effort to provide safe, appropriate, and continued support to both mentors and mentees.","Kaufman, Wright, Simon, Edwards, Thrul, DuBois","https://doi.org/10.1002/ajcp.12543","20210728","COVID-19; E-Mentoring; Mentoring; Online focus group; Youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-30","",16674,""

"Immediate effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient health, health-care use, and behaviours: results from an international survey of people with rheumatic diseases","The impact and consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with rheumatic disease are unclear. We developed the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance Patient Experience Survey to assess the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with rheumatic disease worldwide. Survey questions were developed by key stakeholder groups and disseminated worldwide through social media, websites, and patient support organisations. Questions included demographics, rheumatic disease diagnosis, COVID-19 diagnosis, adoption of protective behaviours to mitigate COVID-19 exposure, medication access and changes, health-care access and communication with rheumatologists, and changes in employment or schooling. Adults age 18 years and older with inflammatory or autoimmune rheumatic diseases were eligible for inclusion. We included participants with and without a COVID-19 diagnosis. We excluded participants reporting only non-inflammatory rheumatic diseases such as fibromyalgia or osteoarthritis. 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°117 responses to the survey were received between April 3 and May 8, 2020, and of these, 10Ã¢â‚¬â€°407 respondents had included appropriate age data. We included complete responses from 9300 adults with rheumatic disease (mean age 46Ã‚Â·1 years; 8375 [90Ã‚Â·1%] women, 893 [9Ã‚Â·6%] men, and 32 [0Ã‚Â·3%] participants who identified as non-binary). 6273 (67Ã‚Â·5%) of respondents identified as White, 1565 (16Ã‚Â·8%) as Latin American, 198 (2Ã‚Â·1%) as Black, 190 (2Ã‚Â·0%) as Asian, and 42 (0Ã‚Â·5%) as Native American or Aboriginal or First Nation. The most common rheumatic disease diagnoses included rheumatoid arthritis (3636 [39Ã‚Â·1%] of 9300), systemic lupus erythematosus (2882 [31Ã‚Â·0%]), and SjÃƒÂ¶gren's syndrome (1290 [13Ã‚Â·9%]). Most respondents (6921 [82Ã‚Â·0%] of 8441) continued their antirheumatic medications as prescribed. Almost all (9266 [99Ã‚Â·7%] of 9297) respondents adopted protective behaviours to limit SARS-CoV-2 exposure. A change in employment status occurred in 2524 (27Ã‚Â·1%) of 9300) of respondents, with a 13Ã‚Â·6% decrease in the number in full-time employment (from 4066 to 3514). People with rheumatic disease maintained therapy and followed public health advice to mitigate the risks of COVID-19. Substantial employment status changes occurred, with potential implications for health-care access, medication affordability, mental health, and rheumatic disease activity.

"Cognitive deficits in people who have recovered from COVID-19","There is growing concern about possible cognitive consequences of COVID-19, with reports of 'Long COVID' symptoms persisting into the chronic phase and case studies revealing neurological problems in severely affected patients. However, there is little information regarding the nature and broader prevalence of cognitive problems post-infection or across the full spread of disease severity. We sought to confirm whether there was an association between cross-sectional cognitive performance data from 81,337 participants who between January and December 2020 undertook a clinically validated web-optimized assessment as part of the Great British Intelligence Test, and questionnaire items capturing self-report of suspected and confirmed COVID-19 infection and respiratory symptoms. People who had recovered from COVID-19, including those no longer reporting symptoms, exhibited significant cognitive deficits versus controls when controlling for age, gender, education level, income, racial-ethnic group, pre-existing medical disorders, tiredness, depression and anxiety. The deficits were of substantial effect size for people who had been hospitalised (<i>N</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 192), but also for non-hospitalised cases who had biological confirmation of COVID-19 infection (<i>N</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 326). Analysing markers of premorbid intelligence did not support these differences being present prior to infection. Finer grained analysis of performance across sub-tests supported the hypothesis that COVID-19 has a multi-domain impact on human cognition. Interpretation. These results accord with reports of 'Long Covid' cognitive symptoms that persist into the early-chronic phase. They should act as a clarion call for further research with longitudinal and neuroimaging cohorts to plot recovery trajectories and identify the biological basis of cognitive deficits in SARS-COV-2 survivors.

"Cohort profile: the Men and Parenting Pathways (MAPP) Study: a longitudinal Australian cohort study of men's mental health and well-being at the normative age for first-time fatherhood","The Men and Parenting Pathways (MAPP) Study is a prospective investigation of men's mental health and well-being across the normative age for transitioning to fatherhood. This includes trajectories and outcomes for men who do and do not become fathers across five annual waves of the study. Australian resident, English-speaking men aged 28-32 years at baseline were eligible. Recruitment was over a 2-year period (2015-2017) via social and traditional media and through engagement with study partners. Eight hundred and eighteen eligible men consented to participate. Of these, 664 men completed the first online survey of whom 608 consented to ongoing participation. Of the ongoing sample, 83% have participated in at least two of the first three annual online surveys. Three waves of data collection are complete. The first longitudinal analysis of MAPP data, published in 2020, identified five profiles that characterise men's patterns of depressive symptom severity and presentations of anger. Profiles indicating pronounced anger and depressive symptoms were associated with fathers' lack of perceived social support, and problems with coparenting and bonding with infants. In a second study, MAPP data were combined with three other Australian cohorts in a meta-analysis of associations between fathers' self-reported sleep problems up to 3 years postpartum and symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress. Adjusted meta-analytic associations between paternal sleep and mental health risk ranged from 0.25 to 0.37. MAPP is an ongoing cohort study. Waves 4 and 5 data will be ready for analyses at the end of 2021. Future investigations will include crossed-lagged and trajectory analyses that assess inter-relatedness and changing social networks, mental health, work and family life. A nested study of COVID-19 pandemic-related mental health and coping will add two further waves of data collection in a subsample of MAPP participants.","Macdonald, Francis, Skouteris, Youssef, Graeme, Williams, Fletcher, Knight, Milgrom, Di Manno, Olsson, Greenwood","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-047909","20210728","adult psychiatry; anxiety disorders; depression &amp; mood disorders; mental health; perinatology; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-30","",16678,""
"Longitudinal influence of COVID-19-related stress on sexual compulsivity symptoms in Chinese undergraduates","The coping theory shows that stressful life events are associated with individuals' psychology/behaviors; meanwhile, the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is known to have impacted individuals' physical and mental health. Prior studies revealed that undergraduates have many sexual behavior and emotion disorders, which may be impacted during an isolation period, such as the one brought by COVID-19. However, few studies have explored the longitudinal associations between COVID-19-related stress and sexual compulsivity symptoms (SCS), and the mediating effect of emotions (i.e., depression and anxiety) on this relationship. This longitudinal study aimed to investigate these associations. We employed a cross-lagged design (2020/2/12: Time 1, 3219 participants; 2020/6/6: Time 2, 2998 participants) and recruited Chinese undergraduates through an online system to respond to a survey. Our results showed that COVID-19-related stress at Time 1 directly influenced SCS at Time 1, and there was an indirect influence via depression and anxiety at Time 1. COVID-19-related stress at Time 1 positively correlated with depression, anxiety, and SCS at Time 2, and the first could directly and positively predict SCS at Time 2. Moreover, albeit depression at Time 2 was negatively linked to SCS at Time 2, anxiety at Time 2 enhanced the effect of COVID-19-related stress on SCS. Our findings extend the literature on SCS, showing that the higher the COVID-19-related stress, the higher the SCS, and the longer-lasting effect was associated with anxiety in undergraduates. Furthermore, depression does not mediate the relationship between COVID-19-related stress and SCS.","Deng, Li, Wang, Teng","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03369-x","20210728","Anxiety sexual compulsivity symptom; COVID-19; Depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-30","",16679,""
"Adolescent and young adult stress and coping during COVID-19: the utility of a pediatric emergency department screener","COVID-19 altered lives, especially adolescents and young adults who lost their emotional and social support systems and may be suffering. In response to the coronavirus pandemic, a questionnaire was created and administered to Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) patients in order to identify psychosocial stress and coping abilities. A 12-question (yes/no) quality improvement (QI) paper-based questionnaire was administered by PED providers to assess psychosocial stress and coping among patients 12 years and greater who presented to the PED at a tertiary Children's Hospital, March-September 2020. Questions were asked/recorded to determine rates of distress and provide social work intervention, if needed. Analysis-Chi-squared, Fisher's exact, and Mann-Whitney U tests. Among 1261 PED patients who participated in the study, the mean age was 15.4 years (SD = 2.4), (58% female, 41.5% male, 0.6% missing data). We identified 611 patients (48.5%) who admitted to feeling scared about contracting the disease, 876 patients (69.5%) who were concerned about the health of their families, and 229 patients (18.2%) who screened positive for food insecurity. In addition, 596 patients (47.3%) felt anxiety, 333 patients (26.4%) felt depressed, and 13 patients (1%) admitted to having suicidal ideation because of COVID-19. The majority of patients, 1165 (92.4%), felt supported during the pandemic. Social work was consulted for 235 (18.6%) of patients participating. While patients typically present to PEDs for a somatic complaint, screening their psychosocial and emotional states may reveal underlying mental health concerns that require intervention and at times, assistance from social workers.","Yau, Nager","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12245-021-00359-4","20210728","Anxiety; COVID-19; Mental health; Psychosocial stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-30","",16680,""
