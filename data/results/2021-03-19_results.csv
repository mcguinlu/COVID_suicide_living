"Psychosocial effects of social media on the Saudi society during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic: A cross-sectional study","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been posing a substantial challenge to human survival and well-being, which rely on the actions and behaviors of individuals. It is essential that accurate information is distributed; however, misinformation has been spread via social media. Consequently, the resulting panic has to be addressed while putting essential public health measures in place. It is also important to explore the link between the social media exposure and well-being. Therefore, in the current study, we aimed to identify the levels of anxiety, depression, and social isolation among individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we explored the relationship between exposure to misleading social media news and anxiety, depression, and social isolation. A cross sectional design was employed to collect data from 371 Saudi participants (aged 16-60 years), using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, and de Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale. Results showed that the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and social isolation was 47.82%, 47.57%, and 46.42%, respectively. Further, more than 83% of the participants reported using social media frequently during the pandemic. We found that exposure to misinformation via social media has a significant positive relationship with anxiety, depression, and social isolation. However, Due to the cross-sectional nature of this study it cannot be determined whether social media causes negative mental health outcomes, or if individuals experiencing greater depression, anxiety and social isolation turn to social media more than others, or if some third variable might explain both. Based on our findings, we present specific suggestions related to the COVID-19 pandemic to the government of Saudi Arabia. Minoring and filtering out misleading information with the cooperation of the World Health Organization (WHO) can promote the spread of accurate news in Saudi Arabia.","Hammad, Alqarni","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248811","20210318","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-19","",12113,""
"Association of Children's Mode of School Instruction with Child and Parent Experiences and Well-Being During the COVID-19 Pandemic - COVID Experiences Survey, United States, October 8-November 13, 2020","In March 2020, efforts to slow transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, resulted in widespread closures of school buildings, shifts to virtual educational models, modifications to school-based services, and disruptions in the educational experiences of school-aged children. Changes in modes of instruction have presented psychosocial stressors to children and parents that can increase risks to mental health and well-being and might exacerbate educational and health disparities (1,2). CDC examined differences in child and parent experiences and indicators of well-being according to children's mode of school instruction (i.e., in-person only [in-person], virtual-only [virtual], or combined virtual and in-person [combined]) using data from the COVID Experiences nationwide survey. During October 8-November 13, 2020, parents or legal guardians (parents) of children aged 5-12 years were surveyed using the NORC at the University of Chicago AmeriSpeak panel,* a probability-based panel designed to be representative of the U.S. household population. Among 1,290 respondents with a child enrolled in public or private school, 45.7% reported that their child received virtual instruction, 30.9% in-person instruction, and 23.4% combined instruction. For 11 of 17 stress and well-being indicators concerning child mental health and physical activity and parental emotional distress, findings were worse for parents of children receiving virtual or combined instruction than were those for parents of children receiving in-person instruction. Children not receiving in-person instruction and their parents might experience increased risk for negative mental, emotional, or physical health outcomes and might need additional support to mitigate pandemic effects. Community-wide actions to reduce COVID-19 incidence and support mitigation strategies in schools are critically important to support students' return to in-person learning.","Verlenden, Pampati, Rasberry, Liddon, Hertz, Kilmer, Viox, Lee, Cramer, Barrios, Ethier","https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7011a1","20210318","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-19","",12114,""
"THE EFFECTS OF PARTICIPATING IN A RESEARCH TEAM DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON THE EDUCATIONAL ROUTINE AND MENTAL HEALTH OF MEDICAL STUDENTS: A STUDY PROTOCOL FOR A WEB BASED SURVEY","The COVID-19 pandemic has provided social isolation with a potential negative impact on the educational routine, including the suspension of face-to-face appointments, and mental health of medical students. The Mario Pinotti II study (MPII) is a 24-week observational study with scheduled telephone calls every 2 weeks to verify the occurrence of the COVID-19 in rheumatic patients on hydroxychloroquine chronically (from 29th, March, 2020 to 30th, September, 2020). The effects of voluntary participation in a research project, which foresees interaction by telephone contact with patients, professors, rheumatologists, and colleagues on the daily life and mental health of medical students requires evaluation. Considering that medical students are professionals in training with a high level of responsibility to handle emotional and physical aspects related to several diseases, this study has the aim of evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and participation in the MPII study, on the educational routine and mental health of medical students. A web-based survey was carried out to perform a cross-sectional comparative assessment between medical students participating in the MPII study and other their colleagues who are not involved in this research project, matched to sex, age and medical school. The web questionnaire was developed by a panel composed of graduate medical students, rheumatologists, medical school professors, and a psychology professor and it included details on demographic and life habits data, as well as evaluation of participants' impression about the MPII study and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their educational routine and medical training. In addition, the depressive, anxiety, and stress domains were evaluated using the DASS-21 (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale), Brazilian version, and, lately, the scores were grouped as low, moderate and high risk for mental distress. This project was approved by the Federal University of SÃƒÂ£o Paulo Ethics Committee (CAAE: 34034620.0.0000.5505). Data collection was applied for both medical student groups from July 20th to August 31st, 2020. Data extraction was completed in September, 2020. Analysis is ongoing. The authors expect the results to be published in the first semester of 2021.

"Physical and mental impact of COVID-19 outbreak on fibromyalgia patients","Acute or chronic stress may trigger or aggravate symptoms of fibromyalgia (FM). We aimed to evaluate the physical and mental health of fibromyalgia patients during the COVID 19 outbreak and identify protective/risk factors. An online survey was published in May 2020, following two months of lockdown due to the COVID 19 outbreak, including questionnaires regarding demographic characteristics, access to medical services, anxiety, depression, life approach, coping strategies, perception of social support, widespread pain index (WPI) and symptoms severity scale (SSS), insomnia severity index (ISI) and patient global assessment. Of the 233 patients included in the study, 98% were forced to discontinue complementary - alternative treatments during lockdown. Up to 30% of responders who had been treated with medical cannabis had to stop due to logistic difficulties and this was associated with significantly higher scores of WPI/SSS (p=0.024). Higher levels of anxiety and depression were significantly correlated with higher levels of pain, sleep disorders and subjective perception of deterioration (p=0.00). Higher scores of social support and positive life approach were correlated with less anxiety and depression (p&lt;0.01), lower levels of pain (p&lt;0.05) and less sleep disturbances (p&lt;0.01). Avoidant coping style was strongly associated to higher levels of pain, sleep disturbances, anxiety, depression, and subjective perception of worsening (p&lt;0.01). Fibromyalgia patients reported adverse mental and physical outcomes during the COVID-19 outbreak. Factors such as stopping current treatments may play a central role. Social support and a positive life approach appear to be protective.","Aloush, Gurfinkel, Shachar, Ablin, Elkana","https://www.google.com/search?q=Physical+and+mental+impact+of+COVID-19+outbreak+on+fibromyalgia+patients.","20210318","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-19","",12116,""
"Clinical impact of confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with fibromyalgia: a cohort study","To our knowledge, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on fibromyalgia (FM) patients has not been studied before. FM patients often experience clinical impairment with stress. The aim of this study was to determine whether severity of FM increases because of confinement by the COVID-19 pandemic. This prospective study includes patients from the Combined Index of Severity of Fibromyalgia (ICAF) cohort who met the 2010 ACR FM criteria. In this cohort, all patients have a periodical evaluation of their quality of life through two questionnaires, the ICAF, which assesses the ability to perform daily living activities, anxiety and depression, and through the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), which assesses overall change after a therapeutical intervention. Pre- and post-confinement measurements were analysed. Inferential statistical analysis and ANOVA for repeated measurements were used. A total of 93 patients received a phone consultation, (95.5% females), mean (SD) age of 48.23 (8.38) years. Four patients were excluded as presenting COVID-19 and 51 (57%) completed the post-confinement ICAF. Following confinement, 25 (49%) patients got worse (group-worse) and 26 (51%) patients experienced no change or improved (group-stable). Comparisons between pre- and post-confinement ICAF did not show significant differences in both groups. Passive coping was significantly different in group-worse in pre-confinement evaluation. In the 80% of patients with passive coping predominance there were no changes in coping strategy. No clinical impairment due to COVID-19 confinement occurred. The perceived worsening among FM patients relies primarily on how patients cope with their disease, without a real impact on clinical manifestations.","Rivera, CastrejÃƒÂ³n, Vallejo-Slocker, OffenbÃƒÂ¤cher, Molina-Collada, Trives, LÃƒÂ³pez, Caballero, Hirsch, Toussaint, Nieto, Alvaro-Gracia, Vallejo","https://www.google.com/search?q=Clinical+impact+of+confinement+due+to+the+COVID-19+pandemic+on+patients+with+fibromyalgia:+a+cohort+study.","20210318","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-19","",12117,""
"Depending on your own kindness: The moderating role of self-compassion on the within-person consequences of work loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic","The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has transformed the way we work, with many employees working under isolating and difficult conditions. However, research on the antecedents, consequences, and buffers of work loneliness is scarce. Integrating research on need for belonging, regulatory loop models of loneliness, and self-compassion, the current study addresses this critical issue by developing and testing a conceptual model that highlights how COVID-related stressors frustrate employees' need for belonging (i.e., telecommuting frequency, job insecurity, and a lack of COVID-related informational justice), negatively impacting worker well-being (i.e., depression) and helping behaviors [i.e., organizational citizenship behavior (OCB)] through work loneliness. Furthermore, we examine the buffering role of self-compassion in this process. Results from a weekly diary study of U.S. employees conducted over 2 months during the initial stage of the pandemic provide support for the mediating role of work loneliness in relations between all three proposed antecedents and both outcomes. In addition, self-compassion mitigated the positive within-person relationship between work loneliness and employee depression, indicating that more self-compassionate employees were better able to cope with their feelings of work loneliness. Although self-compassion also moderated the within-person relationship between work loneliness and OCB, this interaction was different in form from our prediction. Implications for enhancing employee well-being and helping behaviors during and beyond the pandemic are discussed.

"Increasing treatment-seeking intentions of US veterans in the Covid-19 era: A randomized controlled trial","Veterans have higher rates of anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and may be vulnerable to mental health consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic. More than half of veterans who meet mental illness criteria do not seek help. This study screened for clinical symptoms and evaluated the efficacy of a brief, online social-contact-based video intervention in increasing treatment-seeking intentions among veterans. We hypothesized that the video-based intervention would increase treatment-seeking intentions more than written vignette and control conditions. One hundred seventy-two veterans were randomized to either a (a) brief video-based intervention; (b) written vignette intervention, or (c) nonintervention control group. In the 3-min video, a veteran previously diagnosed with PTSD described his symptom reactivation by Covid-19, his barriers to care, and how therapy helped him to cope. Assessments were conducted at baseline, postintervention, and at 14- and 30-day follow-ups. A total of 91 (53%) veterans reported high levels of clinical symptoms, especially those self-reporting Covid-19 exposure. The brief video-based intervention yielded greater increase in treatment-seeking intentions among veterans. Within the video group, women showed an increase in treatment-seeking intentions from baseline to postintervention only, whereas men showed a more sustained effect, from baseline to Day 14. Surveyed veterans reported high symptoms levels. A brief video intervention increased treatment-seeking intention, likely through identification and emotional engagement with the video protagonist. This easily disseminable video-based intervention has the potential to increase likelihood of seeking care. Future research should examine longer term sustainability and changes in help-seeking behavior.","Amsalem, Lazarov, Markowitz, Gorman, Dixon, Neria","https://doi.org/10.1002/da.23149","20210318","Covid-19; PTSD; anxiety; depression; help-seeking; intervention; veterans","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-19","",12119,""
"Remote delivery of a therapeutic intervention to court-mandated youths of Haitian descent during COVID-19","The threat generated by the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered sudden institutional changes in an effort to reduce viral spread. Restrictions on group gatherings and in-person engagement have increased the demand for remote service delivery. These restrictions have also affected the delivery of court-mandated interventions. However, much of the literature has focused on populations that voluntarily seek out face-to-face medical care or mental health services, whereas insufficient attention has been paid to telehealth engagement of court-mandated populations. This article draws on data gathered on an NIH/NIDA-funded study intervention implemented with juvenile justice-involved youths of Haitian heritage in Miami-Dade County, Florida, during the COVID-19 public health crisis. We explore the process of obtaining consent, technological access issues, managing privacy, and other challenges associated with remote delivery of family-based therapy to juvenile justice-involved youth. Our aim is to provide some insights for consideration by therapists, healthcare workers, advocates, researchers, and policymakers tasked with finding alternative and safer ways to engage nontraditional populations in health services.

"Changes in mental well-being of adult Poles in the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic with reference to their occupational activity and remote work","The present study focused on the relationship between occupational activity and mental health during the first COVID-19 lockdown. At the turn of May and June 2020, an online survey was conducted on a representative sample of 3000 Poles (age: Me = 45 years). Working persons accounted for 52% of the respondents, while 38.1% were hired workers. Two standardized (0-100 pts) indices were defined. The level of mental health symptoms index (LMHSI) concerned the incidence of 4 problems within the past 2 months, whereas the change in mental health symptoms index (CMHSI) concerned the degree of mental health deterioration. The mean value of LMHSI was 40.91 (SD = 26.97), and that of CMHSI 60.51 (SD = 23.97). In both cases, a worse assessment was obtained among women than among men. In the group of working respondents, the least advantageous results were found among those who worked casually or under a commission contract. Among the non-employed respondents, jobless persons and students were the group at risk. Remote work resulted in the deterioration of mental health in the light of CMHSI; however, a threat of changes in the professional situation affected LMHSI variability to the greatest extent The results of linear regression (R2 = 0.339) suggest that the increase in the CMHSI score (adjusted for LMHSI) is independently influenced by female sex, university education, remote work and a threat of the worsening of employment terms. The analysis of the interaction effect showed a stronger impact of the last factor in the group of women (p = 0.001). To conclude, COVID-19 restrictions were associated with a negative impact on mental health which should be analyzed in the occupational context.","Izdebski, Mazur","https://doi.org/10.13075/ijomeh.1896.01778","20210318","COVID-19; change of employment terms; employment status; mental health; online survey; remote work","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-19","",12121,""
"Forward-focused coping predicts better mental health outcomes in mid- to late-life during the COVID-19 pandemic","<b>Objectives:</b> Psychosocial stressors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may increase the risk of depression and anxiety in the general population. Individuals approaching or within older adulthood may be especially vulnerable to these psychosocial stressors and their impact on mental health outcomes. Consequently, there is an urgent need to identify protective factors for older adults. The purpose of the present study was to determine the relative contribution of coping flexibility (CF) and two distinct coping strategies, forward-focused and trauma-focused, on negative affect in persons 50 years of age and older during the COVID-19 pandemic.<b>Method:</b> Data were collected using an online survey, including questions about demographic information, coping, depression, and anxiety. Participants aged 50 and over were included in our analyses of depression (<i>N</i> = 800) and anxiety (<i>N</i> = 638).<b>Results:</b> Both higher CF and higher forward-focused coping predicted lower depression and lower anxiety. In contrast, higher trauma-focused coping predicted slightly higher depressive symptoms but was not a significant predictor of anxiety.<b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings suggest that higher forward-focused coping may serve as a protective factor in older adults during the pandemic and, therefore, may be an effective treatment target for mental health interventions.","Jordan, Woodard, Pena, Arnold-Nedimala, Won, Callow, Smith","https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2021.1897523","20210318","Depression; anxiety; coping flexibility; negative affect; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-19","",12122,""

Children and adolescents reported fear and anxiety, as well as disruptions to their day to day routines as a result of outbreaks. However, children were also able to demonstrate resilience during outbreaks with the right support. Children's psychological response to the outbreak appeared to be largely attributed to how their parents, healthcare providers and the media communicated the event.

The study showed significant associations between (i) place of province and anxiety; (ii) sleep per day and depression; (iii) hours spent on the internet per day for education and depression; (iv) postponement of final exams and depression. There were no significant associations with the socio-demographic variables. <b>Conclusion:</b> Anxiety and depression in health science students showed correlation with the province, internet use for education, and postponement of exams. These correlations could be common among students in other fields as well. A large-scale study covering a wider geographical area and various fields of education is necessary to further evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on (health sciences) students.

"They Saw It Coming: Rising Trends in Depression, Anxiety, and Suicidality in Creative Students and Potential Impact of the COVID-19 Crisis","Previous research has established that creative adolescents are generally low in neuroticism and as well-adjusted as their peers. From 2006 to 2013, data from cohorts of creative adolescents attending a counseling laboratory supported these results. Clinical findings of increased anxiety, depression, and suicidality among creative students in 2014 led the researchers to create 3 studies to explore these clinical findings. Once artifactual causes of these changes were ruled out, a quantitative study was conducted. Study 1, an analysis of mean differences of pre-2014 and post-2014 cohorts showed that post-2014 cohorts scored significantly higher in Neuroticism, Openness to Experience, and Conscientiousness and lower in Extraversion on Big 5 inventories. Regression analyses suggested that while Neuroticism was associated with gender, Conscientiousness and Grade Point Average for the earlier group, Neuroticism in the post 2014 groups was related to complex interplay of all personality dynamics except Agreeableness. In the qualitative Study 2, focus groups of 6-10 students, for a total of 102 participants were queried about the reasons they perceived for increased anxiety and depression in creative students. Increased achievement pressures and awareness of environmental and social problems were major sources of external stressors; perfectionism and desire to fulfill expectations of others were the primary sources of internal stress. The authors suggest that creative students' openness to experience and advanced knowledge made it possible for these students to see the potential for environmental and social crises and respond to their inability to solve these problems with anxiety and depression. Study 3 was a qualitative study that followed up 19 participants from the post-2014 cohort to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and creativity. While the majority perceived a negative effect of the pandemic on their mental health, most also produced a surprising variety of creative works during that time. In conclusion, rapid changes in the lives of creative adolescents since 2014 suggest that scholars focus on current cohorts and the ways in which adolescent personality is shaped by internal expectation and external pressures and global events. Despite the pandemic, creative young people continued to create.","Kerr, Birdnow, Wright, Fiene","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.611838","20210318","COVID-19; adolescence; anxiety; creativity &amp; innovation; depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-19","",12126,""

The survey comprised basic demographic data of the participants and anxiety symptoms measured using the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) with Ã¢â€°Â¥15 as the cut-off score for clinically significant anxiety symptoms. Additionally, a survey regarding the lockdown effect was administered, which consisted of several parts, to measure the lockdown status. A total of 8084 responses were recorded, of which, 5090 (63%) were women and 2994 (37%) were men. The mean age (SD) for study participants was 27.2 (8.9) years. Among the participants, 1145 (14.2%) reached the cut-off score to detect anxiety symptoms; however, of the study variables, only five were predictors of clinically significant anxiety: age, gender, marital status, work status, being a financial supporter for the family, and being infected with COVID-19. Women had 1.19 times higher odds to exhibit anxiety symptoms than men. Increasing age was significantly associated with reduced likelihood of exhibiting anxiety symptoms, whereas being married was significantly associated with higher likelihood of anxiety symptoms, compared to not being married. Being suspended from work was associated with an increase in the likelihood of anxiety symptoms. However, we found that being infected with COVID-19 was associated with a 9.59 times higher risk of exhibiting severe anxiety symptoms. Among the study participants, 1451 (17.9%) reported a physical and/or verbal abuse episode from family members, 958 (11.9%) reported abuse outside the family, and 641 (7.9%) reported abuse from enforcers, during the lockdown. Our study provided an overview of the psychological and behavioral status, among those who resided in Libya during the civil war and COVID-19 pandemic. The study demonstrates a concerningly high level of clinically significant anxiety during lockdown among the Libyan population during Libya's lockdown period.","Msherghi, Alsuyihili, Alsoufi, Ashini, Alkshik, Alshareea, Idheiraj, Nagib, Abusriwel, Mustafa, Mohammed, Eshbeel, Elbarouni, Elhadi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.605279","20210318","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; anxiety; lockdown; mental health; psychology; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-19","",12127,""
"Social, Family, and Educational Impacts on Anxiety and Cognitive Empathy Derived From the COVID-19: Study on Families With Children","This research aims to monitor the current situation of confinement in Spanish society motivated by COVID-19 crisis. For this, a study of its socio-family, psychological and educational impact is conducted. The sample (<i>N</i> = 165 families, 89.1% nuclear families with children living in the same household and 20.5% with a relative in a risk group) comes from the Aragonese region (Spain). The instruments used are: Beck-II Depression Inventory (BDI-II); Baron-Cohen and Wheelwright's Empathy Quotient (EQ) with its cognitive empathy subscale, as well as an ad-hoc questionnaire, reviewed by a panel of experts, to learn about socio-personal, family and housing conditions, use of technology, involvement in school tasks and household, and working condition. The multiple regression analysis results show that the anxiety derived from the current situation is explained in 23.1% (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) by the variables: gender (t = -2.31, <i>p</i> = 0.022), level of Internet consumption (t = 2.139, <i>p</i> = 0.034), increase of family conflicts (t = 2.980, <i>p</i> = 0.003) and help with school tasks (t = 2.980, <i>p</i> = 0.040). On the other hand, cognitive empathy is explained in 24.6% (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) by the variables: gender (t = -4.690, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and mother's hours of teleworking (t = 2.101, <i>p</i> = 0.037). All this leads us to conclusions related to preventive systems of social, psychological, and educational aspects to better serve families. These conclusions can be also be transferred to the future with an inclusive care to family settings from those three parameters.","QuÃƒÂ­lez-Robres, Lozano-Blasco, ÃƒÂÃƒÂ±iguez-Berrozpe, CortÃƒÂ©s-Pascual","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.562800","20210318","COVID-19; anxiety; cognitive empathy; education; families; social stressors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-19","",12128,""
"Psychiatric symptoms and behavioral adjustment during the COVID-19 pandemic: evidence from two population-representative cohorts","This study examined prevalences of anxiety and depression and their correlations with daily routines among Hong Kong Chinese during the COVID-19 pandemic. Random digit dialing recruited two population-representative samples of 6029 residents during a period of low infection and limited intervention (survey 1: nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4021) and high incidence and intensive measures (survey 2: nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2008). Prevalence of anxiety for survey 1 and survey 2 were 14.9% and 14% and depression were 19.6% and 15.3%, respectively. Increased odds of anxiety and depression were associated with disrupted routines and lower socioeconomic status in both surveys, whereas depression was inversely related to the novel preventive routine of avoiding going to crowded places in survey 1. The prevalences of anxiety and depression were higher than preceding public health/social crises. A heavier burden of psychiatric conditions was evidenced amongst people experiencing disrupted daily routines across different phases of the pandemic and without novel preventive routines in the early phase.","Hou, Lee, Liang, Li, Liu, Tong, Ben-Ezra, Goodwin","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-021-01279-w","20210318","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-19","",12129,""
"Resilience and psychological distress in pregnant women during quarantine due to the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain: a multicentre cross-sectional online survey","To examine the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms and the corresponding risk factors among pregnant women during the confinement due to the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain. Between 15 April and 14 May 2020, a multicentre cross-sectional survey was performed to study depression, anxiety and resilience in a sample of Spanish pregnant women during the lockdown set up by the Government in response to COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. We designed an anonymous online self-administered questionnaire (https://bit.ly/34RRpq1) that included the Spanish validated versions of the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Connor-Davidson Resilience 10-items Scale (CD-RISC-10). A total of 514 pregnant women completed the survey. 72.8% had been confined &lt; 40Ã¢â‚¬â€°days and 27.2% between 41 and 60Ã¢â‚¬â€°days. 182 (35.4%) participants scored over 10, with 21.3% scoring over 13 (75th Percentile) in depressive symptoms rates. We found high trait and anxiety scores, with 223 (43.4%) and 227 (44.2%) pregnant women scoring over the trait and state mean scores. Neither depression, anxiety or resilience levels showed any significant correlation with the length of confinement. We found low CD-RISC-10 scores. We found a high prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms during the quarantine, although we did not find an increased prevalence of psychological distress according to length of home confinement. Resilience correlated negatively with depression and anxiety.","LubiÃƒÂ¡n LÃƒÂ³pez, ButrÃƒÂ³n Hinojo, Arjona Bernal, Fasero Laiz, Alcolea Santiago, Guerra Vilches, Casaus FernÃƒÂ¡ndez, Bueno Moral, Olvera Perdigones, RodrÃƒÂ­guez RodrÃƒÂ­guez, Cuevas Palomino, Presa Lorite, Coronado MartÃƒÂ­n, SÃƒÂ¡nchez-Prieto, SÃƒÂ¡nchez-Borrego, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-Mesa","https://doi.org/10.1080/0167482X.2021.1896491","20210318","COVID-19; perinatal anxiety; perinatal depression; quarantine; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-19","",12130,""

"Rapid Telepsychiatry Implementation During COVID-19: Increased Attendance at the Largest Health System in the United States","This study aimed to examine differences in completion rates between telepsychiatry and in-person visits during the COVID-19 pandemic and a prior reference period. The authors used electronic medical record data along with chi-squared or t tests to compare patients' demographic characteristics. Generalized estimating equations for estimating the odds of primary and secondary outcomes were used, controlling for demographic characteristics. During COVID-19, the odds of completing a telepsychiatry visit (N=26,715) were 6.68 times the odds of completing an in-person visit (N=11,094). The odds of completing a telepsychiatry visit during COVID-19 were 3.00 times the odds of completing an in-person visit during the pre-COVID-19 reference period (N=40,318). In this cross-sectional study, outpatient adult mental health clinic telepsychiatry appointments, largely by telephone, were strongly associated with a higher rate of visit completion compared with in-person visits during and prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Regulators should consider permanently enabling reimbursement for telephone-only telepsychiatry visits.","Avalone, Barron, King, Linn-Walton, Lau, McQuistion, Popiel, Balasubramaniam, Freeman, Fattal","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202000574","20210318","COVID-19; Mental Health; Outpatient clinics; Telecommunications; Telepsychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-19","",12132,""
"Social Media and Emotional Burnout Regulation During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Multilevel Approach","In February 2020, the Chinese government imposed a complete lockdown of Wuhan and other cities in Hubei Province to contain a spike of COVID-19 cases. Although such measures are effective in preventing the spread of the virus, medical professionals strongly voiced a caveat concerning the pandemic emotional burnout at the individual level. Although the lockdown limited individuals' interpersonal communication with people in their social networks, it is common that individuals turn to social media to seek and share health information, exchange social support, and express pandemic-generated feelings. Based on a holistic and multilevel perspective, this study examines how pandemic-related emotional exhaustion enacts intrapersonal, interpersonal, and hyperpersonal emotional regulation strategies, and then evaluates the effectiveness of these strategies, with a particular interest in understanding the role of hyperpersonal-level regulation or social media-based regulation. Using an online panel, this study sampled 538 Chinese internet users from Hubei Province, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Survey data collection lasted for 12 days from February 7-18, 2020, two weeks after Hubei Province was placed under quarantine. The sample had an average age of 35 (SD 10.65, range 18-78) years, and a majority were married (n=369, 68.6%). Using structural equation modeling, this study found that intrapersonal-level (B=0.22; ÃŽÂ²=.24; P&lt;.001) and interpersonal-level (B=0.35; ÃŽÂ²=.49; P&lt;.001) emotional regulation strategies were positively associated with individuals' outcome reappraisal. In contrast with intrapersonal and interpersonal regulations, hyperpersonal (social media-based) regulation strategies, such as disclosing and retweeting negative emotions, were negatively related to the outcome reappraisal (B=-1.00; ÃŽÂ²=-.80; P&lt;.001). Consistent with previous literature, intrapersonal-level regulation (eg, cognitive reappraisal, mindfulness, and self-kindness) and interpersonal-level supportive interaction may generate a buffering effect on emotional exhaustion and promote individuals' reappraisal toward the stressful situation. However, hyperpersonal-level regulation may exacerbate the experienced negative emotions and impede reappraisal of the pandemic situation. It is speculated that retweeting content that contains pandemic-related stress and anxiety may cause a digital emotion contagion. Individuals who share other people's negative emotional expressions on social media are likely to be affected by the negative affect contagion. More importantly, the possible benefits of intrapersonal and interpersonal emotion regulations may be counteracted by social media or hyperpersonal regulation. This suggests the necessity to conduct social media-based health communication interventions to mitigate the social media-wide negative affect contagion if lockdown policies related to highly infectious diseases are initiated.","Shao, Shi, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.2196/27015","20210318","COVID-19; buffer; effective; emotion; emotion regulation; emotional exhaustion; mental health; modeling; multilevel approach; pandemic; perspective; social media; strategy; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-19","",12133,""

"The Relationship between Interoceptive Sensitivity, Age, and COVID-19 Anxiety During the First National Lockdown in the United Kingdom","Interoception refers to the multidimensional representation of the internal states of the body, including their sensation, appraisal, integration, and regulation. COVID-19 targets internal respiratory, temperature and gastrointestinal systems, thus posing a primary threat to humans that causes anxiety. Here, we examined the relationship between the sensitivity to internal bodily states and COVID-19 anxiety during the first national lockdown in the UK, when uncertainties surrounding the virus were at their peak. Between April and July 2020, N=232 individuals across 6 age-categories completed questionnaires measuring interoceptive sensibility (BPQ-SF and MAIA-2) and COVID-19 anxiety (adapted STAI). Several significant relationships suggested that the heightened sensation and the noticing of bodily signals were associated with higher COVID-19 anxiety, while healthy appraisal, attention regulation, mind-body integration and trusting of bodily signals were related to lower levels of COVID-19 anxiety. Age was associated with changes across multiple interoceptive dimensions and was related to lower levels of COVID-19 anxiety. Regression results further revealed that, after controlling for trait anxiety, higher age significantly predicted lower levels of COVID-19 anxiety, and a lower score on the Not Worrying subscale significantly predicted higher levels of COVID-19 anxiety. Our results extend previous findings of an age-related decline in COVID-19 anxiety to suggest underlying biopsychological changes in interoception. Interoceptive sensitivity may significantly influence anxiety management and regulate adaptive behaviour in the presence of health threats. Age-related interoceptive changes therefore raise important questions about best-practice guidance for individuals across the lifespan in protecting their own and otherâ€™s physical and mental health during a pandemic.","Jennifer Elliott et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4616E-D7B-59C","20210319","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; anxiety; pandemic; interoception; mental health; covid-19; aving","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-19","",12135,""
