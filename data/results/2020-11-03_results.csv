"Surveillance study of acute neurological manifestations among 439 Egyptian patients with COVID-19 in Assiut and Aswan university hospitals","Background: COVID 19 can be accompanied by acute neurological complications of both central and peripheral nervous systems (CNS and PNS). In this study we estimate the frequency of such complications among hospital in-patients with COVID-19 in Assiut and Aswan University Hospitals. Material and Methods: We screened all patients with suspected COVID-19 admitted from 1 June to 10 August 2020 to the university hospitals of Assiut and Aswan in Upper Egypt. Clinical and laboratory data, CT/MRI of chest and brain, and neurophysiology were performed for each patient if indicated. Results: 439 patients had confirmed/probable COVID-19; neurological manifestations occurred in 222. Of these 117 had acute neurological disease; the remainder had non-specific neuropsychiatric symptoms such as headache, vertigo, and depression. The CNS was affected in 75 patients: 55 had stroke; the others had convulsions (5), encephalitis (6), hypoxic encephalopathy (4), cord myelopathy (2), relapse of RR-MS (2), and meningoencephalitis (1). The PNS was affected in 42 patients: the majority had anosmia and ageusia (31); the others had GBS (4), peripheral neuropathy (3), myasthenia gravis (2), or myositis (2). Fever, respiratory symptoms and headache, were the most common general symptoms. Hypertensions, Diabetes Mellitus, ischemic heart disease were the most common comorbidities in patients with CNS affection. Conclusion: In COVID-19, both the CNS and PNS are affected. Stroke was the most common complication for CNS and anosmia and/or ageusia were common for PNS diseases. However there were 6 cases encephalitis, 2 cases of spinal cord myelopathy, 2 cases of MG and 2 cases of myositis.","Eman Mohamed khedr; Noha Abo-Elfetoh; Enas Deaf; Hebatallah M Hassan; Mariam T Amin; Radwa K Soliman; Alaa A Attia; Amro A Zarzour; Mohamed Zain; Aliae Mohamed-Hussein; Maiada K Hashem; Sahar M Hassany; Ahmed Aly; Ahmed Shoap; Mostafa Saber","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.28.20221879","20201103","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-03","",6662,""
"The prevalence of common mental disorders among health care professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic at a tertiary Hospital in East Africa","Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in unprecedented morbidity, mortality, and health system crisis leading to a significant psychological distress on healthcare workers (HCWs). The study aimed to determine the prevalence of symptoms of common mental disorders among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic at St. Paul Hospital, Ethiopia. Methods: A self-administered cross-sectional study was conducted to collect socio-demographic information and symptoms of mental disorders using validated measurement tools. Accordingly, PHQ-9, GAD-7, ISI, and IES-R were used to assess the presence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress, respectively. Chi-square test, non-parametric, and logistic regression analysis were used to detect risk factors for common mental disorders. Results: A total of 420 healthcare workers participated in the survey. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and psychological distress was 20.2%, 21.9%, 12.4%, and 15.5% respectively. Frontline HCWs had higher scores of mental health symptoms than other health care workers. Logistic regression analysis showed that being married was associated with a high level of depression. Working in a frontline position was an independent factor associated with a high-level depression, anxiety, and psychological distress. Limitations: It is a single-centre cross-sectional study and the findings may not be generalizable or reveal causality.","Hailu Abera Mulatu; Muluken Tesfaye; Esubalew Woldeyes; Tola Bayisa; Henok Fisseha; Rodas Asrat","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.29.20222430","20201103","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-03","",6663,""

 Objective: To identify the psychosocial consequences of the pandemic and to de5ne proposals for coping with the negative e6ects of the pandemic and con5nement on mental health. Materials and Methods: For the 5rst objective we searched for empirical articles in English or Spanish, published between January and May 2020, and indexed in the Web of Science data base. For the second objective, the search was expanded, from the year 2004 onwards, to reviews, national surveys, short communications and reports from international organizations such as the WHO, the United States Center for Disease Control (CDC), and the European Centre for Disease Control  (ECDC).  Results:  11  scienti5c  articles  and  6  documents  were  analyzed.  7e  emotional  experience related to the pandemic has a wide range of individual variability, with a high prevalence of psychological distress and anxiety reported. 7e severity of symptoms was related to the period of isolation, fear of contracting the disease, 5nancial instability and media exposure. In order to manage adverse consequences, it is recommended to satisfy basic needs, maintain social ties and receive truthful and non-alarmist information from the authorities and the media. Conclusion: 7e consequences of the pandemic include discomfort and responses of fear and anxiety.  For  people  who  su6er  abandonment  and  social  exclusion,  con5nement  makes  this  condition  even more  precarious.  Considering  that  the  pandemic  occurs  in  a  context  of  high  heterogeneity,  the  psychosocial dimension should also be a priority. (AU)

For patients presenting with HCQ overdose and an unknown initial serum potassium level, high-dose diazepam and hypertonic sodium chloride should be started immediately for the patient with widened QRS  The choice of hypertonic sodium chloride instead of sodium bicarbonate is to avoid exacerbating underlying hypokalemia which may in turn potentiate unstable dysrhythmia  In addition, early intubation should be a priority in vomiting patients as both HCQ toxicity and high-dose diazepam cause profound sedation","Mahan, Keenan M.; Hayes, Bryan D.; North, Crystal M.; Becker, Justin S.; Fenves, Andrew Z.; Hyppolite, Guibenson, Khosrowjerdi, Sara, Sinden, Daniel, Stearns, Dana A.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jemermed.2020.10.048","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: The Journal of Emergency Medicine;2020.; Publication details: The Journal of Emergency Medicine;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-03","",6692,""

"[COVID-19 Pandemic and Mental Health of the General Public: Is there a Tsunami of Mental Disorders?]","The paper reviews and discusses short- and long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for population mental health. The dynamics of short-term psychological reactions - such as anxiety, depression and distress - seem to follow directly the epidemiological dynamics of the outbreak. Although older individuals are at risk for severe COVID-19 disease course and death, psychological reactions seem to be more intense in younger individuals compared to the elderly. For long-term consequences, we do not have data yet. However, since the association between economic crises and population mental health is established, a recession-related increase in mental disorders is assumed. Mental health should be key concern in the management of the pandemic. Der Beitrag diskutiert kurz- und lÃƒÂ¤ngerfristige psychische Folgen der COVID-19-Pandemie in der AllgemeinbevÃƒÂ¶lkerung.

"Emotional Resilience and Bariatric Surgical Teams: a Priority in the Pandemic","The infection control measures implemented as a result of COVID-19 led to a postponement of bariatric surgical procedures across many countries worldwide. Many bariatric surgical teams were in essence left without a profession, with many redeployed to other areas of clinical care and were not able to provide the levels of patient support given before COVID-19. As the pandemic continues, some restrictions have been lifted, with staff adjusting to new ways of working, incorporating challenging working conditions and dealing with continuing levels of stress. This article explores the concept of emotional labour, defined as 'inducing or suppressing feelings in order to perform one's work', and its application to multidisciplinary teams working within bariatric surgery, to offer insight into the mental health issues that may be affecting healthcare professionals working in this discipline.","Graham, Mahawar, Riera, Islam, Bhasker, Wilson, Tahrani, Moize, Leal, Hayes","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-020-05083-1","20201102","Bariatric surgery; Compassion fatigue; Emotional labour; Mental health; Resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-03","",6707,""
"Lessons in Resilience: Initial Coping among Older Adults during the COVID-19 Pandemic","In addition to increased physical health risks, older adults may also experience risks to their mental health and social wellbeing due to COVID-19. Yet, older adults may be uniquely able to cope given their life experiences and coping mechanisms. This study explores older adults' coping experiences and strategies during the initial weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. A Midwestern sample of 76 older adults aged 70-97 completed a phone interview about their experiences with social distancing due to COVID-19. Interviews were conducted during early weeks of regional social distancing (March 28-April 20, 2020). Participants rated their level of perceived coping and responded to open-ended questions about their daily life and coping. Mean perceived coping level (on a scale from 1-10) was 7.9, with 87% of participants rating their coping positively. Primary themes that emerged included: 1) staying busy, 2) seeking social support, and 3) having a positive mindset. These emotion-focused coping strategies appeared adaptive in the early weeks of the pandemic for most older adults. Contrary to predominant messaging about the vulnerability of older adults, these findings highlight the resilient nature of older adults in terms of their psychological coping and adaptability during COVID-19. Future research should build upon these findings to better understand and promote late-life coping during crises. Practitioners should seek to support older adults' engagement in such proactive coping, and social policies should be developed to acknowledge the variable needs of older adults.","Fuller, Huseth-Zosel","https://doi.org/10.1093/geront/gnaa170","20201102","Coronavirus; Mixed methods; Optimism; Social Distancing; Social Support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-03","",6708,""

"Why Severe COVID-19 Patients Are at Greater Risk of Developing Depression: A Molecular Perspective","The prevailing evidence suggests that patients with severe COVID-19 seem to have an overreaction of the immune system demonstrating exacerbated levels of inflammation caused by a &quot;cytokine storm.&quot; At this early stage, the mechanisms underpinning COVID-19 are still subject to intense scrutiny and the long-term mental health consequences as a result of the disease are unknown. Here we discuss the hypothesis that patients who survive severe COVID-19 and who experience significant activation of the immune system, are at greater risk of developing depression. We posit that a phenomenon known as cytokine storm dramatically activates the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1), resulting in the increase in kynurenine metabolites. Kynurenine is metabolized by IDO-1 in the brain, producing chemokines, in which a prolonged exposure may result long-term brain impairment. In this article, we also propose the possibility that a SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion increases the local levels of angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 down-regulation. Thereby, angiotensin II could increase kynurenine metabolites producing pro-oxidative and pro-inflammatory effects, resulting in impairment of cognitive function, enhanced oxidative stress and decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor. It is our premise that patients who experience such a cytokine storm may be at increased risk of long-term mental illness, such as depression.","BouÃƒÂ§as, Rheinheimer, Lagopoulos","https://doi.org/10.1177/1073858420967892","20201102","brain impairment; cytokine storm; depression; long-term mental illness; severe COVID-19","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-03","",6711,""
"Spirituality, religiosity and the mental health consequences of social isolation during Covid-19 pandemic","Evidence shows that religiosity and spirituality (R/S) are highly used in critical moments of life and that these beliefs are associated with clinical outcomes. However, further studies are needed to assess these beliefs during the COVID-19 pandemic. To evaluate the use of R/S during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil and to investigate the association between R/S and the mental health consequences of social isolation. Cross-sectional study conducted in May 2020. Online surveys were carried out assessing sociodemographics, R/S measures, and social isolation characteristics and mental health consequences (hopefulness, fear, worrying and sadness). Adjusted regression models were used. A total of 485 participants were included from all regions of Brazil. There was a high use of religious and spiritual beliefs during the pandemic and this use was associated with better mental health outcomes. Lower levels of worrying were associated with greater private religious activities (OR = 0.466, CI 95%: 0.307-0.706), religious attendance (OR = 0.587, CI 95%: 0.395-0.871), spiritual growth (OR = 0.667, CI 95%: 0.448-0.993) and with an increase in religious activities (OR = 0.660, CI 95%: 0.442-0.986); lower levels of fear were associated with greater private religious activities (OR = 0.632, CI 95%: 0.422-0.949) and spiritual growth (OR = 0.588, CI 95%: 0.392-0.882) and, lower levels of sadness (OR = 0.646, CI 95%: 0.418-0.997) were associated with spiritual growth. Finally, hope was associated with all R/S variables in different degrees (ranging from OR = 1.706 to 3.615). R/S seem to have an important role on the relief of suffering, having an influence on health outcomes and minimizing the consequences of social isolation. These results highlight the importance of public health measures that ensure the continuity of R/S activities during the pandemic and the training of healthcare professionals to address these issues.","Lucchetti, GÃƒÂ³es, Amaral, Ganadjian, Andrade, Almeida, do Carmo, Manso","https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020970996","20201102","COVID-19; mental health; pandemic; religion and medicine; spirituality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-03","",6712,""

"Factors associated with mental health outcomes among patients with COVID-19 treated in the Fangcang shelter hospital in China","Faced with surging infections and considering that 80% of cases were mild and moderate, the city government transformed stadiums and exhibition centers into the Fangcang shelter hospitals in Wuhan. The aims of this study were to evaluate mental health outcomes among patients with COVID-19 treated in the Fangcang shelter hospitals and analyze potential risk factors associated with these symptoms, including PTSS, symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and perceived stress. This cross-sectional study used an online survey to assess mental health problems of 461 confirmed COVID-19 patients in a Jianghan Fangcang shelter from February 15 to 22, 2020. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to explore potential risk factors. Overall, 25.2%, 50.1%, 54.4%, 10.2%, and 39.7% of all patients reported symptoms of posttraumatic stress, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and perceived stress, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that female sex was associated with all investigated outcomes except insomnia. Patients with lower education level were more likely to endorse anxiety, depression, and higher perceived stress, while patients' family members with other diseases were more likely to endorse severe insomnia. Patients with illness onset to admission less than 7Ã¢â‚¬â€°days were associated with higher perceived stress. In this survey study, patients reported high rates of symptoms of posttraumatic stress, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and perceived stress.

"The early influence of COVID-19 pandemic-associated restrictions on pain, mood, and everyday life of patients with painful polyneuropathy","The SARS-Cov-2 pandemic requires special attention on its psychological effects and the impact on patients with chronic pain. This study aimed at examining the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic-associated regulations initiated by the German government on pain intensity and characteristics, emotional well-being, and everyday life of patients with painful polyneuropathy. Forty-three patients (well assessed with questionnaires before the pandemic and without change of their health status between baseline and current assessment) were investigated with validated, self-reported questionnaires and COVID-19-specific items 2 weeks after the regulations came into effect. Pain intensity remained stable or even improved like the neuropathic pain symptom inventory total score (t0: 33.54 Ã‚Â± 20.48 vs t1: 27.38 Ã‚Â± 16.16, <i>P</i> = 0.008). Only 11.6% reported a pandemic-associated pain worsening.

Interestingly, pain ratings for the last 7 days were higher in patients with a changed social life compared to those without (-1.63 Ã‚Â± 1.60 vs 0.31 Ã‚Â± 1.83; <i>P</i> = 0.01). Quality of life was decreased and helplessness increased in those with higher pain ratings.

"Unintended consequences of COVID-19 safety measures on patients with chronic knee pain forced to defer joint replacement surgery","In recent months, with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the American College of Surgeons and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officially recommended the delay of nonemergency procedures until the public health crisis is resolved. Deferring elective joint replacement surgeries for an unknown period is likely to decrease the incidence of infection with SARS-CoV-2 but is likely to have detrimental effects in individuals suffering from chronic knee pain. These detrimental effects extend beyond the discomfort of osteoarthritis (OA) and the inconvenience of rescheduling surgery. Disabling pain is a driving factor for individuals to seek medical intervention, including pharmacological palliative treatment and surgical procedures. The need for surgical intervention due to chronic pain as for knee and hip replacement is now put on hold indefinitely because access to surgical care has been limited. Although a moderate delay in surgical intervention may not produce a significant progression of OA within the knee, it could lead to muscle wasting due to immobility and exacerbate comorbidities, making rehabilitation more challenging. Importantly, it will have an impact on comorbidities driven by OA severity, notably decreased quality of life and depression. These patients with unremitting pain become increasingly susceptible to substance use disorders including opioids, alcohol, as well as prescription and illegal drugs. Appreciation of this downstream crisis created by delayed surgical correction requires aggressive consideration of nonsurgical, nonopiate supported interventions to reduce the morbidity associated with these delays brought upon by the currently restricted access to joint repair.","Cisternas, Ramachandran, Yaksh, Nahama","https://doi.org/10.1097/PR9.0000000000000855","20201102","COVID-19; Chronic pain; Depression; Elective surgery; Joint pain; Joint replacement; Opioid; Osteoarthritis; Quality of life; Total knee arthroplasty","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-03","",6716,""

"Preliminary evidence of the impact of social distancing on psychological status and functional outcomes of patients who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy","Social distancing is considered the best strategy to prevent the spread of COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease 19). We aimed to analyse the effect of 'social distancing' on the emotional state, post-operative pain and functional outcomes of patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). We retrospectively reviewed data of male patients who underwent RARP within the study period (from March to April 2019 [Group A = 27 patients] and from March to April 2020 [Group B = 29 patients]). Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) results were collected on the first day of hospitalization. Post-operative pain was assessed using the numerical rating scale (NRS) and visual analogic scale (VAS) after surgery in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and at 24 hours. Functional outcomes were evaluated at the one-month follow-up. Demographic, pathological and peri-operative data were collected for all patients. There were no significant differences in demographics and pathological characteristics amongst the groups. We observed that patients in Group A had a statistically lower value on the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 questionnaires than patients of Group B. Moreover, Group A showed statistically significant better post-operative pain control in PACU and at 24 hours. At one-month follow-up, patients in Group B required more diapers for incontinence than Group A, showing poor early continence.

"[Consequences of the COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 pandemic for gastroenterology in Germany]","The recommendations of the German Society of Gastroenterology, Digestive and Metabolic Diseases (DGVS) on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in gastroenterological patients are accessible on the homepage of the Society under information at https://www.dgvs.de/covid-19/. Recommendations for protection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been published by the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) and the European Society of Gastroenterology and Endoscopy Nurses and Associates (ESGENA). Separate endoscopy rooms for high-risk patients and negative pressure rooms should be included in the planning of future endoscopy unit projects. It is unclear whether aÃ‚Â continuing prioritization of gastroenterological services after the first wave of COVID-19 is necessary in the future. The report of the Scientific Institute of the AOK health insurance company (WldO) and surveys of the Working Group of Clinical Gastroenterologists (ALGK) and the Professional Association of Private Gastroenterologists in Germany (bng) demonstrated that the coronavirus lockdown led to aÃ‚Â significant reduction of gastrointestinal diseases and gastroenterological services including screening colonoscopy. It is likely that the reduction of the overcapacity of the German healthcare system will also be continued by reduction of inpatient services after the corona pandemic has been overcome. It is essential to keep the medical profession attractive for young colleagues. The high rates of burnout and suicide and the difficult compatibility with the requirements of a life balance are alarm signals that have to be solved.","Frieling","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11377-020-00480-5","20201102","Colonoscopy; Coronavirus; Endoscopy; Pandemic; Prioritization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-03","",6719,""
"[Social isolation among teleworkers in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic]","During the peak times of the COVID-19 pandemic, which were characterized by contact restrictions, many companies initiated telework for their employees due to infection prevention. In this literature review working from home and therefore digital cooperation in aÃ‚Â virtual team was investigated, focusing on the organization of occupational health promotion aspects in the context of prevention of social isolation. The current occupational health psychology research identified appropriate and enriched information and communication media accompanied by sufficient and understandable technical support as basic prerequisites for the collaboration of location-independent teams. Also, aÃ‚Â continuous socially supporting communication within the team and with the supervisor as well as health-promoting leadership have aÃ‚Â positive impact on the employees' mental health. Additionally, individual (digital) health promotion interventions and flexible working hours are recommended. These multifactorial approaches to measures derived from the literature are suggested for companies with employees working predominantly from home to reduce work-related adverse health effects from the crisis, especially with respect to social isolation and to promote their employees' health.","Lengen, Kordsmeyer, Rohwer, Harth, Mache","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40664-020-00410-w","20201102","Corona pandemic; Health promotion; Telecommuting; Telework; Virtual teams","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-03","",6720,""
"Anxiety, Depression, and Resilience of Healthcare Workers in Japan During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Outbreak","Objective Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading around the world. The aim of this study was to assess the degree of anxiety, depression, resilience, and other psychiatric symptoms among healthcare workers in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This survey involved medical healthcare workers at the Japanese Red Cross Medical Center (Tokyo, Japan) between April 22 and May 15, 2020. The degree of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and resilience was assessed using the Japanese versions of the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. Furthermore, we added original questionnaires comprising three factors: (i) anxiety and fear of infection and death; (ii) isolation and unreasonable treatment; and (iii) motivation and escape behavior at work. Results In total, 848 healthcare workers participated in this survey: 104 doctors, 461 nurses, 184 other co-medical staff, and 99 office workers. Among all participants, 85 (10.0%) developed moderate-to-severe anxiety disorder, and 237 (27.9%) developed depression. Problems with anxiety and fear of infection and death, isolation and unreasonable treatment, and motivation and escape from work were higher in the depression group than in the non-depression group (total CES-D score Ã¢â€°Â¥ 16 points). Being a nurse and high total GAD-7 scores were risk factors of depression. Older workers and those with higher resilience were less likely to develop depression than others. Conclusion During the COVID-19 epidemic, many healthcare workers suffered from psychiatric symptoms. Psychological support and interventions for protecting the mental health of them are needed.","Awano, Oyama, Akiyama, Inomata, Kuse, Tone, Takada, Muto, Fujimoto, Akagi, Mawatari, Ueda, Kawakami, Komatsu, Izumo","https://doi.org/10.2169/internalmedicine.5694-20","20201102","anxiety; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; healthcare worker; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-03","",6721,""
"More Than Inconvenienced: The Unique Needs of US College Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic","U.S. college students are a distinct population facing major challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Before the pandemic, students were already experiencing substantial mental health concerns, putting both their health and academic success in jeopardy. College students now face increasing housing and food insecurity, financial hardships, a lack of social connectedness and sense of belonging, uncertainty about the future, and access issues that impede their academic performance and well-being. There is also reason to believe that COVID-19 is exacerbating inequalities for students of color and low-income students. We provide several recommendations for institutions of higher education to mitigate these obstacles, including engaging in data-driven decision making, delivering clear and informative messaging to students, prioritizing and expanding student support services, and using an equity framework to guide all processes.","Lederer, Hoban, Lipson, Zhou, Eisenberg","https://doi.org/10.1177/1090198120969372","20201102","COVID-19; college; health; mental health; students; university","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-03","",6722,""

"The impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the mental health of healthcare workers in a hospital setting-A Systematic Review","The SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic has subjected healthcare workers (HCWs) to high risk of infection through direct workplace exposure, coupled with increased workload and psychological stress. This review aims to determine the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on mental health outcomes of hospital-based HCWs and formulate recommendations for future action. A systematic review was performed between 31st December 2019 and 17th June 2020 through Ovid Medline and Embase databases (PROSPERO ID CRD42020181204). Studies were included for review if they investigated the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on mental health outcomes of hospital-based HCWs and used validated psychiatric scoring tools. Prevalence of ICD-10 classified psychiatric disorders was the primary outcome measure. The initial search returned 436 articles. Forty-four studies were included in final analysis, with a total of 69,499 subjects. Prevalence ranges of six mental health outcomes were identified: depression 13.5%-44.7%; anxiety 12.3%-35.6%; acute stress reaction 5.2%-32.9%; post-traumatic stress disorder 7.4%-37.4%; insomnia 33.8%-36.1%; and occupational burnout 3.1%-43.0%. Direct exposure to SARS-CoV-2 patients was the most common risk factor identified for all mental health outcomes except occupational burnout. Nurses, frontline HCWs, and HCWs with low social support and fewer years of working experience reported the worst outcomes. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has significantly impacted the mental health of HCWs. Frontline staff demonstrate worse mental health outcomes. Hospitals should be staffed to meet service provision requirements and to mitigate the impact onmental health. This can be improved with access to rapid-response psychiatric teams and should be continually monitored throughout the pandemic and beyond its conclusion.","Sanghera, Pattani, Hashmi, Varley, Cheruvu, Bradley, Burke","https://doi.org/10.1002/1348-9585.12175","20201101","SARS-CoV-2; anxiety; burnout; depression; insomnia; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-03","",6724,""
"Severe psychiatric disturbance and attempted suicide in a patient with COVID-19 and no psychiatric history","A previously fit and well 37-year-old male healthcare worker presented with confusion, psychotic symptoms and a suicide attempt in the context of a new COVID-19 diagnosis. Following surgical interventions and an extended admission to the intensive care unit, he made a good recovery in terms of both his physical and mental health. A number of factors likely contributed to his presentation, including SARS-CoV-2 infection, severe insomnia, worry, healthcare worker-related stress, and the unique social and psychological stressors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. This case highlights the need to further characterise the specific psychiatric sequelae of COVID-19 in community settings, and should remind general medical clinicians to be mindful of comorbid psychiatric symptoms when assessing patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19.","Gillett, Jordan","https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2020-239191","20201101","delirium; infectious diseases; psychotic disorders (incl schizophrenia); public health; suicide (psychiatry)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-03","",6725,""
