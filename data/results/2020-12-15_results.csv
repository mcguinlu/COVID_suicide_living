"Self-harm presentations to Emergency Departments and Place of Safety during the first wave of the UK COVID-19 pandemic: South London and Maudsley data on service use from February to June 2020","The lockdown and social distancing policy imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on both mental health service delivery, and the ways in which people are accessing these services. Previous reports from the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust (SLaM; a large mental health service provider for around 1.2m residents in South London) have highlighted increased use of virtual contacts by mental health teams, with dropping numbers of face-to-face contacts over the first wave of the pandemic. There has been concern that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic would lead to higher mental health emergencies, particularly instances of self-harm. However, with people advised to stay at home during the first wave lockdown, it is as yet unclear whether this impacted mental health service presentations. Taking advantage of SLaMs Clinical Records Interactive Search (CRIS) data resource with daily updates of information from its electronic mental health records, this paper describes overall presentations to Emergency Department (ED) mental health liaison teams, and those with self-harm. The paper focussed on three periods: i) a pre-lockdown period 1st February to 15th March, ii) a lockdown period 16th March to 10th May and iii) a post-lockdown period 11th May to 28th June. In summary, all attendances to EDs for mental health support decreased during the lockdown period, including those with self-harm. All types of self-harm decreased during lockdown, with self-poisoning remaining the most common. Attendances to EDs for mental health support increased post-lockdown, although were only just approaching pre-lockdown levels by the end of June 2020.","Eleanor Nuzum; Evangelia Martin; Gemma Morgan; Rina Dutta; Christoph Mueller; Catherine Polling; Megan Pritchard; Sumithra Velupillai; Robert Stewart","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.10.20247155","20201214","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-15","",8131,""
"SARS-CoV-2 among migrants and forcibly displaced populations: a rapid systematic review","The economic and health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic pose a particular threat to vulnerable groups, such as migrants, particularly forcibly displaced populations. The aim of this review is (i) to synthesise the evidence on risk of infection and transmission among migrants, refugees, asylum seekers and internally displaced populations, and (ii) the effect of lockdown measures on these populations. We searched MEDLINE and WOS, preprint servers, and pertinent websites between 1st December 2019 and 26th June 2020. The included studies showed a high heterogeneity in study design, population, outcome and quality. The incidence risk of SARS-CoV-2 varied from 0.12% to 2.08% in non-outbreak settings and from 5.64% to 21.15% in outbreak settings. Migrants showed a lower hospitalisation rate compared to non-migrants. Negative impacts on mental health due to lockdown measures were found across respective studies. However, findings show a tenuous and heterogeneous data situation, showing the need for more robust and comparative study designs.","Maren Hintermeier; Hande Gencer; Katja Kajikhina; Sven Rohleder; Claudia Santos-Hoevener; Marie Tallarek; Jacob Spallek; Kayvan Bozorgmehr","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.20248152","20201214","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-15","",8132,""
"Association of Mortality and Aspirin Prescription for COVID-19 Patients at the Veterans Health Administration","There is growing evidence that thrombotic and inflammatory pathways contribute to the severity of COVID-19. Common medications such as aspirin, that mitigate these pathways, may decrease COVID-19 mortality. This assessment was designed to quantify the correlation between aspirin and mortality for COVID-19 positive patients in our care. Data from the Veterans Health Administration national electronic health record database was utilized for the evaluation. Veterans from across the country with a first positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction lab result were included in the evaluation which comprised 28,350 patients from March 2, 2020 to September 13, 2020 for the 14-day mortality cohort and 26,346 patients from March 2, 2020 to August 28, 2020 for the 30-day mortality cohort. Patients were matched via propensity scores and the odds of mortality were then compared. Among COVID-19 positive Veterans, preexisting aspirin prescription was associated with a statistically and clinically significant decrease in overall mortality at 14-days (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.32-0.46) and at 30-days (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.33-0.45), cutting the odds of mortality by more than half. Findings demonstrated that pre-diagnosis aspirin prescription was strongly associated with decreased mortality rates for Veterans diagnosed with COVID-19. Prospective evaluation is required to more completely assess this correlation and its implications for patient care.","Thomas F Osborne; Zachary P Veigulis; David M Arreola; Satish M Mahajan; Eliane M Roosli; Catherine M Curtin","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.13.20248147","20201214","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-15","",8133,""
"Simulation-Based Study on the COVID-19 Airborne Transmission in a Restaurant","COVID-19 has shown a high potential of transmission via virus-carrying aerosols as supported by growing evidence. However, detailed investigations that draw direct links between aerosol transport and virus infection are still lacking. To fill in the gap, we conducted a systematic computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based investigation of indoor air flow and the associated aerosol transport in a restaurant setting, where likely cases of airborne infection of COVID-19 caused by asymptomatic individuals were widely reported by the media. We employed an advanced in-house large eddy simulation (LES) solver and other cutting-edge numerical methods to resolve complex indoor processes simultaneously, including turbulence, flow--aerosol interplay, thermal effect, and the filtration effect by air conditioners. Using the aerosol exposure index derived from the simulation, we are able to provide a spatial map of the airborne infection risk under different settings. Our results have shown a remarkable direct linkage between regions of high aerosol exposure index and the reported infection patterns in the restaurant, providing strong support to the airborne transmission occurring in this widely-reported incidence. Using flow structure analysis and reverse-time tracing of aerosol trajectories, we are able to further pinpoint the influence of environmental parameters on the infection risks and highlight the needs for more effective preventive measures, e.g., placement of shielding according to the local flow patterns. Our research, thus, has demonstrated the capability and value of high-fidelity CFD tools for airborne infection risk assessment and the development of effective preventive measures.","Han Liu; Sida He; Lian Shen; Jiarong Hong","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.10.20247403","20201214","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-15","",8134,""

"Enhancing Employee Stress Resilience (Wellness): A Study of Women Leaders in Asia Pacific","We live in an era of globalisation where technology, automation and digital networks drive disruptions in various spheres of life, work, family, health and society  They have increased productivity, ease of working and material comfort for humans worldwide, along with accelerating the pace of work and life  With the continued growth of technology, we are on the verge of Industry 4 0  The implications are changing at a fast pace and are associated with negative impact on health and wellness, as employees struggle to cope  In the last two decades, there has appeared a growing awareness of the need for total wellness, with implications for employee engagement and productivity  In the recent months, COVID-19 has caused further pressure on mental health, with employees struggling with anxiety, stress and depression, when organisations need them to be fully engaged, focused and making critical decisions In this article, the authors highlight the need to equip employees with tools to build total resilience: physical, mental and spiritual  They propose a toolbox called ?R-box? (resilience box) to enhance employees? ability to perform under stress  The toolkit is developed from the perspective that employees and leaders see themselves as corporate athletes (Loehr & Schwartz, 2001) and train themselves as athletes do, so as to sustain high levels of performance and, in the process, achieve high personal growth  Considering time as a major resource constraint for low adoption, R-box uses a range of mini-interventions, focused on the four areas of ?run? (body movement), ?refresh? (nutrition), ?restore? (sleep) and ?rebalance? (mind-related) Being Strong is a programme for leaders who have been running for a few years in Asia-Pacific (APAC)  ?R-box? is central to this programme  An exploratory study was conducted with women leaders in Southeast Asia, especially from Malaysia and Indonesia, who were a part of the Being Strong programme  In the study, the authors try to find out how the R-box toolkit, practised by the participants over 12 weeks, has impacted their ability to deal with stress and grow their resilience This article elaborates the findings of the survey conducted in 2020, 90 days after the programme  The survey showed over 80 per cent adoption by the participants  Further, over 85 per cent of those who adopted the toolkit saw an improvement in their ability to deal with stress with enhanced resilience  This appears to demonstrate the usefulness of R-box as a powerful toolkit for enhancing resilience Based on the above, the authors propose the study to be extended to a larger audience in Southeast Asia and beyond  They also recommend HR to play a lead role in bringing wellness, as a driver of employee engagement and productivity  This has implications for the immediate situation of COVID-19 pandemic-impacted work and life, and the future of work too","Vaidyanathan, Subba, Mahapatra, Gopal","https://doi.org/10.1177/2631454120973513","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: NHRD Network Journal;: 2631454120973513, 2020.; Publication details: NHRD Network Journal;: 2631454120973513, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-15","",8139,""

"The Benefits of Buying Distressed Assets","Studies of mergers and acquisitions have struggled to identify characteristics of M&A transactions that are consistently associated with positive returns for buyers  The authors report the findings of their study of buyers' gain in fire sales by examining the stock price reaction to corporate announcements of acquisitions of distressed companies or their assets  During the period from 1982 to 2012, buyer returns were approximately two percentage points higher in fire sales than in regular M&A transactions The explanation of this result is shown to be the reduction in the sellers' bargaining power  Consistent with that explanation, the authors found no difference in either the operating profitability of the buyers after acquisitions, or in the combined announcement returns of buyers and sellers between fire sales and regular acquisitions, suggesting that the quality of the match is similar in both types of transactions For corporate practitioners, one implication of these findings is that corporate acquirersâ€”and not just the private equity firms that focus on distressed companiesâ€”should consider the purchase of distressed assets as a value-adding way of deploying capital  From a public policy perspective, the spillover costs associated with fire sales for the distressed seller's suppliers and customers are roughly comparable to those in regular M&A deals  Moreover, fire sales do not depress the asset values of other companies in the seller's industry  In sum, the welfare losses associated with fire sales are smaller than previously thought, which in turn casts doubt on the $1 8 trillion of federal bailout funds appropriated in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as the best use of taxpayer money","Jean-Marie, Meier, Servaes, Henri","https://doi.org/10.1111/jacf.12436","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of Applied Corporate Finance;32(4):105-116, 2020.; Publication details: Journal of Applied Corporate Finance;32(4):105-116, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-15","",8163,""

"Psychosocial Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Large-scale Quasi-Experimental Study on Social Media","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused several disruptions in personal and collective lives worldwide. The uncertainties surrounding the pandemic have also led to multifaceted mental health concerns, which can be exacerbated with precautionary measures such as social distancing and self-quarantining, as well as societal impacts such as economic downturn and job loss. Despite noting this as a ""mental health tsunami"", the psychological effects of the COVID-19 crisis remain unexplored at scale. Consequently, public health stakeholders are currently limited in identifying ways to provide timely and tailored support during these circumstances. OBJECTIVE: Our study aims to provide insights regarding people's psychosocial concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic by leveraging social media data. We aim to study the temporal and linguistic changes in symptomatic mental health and support expressions in the pandemic context. METHODS: We obtained about 60 million Twitter streaming posts originating from the United States from March 24 to May 24, 2020, and compared these with about 40 million posts from a comparable period in 2019 to attribute the effect of COVID-19 on people's social media self-disclosure. Using these data sets, we studied people's self-disclosure on social media in terms of symptomatic mental health concerns and expressions of support. We employed transfer learning classifiers that identified the social media language indicative of mental health outcomes (anxiety, depression, stress, and suicidal ideation) and support (emotional and informational support). We then examined the changes in psychosocial expressions over time and language, comparing the 2020 and 2019 data sets. RESULTS: We found that all of the examined psychosocial expressions have significantly increased during the COVID-19 crisis-mental health symptomatic expressions have increased by about 14%, and support expressions have increased by about 5%, both thematically related to COVID-19. We also observed a steady decline and eventual plateauing in these expressions during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have been due to habituation or due to supportive policy measures enacted during this period. Our language analyses highlighted that people express concerns that are specific to and contextually related to the COVID-19 crisis. CONCLUSIONS: We studied the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 crisis by using social media data from 2020, finding that people's mental health symptomatic and support expressions significantly increased during the COVID-19 period as compared to similar data from 2019. However, this effect gradually lessened over time, suggesting that people adapted to the circumstances and their ""new normal."" Our linguistic analyses revealed that people expressed mental health concerns regarding personal and professional challenges, health care and precautionary measures, and pandemic-related awareness. This study shows the potential to provide insights to mental health care and stakeholders and policy makers in planning and implementing measures to mitigate mental health risks amid the health crisis.","Saha, Koustuv; Torous, John; Caine, Eric D; De Choudhury, Munmun","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/22600","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(11): e22600, 2020 Nov 24.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(11): e22600, 2020 Nov 24.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-15","",8204,""

"Impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on the quality of life for women with ovarian cancer","BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented challenges for the oncology community. For people living with cancer, treatments are interrupted, surgeries cancelled, and regular oncology evaluations rescheduled. People with cancer and their physicians must balance plausible fears of coronavirus disease 2019 and cancer treatment with the consequences of delaying cancer care. OBJECTIVE: We aim to evaluate the experience of women with ovarian cancer during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: Women with a current or previous diagnosis of ovarian cancer completed an online survey focusing on treatment interruptions and quality of life. The quality of life was measured with the Cancer Worry Scale and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The survey was distributed through survivor networks and social media. Univariate and multivariable linear regression analysis were used to evaluate the effect of participant characteristics on quality of life survey scores. RESULTS: A total of 603 women, from 41 states, visited the survey website between March 30, 2020, and April 13, 2020, and 555 (92.0%) completed the survey. The median age was 58 years (range, 20-85). At the time of survey completion, 217 participants (43.3%) were in active treatment. A total of 175 participants (33%) experienced a delay in some component of their cancer care. Ten (26.3%) of the 38 participants scheduled for surgery experienced a delay, as did 18 (8.3%) of the 217 participants scheduled for nonsurgical cancer treatment. A total of 133 participants (24.0%) had a delayed physician appointment, 84 (15.1%) laboratory tests, and 53 (9.6%) cancer-related imaging. Among the cohort, 88.6% (489) reported significant cancer worry, 51.4% (285) borderline or abnormal anxiety, and 26.5% (147) borderline or abnormal depression. On univariate analysis, age less than 65 years, being scheduled for cancer treatment or cancer surgery, delay in oncology care, being self-described as immunocompromised, and use of telemedicine were all associated with higher levels of cancer worry. Higher anxiety scores were associated with age less than 65 years and being self-described as immunocompromised. Higher depression scores were associated with age less than 65 years, being scheduled for cancer surgery, delay in oncology care, being self-described as immunocompromised, and use of telemedicine. On multivariable linear regression analysis, age less than 65 and being self-described as immunocompromised were independently predictive of greater cancer worry, anxiety, and depression, and delay in cancer care was predictive of anxiety and depression. CONCLUSION: The coronavirus disease 2019 crisis is affecting care of patients with ovarian cancer; surgeries, treatments, scheduled physician appointments, laboratory tests, and imaging are cancelled or delayed. Younger age, presumed immunocompromise, and delay in cancer care were associated with significantly higher levels of cancer worry, anxiety, and depression. Providers must work with patients to balance competing risks of coronavirus disease 2019 and cancer, recognizing that communication is a critical clinical tool to improve quality of life in these times.","Frey, Melissa K; Ellis, Annie E; Zeligs, Kristen; Chapman-Davis, Eloise; Thomas, Charlene; Christos, Paul J; Kolev, Valentin; Prasad-Hayes, Monica; Cohen, Samantha; Holcomb, Kevin; Blank, Stephanie V","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.06.049","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Am J Obstet Gynecol;223(5): 725.e1-725.e9, 2020 11.; Publication details: Am J Obstet Gynecol;223(5): 725.e1-725.e9, 2020 11.; Coronavirus Infections; Ovarian Neoplasms/psychology; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Quality of Life/psychology; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anxiety/psychology; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Surveys and Questionnaires; Telemedicine; Young Adult; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-15","",8206,""
"Public Emotions and Rumors Spread During the COVID-19 Epidemic in China: Web-Based Correlation Study","BACKGROUND: Various online rumors have led to inappropriate behaviors among the public in response to the COVID-19 epidemic in China. These rumors adversely affect people's physical and mental health. Therefore, a better understanding of the relationship between public emotions and rumors during the epidemic may help generate useful strategies for guiding public emotions and dispelling rumors. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore whether public emotions are related to the dissemination of online rumors in the context of COVID-19. METHODS: We used the web-crawling tool Scrapy to gather data published by People's Daily on Sina Weibo, a popular social media platform in China, after January 8, 2020. Netizens' comments under each Weibo post were collected. Nearly 1 million comments thus collected were divided into 5 categories: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and neutral, based on the underlying emotional information identified and extracted from the comments by using a manual identification process. Data on rumors spread online were collected through Tencent's Jiaozhen platform. Time-lagged cross-correlation analyses were performed to examine the relationship between public emotions and rumors. RESULTS: Our results indicated that the angrier the public felt, the more rumors there would likely be (r=0.48, P<.001). Similar results were observed for the relationship between fear and rumors (r=0.51, P<.001) and between sadness and rumors (r=0.47, P<.001). Furthermore, we found a positive correlation between happiness and rumors, with happiness lagging the emergence of rumors by 1 day (r=0.56, P<.001). In addition, our data showed a significant positive correlation between fear and fearful rumors (r=0.34, P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm that public emotions are related to the rumors spread online in the context of COVID-19 in China. Moreover, these findings provide several suggestions, such as the use of web-based monitoring methods, for relevant authorities and policy makers to guide public emotions and behavior during this public health emergency.","Dong, Wei; Tao, Jinhu; Xia, Xiaolin; Ye, Lin; Xu, Hanli; Jiang, Peiye; Liu, Yangyang","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/21933","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(11): e21933, 2020 Nov 25.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(11): e21933, 2020 Nov 25.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-15","",8207,""

"Changing Patterns of Medical Visits and Factors Associated with No-show in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis during COVID-19 Pandemic","The main barrier to the effective rheumatoid arthritis (RA) therapy is poor adherence. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have led to a significant change in the pattern and the number of medical visits. We assessed changing patterns of medical visits and no-show, and identified factors associated with no-show in patients with RA during COVID-19 pandemic. RA patients treated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs at least 6 months who had been in remission or those with mild disease activity were observed for 6 months from February to July 2020. No-show was defined as a missed appointment that was not previously cancelled by the patient and several variables that might affect no-show were examined. A total of 376 patients and 1,189 appointments were evaluated. Among 376 patients, 164 patients (43.6%) missed appointment more than one time and no-show rate was 17.2% during COVID-19 pandemic. During the observation, face-to-face visits gradually increased and no-show gradually decreased. The logistic regression analysis identified previous history of no-show (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.225; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.422-3.479; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) and fewer numbers of comorbidities (adjusted OR, 0.749; 95% CI, 0.584-0.961; <i>P</i> = 0.023) as the independent factors associated with no-show.

Personal fears regarding the own disease and therapies (39.6Ã¢â‚¬Å %) are a central problem. The participants await physical (24.7Ã¢â‚¬Å %) as well as psychological (21.3Ã¢â‚¬Å %) consequences due to the pandemic and its current management. During the lockdown the isolation (banned visitors at any hospital) was discussed as critical main point by 58.5Ã¢â‚¬Å % of HNC patients. Study 2 (after lockdown) underlined the mental stress caused by pandemic. Intensified relations within the families (58/100 points) as well as more intensive experience of nature and silence (58/60 points) are the most perceived changes in corona-times. HNC showed increased own inactivity (MLQ) and depressed well-being (WHO-5) and attention to the moment (GrAw-7). Ã¢â‚¬â€šHNC patients have had high burden and fears due to the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020.

"Impact of COVID-19 outbreak on nurses' mental health: a prospective cohort study","To evaluate variations in nurses' sleep quality and symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress during the COVID-19 outbreak, and to evaluate whether the presence of potential risk factors influenced these symptoms over time. This prospective cohort study surveyed nurses three times - surveying personal factors, working conditions, family dynamics, and attitude towards COVID-19 - between March 31 and May 4, 2020. Nurses' mental health was assessed through Depression Anxiety Stress Scales - short version (DASS-21); their sleep quality was assessed through a 5-point Likert scale question. Nurses' sleep quality and symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress presented a positive variation over the COVID-19 outbreak. The only factors which are directly related to the COVID-19 outbreak and that were associated with the positive variation in nurses' symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress were the fear to infect others and the fear to be infected (higher fear of being infected or to infect someone corresponded to increased symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress). Although the COVID-19 outbreak seems to have had an immediate impact on nurses' mental health, a psychological adaptation phenomenon was also observed. Future research should focus on assessing nurses' symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress, after the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to compare and contrast the findings with the results of our study.","Sampaio, Sequeira, Teixeira","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110620","20201214","Anxiety; Coronavirus; Depression; Mental Health; Nurse","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-15","",8212,""
"Early impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on outpatient migraine care in Hawaii: Results of a quality improvement survey","A survey was implemented for early assessment of pandemic-related practice processes and quality improvement (QI). In response to the public health measures in Hawaii to curtail the coronavirus 2019 pandemic, Hawaii Pacific Neuroscience (HPN) adapted their patient care to ensure continuity of neurological treatment. The telephone survey was conducted on patients seen at HPN during the period of April 22, 2020-May 18, 2020 to address four areas related to patients' outpatient experience: delivery of care, general well-being, experience with telemedicine, and disease-specific questions. A total of 928 patients were contacted of which 429 (46.2%) patients responded and 367 (85.5%) agreed to participate. A total of 133 patients with migraine and 234 patients with other neurological conditions provided responses. Our migraine patients' survey responses suggest that their well-being was disproportionately negatively affected by the pandemic. Survey respondents with migraine were significantly more likely than their non-migraine peers to report worsening anxiety and sleep problems [62/132 (47.0%) vs. 78/234 (33.3%), Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 6.64, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.010, and 64/132 (48.5%) vs. 73/234 (31.2%), Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 10.77, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.001]; migraine patients also reported worsening of depression as a result of the pandemic more than patients with other diagnoses, though this was not statistically significant [44/132 (33.3%) vs. 57/234 (24.4%), Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 3.40, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.065]. In regard to access to healthcare, significantly more migraine patients reported running out of medications than those with other diagnoses [20/133 (15.0%) vs. 18/234 (7.7%), Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 4.93, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.026]. More avoided seeking medical help for new health problems because of the pandemic [30/133 (22.6%) vs. 30/234 (12.8%), Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 5.88, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.015]. Migraine patients were also significantly impacted economically by the pandemic; 43/132 (32.4%) of migraine patients reported losing their jobs as the result of the pandemic versus 34/234 (14.5%) of their peers (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 11.20, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). An increase in headache severity or frequency was reported in 39/118 (33.1%) of respondents and 19/118 (16.1%) reported to using more abortive therapy than usual. Telemedicine was well received by almost all patients who took advantage of the option. Most of those patients found telemedicine to be easy to use and as valuable as an in-person visit. Migraine patients indicated with more frequency that without the telemedicine option, they would have missed their medical appointments [37/68 (54.4%) vs. 56/144 (38.6%), Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 4.31, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.038]; a majority would prefer or consider telemedicine for future appointments over in-person visits. Insights gained from this QI survey to the practice's new pandemic-related processes include stressing lifestyle modification, optimizing treatment plans, and continuing the option of telemedicine.","Smith, Nakamoto, Crocker, Tiffany Morden, Liu, Ma, Chong, Van, Vajjala, Carrazana, Viereck, Liow","https://doi.org/10.1111/head.14030","20201214","coronavirus 2019; migraine; neurology; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-15","",8213,""

"Healthy lifestyle behaviors are major predictors of mental wellbeing during COVID-19 pandemic confinement: A study on adult Arabs in higher educational institutions","In the past infectious diseases affected the quality of lifestyle during home confinement. The study conducted examines the influence of home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak on lifestyle, mental wellbeing, nutritional status, and sleeping pattern. An online multicategorical questionnaire was distributed to collect demographic information combined with the following tools: Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), WHO-5 wellbeing score, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). A snowball non-discriminate sampling procedure was conducted to collect data from people attending or working at higher institutions from March 1, 2020 to April 24, 2020. A total of 1723 completed responses (917 males, 37.4 Ã‚Â±13.4 years old and 806 females 32.2 Ã‚Â± 11.5 years old) were collected. The female participants had significantly lower mental health scores than males (53.9% vs. 46.1%). The mental wellbeing scores were higher among participants with medium and high physical activity (PA) levels (p &lt; 0.00). Additionally, the mental wellbeing scores were significantly improved by dietary quality and it's sleeping score (p &lt; 0.001). However, PA was by far the major determinant of the mental health scores.

"A 23-Year-Old Man with SARS-CoV-2 Infection Who Presented with Auditory Hallucinations and Imaging Findings of Cytotoxic Lesions of the Corpus Callosum (CLOCC)","BACKGROUND Cytotoxic lesions of the corpus callosum (CLOCC) is a rare clinical and radiological syndrome that has been associated with various infectious etiologies. CLOCC are among the recently described neurological associations with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We report a case of CLOCC in a man with SARS-CoV-2 infection who presented with auditory hallucinations and rapidly developed systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). CASE REPORT A 23-year-old man with no past medical and psychiatric history presented with auditory hallucinations, restlessness, and suicidal ideations. A nasopharyngeal swab specimen tested using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was positive for SARS-CoV-2. A brain MRI revealed an isolated oval-shaped lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum, with hyperintense signal on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and hypointense on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, suggestive of CLOCC. After a dramatic hospital course associated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and severe intra-abdominal and cerebral bleeding, he developed cardiac arrest and died on hospital day 15. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights the need for increased vigilance for the atypical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, it suggests that CLOCC can be considered as a differential diagnosis by clinicians in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who present with unexplained neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms, leading to poor outcome.","Elkhaled, Ben Abid, Akhtar, Abukamar, Ibrahim","https://doi.org/10.12659/AJCR.928798","20201214","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-15","",8216,""
"Use of Asynchronous Virtual Mental Health Resources for COVID-19 Pandemic Related Stress Among the General Population in Canada: Findings from a Nationally Representative Cross-Sectional Survey","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in profound mental health impacts among the general population worldwide. As many in-person mental health supports have been suspended or transitioned online to facilitate physical distancing, there have been numerous calls for the rapid expansion of asynchronous virtual mental health (AVMH) resources. These AVMH resources have great potential to provide support for people coping with negative mental health impacts associated with the pandemic; however, literature examining use prior to COVID-19 illustrates that the uptake of these resources is consistently low. Objective: The aim of this paper is to examine the use of AVMH resources in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic among the general population and among a participant sub-group classified as experiencing an adverse mental health impact related to the pandemic. Methods: Data from this study were drawn from the first wave of a large multi-wave cross-sectional monitoring survey, distributed from May 14-29, 2020. Participants (N=3,000) were adults living in Canada. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample and bivariate cross-tabulations were used to examine the relationships between the use of AVMH resources and self-reported indicators of mental health that included a range of emotional and coping related responses to the pandemic. Univariate and fully adjusted multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine associations between sociodemographic and health related characteristics and use of AVMH resources in the sub-group of participants who reported experiencing one or more adverse mental health impacts identified in the set of self-reported mental health indicators. Results: Among the total sample, 2.0% of participants reported accessing AVMH resources in the prior two weeks to cope with stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the highest rates of use among individuals who reported self-harm (10.4%) and those who reported coping &quot;not well at all&quot; with COVID-19 related stress (10.3%). Within the sub-group of 1954 participants (65.1% of the total sample) who reported an adverse mental health impact related to COVID-19, 54 (2.8%) reported use of AVMH resources. Individuals were more likely to have used AVMH resources if they had reported receiving in-person mental health supports, were connecting virtually with a mental health worker or counsellor or belonged to a visible minority group. Conclusions: Despite substantial government investment into AVMH resources, the use of these resources is low among both the general population and individuals who may benefit from use of these resources as a means of coping with the adverse mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research is needed to improve our understanding of the barriers to the use of these resources.

"Have COVID-19-Related Disruptions Increased mHealth Emergency Use Intention? An Experience Sampling Method Study","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has become a universal public health event, which has raised concerns regarding individuals' health. Individuals need to cope with COVID-19 pandemic with guidelines on symptom recognition, home isolation and maintain mental health. By providing individuals with mobile health services, they always have access to novel and useful information to keep healthy. It is not known whether individuals have increased their daily mobile health services (mHealth) emergency use as a result of disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this diary analysis study is to assess the influences of daily disruptions of COVID-19 pandemic on individuals' mHealth emergency use. The secondary purpose of this study is to explore the mediating role COVID-19 induced strain and the moderating role of promotion regulatory focus in the relationship between daily disruptions of COVID-19 and mHealth emergency use. Drawing from the cognitive activation theory of stress, we investigated the underlying mechanism and boundary condition of the influence of COVID-19-related disruptions on daily mHealth emergency use. To test the proposed model, the present study adopts the experience sampling method to collect daily data. The experience sampling method helps researchers to capture participants' fluctuations in emotions, mental engagement in an activity, and experienced stress. The current study collected 550 cases nested in 110 samples in mainland China to test the conceptual model. And we employed hierarchical linear modeling analysis to test the effect of COVID-19-related disruptions on mHealth emergency use. We found that COVID-19 related disruptions increased COVID-19 induced strain (Ã¯ÂÂ§ = 0.24, P &lt; 0.001) and mHealth emergency use on a daily basis (Ã¯ÂÂ§ = 0.28, P &lt; 0.01). COVID-19-induced daily strain mediated this relationship (Effect = 0.09, 95% CI = [0.05, 0.14]). Promotion regulatory focus moderated the relationship between COVID-19 induced strain and mHealth emergency use (ÃŽÂ³ = 0.35, P = 0.02). In addition, the indirect relationship between disruptions and mHealth emergency use intentions through COVID-19 induced strain is contingent upon promotion regulatory focus: this relationship was stronger in those with high promotion regulatory focus (Effect = 0.12, 95% CI = [0.06, 0.19]) than in those with low promotion regulatory focus (Effect = 0.06, 95% CI = [0.02, 0.11]). Event disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic induced mHealth emergency use intention through increased psychological strain. Furthermore, individuals' promotion regulatory focus amplified this indirect relationship. Our findings extend our understanding of the factors underlying mHealth emergency use intention and illustrate the potential contingent role of promotion regulatory focus in CATS. This study also opens avenues for future research on mHealth emergency use intention in other countries and cultural settings.","Zhang, Xiao, Li, Zheng, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.2196/20642","20201214","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-15","",8218,""

"Emotional reactions and subjective health status during the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel: the mediating role of perceived susceptibility","The general consensus is that COVID-19, the virus spreading rapidly across the globe, affects physical health but also mental health and mental well-being. This study aimed to assess the associations among emotional reactions toward COVID-19, knowledge about COVID-19, perceived susceptibility to this disease, and subjective health status. This study was a cross-sectional study conducted among 1,085 Israeli adults who completed an online survey between April 23 and May 5, 2020. The self-administered questionnaire included questions about emotional reactions to COVID-19, knowledge about COVID-19, perceived susceptibility, subjective health status, and sociodemographic variables. Participants (aged 18-96) reported high levels of emotional reactions to COVID-19. Most respondents were worried (77.4%), afraid (62.8%) or stressed (55.3%). Emotional reaction scores were higher among women than among men. In the regression model, emotional reactions were higher for older participants, those who rated their subjective health status as poorer, and those who were employed, with the final model explaining 11.6% of the variance in emotional reactions. Perceived susceptibility significantly mediated the relationship between subjective health status and emotional reactions. The high prevalence of emotional responses among women, older people and those with lower subjective health ratings points to the need for intervention programs primarily targeting these groups.","Inbar, Shinan-Altman","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2020.1858490","20201214","COVID-19; emotional reactions; knowledge about COVID-19; perceived susceptibility; subjective health status","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-15","",8220,""
"Exploring the Mental Health Needs of Persons With Autoimmune Diseases During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: A Proposed Framework for Future Research and Clinical Care","Although the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been associated with increased psychological distress globally, it poses unique challenges to persons who are potentially more vulnerable to its effects, including patients with autoimmune disease. In this article, we review the published literature and media reports to determine factors that may contribute to mental health challenges in persons with autoimmune disease. We then explore existing mental health interventions that have been developed for use in COVID-19 and in patients with autoimmune disorders in general. We identified several potential contributors to psychological distress in patients with autoimmune disease during the pandemic, as follows: feelings of discrimination related to societal response to COVID-19, fear of infection and uncertainty related to immunosuppressive medication, diminished access to usual care and resources, previous health-related trauma, and the exacerbating effect of social isolation. Drawing from existing literature, we synthesize the identified evidence to develop a proposed framework for researching and managing mental health challenges in autoimmune disease during the pandemic and its aftermath.","Bingham, Rozenbojm, Chong-East, Touma","https://doi.org/10.1002/acr2.11205","20201214","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-15","",8221,""

To highlight and discuss the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental or psychological health. Literature search and collection of the information were performed using PubMed, the reports from the World health organization, and the Center for disease control and prevention. COVID-19 infection has already been declared as a global pandemic, which in association with infodemic has increased the risk of psychiatric/psychological disorders. A large population of the world is prone to develop anxiety, depressive disorders, and other mental abnormalities. Therefore, timely psychological interventions and preventive strategies are required. Moreover, the infection has been reported to be linked with cerebrovascular conditions; therefore, patients with underlying cerebrovascular diseases should be given attention. COVID-19-mediated mental health complications and cerebrovascular conditions may cause a huge burden on healthcare communities in the future. Therefore, timely intervention and the development or application of preventive strategies are required to decrease the risk of neurological consequences.","Khan, Siddique, Xiaoyan, Zhang, Nabi, Sohail Afzal, Liu, Xue","https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.1901","20201214","COVID-19; cerebrovascular conditions; psychological health; spread","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-15","",8222,""
"Lockdown, Social Media exposure regarding COVID-19 and the relation with self-assessment depression and anxiety Is the medical staff different?","Locking the humanity in their homes, COVID-19 forced people to use the technology at hand to keep informed about the outbreak and to keep close to their loved ones. During this time, even if physical health is theoretically unaffected, keeping calm and sane can be challenging. The aim of this research was to evaluate whether exposure to COVID-19 information available in the digital space has a different impact on the mental condition of Romanian medical staff, compared to general population, particularly searching for depression and anxiety symptoms. An online survey was conducted from April 6 to 16, 2020 within the Romanian users of Social Media platforms. The questionnaire assessed depression with the WHO-Five Well-Being Index, anxiety with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale and Social Media exposure by asking how often the respondents saw COVID-19 related information on the most popular Social Media channels in Romania. Information about: gender, age, educational level, occupation, area of living and risk category was also collected. The risk categories were defined as no risk, medium risk, and medical staff. Almost 90% of the 402 participants received daily through at least one Social Media channel information related to the COVID-19 outbreak. The Social Media Exposure significantly associated with the risk group only for Facebook and LinkedIn. However, exposure to information regarding COVID-19 was neither associated with anxiety nor depression. No significant association was identified neither between age class and self-assessed anxiety nor self-assessed depression. The self-assessment of depression was significantly more frequent as compared to self-assessment of anxiety. The results of this research are opposite to most of the already published literature. Depression and anxiety could not be correlated with the context of lockdown and excessive COVID-19-related information.","Cordo, BolboacÃ„Æ’","https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.13933","20201214","Coronavirus (COVID-19; Information exposure; SARS-CoV-2); Social Media Exposure (SME)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-15","",8223,""

An online survey developed using a rapid Delphi method. The survey was translated into 17 different languages and disseminated electronically in 27 countries via national diabetes nurse networks. Survey responses from 1829 diabetes nurses were included in the analysis. The responses indicated that 28% (n=504) and 48% (n=873) of diabetes nurses felt the COVID-19 pandemic had impacted 'a lot' on the physical and psychological risks of people with diabetes, respectively. The following clinical problems were identified as having increased 'a lot': anxiety 82% (n=1486); diabetes distress 65% (n=1189); depression 49% (n= 893); acute hyperglycaemia 39% (n=710); and foot complications 17% (n=323). Forty-seven percent (n=771) of respondents identified that the level of care provided to people with diabetes had declined either extremely or quite severely.

Prospective cohort survey study, 30 April - 18 May 2020. Staff (scientists and non-scientists) and students at five medical research institutes in Sydney, New South Wales. Self-assessed overall and task-specific productivity, and mental health. The proportions of non-scientists and scientists who wore pyjamas during the day were similar (3% v 11%; PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.31). Wearing pyjamas was not associated with differences in self-evaluated productivity, but was significantly associated with more frequent reporting of poorer mental health than non-pyjama wearers while working from home (59% v 26%; PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). Having children in the home were significantly associated with changes in productivity. Larger proportions of people with toddlers reported reduced overall productivity (63% v 32%; PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.008), and reduced productivity in writing manuscripts (50% v 17%; PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.023) and data analysis (63% v 23%; PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.002).

On a positive note, the presence of children in the home was not associated with changes in mental health during the pandemic. In contrast to established researchers, early career researchers frequently reported reduced productivity while working at home. Our findings are probably applicable to scientists in other countries.

"The psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Dutch people with and without an inflammatory rheumatic disease","To determine the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with and without an inflammatory rheumatic disease and establish whether psychological flexibility buffers this impact. From online surveys in the general Dutch population in 2018 and during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, we analysed data of people with (index group, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°239) and without (control group, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1821) an inflammatory rheumatic disease. Worry, stress, mental well-being (SF-36) and psychological flexibility levels were subjected to covariate-adjusted analyses of variance or linear regression analyses. During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, as compared with the control group, the index group was more worried about getting infected with the virus (partial ÃŽÂ·2=0.098; medium effect) and more stressed (partial ÃŽÂ·2= 0.040; small effect). However, as compared with data acquired in 2018, the level of mental well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic peak was not lower in both groups. Levels of psychological flexibility did not moderate associations of group or year with mental well-being. Although patients with an inflammatory rheumatic disease were more worried and stressed during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, their level of mental well-being was not reduced, which may have prevented us from finding a buffering effect of psychological flexibility. Overall, our results suggest that the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in patients with inflammatory rheumatic disease is modest, which could imply that common education and health care will do for most patients.","Koppert, Jacobs, Geenen","https://doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/keaa842","20201214","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2 infection; inflammation; mental health; psychological stress; rheumatoid arthritis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-15","",8227,""

Veterans (n=764; 50% male) with chronic musculoskeletal pain throughout nine VA medical centers will participate. The primary outcome is pain interference after treatment (4Ã‚Â months). Secondary outcomes, including pain intensity, depression symptom severity, sleep, self-efficacy, and global impression of change, are also measured after treatment. Where possible, outcomes are collected via electronic health record extraction, with remaining measures collected via IVR calls to maintain blinding. Quantitative and qualitative process evaluation metrics will be collected to evaluate factors related to implementation. A budget impact analysis will be performed. This pragmatic trial compares the outcomes, cost, and implementation of two forms of CBT-CP as delivered in the real-world setting. Findings from the trial can be used to guide future policy and implementation efforts related to these interventions and their use in the health system. If one of the interventions emerges as superior, resources can be directed to this modality. If both treatments are effective, patient preferences and health care system factors will take precedence when making referrals. Implications of COVID-19 on treatment provision and trial outcomes are discussed.","Heapy, Driscoll, Buta, LaChappelle, Edmond, Krein, Piette, Mattocks, Murphy, DeBar, MacLean, Ankawi, Kawecki, Martino, Wagner, Higgins","https://doi.org/10.1093/pm/pnaa365","20201214","Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; Interactive Voice Response; Nonpharmacologic Treatment; Pragmatic Trial; Technology; Ã‚Â Chronic Pain","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-15","",8228,""
"Labour Market Attachment, Workplace Infection Control Procedures and Mental Health: A Cross-Sectional Survey of Canadian Non-healthcare Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to large proportions of the labour market moving to remote work, while others have become unemployed. Those still at their physical workplace likely face increased risk of infection, compared to other workers. The objective of this paper is to understand the relationship between working arrangements, infection control programs (ICP), and symptoms of anxiety and depression among Canadian workers, not specifically working in healthcare. A convenience-based internet survey of Canadian non-healthcare workers was facilitated through various labour organizations between April 26 and June 6, 2020. A total of 5180 respondents started the survey, of which 3779 were assessed as employed in a full-time or part-time capacity on 2 March 2020 (prior to large-scale COVID-19 pandemic responses in Canada). Of this sample, 3305 (87.5%) had complete information on main exposures and outcomes. Anxiety symptoms were measured using the Generalised Anxiety Disorder screener (GAD-2), and depressive symptoms using the Patient Health Questionnaire screener (PHQ-2). For workers at their physical workplace (site-based workers) we asked questions about the adequacy and implementation of 11 different types of ICP, and the adequacy and supply of eight different types of personal protective equipment (PPE). Respondents were classified as either: working remotely; site-based workers with 100% of their ICP/PPE needs met; site-based workers with 50-99% of ICP/PPE needs met; site-based workers with 1-49% of ICP/PPE needs met; site-based workers with none of ICP/PPE needs met; or no longer employed. Regression analyses examined the association between working arrangements and ICP/PPE adequacy and having GAD-2 and PHQ-2 scores of three and higher (a common screening point in both scales). Models were adjusted for a range of demographic, occupation, workplace, and COVID-19-specific factors. A total of 42.3% (95% CI: 40.6-44.0%) of the sample had GAD-2 scores of 3 and higher, and 34.6% (95% CI: 32.-36.2%) had PHQ-2 scores of 3 and higher. In initial analyses, symptoms of anxiety and depression were lowest among those working remotely (35.4 and 27.5%), compared to site-based workers (43.5 and 34.7%) and those who had lost their jobs (44.1 and 35.9%). When adequacy of ICP and PPE was taken into account, the lowest prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms was observed among site-based workers with all of their ICP needs being met (29.8% prevalence for GAD-2 scores of 3 and higher, and 23.0% prevalence for PHQ-2 scores of 3 and higher), while the highest prevalence was observed among site-based workers with none of their ICP needs being met (52.3% for GAD-2 scores of 3 and higher, and 45.8% for PHQ-2 scores of 3 and higher). Our results suggest that the adequate design and implementation of employer-based ICP have implications for the mental health of site-based workers. As economies re-open the ongoing assessment of ICP and associated mental health outcomes among the workforce is warranted.","Smith, Oudyk, Potter, Mustard","https://doi.org/10.1093/annweh/wxaa119","20201214","COVID-19; PPE; epidemiology; infection control; mental health; workplace","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-15","",8229,""
"Bariatric Surgery Closure During COVID-19 Lockdown in Italy: The Perspective of Waiting List Candidates","<b>Background:</b> From the beginning of March 2020, lockdown regimens prevented patients with obesity from receiving bariatric surgery. Surgical emergencies and oncological procedures were the only operations allowed in public hospitals. Consequently, patients with morbid obesity were put in a standby situation. With the aim at exploring the viewpoint of our future bariatric surgery patients, we built a questionnaire concerning obesity and COVID-19. <b>Method:</b> A total of 116 bariatric surgery candidates were approached using a telephonic interview during the Italian lockdown. <b>Results:</b> Of the total sample, 73.8% were favorable to regular bariatric surgery execution. Forty percent were concerned about their own health status due to the COVID-19 emergency, and 61.1% were troubled by the temporary closure of the bariatric unit. The majority of the sample were eating more. Forty-five percent and the 27.5% of patients reported a worsening of the emotional state and physical health, respectively. Most of the patients (52.2%) considered themselves more vulnerable to COVID-19, especially individuals with class III obesity. Patients who reported an increased consumption of food were younger (43.44 Ã‚Â± 12.16 vs. 49.18 Ã‚Â± 12.66; <i>F</i> = 4.28, <i>p</i> = 0.042). No gender difference emerged. <b>Conclusion:</b> The lockdown had a negative result on Italian patients' psychological well-being and eating habits. The majority of patients would have proceeded with the surgery even during the COVID-19 emergency. Effective management and bariatric surgery should be restarted as soon as possible.","Bianciardi, Imperatori, Niolu, Campanelli, Franceschilli, Petagna, Zerbin, Siracusano, Gentileschi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.582699","20201214","COVID-19; bariatric Surgery; depression; eating disorder; mental health; obesity; waiting list","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-15","",8230,""
"First-Degree Atrioventricular Block with Tachycardia from Paliperidone and Mirtazapine Overdose","Paliperidone and mirtazapine are psychotropic agents associated with proarrhythmic effects. A 21-year-old woman was admitted to the intensive care unit on two separate occasions for attempting suicide by overdosing on paliperidone and mirtazapine. During both admissions, the patient had atypical chest pain and a first-degree atrioventricular block (AVB) with paradoxical sinus tachycardia, which resolved with the discontinuation of paliperidone and mirtazapine and aggressive intravenous fluids. Drug-induced first-degree AVB from paliperidone and mirtazapine should be on the differential diagnosis in patients on paliperidone and/or mirtazapine who present with chest pain, tachycardia or new-onset first-degree AVB. Paliperidone and mirtazapine are associated with first-degree heart block, which may be a harbinger of torsades de pointes and ventricular fibrillation.Paliperidone and mirtazapine may potentiate each other's proarrhythmic effects since the metabolism of both involve the cytochrome P450 2D6 enzyme.A history of psychiatric illness makes it difficult to rule out atypical chest pain without ECG or troponins and often leads to increased resource utilization, even during times of heavy use like the COVID-19 pandemic.","Cheung, Levy, Shivkumar","https://doi.org/10.12890/2020_001879","20201214","Atrioventricular block; paliperidone","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-15","",8231,""
"Experiences and Psychological Adjustments of Nurses Who Voluntarily Supported COVID-19 Patients in Hubei Province, China","The COVID-19 pandemic poses a major threat to global public health and economic development. Moreover, it has put considerable psychological pressure on nurses, who have played a vital role in the prevention and control of the epidemic. This qualitative study aimed at exploring the experiences and psychological adjustments of nurses who voluntarily traveled to Hubei Province in China to provide support during the COVID-19 epidemic. We conducted semi-structured, face-to-face interviews with twelve nurses recruited from three hospitals in Jiangsu Province and performed qualitative content analysis of the interview data. The following themes emerged from the analysis: (1) motivations for supporting the hardest-hit areas (professional commitment, family support, and media propaganda); (2) challenges faced during the support missions (heavy workloads, changes in working patterns, communication barriers, and barriers associated with wearing personal protective equipment); (3) psychological experiences (a sense of uncertainty, fear of infection, loneliness, stressful events, and sleep disorders); (4) psychological adjustments (adequate training and personal protective equipment, positive responses to stress, and social support); and (5) personal and professional growth (a strong professional identity, a positive work attitude, a perception of expanded possibilities, realization of the value of learning, and cherishing life). Policy makers and nursing managers should implement effective measures for supporting nurses. They include ensuring adequate workforce preparedness for nurses, strengthening protection training, including professional psychologists in support teams, encouraging nurses to apply self-regulation methods, such as exercising and listening to music, and seeking social support to promote mental health.","Cui, Zhang, Yan, Shi, Jiang, Wang, Chu","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S283876","20201214","coronavirus; mental health; nurse; psychological health; qualitative study","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-15","",8232,""

"Sexual attitudes of healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 outbreak","During the COVID-19 outbreak, which is effective worldwide, the psychological conditions of healthcare professionals deteriorate. The aim of this study was to examine health professionals' changes in their sexual lives due to the COVID-19 outbreak in Istanbul, Turkey. This online survey was conducted between 2 and 26 May 2020 with 232 healthcare professionals working in a pandemic hospital. After obtaining informed consent, a questionnaire was sent online from the hospital database and health institutions social media accounts (TwitterÃ‚Â®, FacebookÃ‚Â®, InstagramÃ‚Â®, WhatsAppÃ‚Â® etc.) and e-mail addresses. The first section of the four-part questionnaire included demographic data, the second and third sections of pre-and post-COVID-19 attitudes, and the last section to assess sexual functions (International Index of Erecile Function for male and Female Sexual Function Index for female), anxiety and depression. Dependent sample t-test, Mc Nemar test, and multivariate analysis were used.The study was completed with 185 participants in total. Healthcare workers' sexual desire (3.49Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.12 vs. 3.22Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.17; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.003), weekly sexual intercourse/masturbation number (2.53Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.12 vs. 1.32Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.27; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), foreplay time (16.38Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°12.35 vs. 12.02Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°12.14; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), sexual intercourse time (24.65Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°19.58 vs. 19.38Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°18.85; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) decreased compared to the Pre-COVID-19 outbreak.

"Excess mortality from suicide during the early COVID-19 pandemic period in Japan: a time-series modeling before the pandemic","Suicide amidst the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is an important issue. In Japan, the number of suicides in April 2020 decreased by nearly 20% from that in 2019. To assess the impact of an infectious disease pandemic, excess mortality is often discussed. Our main purpose was evaluating excess mortality from suicide in Japan during the early pandemic period. We used data on suicides collected by the National Police Agency of Japan until June 2020. We estimated excess mortality during the early pandemic period (March-June 2020) using a time-series model of the number of suicides before the pandemic. A quasi-Poisson model was employed for the estimation. We evaluated excess mortalities by the categories of age and sex, and prefectures. No significant excess mortality was observed throughout the early pandemic; instead, a downward trend in the number of suicides for both sexes was noted. For males, negative values of excess mortalities below the lower bound of the 95% prediction interval were observed in April and May. All numbers of females during the period were included in the interval, and the excess mortalities in June were positive and higher than those in April and May. In Tokyo, the number of suicides was below the lower bound throughout the period. Our results suggest that various changes such as communication, and social conditions amid the early COVID-19 pandemic induced a decrease in suicides in Japan. However, continuous monitoring is needed to evaluate the long-term effects of the pandemic on suicides.","Anzai, Fukui, Ito, Ito, Takahashi","https://doi.org/10.2188/jea.JE20200443","20201214","Early COVID-19 pandemic; Excess mortality; Suicide; Time series modeling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-15","",8236,""
"Social, financial and psychological stress during an emerging pandemic: observations from a population survey in the acute phase of COVID-19","The negative impacts of COVID-19 have rippled through every facet of society. Understanding the multidimensional impacts of this pandemic is crucial to identify the most critical needs and to inform targeted interventions. This population survey study aimed to investigate the acute phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in terms of perceived threats and concerns, occupational and financial impacts, social impacts and stress between 3 April and 15 May 2020. 6040 participants are included in this report. A multivariate linear regression model was used to identify factors associated with stress changes (as measured by the Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)) relative to pre-outbreak retrospective estimates. On average, PSS scores increased from low stress levels before the outbreak to moderate stress levels during the outbreak (p&lt;0.001). The independent factors associated with stress worsening were: having a mental disorder, female sex, having underage children, heavier alcohol consumption, working with the general public, shorter sleep duration, younger age, less time elapsed since the start of the outbreak, lower stress before the outbreak, worse symptoms that could be linked to COVID-19, lower coping skills, worse obsessive-compulsive symptoms related to germs and contamination, personalities loading on extraversion, conscientiousness and neuroticism, left wing political views, worse family relationships and spending less time exercising and doing artistic activities. Cross-sectional analyses showed a significant increase from low to moderate stress during the COVID-19 outbreak. Identified modifiable factors associated with increased stress may be informative for intervention development.

"Death CafÃƒÂ©s for prevention of burnout in intensive care unit employees: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial (STOPTHEBURN)","Burnout is an occupational syndrome that leads to mental health problems, job turnover, and patient safety events. Those caring for critically ill patients are especially susceptible due to high patient mortality, long hours, and regular encounters with trauma and ethical issues. Interventions to prevent burnout in this population are needed. Preliminary studies suggest debriefing sessions may reduce burnout. This study aims to assess whether participation in regular debriefing can prevent burnout in intensive care unit (ICU) clinicians. A randomized controlled trial will be conducted in two large academic medical centers. Two hundred ICU clinicians will be recruited with target enrollment of 100 physicians and 100 non-physicians (nurses, pharmacists, therapists). Participants must have worked in the ICU for the equivalent of at least 1 full time work week in the preceding 4Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks. Enrolled subjects will be randomized to virtually attend biweekly debriefing sessions facilitated by a psychotherapist for 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°months or to a control arm without sessions. Our debriefs are modeled after Death CafÃƒÂ©s, which are informal discussions focusing on death, dying, loss, grief, and illness. These sessions allow for reflection on distressing events and offer community and collaboration among hospital employees outside of work. The primary outcome is clinician burnout as measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) Score. Secondary outcomes include depression and anxiety, as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire 8 (PHQ-8) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7), respectively. Questionnaires will be administered prior to the intervention, at 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°month, at 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°months, and at 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°months after enrollment. These values will be compared between groups temporally. Qualitative feedback will also be collected and analyzed. With ICU clinician burnout rates exceeding 50%, Death CafÃƒÂ© debriefing sessions may prove to be an effective tool to avert this debilitating syndrome. With COVID-19 limiting social interactions and overloading ICUs worldwide, the virtual administration of the Death CafÃƒÂ© for ICU clinicians provides an innovative strategy to potentially mitigate burnout in this vulnerable population.

First objective was to explore psychological problems (Anxiety, Depression and Stress) in general population during Covid-19 pandemic. Second purpose was to find predictive effects of cognitive emotion regulation on psychological problems. Convenient sampling technique was used to obtain the sample of 500 participants (Male =239, Female =261). Research instrument consists of four parts. First part comprised of consent form, second part was about demographic profile, third part was Depression, Anxiety and Stress scale (DASS-21) while Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire was the last part of the instrument. SPSS 23.0 (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) version was used for study analysis. Descriptive statistics used to summarize the raw data. The inferential statistics such as regression, correlation and t-test were used to calculate the findings according to research objectives. Results indicated that 33%, 40% and 27% individuals were experiencing Depression, Anxiety and Stress respectively during Covid-19 pandemic. Among these participants, 48% (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°242) were experiencing normal level of all these targeted psychological problems while remaining 52% (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°258) respondents have mild to very severe level of all these disorders.

"Measuring Cumulative Stressfulness: Psychometric Properties of the COVID-19 Stressors Scale","Scales assessing stressor exposure often fail to demonstrate adequate psychometric qualities, demonstrating low interitem reliability or complex factor structures, as would be expected, given that the majority of stressors are independent events. However, in large-scale mass crisis events, the stressors may be highly interrelated, indicating shared experience. Furthermore, few stressor exposure scales also measure appraised stressfulness of those stressors. Development of a psychometrically sound measure of both stressor exposure and appraisal advances the study of highly stressful events such as community-wide crises, especially in providing a useful measure of its cumulative stressfulness. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an enduring, worldwide stressor with an indefinite timeline. The COVID-19 Stressor Scale is a 23-item measure of stressor exposure and appraisal related to the pandemic developed within the first weeks of widespread shelter-in-place practices in the Unites States. We present initial psychometric results of the COVID-19 Stressor Scale. Results of a principal components analysis indicate that the measure is unidimensional and has strong internal consistency. Evidence of convergent and discriminant validity were demonstrated. The COVID-19 Stressor Scale is a useful measure for studying the ongoing stressors associated with the pandemic and presents a model for measuring other massive, ongoing crises.","Tambling, Russell, Park, Fendrich, Hutchinson, Horton, Tomkunas","https://doi.org/10.1177/1090198120979912","20201214","COVID-19; measurement; mental health; psychological distress; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-15","",8242,""
"[Efficacy of Low-Frequency Magnetic Therapy in Patients with COVID-19 Pneumonia]","The number of patients who have had pneumonia caused by COVID-19 is increasing every month. However, despite the ongoing treatment, the consequences of this disease are possible, which may appear in the short term or after a while. Pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus infection COVID-19 is characterized by the presence of such complications as cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, sleep disturbances, appetite disorders, etc. Often, pneumonia leads to dysfunctions of the respiratory system, higher mental functions, functions of the cardiovascular system and, unfortunately, possible disability. The search and implementation of new methods of physical rehabilitation is an urgent task of modern medicine. Low-frequency magnetotherapy is one of the safest and most commonly recommended treatments for pneumonia. To assess the effectiveness of the use of low-frequency magnetotherapy in the complex medical rehabilitation of patients who have had pneumonia in the phase of convalescence. The study included 52 patients who had suffered from pneumonia caused by COVID-19 and whose average age was 56.2Ã‚Â±5.7 years. Group I (main) group (<i>n</i>=30), against the background of standard therapy on the 16th day after discharge from the hospital, received low-frequency magnetotherapy on the ALMAG-02 apparatus (Elamed, Russia) daily for 20 minutes, a course of 10-12 procedures. In the second (control) group (<i>n</i>=22), therapy was carried out in accordance with the Temporary Clinical Recommendations of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus infection COVID-19 (version 8.1 of 01/10/2020), as well as the Temporary Clinical recommendations for medical rehabilitation for a new coronavirus infection (version 8.1 of 01/10/2020). Evaluation method: spirometry using a spirographMIR (Italy), chest excursion, rehabilitation routing scale (RRM), quality of life questionnaire (EQ-5D), Borg scale for patient assessment of exercise tolerance, ECG, oxygen saturation in the blood. The patients of the 1st group showed an increase in the vital capacity of the lungs by 16.4% in comparison with the 2nd (control) group; an increase in chest excursion by 45.6%, a decrease in the level of shortness of breath from moderate to mild by 64.1%, a decrease in disabilities by 62.7%, compared with the second (control) group. According to the data of the quality of life questionnaire (EQ-5D), the patients of the main group showed improvements in general mobility (mobility) by 44.5%, everyday activity by 26.1%, a decrease in pain/discomfort by 47.9%, anxiety and depression by 42.2%, compared with the control group (<i>p</i>=0.001).

"COVID-19 and Student Well-being: Stress and Mental Health during Return-to-School","Students have been multiply impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic: threats to their own and their familyâ€™s health, the closure of schools and pivoting to online learning in March 2020, a long summer of physical distancing, and then the challenge of returning to school in the fall. The present study engaged with over two thousand (N = 2,310; 1288 female; Mage = 14.5) Alberta secondary students in an online survey during their first few weeks of return-to-school in fall 2020. Students completed an online survey that asked about their perceptions of COVID-19, their fall return-to-school experiences (85% returned in-person), their self-reported pandemic-related stress, and their behaviour, affect, and cognitive functioning in the first few weeks of September. Students reported moderate and equal concern for their health, family confinement, and maintaining social contact. Student stress levels were also above critical thresholds for 25 percent of the sample, and females and older adolescents (age 15-18) generally reported higher stress indicators compared to males and younger (age 12-14) adolescents; stress arousal was also positively and significantly correlated with self-reported behavioural concerns. Discussion focuses on how most students were coping well during the return-to-school, while recognizing that some may require more targeted strategies to address stress arousal and heightened negative affect as a result of COVID-19.","Kelly Dean Schwartz et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F2-F8B-128","20201215","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|School Psychology","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-15","",8245,""
"Written benefit finding for improving psychological health during the Covid-19 pandemic first wave lockdown","Objectives. Written benefit finding has been associated with improvements in psychological and physical health in a range of patient groups. In the present study, we aimed to test the efficacy of written benefit finding, delivered online during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown, on self-reported anxiety, depression, stress and physical symptoms. We also sought to investigate the moderating role of perseverative thinking on these effects. Design. A quantitative longitudinal design was employed. Methods. Participants (n = 91, 33 males, Mage = 37.6, SDage = 15.5; 58 females, Mage = 40.0, SDage = 13.7) completed self-report measures of anxiety, depression, stress and physical symptoms at baseline, and again two weeks after being randomised to complete three consecutive days of writing about the positive thoughts and feelings theyâ€™ve experienced in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic (written benefit finding condition) or to unemotively describe the events of the previous day (control condition). Self-reported state anxiety was measured immediately before and after writing. Perseverative thinking was also measured at baseline. Results. There was a significant reduction in state anxiety in the written benefit finding condition, relative to the control condition. Anxiety and depression decreased between baseline and the two week follow-up, but this did not differ significantly between the two conditions. Perseverative thinking was negatively associated with changes in anxiety, depression and stress, but did not moderate any writing effects. Conclusions. Written benefit finding may be a useful intervention for improving wellbeing, specifically state anxiety, in the general population.","Sarah Hansen et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D3-034-DF4","20201215","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-15","",8246,""
"Musical Engagement and Parent-Child Attachment in Families with Young Children During the Covid-19 Pandemic","The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted the lives of families in the United States and across the world, impacting parent mental health and stress, and in turn, the parent-child relationship. Music is a common parent-child activity and has been found to positively impact relationships, but little is known about musicâ€™s role in parent-child interactions during a pandemic. The current study utilized an online questionnaire to assess the use of music in the home of young children and their parents in the USA and Canada during Covid-19 and its relationship with parentsâ€™ affective attachment with their child. Musical activity was high for both parents and children. Parents reported using music for both emotion regulation and to socially connect with their children. Parent-child musical engagement was associated with parent-child attachment, controlling for relevant parent variables including parent distress, efficacy, education and parent-child engagement in non-musical activities. These results indicate that music may be an effective tool for building and maintaining parent-child relationships during a period of uncertainty and change.","Selena Steinberg et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46045-69F-509","20201214","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; parent-child attachment; music; covid-19; parent-child interactions; early childhood","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-15","",8247,""
