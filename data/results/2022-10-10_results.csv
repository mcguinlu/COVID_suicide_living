"Cancer Survivors' Cancellations of Healthcare Appointments During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Associations with Anxiety and Depression","Though it is well-documented that cancer survivors experienced healthcare delays during the COVID-19 pandemic, who initiated those delays has not been examined. This longitudinal study distinguishes rates of patient- from provider-cancelled healthcare appointments at three timepoints during the pandemic, and examines psychosocial factors associated with patient-cancelled appointments. Cancer survivors (N=147) in the United States completed psychosocial and health behavior measures three times between May and December 2020. We examined rates of patient- and provider-cancelled healthcare appointments, including cancer screening appointments, at each timepoint and change between timepoints. Logistic regression was used to determine if anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms, and COVID-19 fears were associated with self-cancelled healthcare appointments. In May 2020, one third (33.79%) of participants reported one or more self-cancelled appointments within the prior two months and nearly half (45.89%) reported one or more provider-cancelled appointments. Rates of provider-cancelled appointments decreased to 35.71% in June/July 2020 and to 9.24% in November/December 2020 (both reflected p&lt;.05 reductions compared to the previous timepoint). Rates of self-cancelled appointments, however, remained more stable (ps&gt;.144). In June/July and November/December 2020, higher depression and anxiety symptoms, but not COVID-19 fears, were associated with greater likelihood of self-cancelled appointments. Cancer survivors cancelled their healthcare appointments at a stable rate even as provider-cancelled appointments declined. Depression and anxiety symptoms, but not COVID-19 concerns, were associated with patient cancellations. Interventions that address anxiety and depression symptoms may help to promote adherence to cancer survivorship care during the pandemic. This article is protected by copyright.

"Puerto Rican healthcare workers' perspectives on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on their role, patient care, and mental health","To explore the personal and work-related stressors of healthcare workers in Puerto Rico and the organizational support they received during the pandemic. We used a qualitative descriptive design and from April - November, 2021, conducted semi-structured individual interviews with Puerto Rican frontline healthcare workers (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 12) and supervisors (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 5). Thematic analysis revealed five major themes: (a) Organizations' response to COVID-19; (b) increased complexity of patients; (c) intensified work and psychological demand for nurses; (d) overwhelmed and overworked; and (e) recommendations for healthcare leadership. Participants explained that their organizations' responses to COVID-19Ã‚Â wereÃ‚Â insufficientÃ‚Â forÃ‚ meeting the demands and acuity of the patients. Closure of outpatient services contributed to people presenting to hospitals with exacerbated chronic conditions - especially the elderly. With COVID-19 precautions prohibiting family visitation, nurses became responsible for total care, including emotional support of patients. In addition, the shortage of staff contributed to nurses assuming greater workloads, feeling overwhelmed and overworked, and healthcare worker resignations. Given their experiences, healthcare workers recommended that healthcare leadership show more appreciation for staff, demonstrate empathy, include frontline workers in decision-making, and provide mental health resources for staff. This study with Puerto Rican frontline workers and supervisors uncovers the multiple stressors experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings underscore the need for prioritizing the well-being of healthcare workers, preparing healthcare leadership on how to support staff, and mandating nurse-to-patient ratios. Healthcare workers explained the barriers they experienced for providing quality care to their patients. They also presented recommendations for healthcare leadership to facilitate supporting frontline workers, which ultimately contributes to optimal patient care.","Alvarez, Diaz-Ramos, Quiles, Sanchez-Roman, Weeks, Cooper","https://doi.org/10.1111/jnu.12820","20221009","COVID-19; Puerto Rico; healthcare workers; qualitative research; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-10","",38857,""
"New symptoms and prevalence of postacute COVID-19 syndrome among nonhospitalized COVID-19 survivors","The aim of this study was to assess postacute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) syndrome (PACS) symptoms according to the onset of the infection while evaluating the effect of COVID-19 vaccination on the symptoms of PACS. We conducted a retrospective single-center cohort study in which nonhospitalized COVID-19 survivors and healthy controls were compared for the occurrence of PACS. The total number of patients in this study was 472. At 6-12 and &gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°12Ã‚Â months after the infection, COVID-19 survivors had a significantly higher incidence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety than the non-COVID-19 cohort. Furthermore, depression, cognitive deficit, tics, impaired quality of life and general health impairment were significantly more prevalent among COVID-19 survivors at &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°6Ã‚Â months, 6-12Ã‚Â months and &gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°12Ã‚Â months than in the non-COVID-19 cohort. However, respiratory symptoms were significantly more prevalent among COVID-19 survivors only in the first 6Ã‚Â months after infection. In addition, cognitive deficit (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.15; 95% CI 0.03-0.87) and impaired quality of life (BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.11; 95% CI -Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.21 to -Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.20) were significantly less prevalent among vaccinated COVID-19 survivors than among nonvaccinated survivors. Longitudinal studies are needed to establish the time that should elapse after COVID-19 infection for the symptoms of PACS to appear. Randomized clinical trials are needed to assess the possibility that COVID-19 vaccines might relieve PACS symptoms.","Albtoosh, Toubasi, Al Oweidat, Hasuneh, Alshurafa, Alfaqheri, Farah","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-21289-y","20221008","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-10","",38858,""
"The emotional-behavioral state of Israeli adolescent and young adult females with anorexia nervosa during the COVID19 pandemic","During the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel, the number of patients with eating disorders (EDs) seeking treatment increased significantly. The present study sought to evaluate whether, during the pandemic (2020-21), patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) would show more ED-related, comorbid, and COVID-19-related symptoms in comparison to a naturalistic control group, and whether differences would be found between adult and adolescent patients with AN. We also examined attitudes to telemedicine use during the pandemic in patients receiving long-distance interventions. Using online self-report questionnaires, we assessed general and COVID-19-specific symptoms with a secure digital platform (REDCap<sup>Ã‚Â®</sup>) in 36 female adolescents with AN, 35 female adults with AN, and 25 female controls. Compared with controls, patients with AN showed more symptoms of EDs, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), elevated suicidal ideation, more COVID-related emotional-behavioral disturbances, and lower resilience. Adult patients with AN fared worse than adolescent patients on most of these measures. Adult patients using telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic showed fewer positive attitudes toward this treatment than adolescents (telemedicine was offered to all, but used by 18/35 adolescents and 21/36 adults with AN). Last, elevated COVID-19-related symptomatology was correlated with more symptoms of ED, anxiety, depression and PTSD, and with lower resilience. Our findings suggest that the emotional-behavioral state of Israeli females with AN, particularly adults, was worse during the COVID-19 pandemic in comparison to controls. Many patients did not use telemedicine for their treatment. Adult patients using telemedicine were less satisfied with it than adolescent patients. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with increased rates of eating disorders in many countries around the globe, including Israel. Our study evaluated whether Israeli patients with anorexia nervosa would fare worse than a control group during the COVID-19 pandemic, and whether adults and adolescents with anorexia nervosa would differ. For this purpose, we administered questionnaires to 71 females with anorexia nervosaÃ¢â‚¬â€36 adolescents and 35 adultsÃ¢â‚¬â€and to a control group of 25 adolescent and young adult women. We found that females with anorexia nervosa showed not only more eating-disordered and psychiatrically-related symptoms, but also more pandemic-related disturbances than the control group. Among the patients with anorexia nervosa, adults fared worse than adolescents. Fifty-one percent of adolescents and 58% of adults with anorexia nervosa received treatment via telemedicine, although all were offered this treatment. Adults treated with telemedicine showed fewer positive attitudes toward it than adolescents. Last, more disordered eating and other psychiatric symptoms were associated with more COVID-19-specific disturbances. Our findings suggest that the emotional-behavioral state of female Israeli patients with anorexia nervosa is worse than that of control females during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in adults.","Serur, Dikstein, Shilton, Gothelf, Latzer, Lewis, Enoch-Levy, Pessach, Gur, Stein","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40337-022-00668-w","20221008","Age; Anorexia nervosa; COVID-19; Eating disorders; Females; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-10","",38859,""
