"Prevalence, determinants, and impact on general health and working capacity of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 six to 12 months after infection: a population-based retrospective cohort study from southern Germany","Background: Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection have commonly been described after COVID-19, but few population-based studies have examined symptoms six to 12 months after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and their associations with general health recovery and working capacity. Methods: This population-based retrospective cohort study in four geographically defined regions in southern Germany included persons aged 18-65 years with PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between October 2020 and March 2021. Symptom frequencies (six to 12 months after versus before acute infection, expressed as prevalence differences [PD] and ratios [PR]), symptom severity and clustering, risk factors and associations with general health recovery, and working capacity were analysed. Findings: Among a total of 11,710 subjects (mean age 44.1 years, 59.8% females, 3.5% previously admitted with COVID-19, mean follow-up time 8.5 months) the most prevalent symptoms with PDs >20% and PRs >5% were rapid physical exhaustion, shortness of breath, concentration difficulties, chronic fatigue, memory disturbance, and altered sense of smell. Female sex and severity of the initial infection were the main risk factors. Prevalence rates, however, appeared substantial among both men and women who had a mild course of acute infection, and PCS considerably affected also younger subjects. Fatigue (PD 37.2%) and neurocognitive impairment (PD 31.3%) as symptom clusters contributed most to reduced health recovery and working capacity, but chest symptoms, anxiety/depression, headache/dizziness and pain syndromes were also prevalent and relevant for working capacity, with some differences according to sex and age. When considering new symptoms with at least moderate impairment of daily life and [&le;]80% recovered general health or working capacity, the overall estimate for post-COVID syndrome was 28.5% (age- and sex-standardised rate 26.5%). Interpretation The burden of self-reported post-acute symptoms and possible sequelae, notably fatigue and neurocognitive impairment, remains considerable six to 12 months after acute infection even among young and middle-aged adults after mild acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, and impacts general health and working capacity.","Raphael S.

"Persistent Subacute Thyroiditis Post SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine in a Male Patient with Positive Thyroid Autoantibodies","Subacute thyroiditis (SAT) has been recently associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 infection or vaccines against it. We report a case of a 41-year-old male patient who developed persistent SAT after the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) vaccination. He presented with sore throat and neck pain after the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine (CoronaVacÂ®). There was no history of a recent viral infection. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were elevated, thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (fT4) were normal, COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test was negative, and sonography showed thyroiditis in the right lobe. The symptoms resolved after treatment with methylprednisolone. However, 2 weeks after the second dose of the vaccine, the patient suffered from neck pain and hoarseness. TSH and fT4 were normal, but anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti- TPO), anti-thyroglobulin (anti-Tg), ESR, and CRP were elevated. Sonography revealed thyroiditis in the left lobe. The patient was treated with ibuprofen. On follow-up, hypothyroidism was diagnosed, and levothyroxine started. Hence, the clinicians should suspect the possibility of SAT in the vaccinated subjects.

"Novel Strategies of Immunization against Covid-19","COVID-19 manifested itself as a global pandemic in 2019 but even in 2021, it is still not successfully contained. This virus has claimed millions of lives worldwide and rendered many more jobless. Apart from causing mild to severe pneumonia, the virus has also caused a loss of livelihood for thousands globally, along with widespread trauma and depression. Since the transmission rate of the virus is so high, temporary prophylaxis relied on sanitization, wearing masks and physical distancing. However, a long-term solution for stopping viral spread is vaccination. Apart from being the fastest way to induce immunity against the virus, vaccination is also the cheapest and most practical way. However, a vaccine can only be commercially available after it has passed through various clinical trial phases. So far, more than two hundred potential vaccine candidates underwent different phases of the clinical trial, and some of the front-runners have shown more than 90% efficacy. This review has compiled all such vaccine candidates, their types, their modes of action, and the associated pros and cons. The current advances in clinical trials of vaccines have also been discussed, such as plant-based and cocktail vaccines that have recently emerged. Nowadays, novel strains like Delta plus are also emerging and posing a threat. Thus, it is mandatory to get vaccinated and choose a vaccine that provides long-term protection against multiple strains.

"Food Safety Control Measures to Address Emerging Omicron SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern","The recent emergence of the novel Omicron SARS-CoV-2 Variant, first detected in Gauteng Province of South Africa in mid- November 2021, has become a global concern. Several countries witnessed rapid transmission of omicron in the past months. This variant can increase the rate of virus transmission, risk of reinfection and enable omicron to continue its spread in the community. There is no evidence that COVID-19 can spread through food, and people can catch up with this virus through food materials. This virus can not survive and multiple on the surfaces of food packaging. The main routes of this virus transmission and spread may be during close contact and directly from an infected person to a healthy person. Touching a contaminated surface and objects such as doorknobs, table surfaces, everyday use equipment, touching screens and shaking hands and then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes may also be a source of infection.1 Recent research reported that the COVID-19 virus could survive and remain viable on plastics for up to 72 hours, 4 hours on stainless steel and copper and up to 24 hours on cardboard. Since the food sector has complex processing and manufacturing processes with a series of operational steps, starting from food intake, receiving, preparation, production, processing, packaging, storage and delivery to market and customers. At each stage, food handlers are directly involved, there is a more likelihood of food handlers touching the food or food surfaces directly. In this case, food workers are not following proper food safety control and protective actions, e.g., hand washings, cleaning and disinfection, sanitization, and social distancing. If not vaccinated, it can be a possible source of omicron transmission. To prevent the potential transmission of emerging Omicron SARS-COV-2 Variant of Concern, the food sector should ensure compliance with food safety control measures and prerequisites to safe and protect food workers from omicron variants to mitigate the risks of transmission of the virus by adopting good hygienic practices (GHPs), good manufacturing practices (GMPs), appropriate cleaning and disinfection by approved chemicals and sanitizers to endure the production and consistent stream of safe food. Since all the food workers may well be aware of the precautionâ€™s measures, it is still needed to refresh their information. The staff working in food premises should be provided with frequent refresher training, proper personal protective equipment (PPEs), and written instructions on how to contain the transmission of Omicron and COVID-19 variants.2 One of the most critical steps to restrict the spread and transmission of the COVID-19 during food service processes is to wash and sanitize frequently. Frequent hand washing should be obligatory for Food workers directly involved in food production and preparation activities. The staff should avoid touching the food contact surfaces of tables, utensils, small wares, cutting boards and knives and surfaces of food menu, kiosks, dispensers, door handles, freezers and cooler handles, tablets, computers and equipment controller surfaces, buttons, and touchpads. There is a possibility that the virus can transfer from unwashed hands to other cleaned and sanitized surfaces during food production, preparations, cooking, storage, serving to customers and then moving to other food staff and eventually to customers. Frequent disinfection and sanitization with approved sanitizer to reduce the microorganismâ€™s loads to a safe level determined by food safety authorities and public health codes are crucial to mitigating the risk of virus transmission. Social distancing to keep a space of at least 2 meters during operation hours at food premises to limit the close staff contacts inside food preparation and production areas is critically important to limit the spread.2 It is also recommended by CDC and other food safety authorities. The staff Should avoid unnecessary gatherings and crowds during shift changes, breaks and staff training. The food premises should optim ze the number of food workers to occupy maximum capacity at food premises and ensure fewer food workers are available than normal staff to a smaller amount of COVID-19 transmission risks.3,4 The food facilities should also provide appropriate personnel protective equipments (PPEs) for staff while receiving incoming materials and during deliveries, which can enhance the staff protection from the virus. Finally, the food amenities should look for staff health and monitor the visitors, suppliers, and contractors to recognize any sick person, maximize protection, and report to related health authorities if someone's symptoms are identical to emerging COVID-19 omicron variant concern.

"Gender Differences in Mental Health Symptoms Among Canadian Older Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic: a Cross-Sectional Survey","Background Older women's mental health may be disproportionally affected by the COVID-19 pandemic due to differences in gender roles and living circumstances associating with aging. Methods We administered an online cross-sectional nationwide survey between May 1st and June 30th, 2020 to a convenience sample of older adults aged =55 years. Our outcomes were symptoms of depression, anxiety, and loneliness measured by three standardized scales: the eight-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, the five-item Beck Anxiety Inventory, and the Three-Item Loneliness Scale. Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare the odds of depression, anxiety and loneliness between men and women, adjusting for relevant confounders. Results There were 1,541 respondents (67.8% women, mean age 69.3 Â± 7.8). 23.3% reported symptoms of depression (29.4% women, 17.0% men), 23.2% reported symptoms of anxiety (26.0% women, 19.0% men), and 28.0% were lonely (31.5% women, 20.9% men). After adjustment for confounders, the odds of reporting depressive symptoms were 2.07 times higher in women compared to men (OR 2.07 [95%CI 1.50-2.87] p &lt; .0001). The odds of reporting anxiety and loneliness were also higher. Conclusions Older women had twice the odds of reporting depressive symptoms compared to men, an important mental health need that should be considered as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds.","Reppas-Rindlisbacher, Christina, Mahar, Alyson, Siddhpuria, Shailee, Savage, Rachel, Hallet, Julie, Rochon, Paula","https://doi.org/10.5770/cgj.25.532","","Database: CINAHL; Publication type: article; Publication details: Canadian Geriatrics Journal; 25(1):49-56, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28426,""

"Social Entrepreneurship Opportunities via Distant Socialization and Social Value Creation","Social entrepreneurs are catalysts for social change on account of social value creation and opportunity identification, thereby improving the quality of life. Their contribution to society is particularly significant in times of crises and pandemics. Hence, the world health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need for social entrepreneurship across the globe. Despite social entrepreneurship's relevance in social value creation, the studies regarding opportunity identification in times of social distancing are particularly rare. This constructivist-qualitative research fills the gap by employing the EDraw Mind Map tool to explore how the COVID-19 pandemic in general, and social distancing in particular, have shaped entrepreneurial opportunities for social innovation. The findings from content analysis reveal that ICT-based services and industry 4.0 hold a promising future during and post-COVID-19 scenario. They can facilitate a transformation of the threats of social distancing into distant socialization benefits and demand fulfillment. Furthermore, the study contributes to providing a comprehensive depiction of the myriad of opportunities created by social entrepreneurs worldwide. It also guides aspiring social entrepreneurs to adopt such technologies and aim for social integration to ensure quality mental health, education, employment, and manufacturing services in low-resource and developing countries' contexts, as they are severely impacted by the pandemic.","Kamran, Shah Muhammad, Khaskhely, Mahvish Kanwal, Nassani, Abdelmohsen A.; Haffar, Mohamed, Abro, Muhammad Moinuddin Qazi","https://doi.org/10.3390/su14063170","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(6):3170, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28429,""
"Influence of External Natural Environment Including Sunshine Exposure on Public Mental Health: A Systematic Review","The COVID-19 pandemic has been raging around the world and public health measures such as lockdowns have forced people to go out less often, reducing sunlight exposure time, green space use, and physical activity. It is well known that exercise has a positive impact on mental health, but the impact of external environmental factors such as sunlight exposure and green space use on mental health has not been systematically reviewed. In this review, we categorized the major factors that may affect people's mental health into (1) external environmental factors such as exposure to sunlight and green spaces, (2) internal life factors such as physical activity and lifestyle, and (3) mixed external and internal factors, and systematically examined the relationship between each factor and people's mental health. The results showed that exposure to sunlight, spending leisure time in green spaces, and physical activity each had a positive impact on people's mental health, including depression, anxiety, and stress states. Specifically, moderate physical activity in an external environment with sunlight exposure or green space was found to be an important factor. The study found that exposure to the natural environment through sunbathing and exercise is important for people's mental health.","Taniguchi, Keita, Takano, Mayuko, Tobari, Yui, Hayano, Motoshi, Nakajima, Shinichiro, Mimura, Masaru, Tsubota, Kazuo, Noda, Yoshihiro","https://doi.org/10.3390/psychiatryint3010008","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatry International; 3(1):91-113, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28430,""
"Mental Health in Settings with COVID-19 Positive Cases in the Spanish Population: The Protective Role of the Capacity to Adapt to Change","Background: The capacity to adapt to change in complex, highly demanding situations, such as those derived from the COVID-19 pandemic, is essential in maintaining one's mental health. This study analyzed the mental health of the Spanish population in settings with COVID-19 positive cases and the protective role of adaptation to change. Methods: The sample consisted of 1160 adult Spaniards aged 18 to 82 with a mean age of 38.29 (SD = 13.71). Data were collected by a CAWI (Computer Aided Web Interviewing) survey which included the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28), Adaptation to Change Questionnaire (ADAPTA-10), and an ad hoc questionnaire related to COVID-19 (perceived economic impact, COVID-19 positive diagnosis or not, and whether there was a positive case close to them). Results: The data revealed that the perceived economic impact showed a negative association between the emotional factor and the total score in adaptation to change. Lastly, the emotional factor in adaptation to change operated as a protector from the effect that a setting with COVID-19 positive cases exerts on mental health. Conclusions: Coping with COVID-19 requires strengthening the capacity for adaptation to changes generated in the setting, especially emotional, as it could contribute to improving the mental health of individuals, especially in those settings where they find and know a COVID-19 positive case.","Molero Jurado, MarÃ­a del Mar, PÃ©rez-Fuentes, MarÃ­a del Carmen, Herrera-Peco, IvÃ¡n, Oropesa Ruiz, Nieves FÃ¡tima, BarragÃ¡n MartÃ­n, Ana BelÃ©n, Martos MartÃ­nez, Ãfrica, SimÃ³n MÃ¡rquez, MarÃ­a del Mar, GÃ¡zquez Linares, JosÃ© JesÃºs","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11061497","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Medicine; 11(6):1497, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28431,""
"The Well-Being of the German Adult Population Measured with the WHO-5 over Different Phases of the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Analysis within the COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring Study (COSMO)","The aim of this study is to evaluate factors associated with the subjective well-being (SWB) and suspected depression measured with WHO-5 among German adults during different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Survey data were analyzed from the COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring (COSMO) study, which collected data from 972, 1013, and 973 participants in time point 1 (19â€“20 May 2020), time point 2 (15â€“16 September 2020), and time point 3 (21â€“22 December 2020), respectively. Descriptive analyses and logistic regression analyses to identify the factors associated with suspected depression (WHO-5 = 50) were conducted. Data showed that the mean WHO-5 scores in three time points were 56.17, 57.27, and 53.93, respectively. The risk of suspected depression was increased by about 1.5 times for females, 2.5â€“3 times among 18â€“24 year-olds compared to ages above 65 years, 1.5 times for singles, 2 times for those with chronic illnesses, and 2â€“3 times for people living in poverty. The main study findings show that German adult SWB is lower than pre-pandemic reference values. Special focus should be placed on vulnerable groups, such as females, younger persons, and people living in poverty who are most prone to a reduction in SWB and therefore suspected depression.","Tsai, Fang-Yi, Schillok, Hannah, Coenen, Michaela, Merkel, Christina, Jung-Sievers, Caroline, Group, on behalf of the COSMO Study","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19063236","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(6):3236, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28432,""
"Effectiveness of Telematic Behavioral Techniques to Manage Anxiety, Stress and Depressive Symptoms in Patients with Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","Anxiety, depressive symptoms and stress have a significant influence on chronic musculoskeletal pain. Behavioral modification techniques have proven to be effective to manage these variables;however, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for an alternative to face-to-face treatment. We conducted a search of PubMed, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Web of Science, APA PsychInfo, and Psychological and Behavioural Collections. The aim was to assess the effectiveness of telematic behavioral modification techniques (e-BMT) on psychological variables in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain through a systematic review with meta-analysis. We used a conventional pairwise meta-analysis and a random-effects model. We calculated the standardized mean difference (SMD) with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Forty-one randomized controlled trials were included, with a total of 5018 participants. We found a statistically significant small effect size in favor of e-BMT in depressive symptoms (n = 3531;SMD = &minus;0.35;95% CI &minus;0.46, &minus;0.24) and anxiety (n = 2578;SMD = &minus;0.32;95% CI &minus;0.42, &minus;0.21) with low to moderate strength of evidence. However, there was no statistically significant effect on stress symptoms with moderate strength of evidence. In conclusion, e-BMT is an effective option for the management of anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain.

"A Scoping Review of the Health Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Persons Experiencing Homelessness in North America and Europe","Persons experiencing homelessness (PEH) are at heightened risk for infection, morbidity, and mortality from COVID-19. However, health consequences of the pandemic extend far beyond those directly caused by the virus. This scoping review aimed to explore the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health and well-being of PEH in North America and Europe. A systematic search of academic and grey literature was conducted in September 2021. To be included, studies had to include primary data related to the impact of the pandemic on health or well-being of PEH and be written in English. All potentially relevant references were independently screened by two reviewers, and minor conflicts were settled with input of a third reviewer. A total of 96 articles met criteria for inclusion. Data extraction was completed for all included studies, and findings synthesised and presented thematically. Numerous health impacts of the pandemic on PEH were identified, including SARS-CoV-2 infection, morbidity, mortality, and hospitalisation, fear of infection, access to housing, hygiene, PPE, food, as well as mental health, substance use, other health-related outcomes and treatment services. Gaps in the literature relating to persons using alcohol, access to mental health support, and violence were also identified. Implications for future research are discussed.","Corey, Julia, Lyons, James, Oâ€™Carroll, Austin, Stafford, Richie, Ivers, Jo-Hanna","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19063219","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(6):3219, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28434,""
"A Longitudinal Study on Mental Well-Being, Perceived Stress Level and Job-Related Meaningfulness of Austrian Telephone Emergency Service Counselors during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Telephone emergency service (TES) consultants have been challenged even more since the beginning of the pandemic. How the COVID-19 situation and the associated increasing demand for TES services affect the well-being and stress of TES counselors has not been assessed so far. This longitudinal study examined mental well-being (WHO-5), perceived stress level (PSS-10), and experienced job-related meaningfulness (CERES) of TES counselors at two measurement points during the pandemic. From December 2020 to January 2021 (t1), N = 374 counselors were recruited within the Austrian nationwide organization 'TelefonSeelsorge';. From those, N = 108 also participated one year later at t2. Neither well-being nor perceived stress differed significantly between t1 and t2. There was a decrease in job-related meaningfulness (from 5.46 at t1 to 5.34 at t2;p &lt; 0.001). The consultants identified loneliness and mental health as the most common problems of helpline callers at both measurement points. The results confirm a stable level of stress and well-being during the pandemic in TES consultants. However, they also show a slight decrease in perceived job-related meaningfulness. Well-being of counselors should be watched closely, as they are an important part of the psychosocial healthcare system.","Humer, Elke, Pieh, Christoph, Kisler, Ida-Maria, SchimbÃ¶ck, Wolfgang, Schadenhofer, Petra","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19063166","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(6):3166, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28435,""
"Telemedicine in the Management of Patients with Rheumatic Disease during COVID-19 Pandemic: Incidence of Psychiatric Disorders and Fibromyalgia in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis and Psoriatic Arthritis","The management of patients with immuno-rheumatological diseases has profoundly changed during the COVID-19 pandemic and telemedicine has played an important role in the disease follow-up. In addition to monitoring disease activity and any adverse events, especially infectious events, assessing the psychological situation of the patient can be fundamental. Furthermore, COVID-19 has a serious impact on mental health and, since the beginning of the pandemic, a significantly higher incidence of anxiety disorders and depressive symptoms especially in younger people was observed. In this study, we evaluated the incidence of depressive disorders, anxiety, and fibromyalgia (FM) in our patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis during the lockdown period due to the COVID-19 pandemic and we validate the use of telemedicine in the clinical management of these patients. Mental and physical stress during the COVID-19 pandemic can greatly worsen FM symptoms and intensify patients' suffering without a clinical flare of the inflammatory disease for patients affected by rheumatoid arthritis. Telemedicine has allowed us to identify patients who needed a face-to-face approach for therapeutic reevaluation even if not related to a flare of the inflammatory disease. Even if our data does not allow us to draw definitive conclusions regarding the effectiveness of telemedicine as greater than or equal to the standard face-to-face approach, we continue to work by modifying our approach to try to ensure the necessary care in compliance with safety and, optimistically, this tool will become an important part of rheumatic disease management.","Foti, Rosario, Amato, Giorgio, Dal Bosco, Ylenia, Longo, Antonio, Gagliano, Caterina, Falsaperla, Raffaele, Foti, Roberta, Speranza, Sergio, De Lucia, Francesco, Visalli, Elisa","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19063161","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(6):3161, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28436,""
"The Mental Health of Employees with Job Loss and Income Loss during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Mediating Role of Perceived Financial Stress","The COVID-19 outbreak, which was followed by home confinement, is expected to have had profound negative impact on the mental health of people. Associated factors, such as losing jobs and income, can be expected to lead to an increased risk of suffering from psychopathological problems. Therefore, this study was aimed at researching the associations of job and income loss with mental health, as well as the possible mediating role of perceived financial stress during the COVID-19 outbreak. The sample included 2381 Spanish workers who were interviewed right after the first COVID-19 lockdown. Measures were taken for generalized anxiety disorder, panic attacks, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, suicidal thoughts and behaviors, working conditions, sociodemographic variables, and perceived financial stress. Logistic regression models were calculated with psychological variables as outcomes, and with job loss and income loss as predictors. Mediation analyses were performed by adding the financial threat as a mediator. Nineteen point six percent and 33.9% of participants reported having lost their jobs and incomes due to the pandemic, respectively. Only income loss was related to a higher risk of suffering from depression and panic attacks. When adding financial stress as a mediator, the indirect effects of job and income loss on the mental health measures were found to be significant, therefore indicating mediation. These findings pinpoint the vulnerability of this population, and highlight the need for interventional and preventive programs targeting mental health in economic crisis scenarios, such as the current one. They also highlight the importance of implementing social and income policies during the COVID-19 pandemic to prevent mental health problems.","de Miquel, Carlota, DomÃ¨nech-Abella, Joan, Felez-Nobrega, Mireia, CristÃ³bal-NarvÃ¡ez, Paula, Mortier, Philippe, Vilagut, Gemma, Alonso, Jordi, Olaya, Beatriz, Haro, Josep Maria","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19063158","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(6):3158, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28437,""
"The Nine-Item Internet Gaming Disorder Scale (IGDS9-SF): Its Psychometric Properties among Sri Lankan Students and Measurement Invariance across Sri Lanka, Turkey, Australia, and the USA","The prevalence of internet gaming disorders (IGD) is considerably high among youth, especially with the social isolation imposed by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. IGD adversely affects mental health, quality of life, and academic performance. The Internet Gaming Disorder Scale (IGDS9-SF) is designed to detect IGD according to DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. However, inconsistent results are reported on its capacity to diagnose IGD evenly across different cultures. To ensure the suitability of the IGDS9-SF as a global measure of IGD, this study examined the psychometric properties of the IGDS9-SF in a sample of Sri Lankan university students (N = 322, mean age = 17.2 &plusmn;0.6, range = 16&ndash;18 years, 56.5% males) and evaluated its measurement invariance across samples from Sri Lanka, Turkey, Australia, and the USA. Among Sri Lankan students, a unidimensional structure expressed good fit, invariance across different groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, and income), adequate criterion validity (strong correlation with motives of internet gaming, daily gaming duration, and sleep quality), and good reliability (alpha = 0.81). Males and online multiplayers expressed higher IGD levels, greater time spent gaming, and more endorsement of gaming motives (e.g., Social and Coping) than females and offline players. Across countries, the IGDS9-SF was invariant at the configural, metric, and scalar levels, although strict invariance was not maintained. The lowest and highest IGD levels were reported among Turkish and American respondents, respectively. In conclusion, the IGDS9-SF can be reliably used to measure IGD among Sri Lankan youth. Because the scale holds scalar invariance across countries, its scores can be used to compare IGD levels in the studied countries.","Ali, Amira Mohammed, Al-Amer, Rasmieh, Atout, Maha, Ali, Tazeen Saeed, Mansour, Ayman M.

"The Effect of Socio-Demographic Factors in Health-Seeking Behaviors among Bangladeshi Residents during the First Wave of COVID-19","Background: Socio-demographic variability among nations and cultures highly influences health-seeking behavior (HSB) in managing endemic or pandemic diseases. The present study aimed to investigate the influence of socio-demographic factors on HSB among Bangladeshi residents during the first wave of COVID-19. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was performed with Bangladeshi residents (60% male and 40% female;age range: 10&ndash;60 years or above) from May to July 2020. Information was collected from the participants who resided in slum areas or did not have internet access through face-to-face surveys, maintaining spatial distancing and proper preventive measures. A self-reported and structured questionnaire, including socio-demographic and HSB, was undertaken, and the data was analyzed using a convenience sampling method. Finally, among the 947 participants, 20 were selected using a stratified random sampling technique for in-depth-interview (IDI). The linear regression analysis was performed to determine the influence of socio-demographic factors on HSB. Results: Only about 4.2% of respondents did not wear masks, but nearly half of the participants (46.6%) did not use hand gloves. The mean score of HSB was 9.98 (SD = 2.01) out of 16, with a correct overall rate of 62.4%. As per regression analysis, higher HSBs were found among participants who reported older age (&gt;50 years) (9.96 &plusmn;2.45), educated unemployed students (10.1 &plusmn;1.95), higher education (10.5 &plusmn;1.76), and higher-income (10.4 &plusmn;1.59);in contrast, participants living in slum areas (8.18 &plusmn;2.34) and whose source of income was business (8.46 &plusmn;2.04) exhibited lower HSBs. Females, compared to men, showed better HSB in every aspect, apart from online food ordering. Qualitative data showed that the younger generation is more aware because of their access to information and persuaded the older generations to follow health-seeking protocols. The results also showed that some lower-income slum-dwellers have access to information and healthcare through their employers. IDIs also found cultural, religious, and mental-health affect people's adherence to health-seeking guidelines and regulations. Conclusions: The findings suggest that socio-demographic factors significantly influenced HSBs during COVID-19 in the Bangladeshi population. Authorities can use these observations to systematically manage future endemics or pandemics.","Mou, Taslin Jahan, Afroz, Khandaker Anika, Haq, Md.

"Cognitive Impairment in Convalescent COVID-19 Patients Undergoing Multidisciplinary Rehabilitation: The Association with the Clinical and Functional Status","Background. Cognitive impairment has been reported in the aftermath of severe acute respiratory syndrome due to coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We investigated the possible association between cognitive impairment and the main clinical and functional status variables in a cohort of convalescent COVID-19 patients without premorbid diseases potentially affecting cognition. Methods. We consecutively screened for inclusion of convalescent COVID-19 patients referring to a post-acute care facility for pulmonary rehabilitation. All the enrolled patients were assessed for cognitive functions. We also investigated features of psychological distress (anxiety, depression, symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder and quality of life) and cardiac and pulmonary functional status. Results. The 63 enrolled patients (mean age 59.82 &plusmn;10.78, male gender = 47) showed a high frequency of depressive symptoms (76.2%) and anxiety (55.5%), and a high prevalence of symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD, 44.4%). About half of the total sample showed reduced cognitive efficiency (RCE, 44.4%) in the domains of spatial and verbal long-term memory and executive functions. Patients with RCE more frequently showed alteration of blood pressure (BP) circadian rhythm (p = 0.01), higher levels of D-Dimer (p = 0.03), had experienced a severe illness (p = 0.02), had longer disease duration (p = 0.04), more clinically relevant symptoms of PTSD (p = 0.02), more frequent cognitive complaints (p = 0.002), higher anxiety scores (p = 0.01) and lower quality of life (p = 0.02) than patients with normal cognitive efficiency. Conclusions. Our findings indicated a possible association between the RCE after COVID-19 and some cardiological variables, including some indirect measures of a residual autonomic disorder, such as the presence of an altered BP circadian rhythm. Future research studies with large samples are needed to provide valid conclusions.","Moretta, Pasquale, Ambrosino, Pasquale, Lanzillo, Anna, Marcuccio, Laura, Fuschillo, Salvatore, Papa, Antimo, Santangelo, Gabriella, Trojano, Luigi, Maniscalco, Mauro","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10030480","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(3):480, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28440,""
"Impact of COVID-19 First Wave on Psychological and Psychosocial Dimensions: A Systematic Review","A systematic review of the literature investigating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological and psychosocial factors was completed. Published literature was examined using electronic databases to search psychosocial factors such as beliefs and media persuasion, social support, coping, risk perception, and compliance and social distancing;and psychological factors as anxiety, stress, depression, and other consequences of COVID-19 that impacted mental health among the pandemic. A total of 294 papers referring to the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (December 2019&ndash;June 2020) were selected for the review. The findings suggested a general deterioration of mental health, delineating a sort of 'psychological COVID-19 syndrome';, characterized by increased anxiety, stress, and depression, and decreased well-being and sleep quality. The COVID-19 effect on the psychological dimensions of interest was not the same for everyone. Indeed, some socio-demographic variables exacerbated mental health repercussions that occurred due to the pandemic. In particular, healthcare workers and young women (especially those in postpartum condition) with low income and low levels of education have been shown to be the least resilient to the consequences of the pandemic.","Filindassi, Viola, Pedrini, Chiara, Sabadini, Clarissa, Duradoni, Mirko, Guazzini, Andrea","https://doi.org/10.3390/covid2030022","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: COVID; 2(3):273-340, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28441,""
"The Relationship between Acceptance and Sleep&ndash;Wake Quality before, during, and after the First Italian COVID-19 Lockdown","Several studies have reported that the COVID-19 pandemic has had deleterious effects on sleep quality and mood, but the mechanisms underlying these effects are not clearly understood. Recently, it has been shown that the acceptance component of mindfulness reduces anxiety, and, in turn, lower anxiety improves sleep quality. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to assess changes in mindfulness traits, sleep&ndash;wake quality, and general distress, before, during, and after the first COVID-19 wave, testing the model in which acceptance influences sleep through anxiety in each period. A total of 250 participants were recruited before (Pre-Lockdown group: 69 participants, 29 females, 33.04 &plusmn;12.94 years), during (Lockdown group: 78 participants, 59 females, 29.174 &plusmn;8.50 years), and after (After-Lockdown group: 103 participants, 86 females, 30.29 &plusmn;9.46 years) the first Italian lockdown. In each group, self-report questionnaires, assessing mindfulness facets, distress, and sleep&ndash;wake quality, were administered and assessed. The Lockdown group reported lower acceptance and higher depression, while the After-Lockdown group reported lower sleep&ndash;wake quality and higher anxiety. The results of the path analysis confirmed that higher acceptance reduced anxiety and higher anxiety decreased sleep&ndash;wake quality in all groups. Our results confirm that acceptance influences sleep through the mediating role of anxiety.","Fabbri, Marco, Simione, Luca, Martoni, Monica, Mirolli, Marco","https://doi.org/10.3390/clockssleep4010016","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Clocks & Sleep; 4(1):172-184, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28442,""
"Impact of the First COVID Lockdown on Accident- and Injury-Related Pediatric Intensive Care Admissions in Germany&mdash;A Multicenter Study","Children's and adolescents' lives drastically changed during COVID lockdowns worldwide. To compare accident- and injury-related admissions to pediatric intensive care units (PICU) during the first German COVID lockdown with previous years, we conducted a retrospective multicenter study among 37 PICUs (21.5% of German PICU capacities). A total of 1444 admissions after accidents or injuries during the first lockdown period and matched periods of 2017&ndash;2019 were reported and standardized morbidity ratios (SMR) were calculated. Total PICU admissions due to accidents/injuries declined from an average of 366 to 346 (SMR 0.95 (CI 0.85&ndash;1.05)). Admissions with trauma increased from 196 to 212 (1.07 (0.93&ndash;1.23). Traffic accidents and school/kindergarten accidents decreased (0.77 (0.57&ndash;1.02 and 0.26 (0.05&ndash;0.75)), whereas household and leisure accidents increased (1.33 (1.06&ndash;1.66) and 1.34 (1.06&ndash;1.67)). Less neurosurgeries and more visceral surgeries were performed (0.69 (0.38&ndash;1.16) and 2.09 (1.19&ndash;3.39)). Non-accidental non-suicidal injuries declined (0.73 (0.42&ndash;1.17)). Suicide attempts increased in adolescent boys (1.38 (0.51&ndash;3.02)), but decreased in adolescent girls (0.56 (0.32&ndash;0.79)). In summary, changed trauma mechanisms entailed different surgeries compared to previous years. We found no evidence for an increase in child abuse cases requiring intensive care.

"Implications of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Children and Adolescents: Cognitive and Emotional Representations","The present research investigated children and adolescents' explicit and spontaneous representation of the COVID-19 pandemic and their related emotions, cognitions, and coping strategies. We explored the self-reported protective factors and coping mechanisms, in addition to similar attributional emotional experiences, i.e., the ways participants evaluated others' pandemic experiences. Our sample consisted of 155 children and adolescents aged 10 to 13 (M = 10.70, SD = 0.85, 56.1% females). We designed a 12-item survey and analyzed our data using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Our findings suggested that most children and adolescents associated masks with the thought of the novel coronavirus, and the most frequently associated emotion was sadness (45.2%), followed by fear (17.4%). Generally, participants reported a medium level of perceived adverse effects of the pandemic, mainly because their regular physical school classes moved to the online setting. We also found a significant association between children's self-reported levels of harmful effects of the pandemic and perceived adverse effects on their families. Most participants expressed their dissatisfaction concerning online school classes, primarily due to poor online interaction. In our sample, the children and adolescents reported positive thoughts and family relationships as their primary coping mechanisms during the pandemic, suggesting similar perceived coping mechanisms in the others around them. Finally, more than half of the participants considered that the COVID-19 pandemic had no positive effects, while 40% considered the increased time spent with their families the primary positive consequences following the COVID-19 health crisis. Results are discussed regarding their implications concerning healthcare, social, and educational policies.","Maftei, Alexandra, Merlici, Ioan-Alex, Roca, Iulia-Cristina","https://doi.org/10.3390/children9030359","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Children; 9(3):359, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28444,""
"Changes in Health Behaviour and Emotional Well-Being of Pregnant Women During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Latvia","Pregnancy is a vulnerable period of life for changes in physical and mental health, which could be exacerbated by COVID-19. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of COVID-19 on health behaviour and emotional well-being among pregnant women in Latvia. The cross-sectional study included 269 women: pregnant women in the third trimester and women until the 7th day post-partum. The study was conducted between July and October 2020, performed by a trained interviewer. Information regarding demographic, anthropometric data, self-assessment of changes in nutritional habits, daily physical activities, and emotional well-being due to the COVID-19 pandemic was collected. 31.6% reported cooking at home more often and only 10.4% reported eating more often and/or larger portions, 23.2% were going on walks outdoors more often, 32.9% were feeling anxious, insecure about health of themselves and relatives, and 24.8% were lacking communication with friends and family. Latvian women were emotionally more affected than other nationalities (p = 0.015). Overall, women 30+ years of age were more often affected then women aged up to 30 years (p = 0.014). These results suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic had notable impact on health behaviour and emotional well-being in pregnant women in Latvia, especially on women 30+ years of age, who may need more careful counselling.","Rezgale, Roberta, Cauce, Vinita, Bule, Violeta, Piskurjova, Anna, Meija, Laila","https://doi.org/10.2478/prolas-2022-0005","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Proceedings of the Latvian Academy of Sciences; 76(1):30-35, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28445,""

In the current study, we tracked changes in maternal depressive symptoms and children?s behavioral problems from approximately 2 years before the pandemic (T1) to May through August 2020 (T2). Second, we explored maternal hair cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone as predictors of change in maternal depressive symptoms. Mothers (N = 120) reported on maternal and child psychological adjustment at both time points. Hair hormone data were collected in the lab at T1. Results suggest increases in children?s internalizing symptoms from T1 to T2 and that higher levels of CRSs were associated with increased maternal depressive symptoms.

"Approximately in-person in the locked-down home: Approximation, digital ties and maternity amid the COVID-19 lockdown","This article explores strategies and practices of approximation to cope with needs of pregnancy and maternity in the locked-down home at a distinct point in time â€“ the earliest lockdown in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, where, disruption of in-person support, both formally and informally, had implications for new mothers, babies and families. Amid a turn to digital for mental health and related support, it appears, unsurprisingly from the fieldwork, that despite many benefits, the role of technology in this context has been complex, as contexts of use, maternal practices, literacies and the nature of perinatal support required deeply shaped the role technology played amid blanket lockdown restrictions. I explore attempts to â€˜approximateâ€™ in-person ties within the confines of mandatorily digitally mediated interactions by paying attention to the fatigue, materialities and unsettlement of approximation.

"Suicide among Health Care Professionals-An Indian Perspective","Suicide is a global phenomenon that claims a person's life every 40 s. The suicide-mortality rate in India is higher than the worldwide average for health care professionals (HCP). The treatment gap for mental health care is alarming, more than 80% in India which has improved compared to a decade. Among the methods chosen by HCPs for dying by suicide, violent suicide methods are more common. Hanging is the most common means, followed by lethal injection and jumping from a building. Among the medical students and professionals in India, academic stress is the leading cause of suicides, followed by mental illness and harassment. Stressfully long working hours, starvation for long hours, inadequate diet, sleep deprivation, inadequate rest, high levels of personal expectations, knowledge of lethal suicide methods, easy access to potentially fatal drugs, apathy, and fearlessness towards death are some of the contributing factors. Primary preventive measures to minimize suicides in HCPs would be to conduct stress-management workshops at an institutional level, routine mental health check-ups in healthcare institutions, mental-health screening for students enrolling into healthcare courses, and prompt referrals to mental healthcare facilities. In addition, telehealth services or mental health services for medical professionals of India are the need of the hour.","Das, Nishant, Khar, Prerna, Karia, Sagar, Shah, Nilesh","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10020354","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland); 10(2), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28448,""

"[Parental Stress: Psychometric Evaluation of the German Version of the Parental Stress Scale in the General Population]","Parental stress has negative impact on parents and their children. Parental stress may be of special interest for family and child well-being due to Covid-19 pandemic. A reliable and valid assessment of parental stress would be beneficial both in research and clinical practice. The Parental Stress Scale (PSS) is internationally well established as an economic and psychometric valid assessment. It consists of 18 items. The study evaluated the factor structure of the German version of the PSS in a general population (n=386 parents with children&lt;16 years) for the first time. The sample was part of a representative sample (n=2519). The confirmatory factor analysis did not confirm internationally previously reported models. Eliminating one item, the explorative factor analysis suggested a two factor structure with the dimensions ""lack of confident"" and ""worries and strain"". Both subscales showed a good internal consistence (McDonalds Ãâ€°Ã¢â€°Â¥0,87). We observed correlations of the PSS-17 items with family dysfunction and elevated scores for depressive or anxiety symptoms, but not with sociodemographic factors. One conclusion is that the multidimensional construct of parental stress maybe is not comprehensively represented by the PSS. For the use in clinical practice and research this has to be taken into account. Albeit, the German version of the PSS is an economic, reliable and valid assessment. Stress aufgrund von Elternschaft wirkt sich nicht nur negativ auf die Betroffenen selbst, sondern v.Ã¢â‚¬â€°a. auch nachteilig auf die psychische und kÃƒÂ¶rperliche Gesundheit ihrer Kinder aus, was reziprok die Belastung im Sinne eines Teufelskreises erhÃƒÂ¶ht. Elterlicher Stress scheint ein negativer Faktor fÃƒÂ¼r die psychische Gesundheit auch im Rahmen der Covid-19 Pandemie zu sein. Daher kommt einer reliablen und validen Erfassung der elterlichen Stressbelastung sowohl wissenschaftlich als auch klinisch-praktisch eine hohe Bedeutung zu. Die 18 Items umfassende Parental Stress Scale (PSS) ist aufgrund ihrer AnwendungsÃƒÂ¶konomie und soliden psychometrischen Kennwerte international gut etabliert. In dieser Studie wurde die deutsche Version der PSS erstmals an Eltern (n=386) von Kindern unter 16 Jahren aus einer reprÃƒÂ¤sentativen AllgemeinbevÃƒÂ¶lkerungsstichprobe (n=2519) mit einem Fokus auf der Faktorenstruktur teststatistisch evaluiert. Mittels konfirmatorischer Faktorenanalyse konnten die in der internationalen Literatur berichteten Modelle nicht bestÃƒÂ¤tigt werden. Eine explorative Faktorenanalyse legte unter Ausschluss eines Items eine zweifaktorielle LÃƒÂ¶sung mit den Dimensionen Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Mangel an ZufriedenheitÃ¢â‚¬Ëœ sowie Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Sorgen und BelastungenÃ¢â‚¬Ëœ nahe. Beide Subskalen zeigten eine gute interne Konsistenz mit Werten fÃƒÂ¼r McDonalds Ãâ€°Ã¢â€°Â¥0,87. Entgegen den Annahmen fanden sich keine relevanten ZusammenhÃƒÂ¤nge zwischen der um ein Item gekÃƒÂ¼rzten Gesamtskala (PSS-17) einschlieÃƒÅ¸lich der Subskalen und soziodemographischen Merkmalen, jedoch hypothesenkonforme Assoziationen mit familiÃƒÂ¤rer Dysfunktion sowie aktueller DepressivitÃƒÂ¤t und Ãƒâ€žngstlichkeit. Obwohl mit der deutschen Version der PSS Stressbelastung durch Elternschaft anwendungsÃƒÂ¶konomisch, ausreichend reliabel und valide erfasst werden kann, legen die Befunde zur faktoriellen ValiditÃƒÂ¤t nahe, dass das Verfahren der MultidimensionalitÃƒÂ¤t des zugrundeliegenden Konstrukts nur bedingt gerecht wird.

"Self-compassion and savoring buffer the impact of the first year of the COVID-19 on PhD students' mental health","Doctoral students face many challenges that were reinforced by COVID-19-related lockdowns. We assessed this impact over one year on doctoral students' depression, anxiety, stress, well-being, and doctoral engagement. We also investigated the potential protective role of self-compassion and savoring on mental health, well-being, and doctoral engagement. A total of 134 PhD students from several French universities responded to the three-time points of this longitudinal study. The results showed a significant increase in depression, anxiety and stress and a significant decrease in well-being and doctoral engagement during the first year of the pandemic. Self-compassion and savoring predicted lower levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, and higher levels of well-being over time. Savoring alone predicted higher doctoral engagement over time. This study reveals the significant impact of the pandemic year on the mental health of doctoral students, and the relevance of self-compassion and savoring as psychological resources to cope with adversity.

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical student placements in rural Queensland: A survey study","The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted medical students' learning experiences. Students in one Australian Rural Clinical School were surveyed to investigate the impact of disruptions to clinical placements and satisfaction with educational changes implemented as a result of the pandemic. Cross-sectional survey. The University of Queensland Rural Clinical School. Students undertaking one or two years of study at the participating Rural Clinical School in November 2020. A 20-item anonymised survey with questions on personal health and safety, quality of clinical training experience, response to changes in learning and student environment, and progression to completion of the medical degree. The survey was completed by 124 students (76% response rate). Students were satisfied with the changes made to their learning to accommodate the disruptions to health service delivery and placements. Final year students were more satisfied with their learning experiences compared to their third-year counterparts. The Rural Clinical School implemented a range of academic and psychological support strategies which appear to have helped with mitigating mental health concerns experienced by students completing rural placements, who are already prone to experiencing social isolation. Strengthening communication between the academic and health service sectors can improve the quality of learning for medical students on placements.","Martin, McGrail, Fox, Partanen, Kondalsamy-Chennakesavan","https://doi.org/10.1111/ajr.12862","20220314","COVID-19; clinical placements; medical education; rural health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28452,""
"Trauma and US Minority Children and Youth","This paper reviews the literature on the prevalence, risk factors, and effects of traumatic experiences on the mental health outcomes of minority youth in the USA. The USA has an increasing number of children and youth from minority backgrounds. Research reveals that traumatic experiences disproportionately affect minority youth. These experiences include historical/generational trauma, immigration and acculturation stressors, natural and manmade disasters, experiences of discrimination, family violence, and community violence. The COVID-19 pandemic has also disproportionately affected minority youth resulting in illness and hospitalizations. Despite the higher incidence of trauma exposure, minority youth are less likely to access medical and mental health care. These disparities are resulting in increasing rates of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, substance use disorders, and suicide in minority youth. Recognizing and understanding the impact of trauma is critical to the healthy development and successful functioning of minority youth, and to the success of our nation.","Pumariega, Jo, Beck, Rahmani","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-022-01336-1","20220314","Children; Disparities; Mental health; Minority; Race; Trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28453,""
"Initial Impacts of COVID-19 on Sex Life and Relationship Quality in Steady Relationships in Britain: Findings from a Large, Quasi-representative Survey (Natsal-COVID)","Intimate relationships are ubiquitous and exert a strong influence on health. Widespread disruption to them may impact wellbeing at a population level. We investigated the extent to which the first COVID-19 lockdown (March 2020) affected steady relationships in Britain. In total, 6,654 participants aged 18-59Ã‚Â years completed a web-panel survey (July-August 2020). Quasi-representativeness was achieved via quota sampling and weighting. We explored changes in sex life and relationship quality among participants in steady relationships (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 4,271) by age, gender, and cohabitation status, and examined factors associated with deterioration to a lower-quality relationship. A total of 64.2% of participants were in a steady relationship (of whom 88.9% were cohabiting). A total of 22.1% perceived no change in their sex-life quality, and 59.5% no change in their relationship quality. Among those perceiving change, sex-life quality was more commonly reported to decrease and relationship quality to improve. There was significant variation by age; less often by gender or cohabitation. Overall, 10.6% reported sexual difficulties that started/worsened during lockdown. In total, 6.9% reported deterioration to a ""lower quality"" relationship, more commonly those: aged 18-24 and aged 35-44; not living with partner (women only); and reporting depression/anxiety and decrease in sex-life quality. In conclusion, intimate relationship quality is yet another way in which COVID-19 has led to divergence in experience.","Mitchell, Shimonovich, BosÃƒÂ³ PÃƒÂ©rez, Dema, Clifton, Riddell, Copas, Tanton, Macdowall, Bonell, Sonnenberg, Mercer, Field","https://doi.org/10.1080/00224499.2022.2035663","20220314","COVID-19; relationship quality; sex life; sexual satisfaction; social support; steady relationship","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28454,""
"Five-Year Trends in US Children's Health and Well-being, 2016-2020","Ensuring the well-being of the 73 million children in the United States is critical for improving the nation's health and influencing children's long-term outcomes as they grow into adults. To examine recent trends in children's health-related measures, including significant changes between 2019 and 2020 that might be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. Annual data were examined from the National Survey of Children's Health (2016-2020), a population-based, nationally representative survey of randomly selected children. Participants were children from birth to age 17 years living in noninstitution settings in all 50 states and the District of Columbia whose parent or caregiver responded to an address-based survey by mail or web. Weighted prevalence estimates account for probability of selection and nonresponse. Adjusted logistic regression models tested for significant trends over time. Diverse measures pertaining to children's current health conditions, positive health behaviors, health care access and utilization, and family well-being and stressors. A total of 174Ã¢â‚¬Â¯551 children were included (annual rangeÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°21Ã¢â‚¬Â¯599 to 50Ã¢â‚¬Â¯212).

"Telehealth Services for Substance Use Disorders During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Longitudinal Assessment of Intensive Outpatient Programming and Data Collection Practices","The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the rapid transition of many types of substance use disorder (SUD) treatments to telehealth formats, despite limited information about what makes treatment effective in this novel format. This study aims to examine the feasibility and effectiveness of virtual intensive outpatient programming (IOP) treatment for SUD in the context of a global pandemic, while considering the unique challenges posed to data collection during an unprecedented public health crisis. The study is based on a longitudinal study with a baseline sample of 3642 patients who enrolled in intensive outpatient addiction treatment (in-person, hybrid, or virtual care) from January 2020 to March 2021 at a large substance use treatment center in the United States. The analytical sample consisted of patients who completed the 3-month postdischarge outcome survey as part of routine outcome monitoring (n=1060, 29.1% response rate). No significant differences were detected by delivery format in continuous abstinence (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup><sub>2</sub>=0.4, P=.81), overall quality of life (F<sub>2,826</sub>=2.06, P=.13), financial well-being (F<sub>2,767</sub>=2.30, P=.10), psychological well-being (F<sub>2,918</sub>=0.72, P=.49), and confidence in one's ability to stay sober (F<sub>2,941</sub>=0.21, P=.81). Individuals in hybrid programming were more likely to report a higher level of general health than those in virtual IOP (F<sub>2,917</sub>=4.19, P=.01). Virtual outpatient care for the treatment of SUD is a feasible alternative to in-person-only programming, leading to similar self-reported outcomes at 3 months postdischarge. Given the many obstacles presented throughout data collection during a pandemic, further research is needed to better understand under what conditions telehealth is an acceptable alternative to in-person care.","Gliske, Welsh, Braughton, Waller, Ngo","https://doi.org/10.2196/36263","20220314","COVID-19; addiction; addiction treatment; digital health; feasibility study; mental health; outpatient program; patient outcomes; routine outcome monitoring data; substance use disorder; substance use treatment; telehealth; telemedicine; virtual care; virtual health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28456,""
"The impact of physical activity on well-being, lifestyle and health promotion in an era of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 variant","We must recognize the limitations of the current situation and vaccines where SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to transform and spread and need to build strategies to maintain and promote health in adherence to the suggested recommended action of the WHO. The purpose of this review is to examine the literature and latest research on the effects of physical activity (PA) on health in preparation for the SARS-CoV-2 strain and future infectious diseases era. In addition, it provides some general guidelines for actionable PA. We performed a literature search using Scopus, Riss, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar, this review method was a narrative literature review of the available literature and latest literature regarding health and PA-related factors during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, PA suggests opportunities to not only maintain and promote health by strengthening the immune system in an era where the Covid-19 variant is a crisis but also implement opportunities for WB, healthy lifestyles, and long-term health improvement. In particular, maintaining a regular PA routine outdoors or at home could be an important means to lower infection rates and maintain health during the potential impact of the current COVID-19 crisis and future pandemics (i.e., dramatic moments). The clinical relevance of the present review is crucial to understanding the impact of PA on WB, lifestyle, physical and mental health, maintaining regular PA, and important preventive factor to better prepare for the era of Covid-19 variants and similar pandemics in the future as it is emphasized as a prevention strategy and key strategy for continuous health promotion.","So, Kwon","https://doi.org/10.1080/00325481.2022.2052467","20220314","COVID-19; COVID-19 variants; health promotion; immunity; lifestyle modifications","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28457,""

Up to 35% displayed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Although not statistically significant, the trend of depressive and PTSD symptoms worsened over time, especially among females and anaesthetic/surgical trainees, despite subsidence of the pandemic curve. Technicians and anaesthetic/scrub nurses were the at-risk groups with worst psychological outcomes.

"One year of psychiatric presentations to a hospital emergency department during COVID-19","To examine the impact of the first full year of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated restrictions on the volume and nature of psychiatric presentations to an emergency department (ED) in a large academic hospital. Anonymised clinical data on psychiatric presentations to the ED were collected for the 52-week period from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and compared with corresponding 1 year periods in 2019 and 2018. There was a significant increase in psychiatric presentations overall to the ED during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to previous years, in contrast to a reduction in total presentations for all other specialties. There was a marked increase in psychiatric presentations of those below 18 years, and in the 30-39 years and 40-49 years age groups, but a decrease in the 18-29 years group. There was a significant increase in anxiety disorder presentations but a decrease in alcohol related presentations. There was no significant change observed in the rates of presentations for self-harm or suicidal ideation. Psychiatric presentations to the ED have increased during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in contrast to a decrease in presentations for other medical specialties, with this increase being driven by out-of-hours presentations. The fourfold increase in presentations of young people below the age of 18 years to the ED with mental health difficulties is an important finding and suggests a disproportionate burden of psychological strain placed on this group during the pandemic.","Hartnett, Alshurafa, McAndrew, Daly, Alsaffar, Cotter, Cannon, MacHale, Murphy, Barry","https://doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2022.6","20220314","COVID-19; Coronavirus; emergency department; mental health; psychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28459,""

Research participants were recruited using a snowball sampling technique through the social media platform WhatsApp. A total of 482 eligible individuals participated from various locations in Saudi Arabia represented almost all Saudi regions. The questionnaire consisted of seven questions evaluating knowledge, seven gauging attitudes, and 16 questions assessing anxiety and perceived need for mental healthcare services. A modest level of knowledge (59%) was found among the Saudi population sampled about the COVID-19 pandemic, and satisfactory knowledge (&gt;80%) about its preventive measures. Anxiety and stress existed among the participants (79% obsessed with COVID-19), with an 88% approval rate for obtaining mental health services for individuals highly affected by the pandemic. There is a need to increase awareness and provide continuous updates regarding the pandemic situation. Promoting access to mental health services is critical, as well as finding creative and suitable strategies to deliver mental health services to those who need them.","Alanazi, Bahjri","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.801777","20220314","COVID-19 knowledge; attitude; coronvirus-2019 stress and anxiety; knowledge and attitude; mental health perceptions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28461,""
"The Use of Big Data <i>via</i> 5G to Alleviate Symptoms of Acute Stress Disorder Caused by Quarantine Measures","This article investigates the role of Big Data in situations of psychological stress such as during the recent pandemic caused by the COVID-19 health crisis. Quarantine measures, which are necessary to mitigate pandemic risk, are causing severe stress symptoms to the human body including mental health. We highlight the most common impact factors and the uncertainty connected with COVID-19, quarantine measures, and the role of Big Data, namely, how Big Data can help alleviate or mitigate these effects by comparing the <i>status quo</i> of current technology capabilities with the potential effects of an increase of digitalization on mental health. We find that, while Big Data helps in the pre-assessment of potentially endangered persons, it also proves to be an efficient tool in alleviating the negative psychological effects of quarantine. We find evidence of the positive effects of Big Data on human health conditions by assessing the effect of internet use on mental health in 173 countries. We found positive effects in 110 countries with 90 significant results. However, increased use of digital media and exclusive exposure to digital connectivity causes negative long-term effects such as a decline in social empathy, which creates a form of psychological isolation, causing symptoms of acute stress disorder.","Hassani, Komendantova, Unger, Ghodsi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.569024","20220314","5G; COVID-19; big data; mental health; psychological stress; quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28462,""
"How do European Mature Adults and Elderly Perceive SARS-COV-2 and Associated Control Measures? A Cross-Country Analysis of Mental Health Symptoms in June and July 2020","<b>Objectives:</b> Recent literature points out that elderly people are psychologically resilient to COVID-19, but the studies were performed in specific contexts. We measured the link between the worsening of mental health symptoms, the epidemiologic situation, and control measures among European people aged 50 or older. <b>Methods:</b> We used data from the 2020 wave of SHARE, merged with Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker data (<i>n</i> = 38,358). We modeled the risk of worsening of depression, anxiety, sleeping trouble, and loneliness symptoms' self-perception, as functions of control measures and 7-days death incidence, using logistic regressions. <b>Results:</b> The worsening of anxiety and depression perception were more common (16.2 and 23.1%, respectively), compared to that of sleeping troubles and loneliness (8.1 and 11.5%, respectively). The worsening of depression and anxiety perception was negatively related to the rigor of control measures. The seven-days death incidence was positively linked to all symptoms except sleeping troubles. <b>Conclusion:</b> Older people were the most exposed to death risk and were affected psychologically by the COVID-19 epidemiological situation; yet control measures were protective (or neutral) to their mental health condition.","Perelman, Xavier, Barros","https://doi.org/10.3389/ijph.2022.1604218","20220314","COVID-19; Europe; control measures; mature adults; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28463,""

"Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices Among the General Population During the Later Stage of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Malaysia: A Cross-Sectional Study","A different pattern of mental health issues was reported during the later stage of the COVID-19 pandemic; however, few studies have examined Malaysians' knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) prevalent during this time. A nationwide online cross-sectional study was conducted in Malaysia from June 1, 2021 to June 14, 2021, ie, 18-months from the first reported COVID-19 case in the country. Citizens aged 18 years and above were recruited by means of the snowball sampling method. ANOVA, Pearson correlation, and linear regression tests were used. Of the 2168 respondents, most were young adults (62.7%), females (62.4%), tertiary educated individuals (84%), non-health care workers (85.9%), and individuals who knew someone diagnosed with COVID-19 (75.2%). The mean score for knowledge was 10.0 Ã‚Â± 1.52 (maximum score = 12); correct response rate for each question ranged from 54.2% to 99%. The mean score in terms of attitude was 1.3 Ã‚Â± 0.85 (maximum score = 2); 68.7% respondents agreed that control over COVID-19 would finally be achieved; and 62.3% believed that Malaysia could conquer COVID-19. The mean score for practices was 5.1 Ã‚Â± 1.10 (maximum score = 6); 81.5%, 88.1%, and 74.1% respondents avoided crowded places, confined spaces, and conversations in close physical proximity, respectively. Furthermore, 94.2% wore masks when leaving home; 89.0% practiced hand hygiene; and 83.8% adhering to COVID-19 warnings. Small but significant correlations were found between knowledge and attitude (<i>r</i> = 0.078, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) as well as between knowledge and practices (<i>r</i> = 0.070, <i>p</i> = 0.001). Malaysians exhibited sound knowledge but negative attitudes and inadequate practices pertaining to COVID-19 during the pandemic's later stage. At this phase, unlike at the early stage, the public's sound knowledge ensured little improvement in their attitudes and practices. Therefore, health education at the later pandemic stage should focus on promoting positive attitudes and developing better practices.","Chai, Ng, Chua, Tung, Sindeh, Ibrahim, Badlishah Sham, Tan","https://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S349798","20220314","COVID-19 pandemic; attitude; knowledge; late pandemic; pandemic fatigue; practices","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28465,""
"Psychological impact of COVID-19 restrictions among individuals at risk of exercise addiction and their socio-demographic correlates: A Saudi Arabian survey study","Exercise addiction (EA) has been described as a condition of psychological dysfunction characterized by excessive and obsessive exercise patterns, show withdrawal symptoms when unable to exercise, and experience numerous conflicts and other negative consequences in their social and professional lives, due to the extremely high volumes of exercise. The main objective of the present study was to assess the risk of exercise addiction among a Saudi Arabian sample of regular exercisers and to investigate possible associations between their inability to exercise during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown (due to the closure of public gyms, swimming pools, and health clubs) and depression, anxiety, and loneliness. A total of 388 regular-exercising Saudis participated in an online cross-sectional survey over three months (December to February 2021). The study sample comprised 89.9% (males) and 10.1% (females), with a mean age of 28.59Ã‚Â years (SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.69). A 36-item online self-report survey was used for data collection. The prevalence of being at risk of exercise addiction among participants of the present study was 13.1%. Positive significant associations were noted between risk of exercise addiction and depression (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.41; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°<i>.</i>01), risk of exercise addiction and anxiety (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.20; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°<i>.</i>01), and risk of exercise addiction and loneliness (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.17; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°<i>.</i>01). The findings of the present study suggest that those individuals at risk of exercise addiction might also be at an elevated risk of developing negative psychological impact owing to the disruption of the amount of exercise engaged in due to COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions and therefore these high-risk individuals should receive appropriate psychological support to help them overcome the negative impact of the ongoing pandemic.

"Self-compassion and mindful parenting among postpartum mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic: The role of depressive and anxious symptoms","Self-compassion is an important psychological skill that may facilitate the adoption of a mindful way of parenting, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the association between these constructs may be explained by several variables, such as maternal psychopathological symptoms, with a well-established interference in parenting. This study aimed to compare mothers who experienced and mothers who did not experience a negative emotional impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on self-compassion, mindful parenting, postpartum depressive symptoms (PPDS) and postpartum anxious symptoms (PPAS). We also explored whether mothers' self-compassion was associated with mindful parenting and whether this relationship may be mediated by PPDS and PPAS. A sample of 977 Portuguese mothers of infants aged between zero and six months completed an online survey between December 2020 and January 2021, a period of major pandemic-related restrictions. The survey included several self-report questionnaires that assessed sociodemographic, clinical, and COVID-19 information, self-compassion, mindful parenting, PPDS and PPAS. Mothers who reported having felt that the pandemic had a negative emotional impact during their postpartum period (79.5%) presented lower levels of self-compassion and mindful parenting, and higher levels of PPDS and PPAS. Regarding the mediation model, higher levels of self-compassion were related to higher levels of mindful parenting, and this association was mediated by lower levels of PPAS. These results highlight the relevance of mothers' self-compassion for helping them feel less anxious and to adopt a mindful way of parenting in the postpartum period, particularly during the pandemic. Compassion-based interventions may be particularly important in reducing PPAS and promoting mindful parenting and should be available to postpartum mothers, especially during, but also beyond the pandemic.","Fernandes, Canavarro, Moreira","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-02959-6","20220314","Anxious symptoms; COVID-19 pandemic; Depressive symptoms; Mindful parenting; Postpartum period; Self-compassion","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28467,""
"Neurocognitive and psychiatric post-coronavirus disease 2019 conditions: pathogenic insights of brain dysfunction following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), can trigger a myriad of neuropsychiatric manifestations. As a 2-year-old disease (at the writing of this manuscript), its long-term cognitive and neuropsychiatric implications, known as post-COVID-19 conditions, are incompletely recognized and mechanistically obscure. Fatigue, anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and cognitive dysfunction are reported more frequently in COVID-19 survivors than in matching, non-COVID-19 population. Risk factors are unclear, including comorbidities, age at COVID-19 onset, or disease severity; women, however, have been reported to be at increased risk than men. Although the frequency of these symptoms decreases over time, at least one in five will have persistent cognitive and neuropsychiatric manifestations one year after recovering from COVID-19. Neurocognitive and psychiatric post-COVID-19 long-term conditions are frequent and complex multifactorial sequelae. Several acute and chronic factors such as hypoxemia, cerebral thrombotic and inflammatory endothelial damage, and disruption of the blood-brain barrier (leading to parenchymal translocation of pro-inflammatory molecules, cytokines, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes) are involved, leading to microglial activation and astrogliosis. As an evolving topic, evidence derived from prospective studies will expand our understanding of post-COVID-19 these long-term outcomes.","GarcÃƒÂ­a-Grimshaw, Sankowski, ValdÃƒÂ©s-Ferrer","https://doi.org/10.1097/WCO.0000000000001046","20220314","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28468,""
"Mechanisms of coronavirus infectious disease 2019-related neurologic diseases","As of January 8, 2022, a global pandemic caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2, a new RNA virus, has resulted in 304,896,785 cases in over 222 countries and regions, with over 5,500,683 deaths (www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). Reports of neurological and psychiatric symptoms in the context of coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) range from headache, anosmia, and dysgeusia, to depression, fatigue, psychosis, seizures, delirium, suicide, meningitis, encephalitis, inflammatory demyelination, infarction, and acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy. Moreover, 30-50% of COVID-19 survivors develop long-lasting neurologic symptoms, including a dysexecutive syndrome, with inattention and disorientation, and/or poor movement coordination. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA within the central nervous system (CNS) of patients is rare, and mechanisms of neurological damage and ongoing neurologic diseases in COVID-19 patients are unknown. However, studies demonstrating viral glycoprotein effects on coagulation and cerebral vasculature, and hypoxia- and cytokine-mediated coagulopathy and CNS immunopathology suggest both virus-specific and neuroimmune responses may be involved. This review explores potential mechanistic insights that could contribute to COVID-19-related neurologic disease. While the development of neurologic diseases during acute COVID-19 is rarely associated with evidence of viral neuroinvasion, new evidence suggests SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein exhibits direct inflammatory and pro-coagulation effects. This, in conjunction with immune dysregulation resulting in cytokine release syndrome (CRS) may result in acute cerebrovascular or neuroinflammatory diseases. Additionally, CRS-mediated loss of blood-brain barrier integrity in specific brain regions may contribute to the expression of proinflammatory mediators by neural cells that may impact brain function long after resolution of acute infection. Importantly, host co-morbid diseases that affect vascular, pulmonary, or CNS function may contribute to the type of neurologic disease triggered by SARS-COV-2 infection. Distinct effects of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and CNS compartment- and region-specific responses to CRS may underlie acute and chronic neuroinflammatory diseases associated with COVID-19.","Klein","https://doi.org/10.1097/WCO.0000000000001049","20220314","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28469,""

"COVID-19, violence, and mental health among Indigenous gay and bisexual men in Guatemala: An urgent call from key stakeholders","We explored how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the health and wellbeing of Indigenous gay and bisexual men (GBM) in Guatemala, a group that experiences intersectional stigma and structural barriers to health. Between February and May 2021, we conducted in-depth qualitative interviews via Zoom with key stakeholders (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°11) working with Indigenous GBM throughout Guatemala. We coded thematically and conducted narrative analysis to identify the most salient themes. Participants described that prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, many Indigenous GBM migrated to urban centres to avoid stigma and violence from families and rural communities. After the onset of COVID-19, many Indigenous GBM lost their jobs and were forced to move back in with families. For Indigenous GBM who returned, participants described a perceived increase in the severity of physical and psychological violence. Participants attributed this increase in severity to retribution from families and communities for having left. Most Indigenous GBM-serving organisations reported a drastic increase in demand for mental health services. Organisations serving Indigenous GBM have an urgent need to scale up their mental health services and find innovative ways to provide these services remotely during the pandemic and beyond. Technology-based mental health interventions that require little 'live' interaction may be appropriate.","Davis, Orellana, Estrada-Villalta, Brouwer","https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2022.2049844","20220314","Covid-19; gay and bisexual men; indigenous; mental health; violence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28471,""
"Addressing the relevance of COVID-19 pandemic in nature and human socio-economic fate","COVID-19 or Coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) is a pandemic calamity that has locked people in their own houses. The effect of SARS-COV-2 disease has caused a decrease in the economy as businesses, transportation, aviation, and industries have been halted. Many people have died, and many are trying to survive this pandemic. As we all know, the virus of SARS-COV-2 can be transmitted through physical contact, and the government has taken up specific measures like closing up schools and colleges, closing up malls/markets/public places, and imposing lockdown in cities. It is expected that these measures can result in a decreased infection rate. On the one hand, SARS-COV-2 Has halted economic or developmental growth, but on the other hand, our nature i. e. our earth, is being provided with such conditions that it can restore its losses. Air quality has been improved in the lock down time. The emission level of different gases and particulate matters have slowed down in the Covid period. Water bodies have been clean and more transparent and propagate wildlife and fisheries. Due to the SARS-COV-2 lockdown, businesses and industries have halted, impacting the financial needs of many people around the world. The worry about surviving this pandemic and the financial crisis leads them to mental and emotional distress.

"The Fear of Contagion and the Attitude Toward the Restrictive Measures Imposed to Face COVID-19 in Italy: The Psychological Consequences Caused by the Pandemic OneÃ¢â‚¬â€°Year After It Began","The pandemic nature of COVID-19 has caused major changes in health, economy, and society globally. Albeit to a lesser extent, contingent access to shops and places to socialize the imposition of social distancing and the use of indoor masks is measures still in force today (more than a year after the start of the pandemic), with repercussions on economic, social, and psychological levels. The fear of contagion, in fact, has led us to be increasingly suspicious and to isolate ourselves from the remainder of the community. This has had repercussions on the perception of loneliness, with significant psychological consequences, such as the development of stress, anxiety, and, in extreme cases, depressive symptoms. Starting from these assumptions, this research was developed with the aim of deepening the perceptions that the participants have of their own mental health, loneliness, fear linked to contagion, and attitudes toward imposed social distancing. In particular, we wanted to analyze whether there is a relationship between perceived fear and the perceived level of mental health, loneliness, and attitude toward social distancing. Finally, we wanted to analyze whether there are differences related to gender, age, marital status, current working mode, and educational qualifications. The research, performed after the diffusion of the vaccination in Italy, lasted 14Ã¢â‚¬â€°days. The participants were 500 Italians who voluntarily joined the study and were recruited with random cascade sampling. The research followed a quantitative approach. The analyzed data, from participants residing throughout the national territory, allow us to return the picture of the perceptions that Italians have of the fear of contagion, of their level of mental health, of loneliness and of their attitude toward social distancing. In particular, the data show that fear of COVID-19 is an emotional state experienced by the entire population and that young people have suffered more from loneliness and have been less inclined to accept the imposed social distancing. The data that emerged should make policymakers reflect on the need to find functional strategies to combat COVID-19 or other health emergency crises whose effects do not affect the psychological wellbeing of the population.","Rania, Coppola","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.805706","20220314","COVID-19; Italy; fear of contagion; loneliness; mental health; psychological impact; social distance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28473,""

Participants were asked to report their current psychosocial adaptation status during the COVID-19 pandemic, and data were collected via online questionnaires during a relatively severe period of COVID-19 in China. Results of the multi-group path analysis indicated that the effect of perceived social support on mental health problems was mediated by PsyCap for young adolescents, but not for emerging adults.

"Facing the Pandemic in Italy: Personality Profiles and Their Associations With Adaptive and Maladaptive Outcomes","The negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals' psychosocial functioning was widely attested during the last year. However, the extent to which individual differences are associated with adaptive and maladaptive outcomes during quarantine in Italy remains largely unexplored. Using a person-oriented approach, the present study explored the association of personality profiles, based on three broad individual dispositions (i.e., positivity, irritability, and hostile rumination) and two self-efficacy beliefs in the emotional area (i.e., expressing positive emotions and regulating anger emotion), with adaptive and maladaptive outcomes during the first Italian lockdown (March-June 2020). In doing so, we focused also on how different age groups (i.e., young adults and adults) differently faced the pandemic. The study was conducted through an online survey from May to June 2020 and included 1341 participants living in Italy, divided into two groups: 737 young adults aged 18-35 and 604 adults aged 36-60 years old. Latent Profile Analysis identified three personality profiles: resilient, vulnerable, and moderate. A subsequent path analysis model showed that the resilient profile was positively associated with prosocial behavior as an indicator of adaptive outcome, and negatively associated with three maladaptive outcomes: interpersonal aggression, depressive symptoms, and anxiety problems. Contrarily, the vulnerable profile resulted negatively associated with prosocial behavior and positively associated with the three maladaptive outcomes. Finally, regarding age group differences, young adults belonging to the vulnerable profile showed a greater association especially with interpersonal aggression, depression, and anxiety problems, as compared to adults belonging to the same profile. Overall, the results of the present study highlighted the importance to analyze individual functioning during an isolation period by using a person-oriented approach. Findings evidenced the existence of three different profiles (i.e., Resilient, Vulnerable, and Moderate) and subsequent path analysis revealed, especially for the vulnerable profile and young adults, a greater maladaptive consequence of the quarantine. The practical implications will be discussed.","Cirimele, Pastorelli, Favini, Remondi, Zuffiano, Basili, Thartori, Gerbino, Gregori","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.805740","20220314","COVID-19 quarantine; anxiety problems; depressive symptoms; interpersonal aggression; person-oriented approach; prosocial behavior; young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28475,""

Data were collected from a sample of 961 residents in Wuhan in China using a questionnaire survey. The results show that residents' PA intention and behavior have been affected significantly by residents' PA attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. The COVID-19 pandemic has a significant impact on both residents' PA intention and behavior. In addition, there were gender and region differences in this impact. The findings are of great significance in promoting residents' PA intention and PA behavior, which are of positive significance to the development of residents' physical and mental health in the period of global serious health crisis.","Cheng, Chen","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.760702","20220314","COVID-19; behavior; global public health event; intention; physical activity; theory of planned behavior (TPB)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28476,""
"Quality of Life and Depressive Symptoms Among Peruvian University Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic","To determine the factors associated with quality of life and depressive symptoms in Peruvian university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multicentre study in 1,634 students recruited by convenience sampling. The quality of life (QoL) was assessed with the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions at three levels (EQ-5D-3L) and depressive symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). To assess factors associated with QoL and depressive symptoms, linear regressions and fitted regressions were used, with robust coefficients of variance information (ÃŽÂ²). A 345 (21.1%) reported problems in performing daily activities, 544 (33.3%) reported pain and discomfort, 772 (47.2%) were moderately/very anxious or depressed. Furthermore, 207 (12.7%) had moderate-severe and severe depressive symptoms. Men reported better QoL than women (ÃŽÂ²: 3.2; 95% CI: 1.1, 5.4; <i>p</i> = 0.004) and fewer depressive symptoms (ÃŽÂ²: -0.7; 95% CI: -1.3, -0.2; <i>p</i> = 0.011). Ayacucho's residents had more depressive symptoms than Ancash's residents (ÃŽÂ²: 0.8; 95% CI: 0.1, 1.5; <i>p</i> = 0.022) and Piura's residents had fewer depressive symptoms than Ancash's residents (ÃŽÂ²: -1.195% CI: -1.8, -0.3, <i>p</i> = 0.005). Students who left home during quarantine reported more depressive symptoms (ÃŽÂ²: 0.7, 95% CI: 0.2, 1.2, <i>p</i> = 0.006). Problems performing daily activities, pain and discomfort, as well as mild to severe depressive symptoms were found in more than three-quarters of the sample.

"Common mental disorders amongst frontline healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia: A cross-sectional study","A novel coronavirus had a profound physiological and psychological burden with regards to contracting the disease or uncertainties in the care of infected patients. Especially, at risk are frontline healthcare workers who are participating in the care of such patients. This study investigated the burden of mental health problems amongst the frontline health workers during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Ethiopia. East Hararghe Zone of Oromia Region and Harari Regional State, Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was conducted in three selected hospitals of COVID-19 treatment centers. Simple random sampling was used to select a sample of 423 participants from each hospital. The self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) was used to assess the presence of common mental disorders. Binary and multivariable logistic regressions were fitted to identify factors associated with common mental disorders. Statistical significance was declared at a p-value less than 0.05. The prevalence of common mental disorders amongst frontline healthcare workers was 22.6%. Being female, married, having had direct contact with COVID-19 patients, working in COVID-19 treatment centers and ICU, having any symptoms of COVID-19, current three-month use of any substances, and poor social support were found to be strong predictors of common mental disorders in frontline health workers during COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia. The considerable proportions of frontline health care workers have common mental health problems.

"Promotive factors associated with internalising symptoms amongst college students during the COVID-19 lockdown in Enugu metropolis, Nigeria","The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a high burden of psychological distress amongst adolescents. This study aimed to evaluate associations of personal strengths including resilience and social support with internalising symptoms amongst college students during the lockdown in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study population included students from senior and junior college classes in public schools in Enugu metropolis, Nigeria. A school-based cross-sectional study design was employed for the study. A two-stage sampling technique was used to select 496 students (mean age = 16.5, s.d. = 1.9 years; 52.2% female) in six out of 33 public colleges in Enugu metropolis, Nigeria during the lockdown period occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic. Validated questionnaires assessing anxiety, depression, resilience and social support were used to collect information. Most of the students reported depressive symptoms, whilst just over a third of the sample reported anxiety or both depressive and anxiety symptoms. Chi-square and logistic regression analyses revealed that being male and reporting higher levels of social support and the ability to bounce back from stress were associated with less anxiety. Being younger and reporting a moderate level of support were associated with more depressive symptoms, whilst the ability to bounce back was associated with fewer depressive symptoms. Good social support and the ability to bounce back from stress were linked to lower levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms amongst college adolescents during the lockdown in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic despite high prevalence rates.","Chinawa, Aronu, Ossai, Chinawa","https://doi.org/10.4102/sajpsychiatry.v28i0.1672","20220314","COVID-19; anxiety symptoms; college adolescents; depressive symptoms; resilience, Enugu metropolis, Nigeria; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28479,""
"Evaluating the efficacy of an online depression screening tool in South Africa: A pilot study","A global increase of 16% in depression rates from 1990 to 2019 highlights the alarming situation in relation to increase in depression. Research has indicated that this rate is likely to increase as a result of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In South Africa, the depression life-time prevalence rate is 9.47%. However, the lack of access to mental healthcare services leads to people not receiving much needed information and care. The growing accessibility to the Internet for South Africans offers a solution for the screening and access to self-help information for depression. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD)-R was adapted for online usage and a website, mddsa.co.za, was piloted in this regard. This study reports on the efficacy of the online adapted CESD-R for use in South Africa by reporting on the reliability and criterion validity as well as the user friendliness of the website and the appropriateness of the instant feedback provided. The study was conducted in South Africa during COVID lockdown level 1 and 2. This study followed a quantitative, cross-sectional research design. A convenience sample of 21 individuals, above the age of 18, with a depression diagnosis and 86 individuals with no mental health diagnosis participated in the study. Participants accessed the screening instrument online at the website. Internal consistency reliability coefficients exceeded 0.80. T-test and sensitivity and specificity results attested to the accuracy of the tool. All items contributed well to the instrument, including the items that were culturally specific to South Africa. Feedback from participants indicated that the tool was easily comprehensible, the website was user friendly and the instant feedback provided was appropriate. The online adapted CESD-R evidenced excellent reliability and criterion validity and was able to accurately screen for depression amongst South Africans. The website and the tool have the potential to be utilised to increase access to a screening instrument for individuals who display symptoms of depression and to enhance the opportunity for individuals to practise self-help.","Hassem","https://doi.org/10.4102/sajpsychiatry.v28i0.1687","20220314","criterion validity; depression; online screening; reliability; sensitivity; specificity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28480,""
"A Modified LSTM Framework for Analyzing COVID-19 Effect on Emotion and Mental Health during Pandemic Using the EEG Signals","COVID-19, a WHO-declared public health emergency of worldwide concern, is quickly spreading over the world, posing a physical and mental health hazard. The COVID-19 has resulted in one of the world's most significant worldwide lockdowns, affecting human mental health. In this research work, a modified Long Short-Term Memory (MLSTM)-based Deep Learning model framework is proposed for analyzing COVID-19 effect on emotion and mental health during the pandemic using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The participants of this study were volunteers that recovered from COVID-19. The EEG dataset of 40 people is collected to predict emotion and mental health. The results of the MLSTM model are also compared with the other literature classifiers.

"Perceived Stress and Psychological Impact Among Healthcare Workers at a Tertiaty Hospital in China During the COVID-19 Outbreak: The Moderating Role of Resilience and Social Support","To investigate the psychological distress experienced by healthcare workers (HCWs) at a tertiary hospital in Changzhou, China, outside Wuhan, during the early stage of COVID-19 and evaluate the moderating effects of resilience and social support on the relationship between stress and psychological distress. The study was conducted between February 10 and 15, 2020, in a non-probabilistic way. The survey included questions regarding the risk of exposure, sociodemographics, perceived stress [10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10)], resilience [10-item Connor-Davidson Psychological Resilience (CD-RISC-10)], social support [Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS)], and psychological distress [12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12)]. We applied the PROCESS macro for SPSS to test the hypotheses that resilience and social support moderated the stress response. In addition, a simple slope analysis was conducted when the interaction effect was statistically significant. Some 33.6% of participants suffered from psychological distress (GHQ-12 Ã¢â€°Â¥ 12). Perceived stress was positively related to psychological distress (<i>r</i> = 0.42, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). In addition, resilience (ÃŽâ€R<sup>2</sup> = 0.03, <i>p</i> for interaction &lt; 0.001) and social support (ÃŽâ€R<sup>2</sup> = 0.01, <i>p</i> for interaction &lt;0.01) moderated the stress response. The impact of perceived stress on psychological distress was attenuated when subjects who were resilient (high ÃŽÂ² = 0.15, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001; low ÃŽÂ² = 0.36, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and perceived stress had less impact on psychological distress when social support was high (ÃŽÂ² = 0.24, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) rather than low (ÃŽÂ² = 0.34, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The cross-sectional design led to a lack of causal relationships between variables. Our data showed that resilience and social support moderated the stress response among HCWs in the pandemic, suggesting that improving resilience and social support could be appropriate targets to improve HCWs' mental health in the pandemic.","Zhang, Dong, Meng, Chen, Cao, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.570971","20220314","2019 novel coronavirus disease; healthcare workers; perceived stress; psychological distress; resilience; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28482,""
"Panic, Psycho-Behavioral Responses, and Risk Perception in the Earliest Stage of the COVID-19 Pandemic in China","Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19), a rising global pandemic, has triggered psychological crises among the public. Panic, a severe symptom of mental disorders, is increasing in the public in China and it is urgent to provide research for intervention development. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of public panic in China during the earliest stage of the COVID-19 pandemic and to explore the associated psychological behavioral responses and public's risk perception of the pandemic. A cross-sectional study using a web-based survey with convenience sampling was conducted with 2,484 participants nationally from February 11 to February 24, 2020 in China. A self-developed questionnaire was applied to assess the prevalence of public panic and its associated factors. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was applied to assess the risk and protective factors of public panic. There were 23.39% (581/2,484) of the participants who reported experiencing panic during the earliest stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Taking temperature repeatedly, being nervous in a crowd, being suspicious of infection in the family, being worried about the future, and worries about high infectivity of the COVID-19, lack of effective therapies, and wide impact of the COVID-19 pandemic increased the odds of public panic. Whereas, avoiding gatherings during holidays was negatively associated with the odds of public panic. Psycho-behavioral responses were closely associated with public panic during the earliest stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Defusing excessive health-related worries, the guidance of appropriate self-protective behaviors, strengthening of health education in communities, and available treatment for mental disorders should be adopted to monitor the psychological responses and to guide the behaviors of the public.","Zhang, Zou, Sznajder, Cui, Fu, He, Peng, Chen, Yang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2022.766842","20220314","COVID-19; behavior; mental health; online survey; panic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28483,""
"Trauma-Informed Care for Hospitalized Adolescents","Exposure to trauma accelerates during the adolescence, and due to increased behavioral and psychiatric vulnerability during this developmental period, traumatic events during this time are more likely to cause a lasting impact. In this article, we use three case studies of hospitalized adolescents to illustrate the application of trauma-informed principles of care with this unique population. Adolescents today are caught in the crosshairs of two syndemics-racism and other structural inequities and the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased hospitalizations and mental health diagnoses during the past two years signal toxic levels of stress affecting this group. Trauma-informed care promotes health, healing, and equity. This concept of the ""trauma-informed approach"" is still novel; through examples and practice, providers can learn to universally apply the trauma-informed care framework to every patient encounter to address the harmful effects of trauma and promote recovery and resilience.","Fialkowski, Shaffer, Ball-Burack, Brooks, Trinh, Potter, Peeler","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40124-022-00262-3","20220314","Adolescent; Adverse childhood experiences; Feeding and eating disorders; Hospitalized; Patient-centered care; Suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28484,""
"A Cross-Sectional Study of the Relationship Between Exercise, Physical Activity, and Health-Related Quality of Life Among Japanese Workers","Studies have determined that exercise and physical activity positively affect physical and mental health, and that healthy workers contribute to increased work performance. The relationship between the time spent on exercise during leisure time and physical activity, including work, with health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in workers is unclear, with variations observed between occupational types. This cross-sectional study examined these associations among Japanese workers from various occupations during the COVID-19 pandemic. An Internet-based national health survey-Collaborative Online Research on Novel-coronavirus and Work-study (CORoNaWork study)-was conducted among 33,087 Japanese workers in December 2020. After excluding invalid responses, 27,036 participants were categorized into four and five groups according to exercise and physical activity time, respectively. Each group's scores were compared on each of the four questions on the Japanese version of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Health-Related Quality of Life (CDC HRQOL-4) using generalized linear models. Age-sex adjusted and multivariate models were used to compare each index of the CDC HRQOL-4. Compared to the reference category (almost never), any level of exercise (ORs 0.56-0.77) and physical activity (ORs 0.93-0.88) were associated with better self-rated health in the multivariate model. Any exercise was also associated with significantly reduced odds for physically or mentally unhealthy days; however, high levels of physical activity (Ã¢â€°Â¥120 min/day) were associated with significantly increased odds for these outcomes (ORs = 1.11 and 1.16, respectively). The results suggest that exercise habits are more critical to workers' HRQOL than physical activity. Interventions that encourage daily exercise even for a short time are likely to be associated with better workers' health and work performance.","Sugano, Ikegami, Eguchi, Tsuji, Tateishi, Nagata, Matsuda, Fujino, Ogami","https://doi.org/10.3389/fspor.2022.809465","20220314","exercise; health-related quality of life; physical activity; self-rated health; worker","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28485,""
"A Longitudinal Nationwide Study of Psychological Distress During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Chile","Despite numerous efforts to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, there are few longitudinal studies that examine the change in the burden of psychological distress over time and its associated factors, especially in developing countries. The primary aim of this study was to assess the levels of psychological distress at two time points during the COVID-19 outbreak based on a representative community sample in Chile. The secondary aim was to identify groups that are more vulnerable to psychological distress during the pandemic. A nationally representative, longitudinal telephone survey of Chilean adults was conducted. This study analyses panel data from two waves in 2020: May 30 to June 10 and September 15 to October 9. A total of 823 people participated in both surveys. Changes in mental health outcomes (anxiety and depressive symptoms) were assessed, estimating the effect of demographic characteristics, psychosocial and economic factors, household conditions, and health status. There was a significant increase in psychological distress (PHQ-4 Ã¢â€°Â¥ 6) between Waves 1 (22.6%) and 2 (27.0%), especially among younger participants. Overall, the results of this study show that being female, living in or near the capital, living in overcrowded households and having a perceived lack of space in the home, loneliness or perceived social isolation, and having received mental health treatment within the last year are significantly associated with psychological distress over time (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05).

"Mental Health Differences in Healthcare Workers Exposed to Different Risks During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a significant impact on the physical and mental health of healthcare workers. This study assessed the psychological status of healthcare workers who were exposed to different risk-levels in China and explored the factors that affected their mental health. Demographic, occupational characteristics, and mental health measurements were collected from 810 workers in 41 hospitals in China, through online questionnaires from February 11 to March 3, 2020. The degree of symptoms for fatigue, anxiety, and insomnia were assessed using the Chinese versions of the Fatigue Severity Scale, 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, and Insomnia Severity Index, respectively. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health symptoms. All 810 participants completed the relevant questionnaires without missing data. The prevalence of fatigue, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms was 74.3, 73.7, and 61.7%, respectively. Nurses, women, and workers exposed to high-risk areas were more likely to report mental health problems (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). After controlling for confounders, exposure to high-risk areas was independently associated with increased symptoms of fatigue, anxiety, and insomnia (fatigue among high-risk areas: OR, 3.87; 95% CI, 2.26-6.61; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001; anxiety among high-risk areas: OR, 2.66; 95% CI, 1.58-4.51; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001; insomnia among high-risk areas: OR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.68-4.79, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). The study demonstrated significant differences in psychological symptoms among healthcare workers exposed to different levels of risk, and those in high-risk areas were more vulnerable to experiencing mental health symptoms.

"A Qualitative Content Analysis of Online Public Mental Health Resources for COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has far reaching potential public mental health impacts and is linked to higher levels of depression and anxiety. To address these in part, online information resources acted as mass interventions. It is vital to explore the content of these interventions, to consider the framing of the pandemic and to examine the extent to which their content is relevant. In March 2020, a qualitative content analysis was undertaken of 39 easily accessible online resources that offered advice, tips or guidance relating to mental health or mental wellbeing and COVID-19. Their content was compared to subsequent reports of the mental health impact of the pandemic. Resources frequently focused on anxiety. The content of intervention was typically of a cognitive-behavioral nature, with a significant focus on maintaining social contact. Typically, distress related to the situation was normalized and stigmatizing language was not seen. Data revealed a significant impact of the pandemic on depression as well as anxiety measures in the general UK population. A key recommendation is to ensure both depression and anxiety are addressed in these public mental health resources.","Martin, Oliver","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.553158","20220314","COVID-19; information quality; mass intervention; mental health; online health information; online intervention; qualitative","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28488,""
"Protocol for a mixed methods process evaluation of the Promoting Resilience in Nurses (PRiN) trial","Mental health nurses are exposed frequently to occupational stress and can experience a range of negative impacts on their well-being and intention to stay in the nursing workforce. Promoting Resilience in Nurses (PRiN) is a strength-based resilience education programme that incorporates evidence-based cognitive behavioural and interpersonal approaches with post-traumatic growth theory. A partially clustered randomized controlled trial at a large public mental health service will be used to examine the effects of PRiN on mental health nurses' coping self-efficacy, resilience, well-being, mental health, emotional regulation, post-traumatic growth, workplace belonging, and turnover intention as compared to controls. Process evaluations are increasingly used to help understand and interpret trial results for complex interventions. This paper describes the protocol for an embedded mixed methods process evaluation that aims to evaluate the PRiN programme implementation and identify factors that may explain variation in participant outcomes in the trial. Data collection includes a programme participant satisfaction survey; a follow-up semi-structured interview with selected programme participants; a unit/team manager survey on barriers and facilitators to staff recruitment and programme participation; and a fidelity checklist completed by programme facilitators. Normalisation Process Theory will be used to inform data analysis and integration. The findings will provide insights into factors that affect programme implementation, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and may help explain differences in participant outcomes. Findings will also inform post-trial programme sustainability as well as potential future upscale and adaptation for implementation across healthcare settings.","Bui, McInnes, Ennis, Foster","https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.12989","20220313","COVID-19 pandemic; mental health nursing; process evaluation; randomized controlled trial; resilience programme","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28489,""

This study aimed to explore the patterns of COVID-19-related media exposure and examine whether these patterns were associated with mental health. In total, 917 participants in this study completed the Media Exposure Questionnaire (MEQ), the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21). Then latent class analysis and discriminant analysis were conducted to identify the patterns of media exposure. Finally, we tested how mental health was associated with such patterns. Four subtypes of media exposure were identified: the slightly exposed group, the lower-moderately exposed group, the higher-moderately exposed group, and the heavily exposed group. And there were significant differences in individuals' levels of positive and negative affect among different subtypes, but no difference in depression, anxiety, and stress. The results of the current study indicated that more COVID-19-related media exposure was related to increased positive and negative affect.

We carried out a retrospective longitudinal observational study examining the 4 months following the initial lockdown imposed during the COVID-19 outbreak (May 4th and August 31st 2020). More specifically, the ER admissions leading to psychiatric referral were reviewed at all seven public hospitals of AUSL Romagna (Emilia Romagna region, Italy). Socio-demographic variables, history of medical comorbidities or psychiatric disorders, reason for ER admission, psychiatric diagnosis at discharge, and actions taken by the psychiatrist were collected. An 11.3% (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.007) increase in psychiatric assessments was observed when compared with the same period of the previous year (2019). A positive personal history of psychiatric disorders (OR:0.68, CI: 0.53-0.87) and assessments leading to no indication for follow-up (OR: 0.22, CI: 0.13-0.39) were significantly less frequent, while there was a significant increase of cases featuring organic comorbidities (OR: 1.24, CI: 1.00-1.52) and suicidal ideation/self-harm/suicide attempt (OR: 1,71, CI: 1.19-2.45) or psychomotor agitation (OR: 1.46, CI: 1.02-2.07) as reason for admission. Our results showed an increase in ER psychiatric consultations compared to the previous year, underlying the increased psychological distress caused by the lockdown.","Beghi, Ferrari, Biondi, Brandolini, Corsini, De Paoli, Sant'Angelo, Fraticelli, Casolaro, Zinchuk, Pashnin, Urh, Castelpietra, Cornaggia","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-022-02262-6","20220313","COVID-19; Follow-up; Mental health; Pandemic; Psychiatric consultation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28491,""
"Quality of life of children with neurodevelopmental disorders and their parents during the COVID-19 pandemic: a 1-year follow-up study","This study aimed to reveal changes in the quality of life (QOL) of children with neurodevelopmental disorders and their parents, and the interaction between their QOL and parental mental state during the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Eighty-nine school-aged children and parents participated in surveys in May 2020 (T1) and May 2021 (T2). The parents completed questionnaires that assessed their QOL, depression, parenting stress, and living conditions. Children's temporary mood status was evaluated using the self-reported visual analog scale (VAS). Children's QOL and VAS at T2 were higher than their QOL at T1. Parents' QOL at T2 was lower than their QOL at T1. Severe parental depression at T1 had a synergistic effect on severe parenting stress and severe depressive state at T2. Additionally, children's high QOL at T1 had a synergistic effect on low parenting stress and children's high QOL at T2. Furthermore, children's low VAS scores and parents' low QOL at T2 were associated with deterioration of family economic status. Children and parents' QOL changed during the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic. Improvement in children's QOL was influenced by reduced maternal depressive symptoms. Public support for parental mental health is important to avoid decreasing QOL.","Ueda, Okada, Kita, Ukezono, Takada, Ozawa, Inoue, Shioda, Kono, Kono, Nakamura, Amemiya, Ito, Sugiura, Matsuoka, Kaiga, Shiraki, Kubota, Ozawa","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-08273-2","20220313","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28492,""
"The association of resilience with depression, anxiety, stress and physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic","COVID-19 has resulted in substantial global upheaval. Resilience is important in protecting wellbeing, however few studies have investigated changes in resilience over time, and associations between resilience with depression, anxiety, stress, and physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Online surveys were conducted to collect both longitudinal and cross-sectional data at three time points during 2020. Australian adults aged 18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years and over were invited to complete the online surveys. Measures include the six-item Brief Resilience Scale, the 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, and the Active Australia Survey which have eight items identifying the duration and frequency of walking, and moderate and vigorous physical activities (MVPA), over the past 7 days. General linear mixed models and general linear models were used in the analysis. In the longitudinal sample, adjusted differences (aDif) in resilience scores did not significantly change over time (time 2 vs. time 1 [aDifÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.02, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.08, 0.03], and time 3 vs. time 1 [aDifÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.07, 0.06]). On average, those engaging in at least 150Ã¢â‚¬â€°min of MVPA per week (aDifÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.10, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.04, 0.16), and having depression (aDifÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.40, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.33), anxiety (aDifÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.34, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.26, 0.41), and stress scores (aDifÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.30, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.23, 0.37) within the normal range had significantly higher resilience scores. The association between resilience and physical activity was independent of depression, anxiety, and stress levels. All results were similar for the cross-sectional sample. Resilience scores did not change significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there were significant associations between resilience with physical activity and psychological distress. This research helps inform future interventions to enhance or nurture resilience, particularly targeted at people identified as at risk of psychological distress.","To, Vandelanotte, Cope, Khalesi, Williams, Alley, Thwaite, Fenning, Stanton","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-12911-9","20220313","Exercise; Mental health; Psychological distress; Wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28493,""
"Changes in work and health of Australians during the COVID-19 pandemic: a longitudinal cohort study","Engagement in work is an important determinant of health. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, public health measures imposed to reduce viral transmission resulted in large-scale loss of work during the early stages of the pandemic, contributing to declined mental and physical health. As the pandemic unfolded, the Australian economy began to recover and some people could return to work, whilst localised lockdowns resulted in further loss of work for others. The long-term health effects of work loss remain unexplored within the COVID-19 pandemic context, in addition to whether any health effects are persistent upon returning to work. A prospective longitudinal cohort study of 2603 participants across Australia monitored changes in health and work between March and December 2020, with participants completing surveys at baseline and 1, 3 and 6Ã‚Â months later. Outcomes described psychological distress, and mental and physical health. Linear mixed regression models examined associations between changes in health and experiences of work loss, and return to work, over time. Losing work during the early stages of the pandemic was associated with long-term poorer mental health, which began to recover over time as some returned to work. Physical health deteriorated over time, greater for people not working at baseline. Being out of work was associated with poorer mental health, but better physical health. These effects were larger for people that had recently lost work than for people with sustained work loss, and retaining employment played a protective role. Generally, returning to work resulted in poorer physical health and improvements in mental health, although this depended on the broader context of changes in work. Work cessation during the pandemic led to poor health outcomes and had long-lasting effects. Returning to work benefits mental health but may reduce physical activity in the short-term. We encourage the provision of accessible mental health supports and services immediately following loss of work, and for people with prolonged forms of work loss.

"Provision of antenatal care in Europe-A scientific study commissioned by European Board and College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (EBCOG)","Differences in the way health care delivery across countries may have important impacts on health outcomes and can result in inequalities. A questionnaire survey of members of national societies through EBCOG and EAPM was carried out in 2021. A total of 53 responses were received from 26 countries. Most countries reported that routine antenatal care is primarily delivered by medical staff, involving obstetric specialists or family doctors mostly in government-run facilities. Women from minority groups are able to access antenatal care easily in most countries. Less than 10% of women did not attend antenatal care throughout the pregnancy. Most booking for antenatal care takes place in the first trimester and the number of visits range from 6 to 10 depending on parity. Most countries provide routine ultrasound with 2-3 reported scans performed by specifically trained health care professionals. Facilities for prenatal screening/diagnosis of malformations in both low- and high-risk cases varied across Europe. While antenatal care is relatively standardized throughout Europe, important differences still exist in care delivery and accessibility to care. Antenatal preventive strategies appear to be variably available throughout Europe.","Topcu, Savona-Ventura, Ayres-de-Campos, Mukhopadhyay, Messinis, Mahmood, Cassar, Gixti Sultana","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2022.03.009","20220312","Access to care; Antenatal care; Antenatal visits; Covid-19 pandemic; Diversity; EU countries; Foetal abnormality; GDM screening; Immigrant women; Perinatal mental health; Screening; Service delivery; Ultrasound scanning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28495,""
"How does COVID stress vary across the anxiety-related disorders? Assessing factorial invariance and changes in COVID Stress Scale scores during the pandemic","No studies have examined whether levels of COVID stress vary across anxiety-related disorders. Likewise, no studies have assessed structural invariance of the COVID Stress Scales (CSS) across clinical diagnoses. We sought to address these issues in the present study. Given the dynamic nature of pandemics, we also assessed whether COVID stress changed from the first to third wave in those with clinical diagnoses and those with no mental health conditions. Data were collected during COVID-19 from two independent samples of adults assessed about a year apart (early-mid in 2020, NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 6854; and early-mid 2021, NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 5812) recruited from Canada and the United States through an online survey. Participants provided demographic information, indicated the presence of current (i.e., past-year) anxiety-related or mood disorder, and completed the CSS. The five CSS were reliable (internally consistent), and the five-factor structure was stable across samples. Scores tended to be highest in people with anxiety-related or mood disorders, particularly panic disorder. As expected, scores fluctuated over time, being higher during the early phases of the pandemic when threat was greatest and lower during the later phases, when vaccines were deployed and the COVID-19 threat was reduced. The findings add to the growing number of studies supporting the psychometric properties of the CSS. The results encourage further investigations into the utility of the scales, such as their ability to detect treatment-related changes in COVID-19-related distress. The scales also show promise for studies of future pandemics or outbreaks because the CSS can be modified, with minor wording changes, to assess distress associated with all kinds of disease outbreaks.","Asmundson, Rachor, Drakes, Boehme, Paluszek, Taylor","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2022.102554","20220312","Anxiety disorders; COVID-19 Stress Scales; Coronavirus; Factorial invariance; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28496,""
"Using automation to manage donor engagement and fine-tune supply and demand during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic","COVID-19 disrupted blood center operations starting March 2020 and continues to affect donor presentation and blood availability today. The industry mobilized significant resources to collect COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) to treat COVID-19 patients. At the same time, blood centers continued to collect platelets, plasma, and red blood cells (RBCs) to meet the needs of non-COVID-19 patients. The purpose of this study was to quantify how automation was used to fine-tune supply and demand and increase donor engagement during the first year of the pandemic. This was a single-center retrospective study of blood collection and donor presentation at a mid-sized US blood center. Data was evaluated from January 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021. Parameters evaluated included donor presentation, platelets per procedure, concurrent RBC and plasma collections per procedure, operatorÃ‚Â compliance, total donor appointment count, and donor frequency. With the cancelation of mobile blood drives, fixed sites increased total apheresis procedures by 37% and increased turns per bed by 46% whereas less products were collected per donor. By collecting only what was needed, platelet expiration rate decreased from 6.8% (pre-pandemic) to less than 4%. Donor engagement as measured by donor frequency increased from 1.6 in January 2020 to 1.8 in March 2021. Using technological advances such as automated blood collection and information systems, the blood center improved donor engagement and avoided collecting a surplus of any one type of blood product over the course of the pandemic.","Pina, Lewis, Garrison, Razatos","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transci.2022.103420","20220312","Automation; Blood collection strategy; COVID-19 Pandemic; Donor engagement","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28497,""
"Lifestyle changes, mental health, and health-related quality of life in children aged 6-7Ã‚Â years before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Germany","The measures against the COVID-19 pandemic are challenging for children and parents, and detrimental effects on child health are suggested especially from lock-down measures and school closings. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using a population based longitudinal (birth-) cohort study (SPATZ study) conducted in the South of Germany. Data included all 6 or 7Ã‚Â year old children for whom a questionnaire was completed during first grade of school. Consequently, we were able to analyze children being in first grade before the first lockdown in Germany (Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°15th March 2020), as well as children being in first grade during the pandemic (&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°15th March 2020). We conducted descriptive statistics and estimated the associations between the two time periods, before and during the pandemic, and various outcomes of child health using multivariable adjusted linear or logistic regression modeling. The analysis was stratified by gender. Results among nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°362 children aged six or seven years showed substantially lower mean scores of health-related quality of life (difference in means: -Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) -Ã¢â‚¬â€°9.0, -Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.0), and higher mean scores in total emotional and behavioral difficulties (difference in means: 2.0, 95% CI 0.2, 3.8) in girls during vs. before the COVID-19 pandemic using multivariable linear regression modeling. In addition, weekly screen-time was increased in boys by 3.5Ã‚Â h (95% CI 0.6, 6.4). We did not find substantial differences in sleep quality, physical activity, and time spent with books, neither in boys nor in girls, however, the limited sample size has to be considered. Child health (and behavior) of first grade school children is possibly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic with adverse consequences possibly differing by gender.","Kurz, Braig, Genuneit, Rothenbacher","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13034-022-00454-1","20220314","COVID-19; Child health; Lifestyle changes; Mental health; Quality of life; SDQ; Wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28498,""
"Barriers and facilitators to infection prevention and control in Dutch psychiatric institutions: a theory-informed qualitative study","The unique characteristics of psychiatric institutions contribute to the onset and spread of infectious agents. Infection prevention and control (IPC) is essential to minimise transmission and manage outbreaks effectively. Despite abundant studies regarding IPC conducted in hospitals, to date only a few studies focused on mental health care settings. However, the general low compliance to IPC in psychiatric institutions is recognised as a serious concern. Therefore, this study aimed to assess perceived barriers and facilitators to IPC among professionals working at psychiatric institutions, and to identify recommendations reported by professionals to improve IPC. A descriptive, qualitative study involving 16 semi-structured interviews was conducted (before COVID-19) among professionals from five Dutch psychiatric institutions. The interview guide and data analysis were informed by implementation science theories, and explored guideline, individual, interpersonal, organisational, and broader environment barriers and facilitators to IPC. Data was subjected to thematic analysis, using inductive and deductive approaches. This study followed the Consolidated criteria for Reporting Qualitative research (COREQ) guidelines. Our findings generated six main themes: (1) patients' non-compliance (strongly related to mental illness); (2) professionals' negative cognitions and attitude towards IPC and IPC knowledge deficits; (3) monitoring of IPC performance and mutual professional feedback; (4) social support from professional to patient; (5) organisational support and priority; and (6) financial and material resource limitations (related to financial arrangements regarding mental health services). The main recommendations reported by professionals included: (1) to increase awareness towards IPC among all staff members, by education and training, and the communication of formal agreements as institutional IPC protocols; (2) to make room for and facilitate IPC at the organisational level, by providing adequate IPC equipment and appointing a professional responsible for IPC. IPC implementation in psychiatric institutions is strongly influenced by factors on the patient, professional and organisational level. Professional interaction and professional-patient interaction appeared to be additional important aspects. Therefore, a multidimensional approach should be adopted to improve IPC. To coordinate this approach, psychiatric institutions should appoint a professional responsible for IPC. Moreover, a balance between mental health care and IPC needs is required to sustain IPC.","Houben, van Hensbergen, den Heijer, Dukers-Muijrers, Hoebe","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-022-07236-2","20220314","Antimicrobial resistance; Healthcare-associated infection; Infection prevention and control; Mental health care; Nosocomial infection; Psychiatry; Qualitative study","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-15","",28499,""
"A CONFIRMATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS OF A COGNITIVE MODEL OF COVID-19 RELATED DISTRESS","The mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been significant, with many regions across the globe reporting significant increases in anxiety, depression, trauma, and insomnia This study aims to validate a potential cognitive model of maintenance factors of COVID-19 related distress by examining psychological predictors of distress, and their goodness-of-fit as a coherent model. Participants from the general population (n=555) were recruited using a cross-sectional on-line survey design, assessing Demographic factors, Anxiety, Depression, Loneliness, COVID-19 related distress, Trauma Cognitions related to COVID-19, Rumination, Safety Behaviours, Personality Factors, and Mental Effort related to COVID-19. A series of stepwise linear regressions found that components of the model were significant and accounted for a large percentage of variance when examining Covid-19 related distress (R2=0.447 Covid Stress Scale), Anxiety (R2=0.536 DASS-Anxiety Subscale) and Depression (R2=0.596 Depression DASS-subscale). In a confirmatory factor analysis, Loneliness, Post-Traumatic Cognitions about Self, Post-Traumatic Cognitions about the World, Emotional Stability, and Mental Effort related to COVID-19 loaded onto a single factor. The final model showed adequate fit (CFI=0.990, TLI=0.983, RMSEA=0.053(.027-.080), GFI=0.986, SRMR=0.0216), <U+03C7>2=23.087, p=0.006).
