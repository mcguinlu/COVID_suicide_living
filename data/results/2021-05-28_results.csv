"Covid-19 and Mental Health of Individuals with Different Personalities","Several studies have been devoted to establishing the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on mental health across gender, age and ethnicity. However, much less attention has been paid to the differential effect of lockdown according to different personalities. We do this using the UKHLS longitudinal dataset, representative of the UK population. The UKHLS dataset allows us to assess the mental health of the same respondent during the Covid-19 period and the year before based on their personality ""Big Five"" traits and cognitive skills. We find that during the Covid-19 period individuals who have more Extrovert and Open personality report a higher mental health deterioration, while the ones scoring higher in Agreeableness are less affected. The effect of Openness is particularly strong: one more standard deviation predict one more symptom on the GHQ12 test for about 1 respondent over 4. In female respondents, Cognitive Skills and Openness are particularly strong predictors of deterioration. Neuroticism seems to predict more mental health deterioration, as it is normal to expect, but this effect is not significant in the main specifications of the estimated model. The study's results are robust to the inclusion of potential confounding variables such as changes in: physical health, household income and job status (like unemployed or furloughed)","Eugenio Proto; Anwen Zhang","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.24.21257581","20210527","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-28","",14082,""
"6-month multidisciplinary follow-up and outcomes of patients with paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS-TS) at a UK tertiary paediatric hospital: a retrospective cohort study","Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) is a new, rare, post-infectious complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. We aimed to describe the 6-month outcomes of PIMS-TS. This retrospective cohort study comprised children (aged &lt;18 years) who fulfilled the UK Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) diagnostic criteria for PIMS-TS and were admitted to Great Ormond Street Hospital (London, UK) between April 4 and Sept 1, 2020. Patients were followed up by a multidisciplinary team of specialists at 6 weeks and 6 months after admission. Biochemical and functional outcomes were analysed. 46 children were included in this study. The median age at presentation was 10Ã‚Â·2 years (IQR 8Ã‚Â·8-13Ã‚Â·3), 30 (65%) patients were male and 16 (35%) were female, 37 (80%) were from minority ethnic groups, and eight (17%) had pre-existing comorbidities. All patients had elevated markers of systemic inflammation at baseline. None of the patients died. By 6 months, systemic inflammation was resolved in all but one patient. 38 (90%) of 42 patients who had positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies within 6 weeks of admission remained seropositive at 6 months. Echocardiograms were normal in 44 (96%) of 46 patients by 6 months, and gastrointestinal symptoms that were reported in 45 (98%) of 46 patients at onset were present in six (13%) of 46 patients at 6 months. Renal, haematological, and otolaryngological findings largely resolved by 6 months. Although minor abnormalities were identified on neurological examination in 24 (52%) of 46 patients at 6 weeks and in 18 (39%) of 46 at 6 months, we found minimal functional impairment at 6 months (median Expanded Disability Status Scale score 0 [IQR 0-1]). Median manual muscle test-8 scores improved from 53 (IQR 43-64) during hospital admission to 80 (IQR 68-80) at 6 months, but 18 (45%) of 40 patients showed 6-min walk test results below the third centile for their age or sex at 6 months. PedsQL responses revealed severe emotional difficulties at 6 months (seven [18%] of 38 by parental report and eight [22%] of 38 by self report). 45 (98%) of 46 patients were back in full-time education (virtually or face to face) by 6 months. Despite initial severe illness, few organ-specific sequelae were observed at 6 months. Ongoing concerns requiring physical re-conditioning and mental health support remained, and physiotherapy assessments revealed persisting poor exercise tolerance. Longer-term follow-up will help define the extended natural history of PIMS-TS.

"COVID-19 related employment change is associated with increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic","<i>Introduction</i>: The COVID-19 pandemic has had sweeping impacts on income and employment. Previous research has indicated that loss of employment is associated with mental illness and increased alcohol consumption. However, no studies have explored this relationship in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.<i>Objective</i>: The purpose was twofold: (1) Evaluate the association between pandemic-related employment status and alcohol consumption and (2) assess the interacting effect of depression and employment change on alcohol consumption. We hypothesized that (1) employment change would be associated with increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic and (2) the combined effects of depressive symptoms with pandemic-related-employment-change would strengthen the association with alcohol consumption.<i>Methods</i>: A self-report, web-based survey collected information on sociodemographics, COVID-19-related employment impact (<i>e.g</i>., decreased pay, laid off), change in alcohol consumption since the pandemic, reasons for consumption change, and depressive symptoms. Multinomial regression modeling explored the associations between variables.<i>Results</i>: One-third (33%) of participants (<i>n</i> =Ã‚Â 2,441; 67% female) reported consuming more alcohol compared to pre-pandemic and 11% reported that COVID-19 had a negative impact on their employment. Participants reported drinking more alcohol due to having more time (28%) or boredom (22%). The adjusted odds of increased alcohol consumption were 47% greater among those who reported negative employment impact compared to those who reported no employment impact (AOR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.03-2.11); depression did not moderate this relationship.<i>Conclusion</i>: Given the pandemic's far-reaching impact, the potential for alcohol harm is demonstrably great. Mitigating consumption should be considered when addressing loss of employment in this context.","Weerakoon, Jetelina, Knell, Messiah","https://doi.org/10.1080/00952990.2021.1912063","20210527","Alcohol consumption; COVID-19; depression; pandemic; unemployment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-28","",14084,""
"Problematic consumption of online pornography during the COVID-19 pandemic: clinical recommendations","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is one of the greatest contemporary challenges. Feelings of fear and uncertainty triggered by this pandemic have had noxious effects on people's mental health. This seems to have increased during quarantine and there is evidence of an intensification of rewarddirected behavior.

"COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing: economic, psychological, family, and technological effects","The concept of social isolation is currently understood as a measure of epidemiological containment that aims to reduce the speed of spread of the disease, enabling health services to prepare their resources to cope with the likely increase in demand, while also seeking to provide additional protection to groups considered to be at higher risk. The present narrative review aims to compile and synthesize the literature related to social isolation produced during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. This study is a narrative review of the literature on social isolation in the context of the COVID- 19 pandemic. 73 publications were included for full-text reading and were classified into the following categories: levels of social isolation, economic effects, family relationships, health system, mental health of the population, and use of technology. It is necessary to plan an escalation of responses to the consequences of the pandemic, especially in view of the increased demand on the health sector and social services. The negative effects of social isolation can be prevented by public policies that offer a response to the economic recession, maintenance of social work, encouragement of quality care in mental health services, and community support for vulnerable families.","Both, Zoratto, Calegaro, Ramos-Lima, Negretto, Hauck, Freitas","https://doi.org/10.47626/2237-6089-2020-0085","20210527","COVID-19; Coronavirus; pandemic; social distance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-28","",14086,""

"Changes in physical activity levels, eating habits and psychological well-being during the Italian COVID-19 pandemic lockdown: Impact of socio-demographic factors on the Florentine academic population","The confinement and lockdown imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic have produced restrictions in the lifestyle of Italian citizens with variations in their psychological well-being. The aim of the study was to identify changes and relationship with socio-demographic parameters. An online survey was administered to 1383 subjects (1007 females and 307 males) working in the University of Florence, Italy. Three validated questionnaires were used for the survey: the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire, the Med Diet Score and the Psychological General Well-Being Index-A. All the subjects were asked to complete the questionnaires twice, in order to attain a picture of the habits before and a later time point during confinement. Our results show that work-related physical activity was decreased, along with an increase in sedentary behaviour (from 07:22Ã‚Â±03:20 to 08:49Ã‚Â±03:41 h:min; p&lt;0.001, ES = 0.38), whereas recreational physical activity was increased (vigorous exercise varied from 568.5 Ã‚Â± 838.6 to 833.7 Ã‚Â± 1263.0 METs; p&lt;0.002, ES = 0.25). Eating habits changed according to the place where meals were eaten, with an increased habit for breakfast and snacks and a slight increase in alcohol consumption. Psychological well-being decreased (Index from 21.4Ã‚Â±3.9 to 18.0Ã‚Â±5.3; p&lt;0.001, ES = 0.723), especially in terms of vitality and positive thinking. The socio-demographic variables affecting these variations were mostly represented by age, gender and working conditions: young age and self-employment conditions can be considered factors for the changes in daily habits induced by confinement that may affect psychological well-being.","Mascherini, Catelan, Pellegrini-Giampietro, Petri, Scaletti, Gulisano","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252395","20210527","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-28","",14088,""
"Depression, anxiety, and the COVID-19 pandemic: Severity of symptoms and associated factors among university students after the end of the movement lockdown","This online cross-sectional study investigated the severity of depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms among university students and determined the association between various factors and the levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic after the movement control order (MCO) was lifted. A total of 316 participants were administered a self-report questionnaire that collected data on sociodemographic attributes, personal characteristics, COVID-19-related stressors, religious coping, and clinical characteristics. In addition, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) and the 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) were administered. Regarding depression, 15.5%, 11.7%, and 9.2% of the participants reported mild, moderate, and severe to extremely severe depression, respectively. For anxiety, 7.0%, 16.5%, and 13.2% of the respondents had mild, moderate, and severe to extremely severe anxiety, respectively. Moreover, 26.3% of participants had mild stress, 9.5% had moderate stress, and 6.6% had severe to extremely severe stress. The multiple linear regression model revealed that frustration because of loss of daily routine and study disruption and having preexisting medical, depressive, and anxiety disorders were associated with elevated depressive symptoms, while a greater degree of family and friends social support was associated with less depressive symptoms after adjusting for age, gender, and marital status. It was also found that frustration because of study disruption and having preexisting medical, depressive, and anxiety disorders were associated with elevated anxiety symptoms, while being enrolled in medicine-based courses and having a greater degree of family support were factors associated with less anxiety symptoms after adjusting for age, gender, and marital status. There is a need to conduct a longitudinal study in the future to confirm the causal relationship between the significant predictive factors and depression and anxiety identified in this study, and maintenance of a persistent flow of academic activities and social interaction may be of utmost importance to safeguard the mental wellbeing of university students.","Woon, Leong Bin Abdullah, Sidi, Mansor, Nik Jaafar","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252481","20210527","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-28","",14089,""
"Addressing Emotional Wellness During the COVID-19 Pandemic: the Role of Promotores in Delivering Integrated Mental Health Care and Social Services","The disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Latino communities has resulted in greater reports of depression, anxiety, and stress. We present a community-led intervention in Latino communities that integrated social services in mental health service delivery for an equity-based response. We used tracking sheets to identify 1,436 unique participants (aged 5-86) enrolled in Latino Health Access's Emotional Wellness program, of whom 346 enrolled in the pre-COVID-19 period (March 2019-February 2020) and 1,090 in the COVID-19 period (March-June 2020). Demographic characteristics and types of services were aggregated to assess monthly trends using Pearson Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> tests. Regression models were developed to compare factors associated with referrals in the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods. During the pandemic, service volume (P &lt; .001) and participant volume (P &lt; .001) increased significantly compared with the prepandemic period. Participant characteristics were similar during both periods, the only differences being age distribution, expanded geographic range, and increased male participation during the pandemic. Nonreferred services, such as peer support, increased during the pandemic period. Type of referrals significantly changed from primarily mental health services and disease management in the prepandemic period to affordable housing support, food assistance, and supplemental income. An effective mental health program in response to the pandemic must incorporate direct mental health services and address social needs that exacerbate mental health risk for Latino communities. This study presents a model of how to integrate both factors by leveraging promotor-led programs.","Moon, Montiel, Cantero, Nawaz","https://doi.org/10.5888/pcd18.200656","20210527","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-28","",14090,""
"Neuropsychology of COVID-19: Anticipated cognitive and mental health outcomes","Discuss anticipated patterns of cognitive and emotional dysfunction, prognostic indicators, and treatment considerations based on review of (a) neuroinvasive properties of prior human coronaviruses and (b) extensively researched disorders which share similar neurological mechanisms. A web-based comprehensive search of peer-reviewed journals was conducted based on a variety of key terms (and variants of) including coronavirus, neuroinvasion, cognitive dysfunction, viral pandemics, respiratory illness, critical illness, and metabolic disease. Articles were chosen based on relevance to the current topic and ability to provide unique thematic information. Historical articles were included if these added scientific merit to recent literature. Review of information in widely disseminated news articles was followed-up with direct review of cited scientific literature. Databases searched included Google Scholar, PubMed, and Ovid Medline. Based on neuroinvasive properties of prior coronaviruses and existing research on similar neurophysiological conditions with detrimental cognitive effects, COVID-19-especially those with severe symptoms-are at risk for cognitive decline and significant psychiatric/behavioral sequela. There are few studies examining cognitive outcomes in COVID-19. This review argues that neuropsychological sequelae are to be expected in patients with COVID-19.

"Moral injury in Chinese health professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic","<b> <i>Objective:</i> </b> Caring for patients during the COVID-19 pandemic has placed considerable stress on health care professionals (HCPs), increasing their risk of moral injury (MI) and clinician burnout. The present study sought to examine the prevalence and correlates of MI among physicians and nurses in mainland China during the pandemic. <b> <i>Method:</i> </b> A cross-sectional study was performed via an online survey conducted from March 27, 2020 to April 26, 2020. The 10-item Moral Injury Symptoms Scale-Health Professional version (MISS-HP) was administered along with measures of clinician mental health and burnout. A total of 3,006 physicians and nurses who completed the questionnaire were included in the final analysis. Unconditional logistic regression modeling was performed to determine the associations, including that between COVID-19 patient exposure and the risk of moral injury. <b> <i>Results:</i> </b> MISS-HP scores strongly and positively correlated with depression, anxiety, low well-being, and burnout symptoms. The estimated prevalence of MI in the total sample was 41.3%, 95% confidence interval (CI) [39.3%, 43.0%]. HCPs providing medical care to COVID-19 patients experienced a 28% greater risk of MI than those providing medical care to patients without the coronavirus (odds ratio = 1.28, 95% CI [1.05, 1.56], <i>p</i> = .01). <b> <i>Conclusions:</i> </b> A significant proportion of HCPs in mainland China are at risk for significant MI symptoms as well as mental health problems and burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic. MI symptoms are strongly correlated with higher clinician burnout, greater psychological distress, and lower level of subjective well-being. Effective strategies are needed to address MI and other mental health problems in frontline health care workers treating those with and without COVID-19 disease.

Quantitative data were analyzed descriptively and qualitative data by means of thematic analysis. 50% of the participants experienced psychological complaints or sleeping disorders. A limited social network and media coverage of COVID-19 complicated the recovery process of patients. 19% of the participants experienced a reduced quality of life. A weak social network caused feelings of hopelessness. Still, patients showed great resilience.

"Importance of Digital Literacy in the Process of Confronting the Stress During COVID-19 Pandemic","COVID-19 pandemic is a global problem that raised the perception of stress to a completely new level, unseen so far in peace conditions. To reduce the level of stress and deal with its accumulated consequences, people enforce different strategies and coping mechanisms. In the vast amount of information available, imposed by the media, and often filled with falsehoods and catastrophizing related topics, it can be very challenging to distinguish the truth from falsehoods. The existence of an adequate level of digital literacy and e-Health literacy can help society to deal with that problem. Digital and e-Health literacy enables society to search for information efficiently, while remaining critical and open-minded, and use the newly adopted knowledge to improve our mental health. The aim of the paper was to present the frequency of news searches and trusting the COVID-19 related information in the group of medical professionals in Croatia. The survey was conducted using an online questionnaire, containing psychological questionnaires and relevant questions about everyday functioning. Based on the results that show a significant correlation between the frequency of information search and the lack of trust in the search results, we discuss the importance of digital and e-Health literacy, primarily within medical professionals.","Bosanac, Luic","https://doi.org/10.3233/SHTI210343","20210527","Digital literacy; coping mechanism; e-Health literacy; media literacy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-28","",14095,""
"Study into COVID-19 Crisis Using Primary Care Mental Health Consultations and Prescriptions Data","The effect of the 2020 pandemic, and of the national measures introduced to control it, is not yet fully understood. The aim of this study was to investigate how different types of primary care data can help quantify the effect of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis on mental health. A retrospective cohort study investigated changes in weekly counts of mental health consultations and prescriptions. The data were extracted from one the UK's largest primary care databases between January 1st 2015 and October 31st 2020 (end of follow-up). The 2020 trends were compared to the 2015-19 average with 95% confidence intervals using longitudinal plots and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). A total number of 504 practices (7,057,447 patients) contributed data. During the period of national restrictions, on average, there were 31% (3957 Ã‚Â± 269, p &lt; 0.001) fewer events and 6% (4878 Ã‚Â± 1108, p &lt; 0.001) more prescriptions per week as compared to the 2015-19 average. The number of events was recovering, increasing by 75 (Ã‚Â± 29, p = 0.012) per week. Prescriptions returned to the 2015-19 levels by the end of the study (p = 0.854).

"Health and Social Care During Coronavirus Outbreak: The Exploitation of Long Lasting Memories - LLM Care","The Covid-19 pandemic has globally introduced a new crisis with severe consequences and led to a series of pandemic-related containment measures, including social distancing and self-isolation may cause significant impact on mental health. This study describes a social care initiative that was actualized during the Covid-19 outbreak with regard to the potential benefits in older adults' quality of life through the use of the Integrated Healthcare System Long Lasting Memories Care (LLM Care), and specifically the web-based cognitive training software. Online questionnaires, assessing various psychosocial and mental health domains, were distributed to 28 older adults before and after the interaction with the software aiming at evaluating the potential positive effect and usability of cognitive training software. Overall, the study demonstrates that the interaction with the web-based cognitive training software during the pandemic plays a significant role in maintaining mental health among older people, through improvements in well-being.","Romanopoulou, Zilidou, Gylou, Dratsiou, Katsouli, Karagianni, Petronikolou, Varella, Bamidis","https://doi.org/10.3233/SHTI210261","20210527","Covid-19; cognitive training; health care; social care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-28","",14097,""
"Identifying Core Outcome Sets in COVID-19 Clinical Trials Using ClinicalTrialsgov","Introduction of core outcome sets (COS) facilitates evidence synthesis, transparency in outcome reporting, and standardization in clinical research. However, development of COS may be a time consuming and expensive process. Publicly available repositories, such as ClinicalTrials.gov (CTG), provide access to a vast collection of clinical trial characteristics including primary and secondary outcomes, which can be analyzed using a comprehensive set of tools. With growing number of COVID-19 clinical trials, COS development may provide crucial means to standardize, aggregate, share, and analyze diverse research results in a harmonized way. This study was aimed at initial assessment of utility of CTG analytics for identifying COVID-19 COS. At the time of this study, January, 2021, we analyzed 120 ongoing NIH-funded COVID-19 clinical trials initiated in 2020 to inform COVID-19 COS development by evaluating and ranking clinical trial outcomes based on their structured representation in CTG. Using this approach, COS comprised of 25 major clinical outcomes has been identified with mortality, mental health status, and COVID-19 antibodies at the top of the list. We concluded that CTG analytics can be instrumental for COVID-19 COS development and that further analysis is warranted including broader number of international trials combined with more granular approach and ontology-driven pipelines for outcome extraction and curation.","Parvanova, Finkelstein","https://doi.org/10.3233/SHTI210221","20210527","COVID-19; ClinicalTrials.gov; big data; core outcome sets","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-28","",14098,""
"A Web-Based Group Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Intervention for Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression Among University Students: Open-Label, Pragmatic Trial","Anxiety and depression are common among university students, and university counseling centers are under pressure to develop effective, novel, and sustainable interventions that engage and retain students. Group interventions delivered via the internet could be a novel and effective way to promote student mental health. We conducted a pragmatic open trial to investigate the uptake, retention, treatment response, and level of satisfaction with a remote group cognitive behavioral therapy intervention designed to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression delivered on the web to university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Preintervention and postintervention self-reported data on anxiety and depression were collected using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Satisfaction was assessed postintervention using the Client Satisfaction with Treatment Questionnaire. A total of 175 students were enrolled, 158 (90.3%) of whom initiated treatment. Among those initiating treatment, 86.1% (135/158) identified as female, and the mean age was 22.4 (SD 4.9) years. The mean number of sessions attended was 6.4 (SD 2.8) out of 10. Among participants with clinically significant symptoms at baseline, mean symptom scores decreased significantly for anxiety (t<sub>56</sub>=11.6; P&lt;.001), depression (t<sub>61</sub>=7.8; P&lt;.001), and composite anxiety and depression (t<sub>60</sub>=10.7; P&lt;.001), with large effect sizes (d=1-1.5). Remission rates among participants with clinically significant baseline symptoms were 67.7%-78.9% and were not associated with baseline symptom severity. High overall levels of satisfaction with treatment were reported.

"Predictors for COVID-19-related new-onset maladaptive behaviours in children presenting to a paediatric emergency department","The goal of the present study was to determine the incidence of new onset maladaptive behaviours in paediatric emergency department (PED) patients during the COVID-19 pandemic and to examine whether child and parent anxiety and parental health status were predictors for the new-onset of maladaptive behaviours. Participants included child-parent dyads seen in a PED following the state's issuance of mandatory stay-at-home orders on 19 March 2020. A total of 351 children age 0-25Ã¢â‚¬â€°years and 335 parents enrolled in the study. Parents provided baseline demographic data and completed standardised surveys that assessed aspects of parental and child anxiety and parental health, as well as child new-onset maladaptive behaviours. Children Ã¢â€°Â¥8Ã¢â‚¬â€°years of age completed surveys that assessed child anxiety. Parents reported the new onset of maladaptive behaviours in children during the pandemic with frequencies up to 43%. Bivariate analysis identified predictors such as child anxiety (t(96)Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â -2.04, PÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.044) as well as parental variables such as state anxiety (t(190)Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â -4.91, PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and parental sensitivity to anxiety (t(243)Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â -3.19, PÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.002). A logistic regression model identified parent mental health and COVID-19 anxiety as predictors of new onset maladaptive behaviours in children (X<sup>2</sup> (6)Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 42.514, PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Specifically, every unit change in parental anxiety of COVID-19 was associated with a unit increase in maladaptive behaviours in children. We identified distinct parent and child-related factors that predicted new onset child maladaptive behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic. The identification of such predictors may help clinicians to prevent maladaptive responses to the pandemic quarantine.","Heyming, Fortier, Martin, Lara, Bacon, Kain","https://doi.org/10.1111/jpc.15579","20210527","COVID-19; behavioural; emergency medicine; paediatric; psychiatry/mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-28","",14100,""
"[Post-COVID-19 syndrome: epidemiology, diagnostic criteria and pathogenic mechanisms involved]","Many patients with mild or severe COVID-19 do not make a full recovery and have a wide range of chronic symptoms for weeks or months after infection, often of a neurological, cognitive or psychiatric nature. The epidemiological evidence, diagnostic criteria and pathogenesis of post-COVID-19 syndrome are reviewed. Post-COVID-19 syndrome is defined by persistent clinical signs and symptoms that appear while or after suffering COVID-19, persist for more than 12 weeks and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. The symptoms can fluctuate or cause relapses. It is a heterogeneous condition that includes post-viral chronic fatigue syndrome, sequelae in multiple organs and the effects of severe hospitalisation/post-intensive care syndrome. It has been reported in patients with mild or severe COVID-19 and irrespective of the severity of the symptoms in the acute phase. Between 10% and 65% of survivors who had mild/moderate COVID-19 present symptoms of post-COVID-19 syndrome for 12 weeks or more. At six months, subjects report an average of 14 persistent symptoms. The most common symptoms are fatigue, dyspnoea, anxiety, depression, and impaired attention, concentration, memory and sleep. The underlying biological mechanisms are unknown, although an abnormal or excessive autoimmune and inflammatory response may play an important role. Clinical manifestations are diverse, fluctuating and variable, although fatigue and neurocognitive complaints predominate. There is no defined consensus on post-COVID-19 syndrome and its diagnostic criteria have not been subjected to adequate psychometric evaluation.

"Substance Use, Mental Health, and Weight-Related Behaviors During the COVID-19 Pandemic Among Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Patients","The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on behavioral issues among those who have completed bariatric surgery (BS) is not well described in ethnically diverse populations. The aim of this study was to compare the impact of COVID-19 lockdown orders and after lockdown orders were lifted on substance use, mental health, and weight-related behaviors among a sample of post-BS adults. A retrospective medical chart review identified BS patients from one university-based obesity medicine clinic and two BS practices. An online non-anonymous survey was implemented in two phases: during lockdown (April 1-May 31, 2020) and after lockdown orders were lifted (June 1, 2020-September 30, 2020) to obtain information about the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on BS patients. A total of 189 (during lockdown=39, post-lockdown=150) participants (90.4% female, mean age 52.4 years, SD 11.1, 49.8% non-Hispanic White, 30.6% non-Hispanic Black, 16.1% Hispanic) participated. Lockdown participants were more likely to have sleep problems (74.3% vs. 56.1%, P=.039) and feel anxious (82.0% vs. 63.0%, P=.024) versus post-lockdown participants. A majority (83.4%) reported depression in both lockdown/post-lockdown. Post-lockdown participants were more than 20 times more likely to report substance use compared those in lockdown (aOR 20.56, 95% CI 2.66-158.4). The COVID-19 pandemic is having a substantial negative impact on substance use, mental health, and weight-related health behaviors in diverse BS patients. These findings have important implications for post-BS patient care teams and may suggest the integration of screening tools to identify those at high risk for behavioral health issues.","Messiah, Uppuluri, Xie, Schellinger, Mathew, Ofori, Kukreja, Schneider, Dunn, Tavakkoli, Almandoz","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-021-05488-6","20210527","Bariatric surgery; Behaviors; COVID-19; Mental health; Substance use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-28","",14103,""
"Prevalence and correlates of stress and burnout among US healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: A national cross-sectional survey study","COVID-19 has put extraordinary stress on healthcare workers. Few studies have evaluated stress by worker role, or focused on experiences of women and people of color. The &quot;Coping with COVID&quot; survey assessed US healthcare worker stress. A stress summary score (SSS) incorporated stress, fear of exposure, anxiety/depression and workload (Omega 0.78). Differences from mean were expressed as Cohen's d Effect Sizes (ESs). Regression analyses tested associations with stress and burnout. Between May 28 and October 1, 2020, 20,947 healthcare workers responded from 42 organizations (median response rate 20%, Interquartile range 7% to 35%). Sixty one percent reported fear of exposure or transmission, 38% reported anxiety/depression, 43% suffered work overload, and 49% had burnout.

"Practicing Social Isolation During a Pandemic in Brazil: A Description of Psychosocial Characteristics and Traits of Personality During COVID-19 Lockout","The experience of the pandemic caused by the Coronavirus and the consequent disease triggered by it (COVID-19) brought to light fragilities that have been long overlooked by the scientific community and by various political and social institutions. The pandemic also brought to the fore certain social practices resulting from individual behaviors, such as wearing a mask and practicing social isolation. It demonstrated the need for social commitment and pro-social behaviors if societies are to respond successfully. The purpose of this article is to evaluate psychological and sociodemographic characteristics associated with compliance or noncompliance of individuals with these practices in two different phases of the pandemic experience in Brazil: in the first month and after three months. Participants for the first phase of the study were recruited through advertisements in the media and social networks. 1,914 individuals aged between 14 and 81Ã‚Â years agreed to participate, 78.2% of these were women, from 25 Federative Units in Brazil. In the second phase, 761 individuals who participated in the first phase, were reassessed. The authors used the following instruments for data collection: a standardized questionnaire collecting information of sociodemographic characteristics and dynamics of social isolation; the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale; the Life Satisfaction Scale; the Positive and Negative Affections Scale; and the Reduced Personality Markers and Stress Mindset Scale. All instruments used presented evidence of validity and adequate reliability indexes. The comparison of categorical exploratory variables with motives for following social isolation protocols was performed using Pearson's Chi-square, and the comparison of continuous exploratory variables was performed using the Mann-Whitney test. Covariance Analysis was performed using as covariates those that showed significance/effect on isolation in previous analyses. The results showed that respondents practicing social isolation to comply with governmental recommendations had lower scores on the scales of neuroticism and conscientiousness. They reported also less stress, anxiety, and depression, and less general distress. Overall, these respondents also displayed more positive affect, and tended to reframe stress in a more positive way than others. These preliminary results describe the psychological characteristics of individuals and their associations with social behaviors in a period of collective stress and high social risk.","Zanini, Peixoto, de Andrade, Tramonte","https://doi.org/10.3389/fsoc.2021.615232","20210527","pandemic; personality traits; pro-social behavior; psychological characteristics; social isolation; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-28","",14105,""
"Teaching Anxiety, Stress and Resilience During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evaluating the Vulnerability of Academic Professionals in Mexico Through the Adapted COVID-19 Stress Scales","To mitigate the COVID-19 infection, many world governments endorsed the cessation of non-essential activities, such as the school attendance, forcing a shift of the teaching model to the virtual classroom. From this shift, several changes in the teaching paradigm derived, in addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, which could have an impact in academic professional's mental health. In the present work we show the application of a modified version of the adapted COVID-19 stress scales (ACSS) which also included teaching anxiety and preparedness, and resilience for academic professionals in Mexico. These scales were applied during the unprecedented transformation of the education system undergone in the COVID-19 quarantine. Most of the studied variables: gender, age, academic degree, household occupants, having a disease, teaching level, teaching mode, work hours, resilience, teaching anxiety and preparedness, and fear of being an asymptomatic patient (FOBAP), showed significant statistical correlation between each other (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.050) and to the 6 areas of the ACSS (danger, contamination, social economical, xenophobia, traumatic stress, and compulsive checking). Our results further showed that the perceived stress and anxiety fell into the category of Absent to Mild, with only the danger section of the ACSS falling into the Moderate category. Finally, the resilience generated throughout the quarantine was very high, which seems to be a predictor of adaptation the academic professional has undergone to cope with stress.","Delgado-Gallegos, Padilla-Rivas, ZuÃƒÂ±iga-Violante, AvilÃƒÂ©s-Rodriguez, Arellanos-Soto, Villareal, CosÃƒÂ­o-LeÃƒÂ³n, Romo-Cardenas, Islas","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.669057","20210527","ACSS in academic professionals; adapted COVID-stress scales; anxiety during COVID; resilience to COVID stress in academia; stress in academic professionals","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-28","",14106,""

"A holistic care approach to combat the COVID-19 disease","Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-1) 9 pandemic is spreading like a wildfire across the globe. For its containment, measures such as isolation and quarantine are followed. The patients tested positive for COVID-19 disease are kept in isolation with no interaction with the family members leading to negative mental health consequences. To address this, Parul Sevashram Hospital adapted to a more holistic approach to treatment. A process documentation of the best practices was undertaken. Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) were used to gather responses of the project implementers (<i>n</i> = 2), physiotherapists (<i>n</i> = 2), dietician (<i>n</i> = 1), Ayurveda practitioners (<i>n</i> = 2), and staff nurses (<i>n</i> = 2) who were mainly involved in tailoring the package of services to be offered as well as their implementation. In addition, KIIs were also conducted with the patients (<i>n</i> = 10) their views on the additional package of services offered to them and the overall level of satisfaction with the care. The holistic care services involved diet therapy, physiotherapy and yoga, AYUSH medicines for boosting immunity, music therapy and books and indoor games. Few implementation challenges include convincing healthcare workers for providing care to COVID patients, availing raw materials for preparing AYUSH medicines during lockdown. Trainings were also provided to HCW on infection control practices, provided monetary incentive and mobilised the existing resources for addressing the challenges. The holistic care has potential influence on patient's mental health, recovery rate, and satisfaction of COVID-19 patients. These approaches can be up-scaled with a minimum investment and has a potential to benefit patients both in public and private hospitals.","Kotwani, Patwardhan, Patel, Williams, Modi","https://doi.org/10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_1549_20","20210527","COVID-19; holistic care; mental health; patient satisfaction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-28","",14109,""
"COVID-19 and police personnel: An exploratory community based study from South India","COVID-19 has ensured that countries enforced complete lock down to prevent the spread of infection. Despite millions of people working from home during this pandemic situation, police personnel 'the front line workers' who deal with the general population to ensure their safety and wellbeing are at risk of stress and other mental health problems in addition to the risk of infection itself. The aim of this study is to explore the perception of police personnel towards the disease, factors influencing stress and coping abilities of them amid COVID-19. A cross-sectional qualitative study was conducted using in-depth interviews among randomly selected police personnel working in COVID-19 situation across the district of Karaikal, Puducherry. Of the 32 police personnel, majority were of age group 36-45 (43.75%), followed by 25-35 (37.5%). More than half of them were married (78.12%). Around 62.5% had been in the present occupation for more than 5 years. The in depth interviews were group under 5 themes namely perception, practice they follow amid COVID-19, stress they go through, challenges faced, coping strategies used by them.

"Dismantling internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for tinnitus The contribution of applied relaxation: A randomized controlled trial","Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) for tinnitus is an evidence-based intervention. The components of ICBT for tinnitus have, however, not been dismantled and thus the effectiveness of the different therapeutic components is unknown. It is, furthermore, not known if heterogeneous tinnitus subgroups respond differently to ICBT. This dismantling study aimed to explore the contribution of applied relaxation within ICBT for reducing tinnitus distress and comorbidities associated with tinnitus. A secondary aim was to assess whether outcomes varied for three tinnitus subgroups, namely those with significant tinnitus severity, those with low tinnitus severity, and those with significant depression. A parallel randomized controlled trial design (<i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 126) was used to compare audiologist-guided applied relaxation with the full ICBT intervention. Recruitment was online and via the intervention platform. Assessments were completed at four-time points including a 2-month follow-up period. The primary outcome was tinnitus severity as measured by the Tinnitus Functional Index. Secondary outcomes were included for anxiety, depression, insomnia, negative tinnitus cognitions, health-related quality of life, hearing disability, and hyperacusis. Treatment engagement variables including the number of logins, number of modules opened, and the number of messages sent. Both an intention-to-treat analysis and completer's only analysis were undertaken. Engagement was low which compromised results as the full intervention was undertaken by few participants. Both the ICBT and applied relaxation resulted in large reduction of tinnitus severity (within-group effect sizes <i>d</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.87 and 0.68, respectively for completers only analysis), which were maintained, or further improved at follow-up. These reductions in tinnitus distress were greater for the ICBT group, with a small effect size differences (between-group <i>d</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.15 in favor of ICBT for completers only analysis). Tinnitus distress decreased the most at post-intervention for those with significant depression at baseline. Both ICBT and applied relaxation contributed to significant reductions on most secondary outcome measures, with no group differences, except for a greater reduction of hyperacusis in the ICBT group. Due to poor compliance partly attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic results were compromised. Further studies employing strategies to improve compliance and engagement are required. The intervention's effectiveness increased with initial level of tinnitus distress; those with the highest scores at intake experienced the most substantial changes on the outcome measures. This may suggest tailoring of interventions according to tinnitus severity. Larger samples are needed to confirm this.","Beukes, Andersson, Fagelson, Manchaiah","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2021.100402","20210527","Applied relaxation; CBT, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; CONSORT, Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials; Cognitive behavioral therapy; Digital therapeutics; GAD-7, Generalized Anxiety Disorder; HHIA-S, Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults - Screening; ICBT, Internet-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Intervention; ISI, Insomnia Severity Index; Internet intervention; PHQ-9, Patient Health Questionnaire; RCI, Reliable Change Index; TFI, Tinnitus Functional Index; Telehealth; Tinnitus; US, United States","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-28","",14111,""
"Fear of COVID-19 among Peruvian People Living in Disadvantaged Communities: A Cross-Sectional Study","The COVID-19 crisis is fuelling a state of fear among the human population at global level. Especially, those living in informal settlements and slums worldwide have been profoundly impacted by this pandemic. Individuals living in these places are already leading underprivileged lives. Thus, the economic and mental health problems caused by the COVID-19 crisis have further exacerbated their living standards, which has resulted, for instance, in tragedies such as suicides. In this study, we have sought to identify those individuals most at risk of displaying high levels of fear of COVID-19 in an informal settlement located in the capital city of Peru. A questionnaire was administered to 449 inhabitants living in the Carmen Alto informal settlement. The questionnaire was made up of two parts: the first one inquired about demographic data and the second part consisted of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale. The demographic variables of age, gender, marital status, educational level, occupation, whether a relative from the household was infected with COVID-19, and whether one of them died of this showed significant differences. It could be observed as well that the groups of females, stable workers, unemployed and those having completed a workforce education are at higher odds of displaying high levels of fear of COVID-19. As expected, the groups that had either a relative infected with COVID-19 or a relative death by this had the highest levels of fear towards the virus. The female participants are more likely to display higher levels of fear of COVID-19 due to the terrible effect that unfavorable events have on them. In the cases of the unemployed and stable workers, their proneness to show high levels of fear towards the virus is because they have lost their incomes, due to the loss of their jobs, and because of fear of infection, respectively. Hence, we hope that this work serves Peruvian (and other) health authorities to develop strategies that help individuals living in informal settlements and are in urgent need of mitigating mental health problems.","Sotomayor-Beltran, Matta-Solis, Perez-Siguas, Matta-Solis, Matta-Zamudio","https://doi.org/10.2174/1745017902117010019","20210527","COVID-19; Fear; Informal settlements; Mental problems; Peru; Underprivileged","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-28","",14112,""
"Confinement and the Hatred of Sound in Times of COVID-19: A Molotov Cocktail for People With Misophonia","Forced strict confinement to hamper the COVID-19 pandemic seriously affected people suffering from misophonia (M+) and those living with them. Misophonia is a complex neurophysiological and behavioral disorder of multifactorial origin, characterized by an intense physiological and emotional response produced by intolerance to auditory stimuli of the same pattern, regardless of physical properties. The present work studied the secondary impact that strict confinement caused in 342 adults (224 women: 118 men) regularly attending a medical psychological center in Barcelona. Misophonia, usually underdiagnosed, showed a prevalence of 35%, the same for women (37%) than men (31%). A retrospective analysis using a physical-psychological-social inventory of 10 variables evaluated the number of individuals that during confinement and self-confinement (March 11 - June 29, 2020) canceled (mostly M-) and/or requested a therapeutic intervention, the reasons for their request, and the strategies they used to self-manage the situation. Ten main variables indicated that the confinement exponentially increased the effects of misophonia compared with results from the same individuals during the last quarter of 2019. Most people diagnosed with misophonia continued with tele-assistance during the confinement because of this impact's self-concern. Besides the impacts as part of the general population, M+ also developed different symptoms causing significant personal, social, and job/occupational imbalance, as compared to M-. Health, fears, conflicts with neighbors, study-related difficulties were outstanding reasons for consultations. The LSB-50 test for 'Psychological and Psychosomatic Symptoms' applied to M+ revealed the increase of 8 of 9 items of this psychopathological test. Sleep disorders (coronasomnia), hostility, depression, and somatization were more severe than in previous assessments. Women presented the worst psychological and psychosomatic states (eight out of nine, as compared to one out of nine in males). The study unveiled the complex physical-psychological-social burden, the need for dissemination and a gender perspective to understand the secondary impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of the population with misophonia. The results also show that in this new COVID era people suffering from misophonia need to develop coping strategies addressing modifiable risk and protective factors. They deserve familial/social comprehension, stronger clinical support and a gender medicine perspective.","Ferrer-Torres, GimÃƒÂ©nez-Llort","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.627044","20210527","COVID-19; Coronasomnia; confinement; gender medicine; psychologic symptoms; psychosomatic symptoms; secondary impact; sleep disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-28","",14113,""
"End of Life Intervention Program During COVID-19 in Vall d'Hebron University Hospital","<b>Introduction:</b> The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and its consequences have placed our societies and healthcare systems under pressure. Also, a major impact on the individual and societal experience of death, dying, and bereavement has been observed. Factors such as social distancing, unexpected death or not being able to say goodbye, which might predict Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD), are taking place. Moreover, hospitals have become a habitual place for End of Life (EOL) situations but not in the usual conditions because, for example, mitigation measures prevent families from being together with hospitalized relatives. Therefore, we implemented an EOL program with a multidisciplinary team involving health social workers (HSW) and clinical psychologists (CP) in coordination with the medical teams and nursing staff. <b>Objectives:</b> We aim to describe an EOL intervention program implemented during COVID-19 in the Vall d'Hebron University Hospital (HUVH). We present its structure, circuit, and functions. Descriptive analyses of the sample and the interventions that required psychological and social attention are reported. <b>Material and methods:</b> The total sample consists of 359 relatives of 219 EOL patients. Inclusion criteria were families cared for during the COVID-19 pandemic with family patients admitted to the HUVH in an EOL situation regardless of whether or not the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19. <b>Results:</b> Our program is based on family EOL care perceptions and the COVID-19 context features that hinder EOL situations. The program attended 219 families, of which 55.3% were COVID-19 patients and 44.7% had other pathologies. The EOL intervention program was activated in most of the EOL situations, specifically, in 85% of cases, and 78% of relatives were able to come and say goodbye to their loved ones. An emotional impact on the EOL team was reported. It is necessary to dignify the EOL situation in the COVID-19 pandemic, and appropriate psychosocial attention is needed to try to minimize future complications in grief processes and mitigate PGD.","Beneria, Castell-Panisello, Sorribes-Puertas, Forner-Puntonet, Serrat, GarcÃƒÂ­a-GonzÃƒÂ¡lez, Garriga, Simon, Raya, Montes, Rios, Bosch, Citoler, Closa, Corrales, Daigre, Delgado, Dip, Estelrich, Jacas, Lara, Lugo-Marin, Nieto-FernÃƒÂ¡ndez, Regales, IbÃƒÂ¡ÃƒÂ±ez, Blanco, Ramos-Quiroga","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.608973","20210527","COVID-19; death; end of life; grief; intervention program; mental health; mourning; prolonged grief disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-28","",14114,""
"Determinants of Mental Health and Practice Behaviors of General Practitioners During COVID-19 Pandemic in Bali, Indonesia: A Cross-sectional Study","We aim to study the level of mental health distress and COVID-19 prevention in practice behaviors among general practitioners (GPs) in Bali, Indonesia, as well as their determinants. We conducted a cross-sectional online survey. Survey recruitment material was disseminated by purposive snowballing through regional professional association as well as research team's personal acquaintances. The survey measured mental health status by DASS-21 questionnaire and practice behavior by a questionnaire based on WHO recommendations for hand hygiene and PPE use during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted multivariate analyses to identify independent determinants for mental health and practice behavior. Analyses included 635 (41.75%) of GPs in Bali. Mental health status was relatively good with prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress of 13.2%, 19.7%, and 11% respectively, lower than previous studies in Indonesia and elsewhere. Practice behavior, however, was not considerably lower with only 65.4% and 32.1% reported consistent hand hygiene and recommended PPE use respectively. Routine optional PPE use was reported by 23.6% of respondents. Long working hours and fear of COVID-19 was identified as detrimental to mental health while consistent hand hygiene improved it. Meanwhile, workplace, work setting, and fear of COVID-19, were identified as determinants for PPE use. GPs working in primary health centers and private hospitals were also found to have less adherence to hand hygiene protocols. Our results showed relatively good mental health status along with inadequate infection prevention in practice behavior of GPs in Bali, Indonesia. Intervention should be made to improve practice behavior. Determinants of practice behavior identified in this study could help to pinpoint intervention targets.","Sitanggang, Wirawan, Wirawan, Lesmana, Januraga","https://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S305373","20210527","COVID-19; Indonesia; general practitioners; health-care workers; mental health; prevention behavior","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-28","",14115,""
"Identification of risk groups for mental disorders, headache and oral behaviors in adults during the COVID-19 pandemic","The dramatically changing situation during COVID-19 pandemic, is anticipated to provoke psycho-emotional disturbances and somatization arising from the current epidemiological situation that will become a significant problem for global and regional healthcare systems. The aim of this study was to identify the predictors, risk factors and factors associated with mental disorders, headache and potentially stress-modulated parafunctional oral behaviors among the adult residents of North America and Europe as indirect health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. This may help limit the long-term effects of this and future global pandemic crises. The data were collected from 1642 respondents using an online survey. The results demonstrated increased levels of anxiety, depression, headache and parafunctional oral behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic in both North American and European residents. The results of this study facilitated the definition of the group most predicted to experience the aforementioned secondary effects of the pandemic. This group included females younger than 28.5 years old, especially those who were single, less well educated and living in Europe. In case of this and other global crises this will allow faster defining the most vulnerable groups and providing rapid and more targeted intervention.","Wieckiewicz, Danel, Pondel, Smardz, Martynowicz, Wieczorek, Mazur, Pudlo, Wieckiewicz","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-90566-z","20210527","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-28","",14116,""

A regression discontinuity in time (RDiT) analysis of daily service-level activity. Mental healthcare data were extracted from 10 UK providers. Daily (weekly for one site) deaths from all causes, referrals and discharges, inpatient care (admissions, discharges, caseloads) and community services (face-to-face (f2f)/non-f2f contacts, caseloads): Adult, older adult and child/adolescent mental health; early intervention in psychosis; home treatment teams and liaison/Accident and Emergency (A&amp;E). Data were extracted from 1 Jan 2019 to 31 May 2020 for all sites, supplemented to 31 July 2020 for four sites. Changes around the commencement and lifting of COVID-19 'lockdown' policy (23 March and 10 May, respectively) were estimated using a RDiT design with a difference-in-difference approach generating incidence rate ratios (IRRs), meta-analysed across sites. Pooled estimates for the lockdown transition showed increased daily deaths (IRR 2.31, 95% CI 1.86 to 2.87), reduced referrals (IRR 0.62, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.70) and reduced inpatient admissions (IRR 0.75, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.83) and caseloads (IRR 0.85, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.91) compared with the pre lockdown period. All community services saw shifts from f2f to non-f2f contacts, but varied in caseload changes. Lift of lockdown was associated with reduced deaths (IRR 0.42, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.66), increased referrals (IRR 1.36, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.60) and increased inpatient admissions (IRR 1.21, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.42) and caseloads (IRR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.12) compared with the lockdown period. Site-wide activity, inpatient care and community services did not return to pre lockdown levels after lift of lockdown, while number of deaths did. Between-site heterogeneity most often indicated variation in size rather than direction of effect.

"COVID-NURSE: evaluation of a fundamental nursing care protocol compared with care as usual on experience of care for noninvasively ventilated patients in hospital with the SARS-CoV-2 virus-protocol for a cluster randomised controlled trial","Patient experience of nursing care is correlated with safety, clinical effectiveness, care quality, treatment outcomes and service use. Effective nursing care includes actions to develop nurse-patient relationships and deliver physical and psychosocial care to patients. The high risk of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus compromises nursing care. No evidence-based nursing guidelines exist for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, leading to potential variations in patient experience, outcomes, quality and costs. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: we aim to recruit 840 in-patient participants treated for infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus from 14 UK hospitals, to a cluster randomised controlled trial, with embedded process and economic evaluations, of care as usual and a fundamental nursing care protocol addressing specific areas of physical, relational and psychosocial nursing care where potential variation may occur, compared with care as usual. Our coprimary outcomes are patient-reported experience (Quality from the Patients' Perspective; Relational Aspects of Care Questionnaire); secondary outcomes include care quality (pressure injuries, falls, medication errors); functional ability (Barthell Index); treatment outcomes (WHO Clinical Progression Scale); depression Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), anxiety General Anxiety Disorder-2 (GAD-2), health utility (EQ5D) and nurse-reported outcomes (Measure of Moral Distress for Health Care Professionals). For our primary analysis, we will use a standard generalised linear mixed-effect model adjusting for ethnicity of the patient sample and research intensity at cluster level. We will also undertake a planned subgroup analysis to compare the impact of patient-level ethnicity on our primary and secondary outcomes and will undertake process and economic evaluations.

"&quot;Better than having no evaluation done&quot;: a pilot project to conduct remote asylum evaluations for clients in a migrant encampment in Mexico","Asylum evaluations are highly specialized medico-legal encounters to collect physical or mental health evidence for use in immigration proceedings. Although the field of asylum medicine is growing, access to these evaluations is still inadequate, particularly for those in United States immigration detention or other forms of custody, such as under the U.S. Migrant Protection Protocols or &quot;Remain in Mexico&quot; policy. Given advances in telehealth in recent years and growing evidence of similar outcomes with in-person management, it seems prudent to examine whether remote modalities may also be effective for conducting mental health asylum evaluations in hard-to-reach populations. We analyzed the responses of 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°U.S. clinicians who conducted 25 cross-border remote mental health evaluations with clients in Mexico prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and completed a post-evaluation survey regarding their impressions and experiences of the remote encounter. Data were coded through a process of thematic analysis. The average evaluation time was 2.3Ã¢â‚¬â€°h, slightly shorter than might be expected from an in-person encounter. Five themes emerged from the coding process: rapport building, achieving overall goal, comparison of in-person vs. remote, technical issues, and coordination. Clinicians encountered a number of challenges including technical difficulties and a decreased ability to establish rapport. Nearly uniformly, however, clinicians noted that despite difficulties, they were able achieve the goals of the evaluation, including rapport building and diagnosis. Remote evaluations appear to achieve their intended goal and may be useful in expanding legal options for hard-to-reach asylum seekers.","Mishori, Hampton, Habbach, Raker, Niyogi, Murphey","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-06539-5","20210527","Asylum; Asylum-seekers; Evaluation; Forced migrants; Immigration; Medical-legal; Telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-28","",14119,""
"Risk of stress/depression and functional impairment in Denmark immediately following a COVID-19 shutdown","Existing estimates of the impact of the COVID-19 burden on mental wellbeing come from countries with high mortality rates. This study therefore aimed to investigate the impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown (March-April 2020) on risk for stress/depression and functional impairment in a representative sample of adult individuals in Denmark, which had lower infection rates, and whether the impact of lockdown was heterogeneous across living situation. Using a representative, randomly drawn sample from the complete Danish adult population interviewed in March 2 to April 13, 2020 (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2836) and again in July 2020 (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1526, 54% retention rate), we study how the imposed lockdown announced March 11 following the onset of the first Danish wave of COVID-19 infections affected mental wellbeing. We use the World Health Organization Five Well-being Index (WHO-5) and the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) to capture risk for stress/depression (WHO-5Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°50) and functional impairment (WSAS &gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°10). Using covariate adjusted ordinary least squares linear probability models and exploiting variation in the timing of responses occurring just before and just after the introduction of lockdown, we compare respondents before lockdown to respondents that answered during lockdown, as well as to answers in re-interviews in July. In our fully controlled models, we find reduced depressive symptoms among adults immediately after the shutdown, concentrated in adults with children living at home (-.089, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01 (from pre lockdown baseline .273)). Measures of functional impairment also declined immediately after the March shutdown among adults with children living at home (-.066, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05 (from pre lockdown baseline .150)). Impairment intensified for the entire sample between March and July (+.199, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001 (from pre lockdown baseline .248)), but depressive symptoms remained at lower rate in July (-.033, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05 (from pre lockdown baseline .332).

"Prevalence and changes in boredom, anxiety and well-being among Ghanaians during the COVID-19 pandemic: a population-based study","The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with several adverse health outcomes. However, few studies in sub-Saharan Africa have examined its deleterious consequences on mental health. Therefore, we investigated the prevalence and changes in boredom, anxiety and psychological well-being before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ghana. Data for this study were drawn from an online survey of 811 participants that collected retrospective information on mental health measures including symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder, boredom, and well-being. Additional data were collected on COVID-19 related measures, biosocial (e.g. age and sex) and sociocultural factors (e.g., education, occupation, marital status). Following descriptive and psychometric evaluation of measures used, multiple linear regression was used to assess the relationships between predictor variables and boredom, anxiety and psychological well-being scores during the pandemic. Second, we assessed the effect of anxiety on psychological well-being. Next, we assessed predictors of the changes in boredom, anxiety, and well-being. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, 63.5% reported better well-being, 11.6% symptoms of anxiety, and 29.6% symptoms of boredom. Comparing experiences before and during the pandemic, there was an increase in boredom and anxiety symptomatology, and a decrease in well-being mean scores. The adjusted model shows participants with existing medical conditions had higher scores on boredom (ÃƒÅ¸Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.76, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and anxiety (ÃƒÅ¸Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.83, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01). In a separate model, anxiety scores before the pandemic (ÃƒÅ¸Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.25, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01) and having prior medical conditions (ÃƒÅ¸Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-1.53, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) were associated with decreased psychological well-being scores during the pandemic. In the change model, having a prior medical condition was associated with an increasing change in boredom, anxiety, and well-being. Older age was associated with decreasing changes in boredom and well-being scores. This study is the first in Ghana to provide evidence of the changes in boredom, anxiety and psychological well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings underscore the need for the inclusion of mental health interventions as part of the current pandemic control protocol and public health preparedness towards infectious disease outbreaks.","Boateng, Doku, Enyan, Owusu, Aboh, Kodom, Ekumah, Quansah, Boamah, Obiri-Yeboah, Nsabimana, Jansen, Armah","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10998-0","20210527","Coronavirus; Ghana; Infectious disease; Mental health; Psychological well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-28","",14121,""
"Physical activity and mental well-being under COVID-19 lockdown: a cross-sectional multination study","COVID-19 lockdowns have reduced opportunities for physical activity (PA) and encouraged more sedentary lifestyles. A concomitant of sedentariness is compromised mental health. We investigated the effects of COVID-19 lockdown on PA, sedentary behavior, and mental health across four Western nations (USA, UK, France, and Australia). An online survey was administered in the second quarter of 2020 (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2541). We measured planned and unplanned dimensions of PA using the Brunel Lifestyle Physical Activity Questionnaire and mental health using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire. Steps per day were recorded only from participants who used an electronic device for this purpose, and sedentary behavior was reported in hours per day (sitting and screen time). In the USA and Australia samples, there was a significant decline in planned PA from pre- to during lockdown. Among young adults, Australians exhibited the lowest planned PA scores, while in middle-aged groups, the UK recorded the highest. Young adults exhibited the largest reduction in unplanned PA. Across nations, there was a reduction of ~Ã¢â‚¬â€°2000 steps per day. Large increases in sedentary behavior emerged during lockdown, which were most acute in young adults. Lockdown was associated with a decline in mental health that was more pronounced in women. The findings illustrate the deleterious effects of lockdown on PA, sedentary behavior, and mental health across four Western nations. Australian young and lower middle-aged adults appeared to fare particularly badly in terms of planned PA. The reduction in steps per day is equivalent to the non-expenditure of ~Ã¢â‚¬â€°100Ã¢â‚¬â€°kcal. Declines in mental health show how harmful lockdowns can be for women in particular.","Karageorghis, Bird, Hutchinson, Hamer, Delevoye-Turrell, GuÃƒÂ©rin, Mullin, Mellano, Parsons-Smith, Terry, Terry","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10931-5","20210527","Coronavirus; Exercise; International; Mental well-being; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-28","",14122,""
"Depressive symptoms associated with COVID-19 preventive practice measures, daily activities in home quarantine and suicidal behaviors: Findings from a large-scale online survey in Bangladesh","The world is facing a public health emergency situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychological wellbeing among individuals worldwide has been negatively affected by the pandemic especially in low- and middle-income countries such as Bangladesh. The present study aimed to assess the estimate of depressive symptoms and investigated its associations with COVID-19 preventive practice measures, daily activities in home quarantine, and suicidal behaviors in a large-scale Bangladeshi online survey. An online-based cross-sectional survey was widely distributed to Bangladeshi citizens. A total of 13,654 participants (61.0% male; mean ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°24.0Ã¢â‚¬â€°years [SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.0]; age range 18-65Ã¢â‚¬â€°years) completed the survey between May and June (2020). The survey included socio-demographics and COVID-19-related questions, along with lifestyle, suicidal, and psychometric measures. Hierarchical regression was performed to determine significant associations between depression and examined variables. The estimate of depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic was 43.5%. Based on hierarchical regression analysis, depression was significantly associated with not engaging in COVID-19 preventive measures, daily activities in home quarantine (e.g., playing videogames), and suicidal behaviors. Depressive symptoms appeared to be high during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. To fight against the pandemic, mental health issues as well as physical health issues need to be taken into consideration.","Islam, Tasnim, Sujan, Ferdous, Sikder, Masud, Kundu, Tahsin, Mosaddek, Griffiths","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03246-7","20210527","COVID-19; Depressive symptoms; Home quarantine; Mental health; Suicidal behaviors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-28","",14123,""
