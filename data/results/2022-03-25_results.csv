"The Mental Health Implications of Job Loss for Never-married Women during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background. The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with an array of social and economic events, influencing how the pandemic affected people of all genders. In particular, job losses surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially among women. We analyzed how the pandemic and rising job losses affected the mental health of unmarried women with and without children in order to identify possible health disparities, potential causal factors and opportunities for interventions. Methods. Data were collected from Wave 3 (January 6-February 15, 2021) of the US Census COVID-19 Household Pulse online survey designed to measure the impact of COVID-19. Microdata files were downloaded from the Census website and included N=13,940 never-married female respondents aged 25-54 years old. Data were analyzed using <U+03C7>2 tests, with z-tests for more granular between-group comparisons. Results. When asked if they had felt anxiety in the past week, 31% of respondents without children in the household and 28% of those with children reported feeling anxiety nearly every day (p&lt; .05). Among those who did not lose work during the pandemic, 24% of those without children felt anxiety nearly every day vs. 20% of those with children (p&lt; .05). Among those who did experience pandemic-related job loss, 33% of those with children and 42% of those without children reported daily anxiety (p&lt; .05). Conclusion. Overall, COVID-19 job loss was associated with higher levels of anxiety for never-married adult women. Notably, respondents without children expressed significantly higher levels of anxiety than respondents with children, and this difference was even greater when comparing those who had lost jobs during the pandemic. Reasons are being further researched but may be related to mothers' greater opportunities for social and community support, particularly when encountering difficult circumstances. These results have implications for the development of mental health programs serving women experiencing environmental stressors such as job loss, especially women without children who may not have the same mental health and community support.","Kricorian, K.","https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofab466.668","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Open Forum Infectious Diseases; 8(SUPPL 1):S337, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-24","",28889,""
"Navigating COVID-19 through diverse student learning communities: importance and lessons learned (Special Issue: Health education's response to the COVID-19 pandemic: global challenges and future directions)","Purpose: The purpose of this case study is to describe one Southern United States of America (US), historically Black medical school's approach to adapting medical education training through learning communities (LCs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: The COVID-19 pandemic created a wide variety of problems for higher education. Classes moved quickly from in-person to virtual instruction with little time for training;faculty and students had to adapt to new learning platforms, learning styles, study techniques and technological challenges. Emotions ran high due to constant change, transitions and numerous unknowns. The LC structure embedded in the curriculum of this US medical school aided in the navigation of these challenges. Findings: Of the 95 MD1-MD4 respondents combined who responded to the COVID-19 LC survey, 67% rated the LC sessions good/outstanding, 20% average, 7% poor/fair and 5% N/A. When asked if LCs had helped them during the pandemic, overall, 66% said ""yes"" and 34% said ""no."" When asked how LCs have helped during the pandemic, themes emerged related to safety, adapting to feelings of isolation/mental health/emotional support, and academic progress. Originality/value: The small LC group structure created a sense of security for receiving academic help, emotional support, a network of assistance resources and a place to process COVID-19 losses and insecurities. Receptivity to utilizing the LC structure for support may relate to the medical students' commitment to addressing health disparities, serving the underserved and embracing a medical school culture that values community.","Mitchell, A.

"Eye-gaze, inter-brain synchrony, and collaborative VR in conjunction with online counselling: A pilot study","Eye-gaze plays an essential role in interpersonal communication. Its role in face-to-face interactions and those in virtual environments (VE) has been extensively explored. However, the neural correlates of eye-gaze in inter-personal communication have not been explored exhaustively. The research detailed in this paper is an attempt to explore the neural correlates of eye gaze among two interacting individuals in a VE. The choice of using a VE has been motivated by the increasing frequency with which we use a desktop or Head Mounted Display (HMD) based VEs to interact with each other. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the pace at which these technologies are being adopted for the purpose of remote collaboration. The pilot study described in this paper is an attempt to explore the effects of eye gaze on face-to-face interaction in a VE using the hyperscanning technique. This technique is used to measure neural activity and determine empirically whether the participants being measured display neural synchrony. Our results demonstrated that eye gaze directions appear to play a significant role in determining whether interacting individuals exhibit inter-brain synchrony. Results from this study can significantly benefit and contribute to positive outcomes for individuals with mental health disorders. We believe the techniques described here can be used to extend a high-quality mental health care to individuals irrespective of their geographical location.","Gumilar, I.; Barde, A.; Hayati, A.

"Quality of Life of People with Cancer in the Era of the COVID-19 Pandemic in India: A Systematic Review","Background: The recent pandemic of COVID-19 caused havoc on the health system globally and raised a lot of questions and issues. Treatment for cancer is an emergency that cannot be taken back, particularly in an era of global pandemics. Cancer treatment mainly includes chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy, and palliative care, and because of the pandemic, all of these treatments are affected. The COVID-19 pandemic also had a potential effect on the quality of life and mental health of patients as well as health workers. Objective: This systematic review was intended to discuss the quality of life of people with cancer in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic in India in the light of the best available facts. Methods: An extensive literature search was done on PubMed, Medline, Embase, Clinical Key and Google Scholar databases till 3rd Feb 2021. Out of 1455 research articles, 06 research articles were included in this systematic review. Results: The results showed that cancer treatment delivery was as per standard safety protocol and the best treatment decisions were made by scheduling and setting priority. Till data, no direct research was conducted on the Indian continent to assess the quality of life of cancer patients in the COVID-19 era. The effect on the quality of life of cancer patients is very large and needs to be explored more by further research. Issues to be discussed with health care administrators and policy makers further. The teleoncology method of cancer care delivery to patients is another rational option which is applicable as well. Conclusion: This systematic review demonstrated up-to-date evidence regarding the quality of life of cancer patients in the COVID-19 era in India. No research has been done to assess the quality of life of cancer patients. Still, the area is unrevealed, but evidence from other global studies indicates an altered quality of life for cancer patients. To maintain quality of life, cancer physicians should make evidence-based decisions and incorporate multidisciplinary management into decision making.","Rohilla, K. K.; Kalyani, C.

"Project Extension for Community Health Outcomes (ECHO) Autism: A Successful Model to Increase Capacity in Community-Based Care","Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) struggle to access high-quality health care due to the shortage of trained providers. ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) Autism is a unique educational program that allows ASD experts to provide knowledge and skills to professionals in local communities to deliver evidence-based care to children with ASD and their families. The model teaches clinicians how to screen and diagnose ASD, as well as manage common co-occurring medical and mental health issues. ECHO Autism is particularly useful for addressing the complex needs of children with ASD and reducing disparities often present in rural and underserved communities. The model can be disseminated globally due to its flexibility in accommodating local and regional differences in social norms and constructs. This article provides an overview of the format of the ECHO Autism model, data supporting the modelâ€™s efficacy, and discusses future research directions.","Sohl, K.; Rynkiewicz, A.; Nanclares-NoguÃ©s, V.; Curran, A.

"Psychological pathways between type D personality and COVID-19","BACKGROUND Patients with a type D personality have worse social functioning and mental health and more affective constraints than non-type D personalities. They have a negative outlook on life and health-related issues. The aim of this study was to examine the mediating role of stress and anxiety in the relationship between type D personality and COVID-19 by adjustment of the effect of demographic characteristics and perceived symptoms as confounder variables. PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE A total of 196 patients out of those suspected of having COVID-19 and visiting the reference hospitals were selected. They had completed the type D personality and the anxiety and stress scales along with their hospital admission form before undergoing COVID-19 testing. After their COVID-19 test, the participants were divided into two groups based on their disease, an infected group (n = 90) and a non-infected group (n = 106). RESULTS Type D personality has no significant direct effect on infection with the disease, but taking into account the mediating variable of stress, the odds of an event in those with type D personality is 2.21 times higher than those without this personality (p = .027) and, taking into account the mediating variable of anxiety, having a type D personality increases the odds of an event by 2.62 times (p = .011), holding demographic characteristics and perceived symptoms constant. CONCLUSIONS Given the indirect relationship between COVID-19 and type D personality, the mediating variables of stress and anxiety can be considered full mediating variables.","Shahsavarinia, K.; Javadivala, Z.; Allahverdipour, H.; Mousavi, Z.; Hamidi, F.; Saadati, M.; Taghizadieh, A.; Amiri, P.; Gilani, N.","https://doi.org/10.5114/hpr.2021.110933","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Health Psychology Report; 10(1):20-30, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-24","",28895,""

"Depression and Behavioral Changes Associated with Social Media Dependency During COVID-19 Pandemic Among University Students in Bangladesh: A Cross-Sectional Study","Background: With its rapid spread, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had a detrimental effect on students' psychological well-being, depression, and behavioral changes due to indefinite educational leaves, lockdowns, restricted outdoor activities, and excess use of social media. This study aims to assess the relationship of social media exposure with the psychological well-being, depression, and behavioral changes of Bangladeshi university students. Methods: A web-based cross-sectional survey was carried out on 530 students from June 17 to July 10, 2020, to evaluate psychological well-being, depression, behavioral changes, and social media exposure via self-reported measures. Results: The prevalence of factors were as follows: poor psychological well-being was 24.9%;moderate to severe depression was 56.6%;severe behavioral changes was 32.1%;and of moderate to severe addiction to social media exposure was 38.3%. All factors were positively associated with social media exposure. Multivariate logistic regression showed that the addiction of participants to social media was 7.488 times higher with severe behavioral changes (OR: 7.488;95% CI 4.708-11.909), 2.299 times higher with poor psychological functioning (OR: 2.299;95% CI 1.421-3.721), 30.54 times higher with severe depressed (OR: 30.54;95% CI 15.0-62.177) than that of individuals without such symptoms.

"Faculty and Resident Wellness After a Difficult Year","Study Objective: Between the SARS- CoV- 2 pandemic and the changing landscape of emergency medicine (EM) as a medical specialty, there is no question that this has been a difficult year for emergency physicians. Although universally considered to be important, faculty and resident wellness is rarely evaluated in an objective way. We sought to evaluate and compare faculty and resident wellness using simple and well-supported scales. Methods: Full-time faculty and residents at a suburban EM residency program were surveyed using an online, anonymous survey. We utilized two scales: the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS), a validated psychometric scale, used across multiple industries, designed to measure the negative emotional states of depression, anxiety and stress and the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS), another validated scale used to assess the ability to bounce back or recover from stress. The percent of faculty and residents with mild to severe levels of depression, anxiety and stress, as well as degree of resiliency within the two groups was determined. Differences between the faculty and residents with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Results: 20 (77%) full-time faculty and 21 (78%) residents completed the survey. 10% of faculty and 33% of residents were measured to have some degree of depression, ranging from mild to severe (Difference 23%, CI: - 3, 49, p= 0.08) with 0% of faculty and 19% of residents rating as severe. 10% of faculty and 38% of residents were measured to have some degree of anxiety (Difference 28%, CI: 2, 54, p&lt;0.05), with 0% of faculty and 19% of residents rating as severe. 10% of faculty and 48% of residents were measured to have some degree of stress (Difference 38%, CI: 11, 65, p&lt;0.01), with 0% of faculty and 10% of residents rating as severe. The average faculty resiliency score was 4.1 compared to 3.8 for the residents (Difference NS). One faculty member (6%) and two residents (10%) scored as having low resiliency (Difference NS). Conclusion: Although resiliency levels appear to be similar, faculty have significantly less anxiety and stress than the residents, and a trend toward less depression. It is unclear if these differences are stable over time or are related to the unprecedented events over the past year.","Fiesseler, F.; Espinosa, C.; Mekaeil, V.; Walsh, K.; Flannery, A.; Walsh, B.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annemergmed.2021.09.064","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Annals of Emergency Medicine; 78(4):S23, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-24","",28906,""
"Promoting Educator Social Emotional Competence, Well-Being, and Student-Educator Relationships: A Pilot Study","Educator mental health and well-being have received increased attention in response to the additional stress experienced during the coronavirus pandemic. Cultivating mental health and well-being can be facilitated by enhancing adult social emotional competencies. However, relatively limited research has explored how prevention programs promoting social emotional competencies have enhanced educator well-being and related attributes of self-care, efficacy, and skillful interactions with students. In this pilot study, we implemented and evaluated an innovative prevention program called Resilience in Schools and Educators (RISE) in eight Colorado schools with 53 educators. RISE builds knowledge and skills that promote educator social-emotional competencies, trauma responsivity, cultural responsivity, resilience, and well-being. The first study aim was to explore the fidelity and feasibility of the RISE program implemented in a school-based context. The second study aim was to explore whether RISE is associated with increases in educatorsâ€™ self-reported social emotional competencies, well-being, self-care practices, self-efficacy, and quality of interactions with students. As compared to field standards, facilitators reported high levels of fidelity and feasibility of RISE. Educatorsâ€™ pre- and post- self-report measures indicate significant improvements in social emotional competencies (emotional awareness, emotional clarity, non-reactivity, nonjudging), self-care practices, well-being, and student-educator conflict, with effect sizes indicating small to medium impacts. No findings emerged for self-efficacy or perceived closeness of student-teacher relationships. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.","Fitzgerald, Monica, Shipman, Kimberly, Pauletic, Marcela, Ellesworth, Kate, Dymnicki, Allison","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mhp.2022.200234","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Mental Health & Prevention;: 200234, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-24","",28907,""

"Burnout and Mental Health of COVID-19 Frontline Healthcare Workers: Results from an Online Survey","Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has been prolonged and healthcare workers have become exhausted. The purpose of this study was to investigate burnout and its relationship with mental health in COVID-19 frontline healthcare workers. Method: This cross-sectional study was carried out in all hospitals where patients with COVID-19 were admitted in Hamedan, Iran. With the census method and considering the inclusion criteria, 924 COVID-19 frontline healthcare workers participated in this study. Data were collected using a web-based survey consisting of demographic characteristics, GHQ-28, and Maslach Burnout Inventory. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata 14. Results: The results showed that the main cause of concern and stress in employees was that it was not clear how long this situation would continue. The results regarding burnout and mental health showed that 29.33% of participants were high in emotional exhaustion (EE), 10.93% were high in depersonalization (DP), 34.31% were low in personal accomplishment (PA), 50.4% had physical symptoms, 50.2% had anxiety and insomnia symptoms, 62.2% had social dysfunction and 17.5% had depression symptoms. The results of the multivariate logistic regression showed that EE had the greatest role in reducing mental health of employees with OR = 6.92 for moderate EE and OR = 39.42 for high EE (P &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: COVID-19 frontline healthcare workers are at risk for burnout and poor mental health. Health policies should be implemented to help reduce burnout in healthcare workers. Also, person-directed and organizational-directed interventions to rejuvenate these employees seem necessary.

"Anxiety, Depression, and Predictors amongst Iranian Students Aged 8 to 18 Years during the COVID-19 Outbreak First Peak","Objective: This study aimed to assess anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 outbreak among students aged 8 to 18 years and to determine related demographic and other related factors. Method: A descriptive and analytical cross sectional study was conducted through web-based data collection which included 348 students aged 8 to 18 years in the state of Mazandaran, Iran during the first peak of COVID-19. Demographic and Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS-P) questionnaires were used to collect the data. The statistical tests including independent sample t test, ANOVA as well as linear regression were employed. Results: The average age of the subjects was reported to be 12.2 Â± 3.59 years. Age, father's occupation, following COVID-19 related news, and also nervousness related to infection were predictors of anxiety (11%). Moreover, age, mother's occupation, family communication and also the safety protocols practiced by the family were found to be predictors of depression in students (17%). A significant relationship was also found between the effect of quarantine on family communication and the anxiety and depression in students (P &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Demographic characteristics affect student mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak. Moreover, family preventive protocols can predict depression in students aged 8 to 18 years. Better preventive precautions encourage less anxiety and depression.

"Measuring depression, stress, anxiety and resilience levels during the covid-19 pandemic using validated psychometric testing","Learning Objectives: To describe the prevalence of depression, anxiety, stress and resilience in EM residents during the Covid-19 pandemic Background: EM residents were already known to be high-risk for depression and burnout;in all likelihood the Covid-19 pandemic has added to this risk. In addition to the understandable work stressors, social isolation caused by the lockdowns likely has affected their support structure negatively. Objectives: Using validated psychometric testing, we sought to determine the levels of depression, anxiety, stress, and resilience in EM residents in a region severely impacted by the pandemic. Methods: Setting: An EM residency program in the state with the highest per-capita deaths from Covid-19. All EM residents were surveyed eight months into the pandemic using the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scales (DASS) and Brief Resilience Scale (BRS). Both studies have been validated in the psychology literature across multiple settings. Surveys were anonymous to promote honesty in answers. Levels of depression, anxiety, stress, and resilience were determined. Demographic information was also collected. Results: 23 of 27 residents (85%) completed the survey. Using the DASS, 48% (95%CI 27-69) were found to have at least mild depression, with 17% (95%CI 2-33) found to have â€œsevereâ€ or â€œextremely severeâ€ depression. 35% (95%CI 15-55) were found to have at least mild levels of anxiety, with 4% (95%CI-4 to 13) having â€œsevereâ€ or â€œextremely severeâ€ anxiety. 52% (95%CI 31-73) were found to have at least mild stress, with 13% (95%CI-1 to 27) found to have â€œsevereâ€ or â€œextremely severeâ€ stress. Using the BRS, 9% (95%CI-3 to 20) were found to have low levels of resilience. Conclusion: While we knew EM residents (physicians) are high-risk for depression and burnout, the levels of depression and stress measured by validated psychometric testing during the Covid-19 pandemic were concerning. Although the residency has increased its wellness activities significantly, it appears much more needs to be done to help residents get through this extremely difficult situation.","Bella, S.; Fiesseler, F.; Walsh, K.; Flannery, A.; Walsh, B.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Measuring+depression,+stress,+anxiety+and+resilience+levels+during+the+covid-19+pandemic+using+validated+psychometric+testing","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Western Journal of Emergency Medicine; 23(1.1):S25, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-24","",28912,""
"Effectiveness of technology-assisted cardiac rehabilitation: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Objectives: This review aims to examine the effectiveness of technologyassisted interventions in cardiac rehabilitation (CR), and to synthesise its delivery modes. Methods: Six electronic databases including CINALH Complete, Cochrane Library, PubMed, MEDLINE via OvidSP, British Nursing Index and PsycINFO were searched from 2010 to 2020. Randomised control trials that met the inclusion criteria were critically appraised by two independent reviewers using Revised Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized trials (RoB2). Meta-analysis was conducted using Review Manager 5.3 for at least two studies reporting the same outcome parameter. Narrative synthesis was performed if there was a considerable heterogeneity (I2) with a significant p-value. Results: Nine trials with 1016 participants with coronary heart diseases in phase II cardiac rehabilitation (mean age between 54.9Â±9.6 and 62.68Â±11.95 years old, predominantly male (81.7%) were included. Technologyassisted CR interventions showed comparable effectiveness with traditional centre-based CR on modifiable coronary risk factors (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol, all pooled results p&gt;0.05), exercise capacity (peak VO2: SMD 0.13, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.35, p=0.28), psychological outcomes (anxiety: SMD 0.25, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.61, p=0.17 and depression: SMD 0.09, 95% CI -0.16 to 0.35, p=0.47). Narrative synthesis was conducted for adherence to CR. Inconsistent results were found among studies. The technology assisted CR interventions with web apps and wearable technology for self-monitoring were found to improve CR adherence when compared to traditional centre-based CR. Adverse events were self-reported, mostly were unrelated to technology-assisted CR interventions and the number of events was comparable between both groups. Conclusion: The technology-assisted interventions, incorporating smartphone and web apps, wearable physiological sensing devices, realtime video conferencing and secure messaging in home-based or hybrid CR, have demonstrated comparable effectiveness on patient outcomes as comparing with the traditional centre-based CR programs. Thus, it has opened up an array of opportunities for patient-professional coaching and monitoring while bridging geographical distances and physical contacts, especially during the current COVID-19 pandemic. There was lack of theory-based guided intervention in technology-assisted CR for enhancing self-efficacy, social support and behavioural change strategies, which may shed light on future studies.","Chong, M.

"The postnatal period","A lack of adequate knowledge and training in breastfeeding may be felt by many GPs,3 and to increase the understanding of these common issues, an article featured in this issue discusses the essentials of expressing and supplemental feeding.4 The postnatal period provides an opportune time for health promotion and prevention, especially considering that nearly half of all women who delivered babies in 2019 were overweight or obese.5 Promoting a healthy lifestyle, with good nutrition6 and physical exercise,7 is fundamental for subsequent healthy pregnancies and for the prevention of non-communicable diseases. Nearly half of maternal deaths occur soon after birth and in the first six weeks, with the current leading cause in Australia being pre-existing cardiovascular conditions, followed by suicide.9 Mental health conditions are more likely to develop following birth than at any other stage in a womans life,10 and supporting women who may be at risk of or are vulnerable to mental health conditions is crucial to providing high-quality postnatal care.8 Regardless of your breadth of practice in managing women in the postpartum period, this is a time when we can have a significant impact on health outcomes. [...]what matters to women is a positive experience, which includes GPs listening and being responsive to individual needs, managing expectations and arranging support for both parenting and adjustment to the changes that occur within their intimate and family relationships and their roles as mothers.11 References 1.","Frayne, Jacqueline","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+postnatal+period","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Australian Journal of General Practice; 51(3):101-102, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-24","",28915,""
"Return to exercise after covid-19 disease","Objectives: Physical activity is one of most important parts of a healthy life style. After COVID-19 we have to consider alterations needed in prescribing exercise. Methods: A comprehensive review. Results: The guidelines for returning to exercise should consider elite athletes as well as the general population in two different categories. We may also classify the patients to these categories: 1. Those who were not affected by COVID-19 or were completely asymptomatic and were home-quarantined;this group will suffer from deconditioning. They have to begin milder physical activity and reduced duration compared to the previous active days before quarantine. The increase in volume and severity of exercises are based on the general condition and the patient's tolerance. All major changes should be monitored by a medical profession expert. 2. Those who were affected by mild to moderate COVID-19 and were not hospitalized;this group will suffer from decreased cardio-respiratory fitness as well as deconditioning. They have to begin with semi-monitored activities. Oxygen saturation should be monitored during physical activity and supplemental oxygen may improve tolerance and safety. 3. Those who were affected by severe COVID-19 and were hospitalized;this group will suffer from severe generalized muscle wasting and decreased cardiorespiratory fitness. They have to begin with in-patient rehabilitation. All participants have to pay attention to social/physical distancing and good hygienic measures, proper warm-up/cool down, adequate hydration, and appropriate dietary regimen. Many affected patients may need protein supplements to counteract severe muscle wasting;anti-oxidant and vitaminmineral supplements may be helpful because of long term decreased intake during hospitalization (low appetite, intensive care measures, and gastrointestinal symptoms). Psychological consultation to manage posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, obsessive symptoms should not be neglected.","Hakemi, L.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Return+to+exercise+after+covid-19+disease","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of the Hong Kong College of Cardiology; 28(2):106, 2020.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-24","",28916,""
"A qualitative needs assessment of covid-19's impact on em interns","Learning Objectives: To characterize the impact that COVID-19 has had on the well-being and educational experience of EM interns in 2020 Background: The COVID-19 pandemic posed an unprecedented challenge to our learners. EM interns this year began their training during a time of great need and with less clinical experience than those of prior years. Objectives: To characterize the impact that COVID-19 has had on the well-being and educational experience of EM interns in 2020. Methods: We conducted a 60-minute semi-structured focus group with 18 interns at a single residency program in July 2020. A recording of the interview was transcribed and de-identified. Using qualitative methods, initial coding was performed independently using an inductive and iterative process by two study authors with experience in qualitative methodology. Once saturation was achieved, final codes were re-applied by an initial coder and a third author. After consensus discussion, agreement reached 100%, and codes were grouped for thematic analysis. Results: We identified two major themes: education and professional identity formation. Interns expressed concerns about the quality and breadth of their medical training during COVID. Interns also voiced frustration with the politicization of medicine and uncertainty about their roles as physicians during the pandemic. Minor themes included physical health, mental health, and grief related to COVID-19. Conclusions: Our analysis suggests that new EM interns have significant concerns about their medical knowledge and the quality of their education as well as their identity as emergency physicians and public health advocates. These results may inform future decisions regarding dedicated support and training necessary for this unique group of learners.","Lee, E.; Mody, S.; Chung, A.","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+qualitative+needs+assessment+of+covid-19's+impact+on+em+interns","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Western Journal of Emergency Medicine; 23(1.1):S2-S3, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-24","",28917,""

"Prevalence of Anxiety and Depression in the Iranian General Population during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Web-Based Cross-Sectional Study","Objective: This study aimed to determine prevalence of anxiety and depression and associated factors in the general population of Iran during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: We conducted this web-based cross-sectional study on 5328 individuals in Iran between 17th and 29th of April 2020. Data were collected using the convenience sampling method through an anonymous online questionnaire via social media like WhatsApp and Telegram. The online survey collected data on demographic variables, COVID-19- related variables, and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Anxiety and depression were assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), respectively. Simple and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to determine independent predictors of anxiety and depression. Results: The mean GAD-7 and PHQ-9 total scores were 7.17 (SD = 5.42) and 7.80 (SD = 6.68), respectively. Prevalence of anxiety, depression, and comorbid anxiety-depression were 30.1%, 33.4%, and 22.1%, respectively. According to the adjusted analysis, anxiety was significantly associated with female gender, being young and middleaged, being unemployed or a housewife, having chronic diseases, spending considerable time thinking about COVID-19, having family members, friends, and/or relatives infected with COVID-19, and death of family members, relatives or friends due to COVID-19. Same results were also found for depression. Furthermore, depression was associated with being single, being resident in urban area, and having high risk individual in family. Conclusion: Prevalence of anxiety and depression were considerably higher in the general population of Iran during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the findings suggest that more attention needs to be paid to vulnerable groups such as women, young/middle-aged adults, the unemployed, and people with chronic disease.

"Three-Inflated Poisson Distribution and its Application in Suicide Cases of India During Covid-19 Pandemic","Inflated models are generally used whenever there is an excess number of frequencies at particular count. In this study, a three-inflated Poisson (ThIP) distribution is proposed by mixing the Poisson distribution and a distribution to a point mass at three. Some of its distribution properties and reliability characteristics are studied. A simulation study is carried out to see the performance of the MLEs. In India Covid-19 implications on mental health have been abysmal. Covid-19 related suicide data of India during lockdown to the first gradual relaxation of the terms of the total lockdown (unlocking 1.0) are used to examine the appropriateness of the proposed distribution.

"Psychological Impact of COVID-19 Patient Care on Families of Healthcare Workers","Objective: The Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has perpetrated a significant mental health burden amongst health care workers (HCWs) and their families. Families of HCWs are at significant risk of various mental health problems due to concerns regarding the wellbeing of the HCW, fear of contacting the virus from HCWs, staying isolated during periods of quarantine and being the passive recipient of public stigma directed towards HCWs. The objective of this study was to assess the perceived stress, resilience and coping tendencies of families of HCWs managing the COVID 19 crisis. Method: A cross sectional study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in India, where close relatives of 150 HCWs managing COVID-19 patients (directly or indirectly involved in patient care) were selected using systematic random sampling. They were evaluated using the Perceived Stress Scale, Brief Resilience Coping Scale, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Pearson's correlation and Independent t-test were used for statistical analysis using the SPSS software. Results: Majority (75%) of the family members associated with frontline HCWs had moderate to high level of perceived stress, while23% and 17% had clinically significant anxiety and depressive symptoms, respectively. More than 50% had low resilience and coping scores. High levels of stress, anxiety and depression were seen in female respondents, those less than 40 years old, having a child or an elderly family member and when the HCW had direct involvement in COVID- 19 patient care. Conclusion: Families of HCWs suffer from significant psychological burden due to the COVID-19 crisis. They face significant risk of depression and anxiety associated problems, which are augmented by low resilience and impaired coping. Mental health of HCWs and their family members should be given due attention with a focus on early identification, providing psychological support and improving resilience.

"Prevalence and determinants of depression in patients with epilepsy during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background Epilepsy is one of the commonest and most serious neurological conditions. It is frequently associated with one or more medical or psychiatric comorbidities. Depression is one of the most common comorbidities. Patients with epilepsy (PWE) are expected to suffer from a high level of depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional study was applied to 290 PWE. Data was collected by personal interviews with each patient using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ 9) scale for the diagnosis of depression and assessing its severity. We aimed to assess the prevalence and the risk factors of depression in PWE during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results We found that 70.3% of PWE suffered from depression. Low financial status, refractory seizures, fear of infection and death by COVID-19, had close relatives died by COVID-19, had a sleep disturbance, a decreased family support, increased seizure rate during the pandemic, increased ER visits during the pandemic, lack of drug adherence, and decreased epilepsy-related follow-up visits during the pandemic were significantly associated with increased risk of depression in PWE during the pandemic. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has a serious effect on the psychological and physical well-being of PWE. There was an increased rate of depression during the COVID-19 pandemic in PWE with its subsequent burden on those patients. So, these patients are in a high need of care and support during the pandemic.","Sehlo, Mohammad Gamal, Mohamed, Wafaa Samir, Youssef, Usama Mahmoud, Lotfi, Shrouk Esam, El-deen, Ghada Mohamed Salah","https://www.google.com/search?q=Prevalence+and+determinants+of+depression+in+patients+with+epilepsy+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Middle East Current Psychiatry, Ain Shams University; 29(1), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-24","",28924,""
"A comparative study of long acting injectable antipsychotic agents and oral agents during covid-19 pandemic: Quality of life, adherence and shortage of supply","Background: Long-acting injectable antipsychotics improved markedly patient adherence to psychotropic agents during the past decade. They were used mainly for long-term treatment of schizophrenia. However their role in short term or intermittent use or their effect on quality of life was not elucidated clearly. Objectives: To assess the impact of Long Acting Antipsychotic agents on quality of life of schizophrenic patients. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of psychiatric patients who were taking LAIs and/or oral antipsychotic drugs at Mohammad Said Kamal Hospital for Mental Illness in Bethlehem and Mental Health Clinic of The Ministry of Health in Hebron city during the period of September 2019 to March 2020. Results: Fifty one patients were included in this study, 74% males, age 50.69 Â± 11.14 years old. Average duration of psychiatric disease was 17.78 Â± 11.4 years. It was found that 9.6% patients were on oral dosage form (category I), 80.4% were on LAI and oral antipsychotics (category II), and 10% were on LAIs (Category III). Chi square test showed a significant difference between the 3-categories and GAF score (functionality), p=0.003. However, there was insignificant difference between the three categories and CGI-S(severity of symptoms) scores, p=0.170. When it comes to side effects, there was a significant difference among the three categories and DIEPSS, p=0.049. Kruskalâ€“Wallis Test showed a significant difference between patients in the three categories and number of all drugs, p=0.007. There was also a significant difference between CGI-S-normal group and CGI-S-severe symptoms group and overall number of drugs used, p=0.02. Mann-Whitney test showed a significant difference between number of all drugs used and the use of trihexphenidyl, p=0.001. Also there was a significant difference between number of antipsychotic drugs alone and thrihexphenidyl use, p=0.001. Patients were prescribed LAIs for the following reasons: non-adherence (47%), no reason at all (27.4%), patient dissatisfaction (13.7%), adherence and patient dissatisfaction (5.8%), side effects, convenience (ease of use), and availability of drug, (1.9%), for each. Conclusion: Improvement in functionality of schizophrenic patients goes along with use of LAIs either alone or in combination. LAIs improved adherence and minimizes polypharmacy.","Shaheen, M. M.

A poor understanding of new infections and lack of knowledge leads to compromised patient health benefits as well as psychological stress to front-line health workers. This study aimed to assess the knowledge and level of perception of health care workers about covid-19. Methods: A cross-sectional web-based survey was carried out among front-line health care workers who work at tertiary health care centers the survey instrument constituted a semi-structured pre-tested questionnaire. The 29-item questionnaire was divided into two sections. Statistical tool chi-square test used to investigate the stress, anxiety, and depression with significance set to p&lt;.05. Results: Out of 100 participants 30 front-line health care workers have minimal depression, 25 mild depression, 14 moderate depression, 13 moderately severe depression, maximum participants belong to age group 26-35 (P-value .001).

"Social stressors and isolation have biggest effect on resident wellness during a pandemic","Learning Objectives: To identify what features of the Covid-19 pandemic have the biggest negative impact on the wellness of EM residents and what interventions help the most. Background: EM physicians are already known to be high-risk for depression and burnout. In all likelihood the Covid-19 pandemic has added to this risk. Objectives: We sought to identify the primary stressors for EM residents during this pandemic and determine which factors and interventions have helped most to improve their wellness. Methods: Setting: An EM residency program in the state with the highest per-capita deaths from Covid-19. All EM residents were surveyed eight months into the pandemic using Google Forms. Surveys were anonymous to promote honesty. Residents were asked about to identify the three factors that had the greatest negative impact on their wellness. They were also asked to identify the three features that did most to improve wellness. Demographic information was collected. Results: 23 of 27 residents (85%) completed the survey. 91% (95%CI 80-100) said the negative impact of the pandemic affects them more socially than professionally. The factors identified most commonly contributing negatively to a resident's wellness were â€œdecreased socialization / isolationâ€ (74%) and â€œconcerns for family safetyâ€ (70%). â€œChanging hospital protocolsâ€ (35%), â€œFeeling under-appreciated at workâ€ (30%), and â€œPublic not doing enough to stop the spreadâ€ (30%) were also identified frequently as having a negative effect. â€œConcerns for my own safetyâ€ was only identified by 17% of residents as being a top-three issue. The features most commonly identified as helping wellness were â€œAbility to socialize in small groupsâ€ (65%), â€œteam mentalityâ€ (57%) and â€œfree foodâ€ (44%). Conclusion: Overwhelmingly, residents cite the social impact of the pandemic as having a more negative effect on their wellness than work did. Concerns for their own safety are not identified frequently as having a significant impact. Interventions that are social and decrease the sense of isolation appear to be especially important in improving wellness.","Walsh, B.; Bella, S.; Fiesseler, F.; Walsh, K.; Flannery, A.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Social+stressors+and+isolation+have+biggest+effect+on+resident+wellness+during+a+pandemic","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Western Journal of Emergency Medicine; 23(1.1):S33, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-24","",28928,""

Participants (N = 162) were recruited to complete an online survey 4 times between March and June 2020 (T1, T2, T3, T4). T1 completion coincided with the beginning of the lockdown, and T4 with the pandemic trough. Depression, anxiety, and stress were assessed with the DASS-42 and APS with the PQ-16. Psychosocial data such as the feeling of loneliness and social network size were also collected. The participants wrote daily narratives during the lockdown period. Anxiety and APS were the highest at T1 and decreased over time. APS and APS-associated distress were correlated with the DASS-42 at all times. APS arose acutely at the beginning of the pandemic, despite participants being socio-economically advantaged, and were related with negative emotions.","Mengin, Amaury C.; AllÃ©, Melissa C.; Koning, Estelle, Pham, Bichthuy, Park, Sohee, Berna, Fabrice, Giersch, Anne","https://www.google.com/search?q=Facing+the+pandemic+and+lockdown:+an+insight+on+mental+health+from+a+longitudinal+study+using+diaries","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: NPJ schizophrenia; 8, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-24","",28930,""

"Brief of Amici Curiae Professors of Health Law and Policy in Support of Petitioner, Ruan v United States (Merits Stage) (preprint); controlled substances | controlled substances act | prescribing | drug distribution | opioids | mens rea | good faith","Prescribing controlled substances for the benefit of patients is an everyday and essential practice for physicians and other authorized prescribing practitioners. Despite dominant public narratives about the harms of prescribed controlled substances, these compounds are neither harmful nor useful absent context. In fact, they are essential to modern medicine;a reality acknowledged by Congress in the initial sentences of the CSA. Indeed, prescribed controlled substances are a critical component of appropriate, ethical, and evidence-based care for patients with a range medical needs and conditions beyond pain and opioid use disorder, from treating patients with severe COVID-19 respiratory failure to regulating wakefulness for pilots. Like all medications, prescribed controlled substances also carry the potential for harm, including the risk that those drugs may be diverted for use by others without medical supervision. Practitioners have professional legal and ethical duties to carefully weigh the potential benefits and harms to their patients, and to prescribe controlled substances in a way that reduces the likelihood of diversion. These prescribing decisions are fraught with peril, including legal peril, in ways that prescribing other potentially harmful drugs are notâ€”especially considering the responses to the drug overdose crises in the United States. Over the last decade, legal and institutional actors have implemented blunt, reactive policies with the singular goal of reducing controlled substances prescriptions. As prescribing rates have plummeted during the last decade, the harms to patients in need of care and safe access to medication have significantly increased. CSA Section 841(a)(1) prosecutions carry a significant possibility of federal imprisonmentâ€”the most severe of the many legal and quasi-legal remedies available to address problematic prescribing. Until recently, Section 841(a)â€™s scienter requirement, which demands a knowing departure from the usual course of professional practice, constrained such prosecutions. But the CSA has been weaponized against practitioners in reaction to the overdose crisis. Federal practitioner investigations and prosecutions have increased while the standards for conviction under Section 841(a)(1) have steadily eroded. Prosecutorial and judicial statutory reconstruction to convict practitioners more easily is not the cure for drug related morbidity and mortality. As we previously explained, and as the petitioners have described in the consolidated cases here, the Tenth and Eleventh Circuits have effectively eliminated Section 841(a)(1)â€™s mens rea requirements as applied to prescribers. While the government must prove intentional or knowing distribution of controlled substances for non-prescribers under Tenth and Eleventh Circuit precedent, the government may convict any prescriber of felony distribution without proof that those prescribers had any knowledge of â€œall the facts that make [their] conduct illegal.â€ McFadden v. United States, 576 U.S. 186, 194â€“95 (2015). Practitioners can face decades in prison for nothing more than deviations from accepted medical standards, including mistaken, foolish, negligent, and reckless prescribing (good faith medical error). The text and history of the CSA and this Courtâ€™s relevant precedent all support the conclusion that Section 841(a)(1) was designed to punish practitioners who engage in intentional or knowing illicit drug distribution by using their authorization to prescribe as a subterfuge for diverting drugs. The statute was not intended to remedy poor or even harmful medical decision-making. The Tenth and Eleventh Circuitsâ€™ constructive rewriting of the CSA as applied to practitioners harms patients with legitimate medical need for controlled substances, forces practitioners to act unethically to protect themselves from legal sanction at the expense of the well-being of the patient, imperils the evolution of patient care, and implicates significant federalism concerns. We respectfully request that this Court clarify the scienter requirements of Section 841(a)(1) and reject the legal exceptionalism embraced by several federal circuits that have determined to apply good faith to the actus rea rather than the mens rea requirements of the statute. The CSAâ€™s reach should only extend to practitioners who knowingly or intentionally (i.e., not with subjective good faith) depart from their controlled substances authorization to prescribe outside the usual course of professional practice, thereby transforming legitimate prescribing into unlawful distribution. This the most coherent interpretation of the line between otherwise lawful activity (prescribing as authorized) and criminal distribution under Section 841(a)(1).","Oliva, Jennifer D.; Dineen Gillespie, Kelly K.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Brief+of+Amici+Curiae+Professors+of+Health+Law+and+Policy+in+Support+of+Petitioner,+Ruan+v.+United+States+(Merits+Stage)+(preprint);+controlled+substances+|+controlled+substances+act+|+prescribing+|+drug+distribution+|+opioids+|+mens+rea+|+good+faith","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-24","",28932,""

Here, we examine the mental health impact of everyday discrimination during the pandemic in a large and diverse cohort of the All of Us Research Program. Methods: Using repeated assessments of 62,651 participants in May to July of 2020, we fitted mixed-effects models to assess the effect of everyday discrimination on moderate to severe depression (Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 = 10) and suicidal ideation (PHQ-9 item 9 &gt; 0), and applied inverse probability weights to account for non-random probabilities of completing the voluntary survey. Results: Everyday discrimination was associated with increased odds of depression (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) [95% CI]: 1.21 [1.20 -1.22]) and suicidal ideation (1.17 [1.16-1.18]). For depression, the effects were larger in earlier phases of the pandemic (interaction p=8.2Ã—10-5), which varied by main reason for discrimination and self-reported race and ethnicity. Among those who identified race or ancestry/national origin(s) as a primary reason for discrimination, Asian and Black or African American participants had 24% and 17% increase in the odds of depression in May of 2020 (1.24 [1.17-1.31] and 1.17 [1.12-1.22]), respectively, versus a 3% and 7% increase in July (1.03 [0.96-1.10] and 1.07 [1.02-1.12]).

"Symptoms of depression and anxiety among Vietnamese immigrants in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)","We aimed to examine mental health status and related factors among Vietnamese immigrants in Japan during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic using data from an online cross-sectional survey administered from September 21 to October 21, 2021. Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scores were considered the main outcome measures. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors related to symptoms of depression and anxiety, and the chosen variables were entered simultaneously in the survey. Among 621 participants (age: 26.0Â±4.8 years;male: 347 [55.9%]) who completed the questionnaire, 73.7% reported a decrease in income when compared with the period before the COVID-19 pandemic, and 60.4% reported being recently affected by poor socioeconomic status. Moderate-to-severe symptoms of depression (PHQ-9 score =10 points) and mild-to-severe symptoms of anxiety (GAD-7 =5 points) were observed in 247 (39.8%) and 285 (45.9%) individuals, respectively. Factors related to depressive symptoms were being single (odds ratio [OR]=1.76, p=0.042), medical or psychiatric co-morbidity (OR=2.15, p&lt;0.001), and low socioeconomic status (OR=2.06, p&lt;0.001). Factors related to anxiety symptoms were being single (OR=1.72, p=0.044), medical or psychiatric co-morbidity (OR=2.52, p&lt;0.001), low socioeconomic status (OR=2.72, p&lt;0.001), and absence of a partner with whom to discuss oneâ€™s health (OR=1.66, p=0.013). The current findings demonstrate that, when compared with Japanese citizens, Vietnamese immigrants experienced a decrease in income, worsening working conditions, and poor mental health status during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings highlight the potential contribution of low socioeconomic status and social isolation to poor mental health status.","Yamashita, Tadashi, Quy, Pham Nguyen, Nogami, Emi, Seto-Suh, Erina, Yamada, Chika, Iwamoto, Saori, Shimazawa, Kyoko, Kato, Kenji","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.09.22271973","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-24","",28934,""
"Alcohol Consumption, Loneliness, Quality of Life, Social Media Usage, and General Anxiety Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Singapore (preprint)","This study aims to identify factors associated with anxiety levels of adults living in Singapore before the pandemic and during the COVID-19 outbreak. Data were collected using a cross-sectional web-based survey conducted from July to November 2020 accruing 264 eligible participants. Ordered logistic regression was used to assess Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), ranked as minimal (0-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10-14), and severe (15-21) before the pandemic and during the pandemic. About 74% of participants were female, 50% were aged 25-34, and 50% were married. The GAD-7 level went up from pre-pandemic for both moderate (from 12.5% to 16%) and severe GAD (from 2% to 11%). Alcohol consumption (AOR 1.79, 95% CI 1.04-3.06), loneliness (AOR 1.28, 95% CI 1.05-1.54), and difficulty in switching off social media (AOR 2.21, 95% CI 1.29-3.79) predicted increased GAD-7 levels. The quality of life (AOR 0.84, 95% CI 0.79-0.90) was significantly associated with decreased GAD-7 levels. The results heighten the awareness that early initiation of mental health support is crucial for the population in addition to the various financial support measures provided by the government as they are adapting to live with the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ung, Mengieng, Wan, Kalista Yearn Yee, Liu, Shi Yu, Choo, Ying Jie, Liew, Nathaniel Shan Wei, Shang, Zhexuan Azure, Khoo, Sophie Su Hui, Tay, Wei Xuan, Lin, Ruixi, Yi, Siyan","https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202203.0191.v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-24","",28935,""
"Effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health, daily and occupational activities among health professionals in Colombia: a cross-sectional study (preprint)","Background:  The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an unprecedented physical and mental burden on healthcare workers who are frequently at high risk of infection, particularly in low-income countries. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of anxiety, depression, and stress, as well as changes in daily and occupational activities among healthcare professionals due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Colombia. Methods: : An observational, cross-sectional study was conducted between February and June 2021. The survey incorporated validated mental health tools such as the Generalized Anxiety Disorderâ€“7, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and the Perceived Stress Scale-10. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the factors associated with severe mental health outcomes. Results: : Among 1345 healthcare workers the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress were 75.61%, 59.18%, and 53.09%, respectively. Anxiety (OR:1.44;95%CI:1.16-1.8), depression (OR:1.74;95%CI:1.27-2.37), and stress (OR:1.51;95%CI:1.18-1.94) were more frequent in women, and individuals who expressed fear of a negative outcome (death, sequelae) (OR:2.25;95%CI:1.60-3.25), (OR:1.49;95%CI:1.03-2.16) and (OR:2.36;95%CI:1.69-3.29) respectively. Age was negatively associated with anxiety (OR:0.98;95%CI:0.98-0.99), stress (OR:0.98;95%CI:0.97-0.99), and depression (OR:0.97;95% CI:0.96-0.98). Reduction in consultations and surgeries (OR:1.01;95%CI:1.0-1.01) was positively associated with anxiety. Due to the pandemic, most specialists expected to incorporate drastic long-term (&gt;1 year) changes in their clinical setting and daily activities. Conclusions: : The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress is higher among Colombian healthcare workers compared to previous reports.

"A systematic review and meta-analysis of Long COVID symptoms (preprint)","Background Ongoing symptoms or the development of new symptoms following a SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis has caused a complex clinical problem known as â€œ:Long COVIDâ€: (LC). This has introduced further pressure on global healthcare systems as there appears to be a need for ongoing clinical management of these patients. LC personifies heterogeneous symptoms at varying frequencies. The most complex symptoms appear to be driven by the neurology and neuropsychiatry spheres. Methods A systematic protocol was developed, peer reviewed and published in PROSPERO. The systematic review included publications from the 1 st of December 2019-30 th June 2021 published in English. Multiple electronic databases were used. The dataset has been analysed using a random-effects model and a subgroup analysis based on geographical location. Prevalence and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were established based on the data identified. Results Of the 302 studies, 49 met the inclusion criteria, although 36 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The 36 studies had a collective sample size of 11598 LC patients. 18 of the 36 studies were designed as cohorts and the remainder were cross-sectional. Symptoms of mental health, gastrointestinal, cardiopulmonary, neurological, and pain were reported. Conclusions The quality that differentiates this meta-analysis is that they are cohort and cross-sectional studies with follow-up. It is evident that there is limited knowledge available of LC and current clinical management strategies may be suboptimal as a result. Clinical practice improvements will require more comprehensive clinical research, enabling effective evidence-based approaches to better support patients.

"A Case Study Addressing Trauma Needs During COVID-19 Remote Learning From An Ecological Systems Theory Framework (preprint)","Mental health conditions related to trauma among American children are a concern, particularly because of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Children, as students, carry the trauma they encounter with them into the classroom. Students impacted by trauma learn differently due to effects on the brain that relate to several impairments, causing them to perform poorly in school. However, teachers may not always understand this issue. This case study shows how certain dynamics within the EST layers impacted one school during the pandemic. The purpose of this study was to examine how teachers at the school experienced a traumaâ€“informed online PD and SEL program intended to improve student outcomes, teacher perceptions, and teacherâ€“student relationships. The six participants included teachers in a K-8 low-income, minority population charter school. The assessment tools used were the Teacherâ€“Student Relationship Scale, Teacher Perception Scale, and Student Outcomes Survey. The teachersâ€™ outlook on SEL improved, particularly online. This improvement helped the teachers implement community circles and SEL infused with mindfulness in their online classrooms, which may have helped them maintain their relationships with the students and may have helped the students with academic and stress outcomes. During unprecedented times, the maintenance, rather than the deterioration, of student outcomes and teacherâ€“student relationships is an accomplishment and an area that necessitates further research.","Mahmud, Sharmeen","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1313437/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-24","",28938,""
"Methadone Distribution Increased from 2010 to 2019 for Opioid Use Disorder Treatment in the US (preprint)","Objectives To identify US prescription trends in methadone distribution for OUD from 2010 to 2020. Methods The weight of methadone in grams distributed to OTPs per state was derived from the US Drug Enforcement Administrationâ€™s Automated Reports and Consolidated Ordering System. Methadone was adjusted for state population and compared across all fifty states and Washington DC from 2010 to 2020. Results The overall distribution of methadone to OTPs significantly (P &lt; 0.0001) increased from 2010 to 2019 (+61.0%) and from 2015 to 2020 (+26.22%). The states with the highest percent change from 2010 to 2020 were Montana (+897.02%), Alaska (+421.11%), and Vermont (+353.67%). In contrast with prior increase of distribution, from 2019 (pre-COVID-19 pandemic) to 2020 (during pandemic), there was no significant change in the distribution of methadone to OTPs (-0.09%). Ohio (+26.02%) significantly increased while Alabama (-21.96%), New Hampshire (-24.13%) and Florida (-28.97%) significantly decreased methadone relative to the national mean. Conclusions This investigation revealed two trends related to methadone distribution in the US: increased utilization over the past decade and a plateau in utilization from 2019 to 2020.

"The Development And Psychometric Evaluation Of COVID-19 Staff Questionnaire For Infectious Disease Outbreak Readiness And Preparedness (SQIDORP) (preprint)","Background:  The COVID-19 pandemic has inundated the capacity of hospitals across the globe, exhausting resources, and placing extreme burden on health care workers (HCWs). Hospital preparedness during infectious disease outbreak involves development and implementation of appropriate strategies, procedures, and adequate training for HCWs. Reliable and valid tools to evaluate the perception of HCWs on the effectiveness of hospital preparedness strategies are imperative and literature is yet to fill that gap. Methods: : Items for â€˜The Staff Questionnaire for Infectious Disease Outbreak Readiness and Preparedness (SQIDORP)â€™ were selected from literature that addressed hospital preparedness during novel pandemic outbreaks. The SQIDORP was distributed within a regional hospital in Victoria, Australia. Psychometric evaluation included estimates of reliability and factor analysis while factors associated with the questionnaire were explored using regression analysis. Results: : Omega coefficient of 0.89, Cronbachâ€™s alpha coefficient of 0.88 and item-total correlations (&gt;0.3) indicated adequate reliability of the SQIDORP. Factor Analysis yielded three meaningful latent factors that are effectiveness of training (Factor 1), self-confidence (Factor 2) and risk to self and stress (Factor 3). Demographic factors did not influence the correlation with SQIDORP. However, rating â€˜ the current plan for management of COVID-19 in your ward â€™ and â€˜ personal knowledge/skills in caring for patients with COVID-19 â€™ had significant positive correlation and accounted for 33% of the variance in readiness and preparedness using SQIDORP (R2=0.33, F=10.227, P &lt;0.001). Conclusion:  Most of the items of SQIDORP questionnaire achieved adequate internal consistence reliability. This is a valuable tool that can be utilized by hospitals to explore aspects of preparedness and give insights to the knowledge, skills, and mental health of HCWs, as perceived by the HCW themselves.","Jokwiro, Yangama, Urbanavicius, Tracy, Robinson, Ainsley, Scott, Cathy, Islam, Md Rafiqul","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1436373/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-24","",28941,""
"Virtual Assessment of Patients with Dry Eye Disease During the COVID-19 Pandemic: One clinicianâ€™s experience (preprint)","Objectives To report on 1) the impact of DED on social, mental, and financial well-being, and 2) the use of virtual consultations to assess DED during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design & Methods An exploratory retrospective review of 35 charts. Telephone consultations for patients with DED conducted during the first lock-down period in Ontario in 2020 were reviewed. Results The most commonly reported DED symptoms were ocular dryness, visual disturbances, and burning sensation. The most common dry eye management practices were artificial tears, warm compresses, and omega-3 supplements. 20.0% of charts documented worsening of DED symptoms since the onset of the pandemic and 17.1% reported the lockdown had negatively affected their ability to perform DED management practices. 42.8% of patients reported an inability to enjoy their daily activities due to DED symptoms. 52.0% reported feeling either depressed, anxious, or both with 26.9% of patients accepting a referral to a social worker for counselling support. More than a quarter of the charts recorded financial challenges associated with the cost of therapy, and more than a fifth of patients reported that financial challenges were a direct barrier to accessing therapy. Conclusions Patients living with DED reported that their symptoms negatively affected their daily activities including mental health and financial challenges, that in turn impacted treatment practices. These challenges may have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Telephone consultations may be an effective modality to assess DED symptom severity, the impact of symptoms on daily functioning, and the need for counselling and support. AUTHOR SUMMARY Dry Eye Disease occurs when your tears do not provide enough lubrication for your eyes, which can be caused by either decreased tear production, or by poor quality tears. This study reviewed 35 patient charts to examine 1) the impact of Dry Eye Disease on patientsâ€™ well-being, and 2) the use of telephone appointments to assess Dry Eye Disease during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients reported an inability to enjoy their daily activities due to symptoms of dry eye including burning sensation and blurred vision. Over half of patients reported mental health challenges. Over a quarter of patients reported that financial challenges prevented them from treating their Dry Eye Disease, such as affording eye drops, dietary supplements, and appointments to see their optometrist. These findings highlight that healthcare providers should considering quality of life, mental health, and financial challenges when treating patients with Dry Eye Disease. Through the experience of an ophthalmologist who specializes in Dry Eye Disease, telephone appointments may be an effective way to assess Dry Eye Disease symptoms, the impact of symptoms on daily functioning, and the need for counselling and support.","Ibrahim, Pierre, McKenna, Caroline, Mather, Rookaya","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.07.22272050","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-24","",28942,""

"Mental health consequences of COVID-19 in house staff physicians (preprint)","Background:  A new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was associated with a newly identified respiratory syndrome, COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, in early December 2019. SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread across the globe, imposing increased working hours and workloads for healthcare workers. We have evaluated the prevalence of mental health outcomes and associated factors in house staff physicians in Panama. Methods: : A cross-sectional study was undertaken from July 23, 2020, to August 13, 2020. Snowball sampling was used to recruit participants. Then, an electronic questionnaire with scales to evaluate anxiety disorders (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9) and post-traumatic stress (IES-R) was administered. In addition, socio-demographic variables, clinical history of mental disorders and COVID-19 exposure were evaluated. Independent analyses for each mental health outcome were undertaken using a logistic regression analysis. Results: : A total of 517/1,205 (42.9%) interns and residents were recruited nationwide. The overall prevalence of depression symptoms was 25.3%, 13.7% for anxiety and 12.2% for post-traumatic stress. At least 9.3% participants reported having suicidal ideation. The most parsimonious model showed females had a higher prevalence of mental health disorders across results, and married participants were more likely to present depression (OR, 1.73;95% CI, 1.03-2.91;P = 0.039) or at least one mental health disorder (OR, 1.66;95% CI, 1.03-2.68;P = 0.039).

"The Wellbeing In Place Perceptions Scale: Structure, Validity, Reliability and Correlates during COVID times (preprint)","The influence of place-based factors on the physical and mental health of residents is well established and acknowledged within the population health approach to addressing health and wellbeing inequalities. The COVID-19 pandemic brought to the fore the issues that global communities face. The current UK policy context of â€˜levelling upâ€™ represents these concerns and the need to address them. This research examines perceptions of community wellbeing and its determinants as collected within a city region of the North West Coast of England during COVID restrictions between June and August 2020. The paper aims to establish the structure, construct validity and reliability of a new measure of community wellbeing - the Wellbeing in Place Perceptions Scale. Further, it aims to examine how this measure of community wellbeing correlated with symptoms of common mental health as reported by residents of this relatively disadvantaged city region during this unprecedented time. Results indicate that the WIPPS has a reliable and valid structure, correlating significantly with another widely used measure of sense of community and with the Index of Multiple Deprivation. Its relationship to self-reported common mental distress is also clear. Though in need of replication and longitudinal testing, the findings reported here on this new measure remind us that individual and place-based factors combine to influence wellbeing and that community needs to have an increasingly influential role to sustainably prevent future mental health challenges.","Corcoran, Rhiannon, Gomez, Katalin Ujhelyi, Simpson, Grace, Goodall, Mark, Bennett, Kate, Gabbay, Mark, Wilson, Tim, Obe, Dorcas Akeju, Pennington, Andy, Bagnall, Anne-Marie, South, Jane","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1441996/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-24","",28946,""
"dePression, ANxiety, and acaDEMIC Performance in COVID-19: Pandemic A Cross-sectional Study (preprint)","Depression and anxiety are common after months of social isolation, and they can have a negative impact on anyone's quality of life if they are not treated promptly and appropriately. The purpose of this study was to determine whether undergraduate and graduate students preferred classroom or online classes and to determine whether the existence of sadness or anxiety connected to the COVID-19 pandemic changed their view of their academic achievement. A cross-sectional design was used in this investigation. To determine the presence of mental health disorders in undergraduate and graduate students, we employed the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) depression screening scale and the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) anxiety screening scale. We examined whether these diseases changed students' perceptions of their academic success using the Academic Self-Concept Scale (ASCS). 610 students responded to the survey. When questioned about their preferred class type, 581 students (95.2 percent) said that they preferred classroom classes. The average score on the Academic Self-Concept Scale was 2.760.35.

"Clinical, Functional, and Mental Health Outcomes in Kidney Transplant Recipients 3 Mo After a Diagnosis of COVID-19","Kidney transplant patients are at high risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related mortality. However, limited data are available on longer-term clinical, functional, and mental health outcomes in patients who survive COVID-19. We analyzed data from adult kidney transplant patients in the European Renal Association COVID-19 Database who presented with COVID-19 between February 1, 2020, and January 31, 2021. We included 912 patients with a mean age of 56.7 (Ã‚Â±13.7) y. 26.4% were not hospitalized, 57.5% were hospitalized without need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and 16.1% were hospitalized and admitted to the ICU. At 3 mo follow-up survival was 82.3% overall, and 98.8%, 84.2%, and 49.0%, respectively, in each group. At 3 mo follow-up biopsy-proven acute rejection, need for renal replacement therapy, and graft failure occurred in the overall group in 0.8%, 2.6%, and 1.8% respectively, and in 2.1%, 10.6%, and 10.6% of ICU-admitted patients, respectively. Of the surviving patients, 83.3% and 94.4% reached their pre-COVID-19 physician-reported functional and mental health status, respectively, within 3 mo. Of patients who had not yet reached their prior functional and mental health status, their treating physicians expected that 79.6% and 80.0%, respectively, still would do so within the coming year. ICU admission was independently associated with a low likelihood to reach prior functional and mental health status. In kidney transplant recipients alive at 3-mo follow-up, clinical, physician-reported functional, and mental health recovery was good for both nonhospitalized and hospitalized patients. Recovery was, however, less favorable for patients who had been admitted to the ICU.","Duivenvoorden, Vart, Noordzij, Soares Dos Santos, Zulkarnaev, Franssen, Kuypers, Demir, Rahimzadeh, Kerschbaum, Jager, Turkmen, Hemmelder, Schouten, RodrÃƒÂ­guez-Ferrero, Crespo, Gansevoort, Hilbrands, van der Net, Essig, du Buf-Vereijken, van Ginneken, Maas, Vogt, van Jaarsveld, Bemelman, Klingenberg-Salahova, Heenan-Vos, Vervloet, Nurmohamed, Abramowicz, Verhofstede, Maoujoud, Malfait, Fialova, Melilli, FavÃƒÂ , Cruzado, Montero Perez, Lips, Krepel, Adilovic, Hengst, Konings, Rydzewski, Braconnier, Weis, Gellert, Oliveira, Alferes, Radulescu, Zakharova, Ambuehl, Guidotti, Walker, Lepeytre, RabatÃƒÂ©, Rostoker, Marques, Azasevac, Strazmester Majstorovic, Katicic, Ten Dam, KrÃƒÂ¼ger, Brzosko, Liakopoulos, Zanen, Logtenberg, Fricke, Kuryata, Slebe, Abd ElHafeez, Kemlin, van de Wetering, Reinders, Hesselink, Kal-van Gestel, Eiselt, Kielberger, El-Wakil, Verhoeven, Logan, Canal, Facundo, Ramos, Debska-Slizien, Veldhuizen, Tigka, Polyzou Konsta, Panagoutsos, Mallamaci, Postorino, Cambareri, Matceac, Nistor, Covic, Groeneveld, Jousma, van Buren, Diekmann, Oppenheimer, Blasco, Assis Pereira, Arias-Cabrales, LlinÃƒÂ s-Mallol, Buxeda, TÃƒÂ rrega, Redondo-Pachon, Jimenez, Mendoza-Valderrey, Martins, Mateus, Alvila, Laranjinha, Hofstra, Siezenga, Franco, Arroyo, Castellano, Balda Manzanos, Sosa Barrios, Lemahieu, Bartelet, Burak Dirim, Sukru Sever, Turkmen, Ã…Å¾afak, Hollander, BÃƒÂ¼ttner, de Vries, Meziyerh, van der Helm, Mallat, Bouwsma, Sridharan, Petruliene, Maloney, Verberk, van der Sande, Christiaans, Mohan Kumar, Di Luca, TuÃ„Å¸lular, Kramer, Beerenhout, Luik, Tiefenthaler, Watschinger, Adema, Stepanov, Gandolfini, Maggiore, Fliedner, Ãƒâ€¦sberg, Mjoen, Miyasato, de Fijter, Mongera, Pini, de Biase, Kerckhoffs, van de Logt, Maas, Lebedeva, Lopez, Reichert, Verhave, Titov, Parshina, Zanoli, Marcantoni, van Kempen, van Gils-Verrij, Harty, Meurs, Myslak, Battaglia, Lentini, den Deurwaarder, Stendahl, Rychlik, Cabezas-Reina, Maria Roca, Nauta, Sahin, Goffin, Kanaan, Labriola, Devresse, Diaz-Mareque, Coca, de Arriba, Meijers, Naesens, Desschans, Tonnerlier, Wissing, Dedinska, Pessolano, Malik, Dounousi, Papachristou, Berger, Meijer, Sanders, Ãƒâ€“zyilmaz, ButuroviÃ„â€¡ Ponikvar, Marn Pernat, Kovac, Arnol, Ekart, Abrahams, Molenaar, van Zuilen, Meijvis, Dolmans, Tantisattamo, Esposito, Krzesinski, Barahira, Gallieni, Martin-Moreno, Guglielmetti, Guzzo, Toapanta, Jose Soler, Luik, van Kuijk, Stikkelbroeck, Hermans, Rimsevicius, Righetti, Islam, Heitink-Ter Braak","https://doi.org/10.1097/TP.0000000000004075","20220323","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-24","",28948,""

"Seasonality of Pediatric Mental Health Emergency Department Visits, School, and COVID-19","The aim of this study was to explore how the academic calendar, and by extension school-year stressors, contributes to the seasonality of pediatric mental health emergency department (ED) visits. The authors reviewed all pediatric mental health ED visits at a large urban medical center from 2014 to 2019. Patients who were younger than 18 years at time of presentation, were Durham residents, and had a primary payer of Medicaid were included in the sample population, and the dates of ED visits of the sample population were compared against dates of academic semesters and summer/winter breaks of a relevant school calendar. Of patients with multiple ED visits, only the first ED presentation was included, and descriptive statistics and a rate ratio were used to describe the study group and identify the rate of ED visits during semesters compared with breaks. Among the sample population from 2014 to 2019, there were 1004 first pediatric mental health ED visits. Of these ED visits, the average number of visits per week during summer/winter breaks was 2.2, and the average number of visits per week during academic semester dates was 3.4. The rate of ED visits was significantly greater during academic semesters compared with breaks (Rate Ratio, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-2.0; P &lt; 0.001). Children may be at greater risk of behavioral health crises or having increased mental needs when school is in session. As many children's mental health has worsened during the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, these findings highlight the need for increased mental health services in the school setting as children return to in-person learning. In addition, it may benefit health systems to plan behavioral health staffing around academic calendars.","Copeland, Babyak, Inscoe, Maslow","https://doi.org/10.1097/PEC.0000000000002671","20220323","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-24","",28950,""
"App-Based Ecological Momentary Assessment to Enhance Clinical Care for Postpartum Depression: Pilot Acceptability Study","Wearable tracking devices and mobile health technology are increasingly used in an effort to enhance clinical care and the delivery of personalized medical treatment. Postpartum depression is the most frequently diagnosed complication of childbirth; however, significant gaps in screening and treatment remain. This study aims to investigate the clinical utility, predictive ability, and acceptability of using ecological momentary assessment to collect daily mood, sleep, and activity data through the use of an Apple Watch and mobile app among women with postpartum depression. This was a pilot study consisting of 3 in-person research visits over the course of a 6-week enrollment period. Questionnaires to assess depression, anxiety, and maternal functioning were periodically collected, along with daily self-reported symptoms and passively collected physiological data via an Apple Watch. Feedback was collected from study participants and the study clinician to determine the utility and acceptability of daily tracking. Logistic regression was used to determine whether mood scores in the 2 weeks before a visit predicted scores at follow-up. Compliance with daily assessments was also measured. Of the 26 women enrolled, 23 (88%) completed the 6-week study period. On average, the participants completed 67% (34.4/51.5 days) of all active daily assessments and 74% (38/51.5 days) of all passive measures. Furthermore, all 23 participants completed the 3 required visits with the research team. Predictive correlations were found between self-reported mood and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score at follow-up, self-reported anxiety and EDPS, and sleep quality and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Using ecological momentary assessment to track daily symptoms of postpartum depression using a wearable device was largely endorsed as acceptable and clinically useful by participants and the study clinician and could be an innovative solution to increase care access during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Krohn, Guintivano, Frische, Steed, Rackers, Meltzer-Brody","https://doi.org/10.2196/28081","20220323","depression; ecological momentary assessment (EMA); mHealth; mobile apps; mobile health; mobile phone; personalized care; postpartum care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-24","",28951,""
"Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Healthcare Providers: Policy Implications for Pandemic Recovery","Notably higher rates of mental health issues have been reported among healthcare providers (HCPs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Concerns over the impact of policy decisions on the well-being of HCPs is growing, yet it remains underexplored in the literature. HCPs from a 301-bed mental health hospital and a 408-bed acute care community hospital, both located in central Ontario, participated in interviews (N = 30) and answered open-ended questionnaires (N = 88) to provide their experiences with the COVID-19 pandemic. Using interpretive description methods, we found that public health policies and other strategies intended to mitigate COVID-19 transmission variably impacted HCP well-being and professional practice. Pandemic-related policies contributed to HCP stress by changing the healthcare environment and clinical practice. Understanding HCP experiences is key for leaders, policy makers and health system planners to deal with the current state, recovery and preparation for future pandemics. Direct input into policy development, implementation and evaluation from HCPs may support their well-being.","Limoges, Mclean, Anzola, Kolla","https://doi.org/10.12927/hcpol.2022.26728","20220323","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-24","",28952,""

"Low Dose Radiation Therapy Attenuates ACE2 Depression and Inflammatory Cytokines Induction by COVID-19 Viral Spike Protein in Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells","<b>Purpose:</b> Low-dose radiation therapy (LDRT) is an evidence-based anti-inflammatory treatment. In anti-COVID-19, our study suggests that low to moderate dose radiation of &lt;1.5Gy can inhibit the induction of inflammatory cytokine and attenuate the ACE2 depression induced by spike protein in human bronchial epithelial cells in COVID-19 infection. Our study provided further mechanistic evidence to support LDRT as a cost-effective treatment for COVID-19 to relieve the severe inflammatory reaction and lung injury. <b>Methods and Materials:</b> A cellular model was created by treating human bronchial epithelial cells (BEP2D) with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We used the qRT-PCR and ELISA analysis to identify the production of inflammatory cytokines. The BEP2D control cells and the spike-treated cells were irradiated using a single low to moderate dose radiation of 0.5Gy, 1Gy, and 1.5Gy. The inflammatory cytokines and ACE2 expression were detected at different time points. <b>Results:</b> The soluble SARS-CoV-2 spike protein stimulated the formation of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-ÃŽÂ± while reducing the ACE2 protein expression in human bronchial epithelial cells. A single low to moderate dose exposure of 0.5Ã¢â‚¬â€°Gy, 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°Gy, and 1.5Ã¢â‚¬â€°Gy could attenuate the IL-6 and TNF-ÃŽÂ± induction and rescue the depression of ACE2 by spike protein. Moreover, the spike protein increased the proteolytic degradation of ACE2 protein by promoting NEDD4-mediated ubiquitination of ACE2. <b>Conclusions:</b> The low-dose radiation can attenuate ACE2 depression and inflammatory response produced in the targeted human bronchial epithelial cells by spike protein. This coordinating effect of LDRT may relieve the severe inflammatory reaction and lung injury in COVID-19 patients.","Wen, Song, Bai, Zhao, Zhou, Gao, Guan, Song","https://doi.org/10.1080/09553002.2022.2055806","20220323","ACE2; COVID-19; Low Dose Radiation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-24","",28954,""
"EXPRESS: The impact of briefly observing faces in opaque facial masks on emotion recognition and empathic concern","Since the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in 2019, there have been global public health initiatives that have advocated for the community use of face masks to reduce spread of the virus. Although the community use of facial coverings has been deemed essential for public health, there have been calls for enquiries to ascertain how face masks may impact non-verbal methods of communication. The present study aimed to ascertain how the brief observations of faces in opaque facial coverings could impact facial emotion recognition. It was also an aim to ascertain if there was an association between levels of empathic concern and facial emotion recognition when viewing masked faces. An opportunity sample of 199 participants, who resided in the UK, were randomly assigned to briefly observe either masked (n = 102) or unmasked (n = 97) faces. Participants in both conditions were required to view a series of facial expressions, from the Radboud Faces Database, with models conveying the emotional states of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprised. Each face was presented to participants for a period of 250ms in the masked and unmasked conditions. A 6 (emotion type) x 2 (masked/unmasked condition) mixed ANOVA revealed that viewing masked faces significantly reduced facial emotion recognition of disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprised. However, there were no differences in the success rate of recognising the emotional state of anger between the masked and unmasked conditions. Furthermore, higher levels of empathic concern were associated with greater success in facially recognising the emotional state of disgust. The results of the present study suggest that significant reductions in emotion recognition, when viewing faces in opaque masks, can still be observed when people are exposed to facial stimuli for a brief period of time.","Shepherd, Rippon","https://doi.org/10.1177/17470218221092590","20220323","Emotion recognition; Facial expression; face masks; facial emotion recognition; non-verbal communication","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-24","",28955,""
"Home Health Aides' Increased Role in Supporting Older Veterans and Primary Healthcare Teams During COVID-19: a Qualitative Analysis","Home health aides are important but often overlooked members of care teams, providing functional and emotional support to patients. These services became increasingly important during the COVID-19 pandemic as older adults faced disruptions in in-person medical services and family caregiving. Understanding how aides supported healthcare teams is important for informing emergency planning and better integrating home health services with primary care. To describe aides' roles in supporting veterans and working with primary care teams during COVID-19 and identify COVID-related changes in tasks. Semi-structured interviews. Eight home health aides, 6 home health agency administrators, and 9 primary care team members (3 RNs, 3 social workers, 3 MDs) serving veterans at a large, urban, Veterans Affairs medical center. Combined deductive and inductive analysis to identify a priori concepts (aide roles; changes in tasks and new tasks during COVID-19) and emergent ideas. Aide, administrator, and provider interviews were analyzed separately and compared and contrasted to highlight emergent themes and divergent perspectives. Participants reported an increase in the volume and intensity of tasks that aides performed during the pandemic, as well as the shifting of some tasks from the medical care team and family caregivers to the aide. Four main themes emerged around aides' roles in the care team during COVID-19: (1) aides as physically present ""boots on the ground"" during medical and caregiving disruptions, (2) aides as care coordination support, (3) aides as mental health support, and (4) intensification of aides' work. Home health aides played a central role in coordinating care during the COVID-19 pandemic, providing hands-on functional, medical, and emotional support. Integrating aides more formally into healthcare teams and expanding their scope of practice in times of crisis and beyond may improve care coordination for older veterans.","Franzosa, Judon, Gottesman, Koufacos, Runels, Augustine, Hartmann, Boockvar","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-021-07271-w","20220323","COVID-19; geriatrics; home health; home health aides; primary care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-24","",28956,""

"Geography of Disparity: Connecting COVID-19 Vulnerability and Social Determinants of Health in Colorado","The COVID-19 pandemic has drawn greater attention to social determinants of health and associated health inequities, which disproportionately affect vulnerable populations and places in the U.S. In this study, we explored geographic patterns of local-level COVID-19 vulnerability and associations with social and health determinants across Colorado. To conceptualize social and health determinants and how together they generate risk and exposure, we integrated the concepts of social vulnerability and syndemic to situate COVID-19 vulnerability within a broader hazards of place framework. Using geospatial statistics and GIS, we estimated census tract-level rates of COVID-19, which are not yet available in Colorado, and mapped areas of high and low incidence risk. We also developed composite indices that characterized social and health vulnerabilities to measure multivariate associations with COVID-19 rates. The findings revealed hotspots of persistent risk in mountain communities since the pandemic emerged in Colorado, as well as clusters of risk in the Urban Front Range's central and southern counties, and across many parts of eastern Colorado. Vulnerability analyses indicate that COVID-19 rates were associated with mental health and chronic conditions along with social determinants that represent inequities in education, income, healthcare access, and race/ethnicity (minority percent of population), which may have disproportionately exposed some communities more than others to infection and severe health outcomes. Overall, the findings provide geographic health information about COVID-19 and vulnerability context, which may better inform local decision-making for interventions and policies that support equity of social determinants of health.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/08964289.2021.2021382 .","Lee, RamÃƒÂ­rez","https://doi.org/10.1080/08964289.2021.2021382","20220323","COVID-19; GIS; health disparity; social determinants of health; social vulnerability; syndemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-24","",28958,""
"Maternal mental health mediates the effects of pandemic-related stressors on adolescent psychopathology during COVID-19","This study examined whether COVID-19-related maternal mental health changes contributed to changes in adolescent psychopathology. A community sample of 226 adolescents (12Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old before COVID-19) and their mothers were asked to complete COVID-19 surveys early in the pandemic (April-May 2020, adolescents 14Ã¢â‚¬â€°years) and approximately 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°months later (November 2020-January 2021). Surveys assessed pandemic-related stressors (health, financial, social, school, environment) and mental health. Lower pre-pandemic family income-to-needs ratio was associated with higher pre-pandemic maternal mental health symptoms (anxiety, depression) and adolescent internalizing and externalizing problems, and with experiencing more pandemic-related stressors. Pandemic-related stressors predicted increases in maternal mental health symptoms, but not adolescent symptoms when other variables were covaried. Higher maternal mental health symptoms predicted concurrent increases in adolescent internalizing and externalizing. Maternal mental health mediated the effects of pre-pandemic income and pandemic-related stressors on adolescent internalizing and externalizing problems. Results indicate that adolescent mental health is closely tied to maternal mental health during community-level stressors such as COVID-19, and that pre-existing family economic context and adolescent symptoms increase risk for elevations in symptoms of psychopathology.","Lengua, Thompson, Kim, Rosen, Rodman, Kasparek, Mayes, Zalewski, Meltzoff, McLaughlin","https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.13610","20220323","COVID-19 pandemic; adolescent; externalizing; internalizing; maternal mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-24","",28959,""
"The prevalence and incidence of major depressive disorder in 8079 Chinese university freshmen before and during COVID-19","COVID-19 pandemic may impact the prevalence and incidence of depression in college students. However, there is no longitudinal study focusing on major depressive disorder (MDD) before and during COVID-19 pandemic. A cohort study was carried out among 8079 Chinese college freshmen. The baseline survey was conducted in 2018 (T0) and annual follow-ups were in 2019 (T1, before COVID-19) and in 2020 (T2, during COVID-19). CIDI-3.0 was used to diagnose MDD. Random effects logistic models of panel data analysis were used for the risk of MDD incidence. STATA 15.1 was used for all analysis. The weighted 12-month prevalence of MDD at T2 (2.10%) was significantly lower than that at T1 (2.67%) (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001). However, among students who reported exposure to the COVID-19 events, the annual prevalence of MDD at T2 was higher than that at T1 (4.21% vs. 2.79%, pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001). The incidence from T0 to T1, incidence from T1 to T2, and the 2-year incidence was 2.23%, 1.34% and 3.75%, respectively. Only 8.93% of MDD students had chosen to seek professional help during the COVID-19 pandemic period. The computer assisted CIDI may not be as sensitive and specific as the diagnosis made by a psychiatrist and may have caused report bias. Although the MDD incidence of college students was decreasing over time, the impact of the pandemic on student mental health may depend on exposure to COVID-19 events. Not seeking professional help in the Chinese college students is still an important issue.","Liu, Li, Hao, Liu, Su, Zhu, Tang, Wang, Wang, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.03.022","20220323","COVID-19; Longitudinal study; Major depressive disorder; University freshmen","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-24","",28960,""
"Consumption and ocurrence of antidepressants (SSRIs) in pre- and post-COVID-19 pandemic, their environmental impact and innovative removal methods: A review","Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are pharmaceuticals whose consumption has increased significantly. They are prescribed as first-line treatment in mental disorders such as depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, phobias, and anxiety; also, they are indicated as adjuvants in diseases such as fibromyalgia and bulimia nervosa. In addition to being linked to the illegal market to be consumed as recreational drugs. The relevance of this review lies in the fact that worldwide consumption has increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, due to the depression and anxiety that originated in the population. As a consequence of this increase in consumption, concentrations of SSRIs in the environment have increased, and these have become a relevant issue for toxicologists due to the effects that they could generate in different organisms, both aquatic and terrestrial. For this reason, the objective of this article was to do a critical evaluation of the existing data on the characteristics and physicochemical properties of SSRIs, consumption data during the COVID-19 pandemic, its occurrence in the environment and the reports of toxic effects that have been generated in different organisms; we also conclude with an updated review of different methods that have been used for their removal. With this analysis, it can be concluded that, despite SSRIs are pharmaceutical products widely studied since their launching to the market, still currently under investigation to clarify their mechanisms of action to understand the different effects on the organisms, adverse reactions, as well as possible toxicological effects on non-target organisms. On the other hand, it has been proven that although it is already possible to eliminate a significant percentage of SSRIs in the laboratory, due to their physicochemical characteristics and their behavior in complex mixtures in the environment, they have not yet been eradicated, showing a persistence in the soil, subsoil and surface waters of the entire planet that may represent a future risk.","Diaz-Camal, Cardoso-Vera, Islas-Flores, GÃƒÂ³mez-OlivÃƒÂ¡n, MejÃƒÂ­a-GarcÃƒÂ­a","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154656","20220323","COVID-19; Consumption; Environment; Ocurrence; SSRIs","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-24","",28961,""
"The new humanitarian crisis in Ukraine: Coping with the public health impact of hybrid warfare, mass migration, and mental health trauma","One of the largest mass movements of displaced people from their homelands in recent history must be recognized and assisted by the Free World. The unprovoked Russian attacks on Ukraine during February-March 2022 will leave long-lasting devastating effects on millions of innocent victims. Nations worldwide, especially NATO member countries, will need to intervene to ameliorate the situation. This letter describes major public health issues apart from the COVID-19 pandemic that are emerging concerns, such as shortages of healthcare professionals, chronic care treatments and health prevention services, disinformation communication campaigns affecting the healthcare infrastructure, and the generational impact of the conflict on people's mental health. A global response and public health support need immediate action including humanitarian assistance, food security, clean water supplies, adequate shelter, and safe transportation out of the active military zones.","Patel, Erickson","https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2022.70","20220323","Ukraine; conflict; humanitarian crisis; hybrid warfare; mass migration; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-24","",28962,""
"Exploring the impact of COVID-19 on substance use patterns and service access of street involved individuals in Kingston, Ontario: a qualitative study","This study aims to understand the experiences of street-involved individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic regarding substance use patterns and service access. With the collision of the COVID-19 pandemic and Canadian opioid epidemic came an increase in opioid related overdoses and increased barriers in accessing essential services since March 2020. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in June and July 2021, with 30 street-involved individuals in Kingston, Ontario. Analysis followed a phenomenological approach to qualitative research. Themes were coded by two independent researchers using NVIVO12. COVID-19 had detrimental effects on the lives of street-involved folks who use substances. Increased substance use to combat feelings of isolation and hopelessness related to loss of income and housing was commonly described. Increased fentanyl usage was considered the major contributor to the rise in overdoses over the pandemic. Restrictions on public access to businesses and services disproportionately impacted individuals with limited means. Harm reduction services and mental health support were considered extremely important throughout the pandemic. The coinciding COVID-19 pandemic and opioid epidemic place street-involved individuals who use substances in a uniquely dangerous position. As such, it is imperative that public policy decision-makers consider the differential needs of street-involved community members to provide safe, relevant, and compassionate solutions in future public health emergencies.","McCann, Allen, Purkey","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-12976-6","20220323","COVID-19; Harm reduction; Opioid epidemic; Public health; Qualitative research; Service access; Street involved; Substance use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-24","",28963,""
"COVID-19 Mitigation Among College Students: Social Influences, Behavioral Spillover, and Antibody Results","By fall 2020, students returning to U.S. university campuses were mandated to engage in COVID-19 mitigation behaviors, including masking, which was a relatively novel prevention behavior in the U.S. Masking became a target of university mandates and campaigns, and it became politicized. Critical questions are whether the influences of injunctive norms and response efficacy on one behavior (i.e. masking) spill over to other mitigation behaviors (e.g. hand-washing), and how patterns of mitigation behaviors are associated with clinical outcomes. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of college students who returned to campus (<i>N</i> = 837) to explore these questions, and conducted COVID-19 antibody testing on a subset of participants to identify correlations between behaviors and disease burden. The results showed that college students were more likely to intend to wear face masks as they experienced more positive injunctive norms, liberal political views, stronger response efficacy for masks, and less pessimism. Latent class analysis revealed four mitigation classes: <i>Adherents</i> who intended to wear face masks and engage in the other COVID-19 mitigation behaviors; <i>Hygiene Stewards</i> and <i>Masked Symptom Managers</i> who intended to wear masks but only some other behaviors, and <i>Refusers</i> who intended to engage in no mitigation behaviors. Importantly, the <i>Hygiene Stewards</i> and <i>Refusers</i> had the highest likelihood of positive antibodies; these two classes differed in their masking intentions, but shared very low likelihoods of physical distancing from others and avoiding crowds or mass gatherings. The implications for theories of normative influences on novel behaviors, spillover effects, and future messaging are discussed.","Smith, Small, Bharti, DeMatte, Lennon, Ferrari","https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2022.2049047","20220323","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-24","",28964,""
"Cross-sectional study of traumatic stress disorder in frontline nurses 6 mo after the outbreak of the COVID-19 in Wuhan","Frontline nurses in Wuhan directly fighting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 diseases are at a high risk of infection and are extremely susceptible to psychological stress, especially due to the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The psychological after-effects of this public health emergency on frontline nurses will last for years. To assess factors influencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among frontline nurses in Wuhan 6 mo after the COVID-19 pandemic began. A total of 757 frontline nurses from five hospitals in Wuhan, China, participated in an online survey from July 27 to August 13, 2020. This cross-sectional online study used a demographic information questionnaire, the PTSD Checklist for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-4. The chi-square test and logistic regression were used to analyze the association of demographics, COVID-19-related variables, and PTSD. Logistic regression was also conducted to investigate which variables were associated with PTSD outcomes. A total of 13.5%, 24.3%, and 21.4% of the frontline nurses showed symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety, respectively. The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the following factors were strongly associated with PTSD: Having a relative, friend, or colleague who died of COVID-19; experiencing stigma; or having psychological assistance needs, depressive symptoms or anxiety. Showing resilience and receiving praise after the COVID-19 outbreak were protective factors. Frontline nurses still experienced PTSD (13.5%) six months after the COVID-19 outbreak began. Peer support, social support, official recognition, reward mechanisms, exercise, better sleep, and timely provision of information (such as vaccine research progress) by the government <i>via</i> social media, and adequate protective supplies could mitigate the level of PTSD among nurses responding to COVID-19. Stigmatization, depression, and anxiety might be associated with a greater risk of PTSD among nurses.","Zhou, Yuan, Tao, Huang, Zhan, Gui, Li, Liu, Li","https://doi.org/10.5498/wjp.v12.i2.338","20220323","COVID-19; Frontline nurses; Mental health; Pandemic; Post-traumatic stress disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-24","",28965,""
"Psychoemotional Disorders and Sleep Impairments in Patients with COVID-19","<b>Objectives.</b> To study the prevalence of anxious-depressive disorders and sleep impairments in their structure among patients hospitalized with the new coronavirus infections (COVID-19) and to develop differential guidelines for their treatment in COVID-19 patients. <b>Materials and methods.</b> This report presents preliminary results from our own observations. We report here analysis of data from 119 patients (age 47-69 years, male and female) obtained at detailed interviews, including using telemedicine technologies, with evaluation on the following scales: the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20) for subjective assessment of asthenia, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). <b>Results.</b> Results on the HADS indicated that clinically severe anxious-depressive symptomatology was seen in 33 of 119 patients (28%) hospitalized with diagnoses of COVID-19: of these, 11% of cases (<i>n</i> = 13) showed clinical signs of significant anxiety only, while five (4%) showed clinically significant depression and 13% displayed increases on both the anxiety and depression subscales (<i>n</i> = 15). Increases on the MFI-20 scale (&gt;20 points) were seen in 87 patients (73%) and sleep impairments on the PSQI were recorded in 32 patients (27%). <b>Conclusions.</b> The results of this study showed that most patients with COVID-19 had not only depressive symptomatology, but also anxious and hypochondriac disorders, asthenic symptom complex, and sleep impairments with difficulty going to sleep and poor sleep quality. Differential guidelines were developed for the treatment of these states taking account of the side effects of the drugs prescribed, interactions between drugs, and the features of the patients' somatic condition. Drug selection must be based on the severity of the impairments found.","Samushiya, Kryzhanovsky, Ragimova, Berishvili, Chorbinskaya, Ivannikova","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11055-022-01229-z","20220323","COVID-19; anxious-depressive disorders; asthenic syndrome; depression; sleep impairment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-24","",28966,""
"Attachment Style and Childhood Traumatic Experiences Moderate the Impact of Initial and Prolonged COVID-19 Pandemic: Mental Health Longitudinal Trajectories in a Sample of Italian Women","The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health has not been clarified yet, with multiple studies warranting a special focus on women and young adults. A sample of 101 Italian women recruited from the general population was evaluated a few weeks before the onset of the pandemic and during the first and the second wave of the pandemic. Depression values at the Brief Symptom Inventory showed an initial increase followed by a stabilization on higher values in respect to the baseline, whereas Phobic Anxiety was stably worsened. Participants with insecure attachment styles and childhood trauma showed higher levels of distress at all timepoints. In many psychopathological domains, moderation analysis showed an unfavorable trend over time for younger participants. The present study seems to confirm a high burden on mental health for women during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting young age, insecure attachment style, and childhood trauma as negative prognostic factors.","Castellini, Tarchi, Cassioli, Rossi, Sanfilippo, Innocenti, Gironi, Scami, Ricca","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-022-00798-x","20220323","COVID-19; Lockdown; Pandemics; Psychopathology; Quarantine; Women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-24","",28967,""

"Psychological impact of suspension/postponement of fertility treatments on infertile women waiting during COVID pandemic","To assess the psychological impact of suspension/postponement of various fertility treatments on infertile women during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This was a cross-sectional study conducted as an online survey among infertile women consulting either through teleconsultation or physical consultation at a fertility clinic of a tertiary care referral unit. A validated questionnaire was given as a WhatsApp link to the women who were consulting for the resumption of services. Questions asked were based on their socio-demographic parameters, fertility treatment at the time of suspension, anxiety (self-reported) and stress (perceived stress scale-4, PSS-4) due to delay in treatment, psychosocial effect of pandemic, and wishes regarding the resumption of fertility services. Of 430 patients who received the questionnaire, 250 completed the survey (response rate: 58%). The mean age of participants was 29.26Ã‚Â±4.18 years and the majority (70.4%) had lower socioeconomic status. The average PSS-4 score was 7.8Ã‚Â±0.71, and the prevalence of self-reported anxiety was 72%. Those who suffered migration during the pandemic had significantly higher PSS-4 scores, and increasing age was associated with increased self-reported anxiety due to the suspension of fertility services. The top three priorities reported were infertility and treatment delay (48.4%), job loss (19.2%), and the risk of contracting COVID-19 infection (16%). The degree of spousal support was significantly correlated with lower PSS-4 scores (r=-0.30, P&lt;0.01). On multivariate logistic analysis, duration of infertility, delay in treatment due to suspension of services, and fear of COVID-19 infection were significant predictors of stress and anxiety. This study emphasizes the need to investigate psychosocial health and to provide psychological support to this vulnerable population in addition to triaging fertility treatments in a phased manner.","Jaiswal, Mahey, Singh, Vanamail, Gupta, Cheluvaraju, Sharma, Bhatla","https://doi.org/10.5468/ogs.21254","20220323","COVID-19; Health services accessibility; In-vitro fertilisation; Infertility; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-24","",28969,""
