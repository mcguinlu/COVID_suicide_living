"Interplay between the Genetics of Personality Traits, severe Psychiatric Disorders, and COVID-19 Host Genetics in the Susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 Infection","Background The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, with all its impacts on our way of life, is affecting our experiences and mental health. Notably, individuals with mental disorders have been reported to have a higher risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2. Personality traits could represent an important determinant of preventative health behavior and, therefore, the risk of contracting the virus. Aims We examined overlapping genetic underpinnings between major psychiatric disorders, personality traits, and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods Linkage disequilibrium score regression was used to explore the genetic correlations of COVID-19 susceptibility with psychiatric disorders and personality traits based on data from the largest available respective genome-wide association studies (GWAS). In two cohorts (the PsyCourse (n=1346) and the HeiDE (n=3266) study), polygenic risk scores were used to analyze if a genetic association between, psychiatric disorders, personality traits, and COVID-19 susceptibility exists in individual-level data. Results We observed no significant genetic correlations of COVID-19 susceptibility with psychiatric disorders. For personality traits, there was a significant genetic correlation for COVID-19 susceptibility with extraversion (p=1.47x10-5; rg=0.284). Yet, this was not reflected in individual-level data from the PsyCourse and HeiDE studies. Conclusions We identified no significant correlation between genetic risk factors for severe psychiatric disorders and genetic risk for COVID-19 susceptibility. Among the personality traits, extraversion showed evidence for a positive genetic association with COVID-19 susceptibility, in one but not in another setting. Overall, these findings highlight a complex contribution of genetic and non-genetic components in the interaction between COVID-19 susceptibility and personality traits or mental disorders.","Urs Heilbronner; Fabian Streit; Thomas Vogl; Fanny Senner; Schaupp Sabrina; Daniela Reich-Erkelenz; Sergi Papiol; Mojtaba Oraki Kohshour; Farahnaz Klohn-Saghatolislam; Janos L Kalman; Heilbronner Maria; Katrin Gade; Ashley L Comes; Monika Budde; Till FM Andlauer; Heike Anderson-Schmidt; Kristina Adorjan; Til Sturmer; Adrian Loerbroks; Manfred Amelang; Eric Poisel; Jerome Foo; Stefanie Heilmann-Heimbach; Andreas J Forstner; Franziska Degenhardt; Jorg Zimmermann; Jens Wiltfang; Martin von Hagen; Carsten Spitzer; Max Schmauss; Eva Reininghaus; Jens Reimer; Carsten Konrad; Georg Juckel; Fabian U Lang; Markus Jager; Christian Figge; Andreas J Fallgatter; Detlef E Dietrich; Udo Dannlowski; Bernhardt T Baune; Volker Arolt; Ion-George Anghelescu; Markus M Nothen; Stephanie H Witt; Ole A Andreassen; Chi-Hua Chen; Peter Falkai; Marcella Rietschel; Thomas G Schulze; Eva C Schulte","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.12.21263447","20210914","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-15","",17966,""

"Evaluating the frequency of English language requirements in clinical trial eligibility criteria: A systematic analysis using ClinicalTrialsgov","A number of prior studies have demonstrated that research participants with limited English proficiency in the United States are routinely excluded from clinical trial participation. Systematic exclusion through study eligibility criteria that require trial participants to be able to speak, read, and/or understand English affects access to clinical trials and scientific generalizability. We sought to establish the frequency with which English language proficiency is required and, conversely, when non-English languages are affirmatively accommodated in US interventional clinical trials for adult populations. We used the advanced search function on ClinicalTrials.gov specifying interventional studies for adults with at least 1 site in the US. In addition, we used these search criteria to find studies with an available posted protocol. A computer program was written to search for evidence of English or Spanish language requirements, or the posted protocol, when available, was manually read for these language requirements. Of the 14,367 clinical trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov between 1 January 2019 and 1 December 2020 that met baseline search criteria, 18.98% (95% CI 18.34%-19.62%; n = 2,727) required the ability to read, speak, and/or understand English, and 2.71% (95% CI 2.45%-2.98%; n = 390) specifically mentioned accommodation of translation to another language. The remaining trials in this analysis and the following sub-analyses did not mention English language requirements or accommodation of languages other than English. Of 2,585 federally funded clinical trials, 28.86% (95% CI 27.11%-30.61%; n = 746) required English language proficiency and 4.68% (95% CI 3.87%-5.50%; n = 121) specified accommodation of other languages; of the 5,286 industry-funded trials, 5.30% (95% CI 4.69%-5.90%; n = 280) required English and 0.49% (95% CI 0.30%-0.69%; n = 26) accommodated other languages. Trials related to infectious disease were less likely to specify an English requirement than all registered trials (10.07% versus 18.98%; relative risk [RR] = 0.53; 95% CI 0.44-0.64; p &lt; 0.001). Trials related to COVID-19 were also less likely to specify an English requirement than all registered trials (8.18% versus 18.98%; RR = 0.43; 95% CI 0.33-0.56; p &lt; 0.001). Trials with a posted protocol (n = 366) were more likely than all registered clinical trials to specify an English requirement (36.89% versus 18.98%; RR = 1.94, 95% CI 1.69-2.23; p &lt; 0.001). A separate analysis of studies with posted protocols in 4 therapeutic areas (depression, diabetes, breast cancer, and prostate cancer) demonstrated that clinical trials related to depression were the most likely to require English (52.24%; 95% CI 40.28%-64.20%). One limitation of this study is that the computer program only searched for the terms ""English"" and ""Spanish"" and may have missed evidence of other language accommodations. Another limitation is that we did not differentiate between requirements to read English, speak English, understand English, and be a native English speaker; we grouped these requirements together in the category of English language requirements. A meaningful percentage of US interventional clinical trials for adults exclude individuals who cannot read, speak, and/or understand English, or are not native English speakers. To advance more inclusive and generalizable research, funders, sponsors, institutions, investigators, institutional review boards, and others should prioritize translating study materials and eliminate language requirements unless justified either scientifically or ethically.","Muthukumar, Morrell, Bierer","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003758","20210914","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-15","",17968,""
"Neuropsychology trainee concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic: A 2021 follow-up survey","As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the impact on neuropsychology trainees continues to evolve. This paper describes the results of a survey of neuropsychology trainee (graduate student through postdoctoral resident) perspectives on the COVID-19 pandemic and compares them to a previous survey conducted in Spring 2020. The survey used several questions from the 2020 survey and added applicable new questions based on the results of the 2020 survey. The survey was distributed to listservs, training directors, and student organizations in neuropsychology with snowball sampling used. Respondents were primarily female (82.4%) and white (63%). The majority of trainees (66%) reported loss of clinical hours. Interestingly, the average training time missed was approximately 3.36Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks (SD = 9.27). Trainees continue to report that they have experienced increased anxiety, depression, and stress since the beginning of the pandemic; however, compared to a prior survey, rates of increased anxiety/stress remained stable, but more trainees reported increased depression. Approximately 31% of trainees reported that they were differentially impacted by the pandemic due to racial/ethnic background and female trainees were more likely to report increased personal stress, anxiety and depression than their male counterparts. Results suggest continued wide-reaching pandemic related impacts on neuropsychology trainees. For example, trainees continue to be concerned about the impact of lost clinical hours on their professional futures. The most notable of the personal impacts included increased rates of mental health concerns and differential impacts on trainees from ethnoracial minority communities. Recommendations are provided to assist trainees in coping with pandemic-related disruptions.","Towns, Breting, Butts, Brett, Leaffer, Whiteside","https://doi.org/10.1080/13854046.2021.1975826","20210914","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-15","",17969,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Epidemic on Diagnosis, Treatment, Concerns, Problems, and Mental Health in Patients with Gastric Cancer","COVID-19 epidemic has had different effects on many diseases, including gastric cancer. Due to COVID-19 epidemic the importance of knowing the effects of the epidemic in patients to deal with it, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of COVID-19 on the diagnosis, treatment, concerns, problems, and mental health of patients with gastric cancer. The present study was a systematic review by searching the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases with the keywords of COVID-19 and gastric cancer. The articles that addressed any aspect of COVID-19 epidemic on diagnosis, treatment, problems, and mental health in patients with gastric cancer were included; the data were qualitatively summarized and presented in related tables. A total 22 articles were included. The effects of COVID-19 on gastric cancer were divided into four categories of the effects of COVID-19 on the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up, concerns, and problems and mental health of patients with gastric cancer. The COVID-19 epidemic has reduced the number of screenings, altered treatment, and delayed or discontinued treatment, which caused problems and concerns such as sleep disturbances and stress. Considering the effects of COVID-19 epidemic on gastric cancer and on the other hand, the continuation of the epidemic in the society, it is necessary for the officials and experts of the health system to design and implement necessary interventions to minimize the negative effects of epidemic on patients with gastric cancer.","Hesary, Salehiniya","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12029-021-00692-0","20210914","COVID-19; Diagnosis; Gastric cancer; Mental Health; Systematic review; Treatment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-15","",17970,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 on Patients With Cancer: A National Study of Patient Experiences","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic abruptly disrupted cancer care. The impact of these disruptions on patient experiences remain relatively understudied. The objective of this study was to assess patients' perspectives regarding the impact of COVID-19 on their experiences, including their cancer care, emotional and mental health, and social determinants of health, and to evaluate whether these outcomes differed by cancer stage. We conducted a survey among adults with cancer across the United States from April 1, 2020 to August 26, 2020 using virtual snowball sampling strategy in collaboration with professional organizations, cancer care providers, and patient advocacy groups. We analyzed data using descriptive statistics, Ãâ€¡2 and t tests. Three hundred twelve people with cancer participated and represented 38 states. The majority were non-Hispanic White (n=183; 58.7%) and female (n=177; 56.7%) with median age of 57 years. Ninety-one percent spoke English at home, 70.1% had health insurance, and 67% had access to home internet. Breast cancer was the most common diagnosis (n=67; 21.5%). Most had Stage 4 disease (n=80; 25.6%). Forty-six percent (n=145) experienced a change in their care due to COVID-19. Sixty percent (n=187) reported feeling very or extremely concerned that the pandemic would affect their cancer and disproportionately experienced among those with advanced cancer stages compared with earlier stages (P&lt;0.001). Fifty-two percent (n=162) reported impact of COVID-19 on 1 or more aspects of social determinants of health with disproportionate impact among those with advanced cancer stages compared with earlier stages. COVID-19 impacted the care and well-being of patients with cancer and this impact was more pronounced among people with advanced cancer stages. Future work should consider tailored interventions to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on patients with cancer.","Rodriguez, Ferguson, Kurian, Bondy, Patel","https://doi.org/10.1097/COC.0000000000000865","20210914","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-15","",17971,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on infant and toddler development","The COVID-19 pandemic has created new cultural norms with pervasive societal implications. Families have experienced a heightened amount of physical, psychological, emotional, and financial stress. Infants and children living with stress have the potential for delayed developmental milestones, difficulty with emotional regulation, and social or behavioral issues. This study aims to determine if the pandemic has affected developmental outcomes in infants and toddlers. Prepandemic and postpandemic developmental (ASQ-3) scores were obtained from charts of 1,024 patients (6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months) from two pediatric practices. There were no significant differences in prepandemic and postpandemic ASQ-3 scores for the overall sample. Age-group analysis showed statistically significant differences in domain scores. Postpandemic problem-solving scores decreased among 6-month-olds while increasing among 24-month-olds. Categorization by score interpretation categories showed a slight decrease in postpandemic scores in the communication domain among 6- and 12-month-olds. The pandemic has the potential to affect childhood development. However, the results of this study are reassuring, showing only slight differences in developmental scores prepandemic versus postpandemic. More studies are needed to establish causation and possible trends in future developmental trajectories. An increased focus on communication screening and promotion of language and communication skills in young children postpandemic is needed. Education about the importance of parent-child engagement, nurturing relationships, opportunities for free-play and exploration, and caregiver support and stress reduction will continue to be of paramount importance.","Imboden, Sobczak, Griffin","https://doi.org/10.1097/JXX.0000000000000653","20210914","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-15","",17972,""
"The Effects of 3D Immersion Technology (3Scape) on Mental Health in Outpatients From a Short-Term Assessment, Rehabilitation, and Treatment Program: Feasibility Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial","Mental health conditions are prevalent among Canadians and are a leading cause of disability. Each year, 1 in 5 Canadians experiences a mental health issue. A total of 5% of people aged Ã¢â€°Â¥65 years perceive their mental health as fair or poor, and 6.3% of them have mood disorders. Regarding older adults with cognitive impairments such as dementia, up to 40%-50% of them experience depression at some point. We believe that older adults can benefit significantly from information and telecommunication technologies as a strategy for improving mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety, while simultaneously improving their quality of life. 3Scape Systems Inc is an Alberta-based private company that has produced a series of specialized 3D videos designed to simulate real-life events and engage individuals living with mental health disorders and cognitive impairments such as dementia. This study aims to explore the trial design and effects of 3Scape videos on older adults' symptoms of depression and anxiety and the efficacy of this technology in improving the quality of life of patients attending the Short-Term Assessment, Rehabilitation, and Treatment Psychiatry Day Hospital program at Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital and to provide data to estimate the parameters required to design a definitive randomized controlled trial. The trial will use a randomized controlled design comprising 15 intervention participants and 15 control group participants. The participants will be adults aged Ã¢â€°Â¥65 years who are cognitively intact or have minimal cognitive impairment (ie, Montreal Cognitive Assessment score Ã¢â€°Â¥18), and are clients of the Short-Term Assessment, Rehabilitation, and Treatment Psychiatry Day Hospital program at Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital. This study's primary outcome variables are related to clients' depressive and anxiety symptoms and their quality of life. The control group will receive the standard of care (ie, the Short-Term Assessment, Rehabilitation, and Treatment Psychiatry Day Hospital program at Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital). The intervention group will receive the same standard of care as the control group and will use 3Scape Systems videos for therapeutic activities. Our study is currently on hold because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The recruitment process is expected to resume by November 2021, and the primary impact analysis is expected to be conducted by February 2022. This study will provide valuable information such as the measurement of comparative intervention effects, perception of older adults and mental health therapists about the 3Scape Systems, the associated costs of treatment, and product costs. This will contribute to the evidence planning process, which will be crucial for the future adoption of 3Scape Systems.

"Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice Towards COVID-19 Among People in Bangladesh: A Telephonic Cross-sectional Survey","The world has been grappling with COVID-19 since December 2019, a dire public health crisis. Preventive and control measures have been adopted to reduce the spread of COVID-19. To date, the public's knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding COVID-19 across Bangladesh are poorly understood. Therefore, it is important to assess people's KAP towards the disease and suggest appropriate strategies to combat COVID-19 effectively. This study aimed to assess the KAP of Bangladeshi people towards COVID-19 and to identify the determinants of those KAPs. We conducted a country-wide cross-sectional telephonic survey from 7 May to 29 May 2020. A purposive sampling method was applied, and adult Bangladeshi citizens who have mobile phones were approached to participate in the survey. Interviews were conducted based on verbal consent. Multiple logistic regression analyses and several tests were performed to identify the factors associated with KAP on COVID-19. A total of 492 out of 576 Bangladeshi adults aged 18 years and above completed the interview with a response rate of 85.4% (492/576). Three hundred and twenty-one (65.24%) were male, and three hundred and four (61.79%) lived in the rural area. Mean scores for knowledge, attitude, and practice were 10.56Ã‚Â±2.86, 1.24Ã‚Â±0.83, and 3.17Ã‚Â±1.5, respectively. Among the respondents, 273 (55.49%) respondents had poor knowledge, 251 (48.98%) respondents expressed a negative attitude, and 192 out of 359 respondents (53.48%) had poor practice towards COVID-19. Mean scores of knowledge, attitude, and practice differed significantly across various demographic and socioeconomic groups. Rural people lagged, as they had lower mean scores of knowledge (9.8Ã‚Â±3.1, P&lt;.001) and adhering to appropriate practice measures (4Ã‚Â±1.4, P&lt;.001) compared to their urban counterparts. A positive and statistically strong correlation between knowledge with attitude (r=0.21, P&lt;.001), knowledge with practice (r=0.45, P&lt;.001), and attitude with practice (r=0.27, P&lt;.001) was observed. Television (53.7%) was identified as the major source of knowledge regarding COVID-19. Almost three-fourths (72.97%) of the respondents went outside the home during the lockdown period. Furthermore, the study found that good knowledge (OR:3.13, 95% CI:2.03-4.83 and AOR: 2.33, 95% CI:1.16-4.68) and positive attitude (OR:2.43, 95% CI:1.59-3.72 and OR:3.87, 95% CI:1.95-7.68) are significantly associated with COVID-19 health measures' better practice. Evidence-informed and context-specific risk communication and community engagement, and a social and behavior change communication strategy against COVID-19 should be developed in Bangladesh, based on the findings of this study, targeting different socioeconomic groups.","Rabbani, Akter, Hasan, Samad, Mahmood, Joarder","https://doi.org/10.2196/28344","20210914","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-15","",17974,""
"COVID-19 and Brazilian healthcare professionals: a cross-sectional survey of perceptions and feelings during pandemics in one of the top three most-affected countries","The importance of the health professionals is recognized for COVID-19 pandemic affected-countries, especially those such as Brazil, one of the top three countries more affected in the world. However, the perception of the stress on these workers and the changes that the pandemic has caused in their lives could vary according to the conditions offered by these affected countries, including salaries, individual protection equipment and psychological support. Our purpose is to identify the perceptions of Brazilian health workers regarding the COVID-19 pandemic impact on their lives, including possible self-contamination and mental health. This cross-sectional online survey was conducted in Brazil by applying a 32-item questionnaire, including multiple-choice, using the Google Forms electronic assessment. The study was designed to capture spontaneous perceptions from health professionals. All questions were mandatory and divided into two blocks with different proposals: personal profile, and COVID-19 pandemic impact. We interviewed Brazilian health professionals from all five Brazilian regions (n=1,376). Our study revealed that 1 in 5 (23%) complained about missing PPE, including face shield (17%), masks (15%), and lab coat (10%), whereas 1 in 4 health professionals did not have enough information to protect themselves from the coronavirus disease. These professionals had anxiety due to COVID-19 (44%), difficulties in sleep (43%) and, concentrating on work (33%). Almost one third experienced traumatic situations at work (28%) which may lead to negative feelings of fear of COVID-19 and sadness. Despite this situation, there is hope and empathy among their positive feelings. The survey also showed that 1 in 5 got COVID-19 with most classic and minor symptoms, including headache (86%), body pain (75%), tiredness (74%), and loss of taste and smell (55%). Some of their negative feelings were higher than those of not infected professionals (fear of COVID-19 77% vs. 48%), (impotence 45% vs. 28%) and fault (12% vs. 5%), respectively. Another worrying outcome is that 61% reported getting an infection while working at a health facility and as expected most of the respondents (70%) felt affected (25%) or very affected (45 %) by the COVID-19. In Brazil, the health professionals revealed to be exposed to a stressful situation and to the risk of self-contamination, conditions that prospect future psychological problems for these workers. According to our survey, the psychological support for this group should be included in future health planning of Brazil and other hugely affected countries to assure a good mental health condition to the medical teams in near future.","CorrÃƒÂªa, Castro, Quaresma, Stephens, Araujo-Jorge, Ferreira","https://doi.org/10.2196/28088","20210914","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-15","",17975,""
"Comparing Public Sentiment towards COVID-19 Vaccines across Canadian Cities: Analysis of Comments on Reddit","Social media enables the rapid consumption of news related to COVID-19 and serves as a platform for discussions. Its richness in text-based data in the form of posts and comments allows researchers to identify popular topics and assess public sentiment. Yet, the vast majority of topic extraction and sentiment analysis based on social media is done on the platform or country level and does not account for local culture and policies. The aim of this study is to use location-based subreddits on Reddit to study city-level variations in sentiments toward vaccine-related topics. Comments made on posts providing regular updates on COVID-19 statistics in the Vancouver (r/vancouver, 49,291), Toronto (r/toronto, 20,764), and Calgary (r/calgary, 21,277) subreddits between July 13th, 2020 and June 14th, 2021 were extracted. Latent Dirichlet allocation was used to identify frequently discussed topics. Sentiment (joy, sadness, fear, and anger) scores were assigned to comments using random forest regression. The number of comments made on the 250 posts from the Vancouver subreddit positively correlated with the number of new daily COVID-19 cases in British Columbia (R = 0.51, 95% CI for slope = [0.18,0.29], P &lt; 0.001). From the comments, thirteen topics were identified. Two were related to vaccines, one regarding vaccine uptake and the other about vaccine supply. The levels of discussion for both topics were linked to the total number of vaccinations given (Granger test for causality: P &lt; 0.001). Comments pertaining to either topic displayed higher scores for joy compared to comments about other topics (P &lt; 0.001). Calgary and Toronto also discussed vaccine uptake. Sentiment scores for this topic differed across the three cities (P &lt; 0.001). Our work demonstrates that data from city-specific subreddits can be used to better understand concerns and sentiments around COVID-19 vaccines at the local level. This can potentially lead to more targeted and publicly-acceptable policies based on content on social media.","Yan, Law, Nguyen, Cheung, Kong","https://doi.org/10.2196/32685","20210914","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-15","",17976,""
"Psychosocial and Behavioral Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic in the Indian Population: A Cross-Sectional Study Protocol","During the year 2020, the COVID - 19 pandemic spread from China to the rest of the world, leading the world to a widespread mandated quarantine or suggested social isolation. The impending uncertainty due to the pandemic must have led to a variety of widespread mental health maladies. There has been documentation in the literature about a lot of these in small populations of the world but limited studies and generated evidence from it has been conducted in India. The main objective of our study was to investigate the mental health effects of COVID-19 on the general population in India - both quantitatively and qualitatively. These results would help contribute to the knowledge gap recognized in the literature, given the unprecedented and novel nature of the pandemic. Aim 1.1: We aim to qualitatively analyze the psychosocial and behavioral effects among the target population via online survey forms and present them in an easily readable way. Aim 1.1 will be accomplished by collecting the data via the use of the 'google forms' survey and using the same software to present data in the form of different kinds of charts such as bar, pie, etc. These will be included in the 'tables and charts' section of the research article. Aim 1.2: We aim to quantitatively analyze and determine the extent of these associations and their statistical significance. Aim 1.2 will be accomplished by using STATA software to analyze the demographic variables across with the data on the psychosocial and behavioral effects by using methods such as logistic regression, chi-square analysis, etc. depending on the kind of variables being analyzed. The results of this analysis will also be included in the 'analysis' section of the research article. We designed and validated our own questionnaire and utilized the method of circulating it via WhatsApp. WhatsApp is a social media app very popularly used in India, and hence turned out to be an effective medium to gather pilot data. We analyzed the pilot data and used it to validate the questionnaire with the expertise of our mentor, Dr. Nilima Shah MD psychiatry. The study protocol was approved in September 2020 by the IRB at Vadilal Sarabhai General Hospital, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. We gathered pilot data of 545 subjects and used the results to determine the changes needed to the questionnaire, while simultaneously validating it. The following preliminary assumptions can be made about the study from the pilot data: the majority of the survey respondents were male (53%: 289/545), most of them were educated and employed as healthcare workers (36.5%: 199/545). The majority of the responders were self-employed (33.9%: 185), single (54.5%: 297/545), and stayed with their family for the lockdown, which helped psychologically. Findings specific to mental health have been elaborated in the manuscript below. It is evident from the data collected in the literature previously, that the pandemic had significantly detrimental effects on the mental health of a vast proportion of the Indian population. <AbstractText Label=""INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">DERR1-10.2196/29896.","Joshi, Shah, Trivedi, Patel, Trivedi, Parghi, Thakkar, Barot, Jadawala","https://doi.org/10.2196/29896","20210914","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-15","",17977,""
"Interprofessional Suicide Prevention Education","<b/> The COVID-19 pandemic has raised concerns regarding possible spikes in suicidal behavior in light of heightened risk factors such as social isolation and financial strain; thus, comprehensive suicide prevention training for emerging health service providers is increasingly vital. This article summarizes an interprofessional education (IPE) suicide prevention course delivered in-person in Spring 2020. Pilot data demonstrate that despite the impact of COVID-19 on higher education, this course had long-term impacts on trainee suicide prevention efficacy, IPE attitudes, and use of course content in practice. Discussion serves to address enhancements for interprofessional and suicide prevention education during and after the pandemic. Emphasis is placed on adaptable training strategies, considerations in the delivery format, guidelines for intensive virtual meetings with trainee teams, and future directions in IPE suicide prevention training research.","La Guardia, Wright-Berryman, Cramer, Kaniuka, Tufts","https://doi.org/10.1027/0227-5910/a000813","20210914","COVID-19; interprofessional education; suicide prevention; training","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-15","",17978,""
"Effects of Depression and Resilience of Public Workers on Work-related Stress and Anxiety in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic","This study explored the clinical variables related to public workers' stress and anxiety regarding the viral epidemic, and the mediating effect of resilience on the relationship between their depression and anxiety in response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A total of 938 public workers answered anonymous questionnaires in May 2020. The survey included rating scales such as the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-9 (SAVE-9), Patients Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale 2 items (CD-RISC 2), and subjects also answered whether they were employed in COVID-19 related fields. Married, female, junior, public workers reported a higher level of stress and anxiety in response to the viral epidemic. Furthermore, high levels of stress and anxiety toward the epidemic are defined by high PHQ-9, high GAD-7, and low CD-RISC 2 scores. It could also be seen that resilience mediated the effect of depression in public workers and their stress and anxiety levels toward the epidemic. It is important to reduce the psychological burden of public workers and manage their mental health to help them cope with the epidemic wisely and efficiently. Among many mental health factors, psychological resilience represents an essential target for psychological intervention among public workers.","Ju, Lee, Ahn, Lee, Kim, Suh, Chung","https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2021.36.e262","20210914","Anxiety; COVID-19 Resilience; Depression; Public Service","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-15","",17979,""
"""It Takes Some Empathy, Sympathy, and Listening"": Telephone Outreach to Older Detroiters in a Pandemic as a Modality to Gain an Understanding of Challenges and Resiliency","This manuscript describes a telephone outreach project for members of a research registry program for older adults in Detroit, Michigan. From April until December 2020, the Healthier Black Elders Center designed and implemented a telephone outreach program, calling 1204 older adults utilizing 15 staff and volunteers. The calls served to check in on registry members and collect data on mental health, coping mechanisms, access to services, masks, testing, and tele-health.

"Stressors and Other Pandemic-related Predictors of Prospective Changes in Psychological Distress","Numerous studies have documented mental health challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Few studies included pre-pandemic levels of mental health or were comprehensive in assessing factors likely associated with longer-term mental health impacts. Analyses used prospective data from a subset of participants in the nationwide Cancer Prevention Study-3 (CPS-3) United States cohort (N=2,359; 1,534 women; 825 men) who completed surveys in 2018 and during the COVID-19 pandemic (July-September 2020). Logistic regressions examined associations of pandemic-related stressors, sociodemographic and other predictors with (i) overall psychological distress (PD) and depression and anxiety separately during the COVID-19 pandemic and (ii) change in PD from 2018 to during the pandemic (low/low; high to low; low to high; high/high). During the pandemic, 10% of participants reported moderate-to-severe PD and almost half (42%) reported at least mild PD. Pandemic PD levels were associated with pre-pandemic PD (female OR=5.65; male OR=9.70), financial stressors (female OR=2.48; male OR=3.68), and work/life balance stressors (female OR=3.03; male OR=3.33) experienced since the pandemic began. These stressors also predicted an escalation from low PD in 2018 to high PD during the pandemic. Factors associated with high PD at both time points included younger age, female sex, and financial stressors. These results highlight the importance of regular mental health assessment and support among those with a history of mental health problems and those experiencing pandemic-related stressors, such as those with caregiving responsibilities or job changes.

"The next pandemic: impact of COVID-19 in mental healthcare assistance in a nationwide epidemiological study","Studies have reported the worsening of psychiatric symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, few studies have evaluated the impact on the access to mental health services during COVID-19. Our aim was to analyze temporal trends and prediction of appointments held in Brazil's public health system, to compare the observed and expected number of mental healthcare appointments during the COVID-19 pandemics. An ecological time-series study was performed, analyzing mental health appointments before and during the pandemic (from 2016 and 2020) from the Brazilian governmental database. The structural break in the data series was assessed using the Chow test, with the break considered in March 2020. Bayesian structural time-series models were used to estimate current average appointments and the predicted expectation if there was no pandemic. Compared to the expected, between March and August 2020 about 28% less outpatient appointments in mental health were observed, totaling 471,448 individuals with suspended assistance. Group appointments and psychiatric hospitalizations were also severely impacted by the pandemic (decreased of 68% and 33%, respectively). On the other hand, mental health emergency consultations and home care increased during this period (36% and 52%, respectively). Our findings demonstrate a dramatic change in mental health assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic, which corroborates a recent WHO survey. This phenomenon can aggravate the mental health crisis and generate a parallel pandemic that may last for a longer time than the COVID-19 pandemic.

"The impact of Sample Processing on the Rapid Antigen Detection test for SARS-CoV-2: Virus Inactivation, VTM Selection, and Sample Preservation","Many factors have been identified as having the ability to affect the sensitivity of rapid antigen detection (RAD) tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This study aimed to identify the impact of sample processing on the sensitivity of the RAD tests. We explored the effect of different inactivation methods, viral transport media (VTM) solutions, and sample preservation on the sensitivity of four RAD kits based on two SARS-CoV-2 strains. Compared with non-inactivation, heat inactivation significantly impacted the sensitivity of most RAD kits; however, ÃŽÂ²-propiolactone inactivation only had a minor effect. Some of the VTM solutions (VTM2, MANTACC) had a significant influence on the sensitivity of the RAD kits, especially for low viral-loads samples. The detection value of RAD kits was slightly decreased, while most of them were still in the detection range with the extension of preservation time and the increase of freeze-thaw cycles. Our results showed that selecting the appropriate inactivation methods and VTM solutions is necessary during reagent development, performance evaluation, and clinical application.","Zhou, Wang, Rao, Chen, Ma, Liu, Ren, Xu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bsheal.2021.09.001","20210914","Rapid antigen detection; SARS-CoV-2; Sample process; Sensitivity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-15","",17983,""
"Study of dynamic behaviour of psychological stress during COVID-19 in India: A mathematical approach","In this study, a new attempt has been made using mathematical modelling to study dynamic behaviour and estimate the final size of spread of the psychological stress arising due to sudden outbreak of COVID-19 in India. The proposed mathematical model examines and includes different behaviours of transition from one process to another in current situation and study their propagation mode. We propose a mathematical model, where two different type of psychological stresses occur due to COVID-19 situation and its impact on people's life such as their mental well being and happiness. We present some sufficient conditions for the vanishing or spreading of the psychological stress through qualitative and quantitative analysis. The basic reproduction number ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow> <mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow> </mml:msub> </mml:math> ) of the model is computed and the local and the global stabilities of different equilibria are studied. Moreover, to better understand the level of psychological stress and decreasing mental well-being during the COVID-19 outbreak in India, we also conducted an online survey. Our findings establish several factors associated with level of psychological impact and mental health status. Based on the empirical analysis, we found that psychological stress has a significant negative influence on mental well being. Further, this study confirms that coping strategies with stress have significantly contributed towards the betterment in the mental well-being of the people. Numerical simulations are also given to illustrate the theoretical results. The results of the present study can be generalized to the society, Government, and others that they can adopt different strategies to avoid stressful situations during COVID-19 outbreak. The findings suggest that policy-makers, Government officials should focus on coping strategies to combat with pandemic disease.","Jain, Tyagi, Dhiman, Alzabut","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rinp.2021.104661","20210914","Basic reproduction number; Empirical analysis; Happiness; Mathematical model; Mental well-being; Next generation matrix; Psychological stress; Stability","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-15","",17984,""
"Food insecurity is adversely associated with psychological distress, anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic","Early COVID-19 pandemic data showed a spike in both food insecurity and poor mental health. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between food insecurity and mental health outcomes nine months after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. A national survey of adults 18Ã‚Â years and older was administered in December 2020 (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 8,355). Multivariable logistic models and post-estimation margins commands were used to show the predicted probability of mental health outcomes (psychological distress, anxiety, and depression) by food security status. The majority of participants (68.5%) reported high/marginal food security, 15.5% had low food security, and 16.0% had very low food security. There was a strong dose response relationship between food insecurity and higher psychological distress, anxiety and depression. Fewer than one in five adults with high/marginal food security screened positive for all three mental health outcomes, while more than two in five adults with low food security screened positive for psychological distress (39.9%), depression (41.7%) and anxiety (41.3%). Among adults with very low food security, nearly half screened positive for psychological distress (47.7%), depression (48.1%) and anxiety (49.4%). Younger adults had higher prevalence of psychological distress compared to older adults regardless of food security status. Food insecure adults, particularly young adults, have higher rates of psychological distress, anxiety, and depression than their food secure counterparts. Facilitating opportunities to connect at risk populations with food assistance and affordable mental healthcare should be prioritized as the pandemic continues and beyond.","Sundermeir, Wolfson, Bertoldo, Gibson, Agarwal, Labrique","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2021.101547","20210914","COVID-19; Food insecurity; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-15","",17985,""
"Relationships among behavioural regulations, physical activity, and mental health pre- and during COVID-19 UK lockdown","A nationwide survey was conducted during the first UK lockdown to further understanding of the degree to which motives for exercise were associated with physical activity (PA) behaviours and, in turn, how PA behaviours were associated with mental health. A cross-sectional design was employed and data were collected by use of a one-off online survey (<i>N</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 392; 18-85 years; <i>M</i> <sub>BMI</sub>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 25.48; <i>SD</i> <sub>BMI</sub>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 5.05; 314 women). Exercise motives, PA, and mental health were measured by use of the Behavioural Regulations in Exercise Questionnaire-3, Brunel Lifestyle Physical Activity Questionnaire, and General Health Questionnaire-12, respectively. Participants were also asked to specify their average step count per day, if they used a mobile device for this purpose (<i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 190). Analyses comprised hierarchical regressions and partial correlations. Results indicated that behavioural regulations were more strongly associated with planned PA pre-lockdown, compared to during lockdown. There were no differences observed in explained variance between pre- and during lockdown for unplanned PA and steps per day. Planned and unplanned PA were significant explanatory variables for mental health both pre- and during lockdown, but sedentary behaviour was not. Partial correlations, with BMI and age partialled out, showed that steps per day were not correlated with mental health either pre- or during lockdown. The range of variables used to explain planned and unplanned PA and mental health suggest that people's motives to exercise were tempered by lockdown. For those who routinely measured their steps per day, the step count was unrelated to their mental health scores both pre- and during lockdown. It appears that engagement in regular PA confers some minor benefits for mental health.","Bird, Karageorghis, Hamer","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychsport.2021.101945","20210914","Behavioural regulations; Coronavirus; Exercise; Mental wellbeing; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-15","",17986,""
"Community dimensions and emotions in the era of COVID-19","Following an ecological perspective, reactions to a disaster-such as the COVID-19 pandemic-should be analysed in the interdependence between individual and community dimensions. The present study aims to analyse individual emotional dimensions (anxiety, joy, fear or depressive feelings) and their community dimensions (connectedness, emotional sharing and solidarity) with a longitudinal approach among university students from Italian universities. Participants were 746 university students at t1 (during the lockdown) and 361 at t2 (after the lockdown) recruited in six Italian universities from different areas of Italy. Comparing emotional dimensions in the two times, t2 is characterized by a generalized ambiguity: both happiness or joy because of the end of limitations and a kind of 'post-lockdown anxiety' because of a sense of individual inadequacy in facing the return to normality, conducting daily activities and attending community spaces. Data confirms that after the so-called 'honeymoon phase' in community dimensions (first phase of t1 time), a sort of 'depressive reaction' arises at t2: Italian university students seem more aware of the need for individual and social responsibility and that many events are not under their personal control. The reconstruction phase and exit from the emergency are perceived as necessary but also as a difficult and risky period.

"COVID-19 Impact Battery: Development and Validation","In addition to impacting the physical health of millions of Americans, the novel-coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is a significant psychological stressor due to both the threat of the illness itself and the mitigation strategies used to contain the spread. To facilitate understanding of the impact of COVID-19, validated measures are needed. Using a stepwise procedure in line with best-practice measurement procedures, the current report summarizes the procedures employed to create the COVID-19 Impact Battery (CIB). Two independent samples recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°175, NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°642) and a third community sample (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°259) were used for reliability and validity testing. Validation procedures yielded a battery consisting of three scales assessing COVID-19 related behaviors, worry, and disability. The behaviors scale contains three subscales assessing stockpiling, cleaning, and avoidance. The worry subscale also contains three subscales assessing health, financial and catastrophic concerns. In addition, we created a short version of the battery (CIB-S) to allow for more flexibility in data collection. In summary, we have provided reliability and validity information for the CIB and CIB-S, demonstrating that these measures can facilitate evaluation of the broad impact of COVID-19 on mental health functioning.","Schmidt, Allan, Koscinski, Mathes, Eackles, Accorso, Saulnier, Allan, Potter, Garey, Suhr, Austin, Zvolensky","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10862-021-09919-7","20210914","Assessment instrument; COVID; Development; Validation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-15","",17988,""
"Child Psychological Functioning During the COVID-19 Lockdown: An Ecological, Family-Centered Approach","To evaluate how sociodemographic characteristics and various aspects of parent well-being, family functioning, parent-child relationship, and child characteristics are related to psychological functioning in children aged 9 to 12 years during the COVID-19 lockdown. Participants included 144 children aged 9 to 12 years and their parents who lived in the province of Quebec, Canada, during the COVID-19 mandatory lockdown. Parents and children were administered a phone-based survey in which various child, parent, parent-child, and family characteristics were assessed. Results showed that higher internalizing problems in children were related to greater depressive symptoms in parents, lower attachment security to parents, and greater aversion to aloneness in children. Results on externalizing behavior problems showed that more problems were associated with more family dysfunction and chaos and lower attachment security to parents. Finally, results on children's anxiety toward COVID-19 showed that more anxiety was associated with greater parental anxiety toward COVID-19 and more child aversion to aloneness. Our findings showed that even during an unusual and stressful context such as a pandemic, proximal variables such as the attachment relationship that have been known to be closely associated with adaptation are significantly related to child psychological functioning. Such observations are important because they highlight factors that may accentuate child vulnerability in times of a pandemic and shed light on potential intervention targets.","Dubois-Comtois, Suffren, St-Laurent, Milot, Lemelin","https://doi.org/10.1097/DBP.0000000000000935","20210914","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-15","",17989,""

"Gambling and the COVID-19 pandemic in the province of Quebec (Canada): protocol for a mixed-methods study","The COVID-19 pandemic has major collateral impacts on mental health. Gambling is among the major public health issues that seems to have been transformed by the pandemic. In the province of Quebec in Canada, gambling is an important leisure activity. About two out of three adults are in Quebec gamble. The objective of this study is to draw a portrait of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on gamblers and to learn more about their experiences during the pandemic in the province of Quebec. This study has a sequential explanatory mixed-method design in two phases. The first phase is a cross-sectional online survey with Quebec residents who are 18 years of age or older and have gambled at least once in the previous 12 months. The second phase will be a qualitative study. Semistructured interviews will be conducted with gamblers, family members, addiction counsellors and state representatives selected through purposing sampling. This study is one of the first mixed-methods studies on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on gambling. This study will generate new scientific knowledge on a worrisome public health issue, that is, gambling, and provide a better understanding of the experiences and gambling behaviours of gamblers during the pandemic. This study is funded by the Ministry of Health and Social Services of the Government of Quebec and was approved on 27 October 2020 by the Scientific and Research Ethics Committee of the CIUSSS de l'Estrie-CHUS.

"Prevalence and associations of COVID-19 testing in an online sample of transgender and non-binary individuals","Testing for COVID-19 and linkage to services is fundamental to successful containment and control of transmission. Yet, knowledge on COVID-19 testing among transgender and non-binary communities remains limited. Between October 2020 and November 2020, we examined the prevalence and associations of COVID-19 testing in an online sample of transgender and non-binary people (n=536). Multivariable hierarchical logistic regression analyses examined associations between COVID-19 testing and participants' sociodemographic, mental health, substance use, gender affirmation, economic changes and healthcare experiences. Prevalence of COVID-19 testing in this sample was 35.5% (n=190/536). In the final model, transgender and non-binary participants from upper socioeconomic income background and Europe, who reported having active alcohol use disorder, limited access to gender-affirming surgery, had more than 20% reduction in income, and experienced mistreatment in a health facility due to gender identity had significantly increased odds of COVID-19 testing (all p&lt;0.05); those who reported recent tobacco use had significantly lower odds of COVID-19 testing (p=0.007). These findings highlight structural disparities in COVID-19 testing and reinforce the importance of increasing testing strategies for transgender and non-binary populations.","Restar, Garrison-Desany, Baker, Adamson, Howell, Baral, Operario, Beckham","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2021-006808","20210914","COVID-19; cross-sectional survey; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-15","",17992,""

Most of the 520 respondents were females (n = 496, 95%) who gave birth at private hospitals (n = 426, 86%). Mothers reported having overall positive birth emotions (n = 399, 80%). Multivariable analysis showed that having a preterm baby (aOR 2.89; CI 1.51-5.53) and the mother self-reporting that Covid-19 affected her birth experience (aOR 4.25; CI 2.08-8.68) increased the odds of mothers reporting predominantly negative emotions about their birth. The mother having her preferred delivery method reduced the odds of having negative birth emotions (aOR 0.41; CI 0.25-0.66). Multivariable analysis showed that having predominantly negative emotions about the birth increased the odds of probable minor depression (aOR 3.60; CI 1.93-6.70). Being older reduced the odds of having probable minor depression (25-34 years aOR 0.36; CI 0.10-1.32; 35 years or older aOR 0.25; CI 0.06-0.91). Lockdown exacerbated many birth and parenting challenges including mental health and health care access. However, overall experiences were positive and there was a strong sense of resilience amongst parents.","Farley, Edwards, Numanoglu, Phillips","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wombi.2021.09.001","20210914","Birth; Covid-19; New parenting","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-15","",17993,""
"Exploring resilience and well-being of family caregivers of people with dementia exposed to mandatory social isolation by COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has raised questions about the resilience of health care systems worldwide. In this regard, one group of people whose physical and mental health has been affected has been family caregivers of people with dementia. This study aims to identify the variables that predict a high degree of well-being in family caregivers of people with dementia during this period of mandatory lockdown. A total of 310 respondents participated in an online survey (266 women and 44 men) from various regions in Spain, aged between 20 and 73Ã‚Â years old (M = 46.45; SD = 15.97), and all were family members. The results showed that there were notable differences in all the protective variables, together with a significant strong positive relationship between well-being and resilience (<i>r</i> = 0.92; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) and with coping strategies (<i>r</i> = 0.85; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), and there were also some significant negative relationships between well-being and difficulties in emotional regulation (ÃÂ = -.78; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). The most predictive variables of a higher level of well-being included the type of dementia (ÃŽÂ² = 1.19; CI (95%) = 1.01-1.29; <i>p</i>&lt; 0.01), living in a large house (ÃŽÂ² = 0.97; CI (95%) =. 23-0.98; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), social support as a coping strategy (ÃŽÂ² = 1.27; CI (95%) = 1.21-1.29; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) and mainly resilience (ÃŽÂ² = 1.34; CI (95%) = 1.30-1.37; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). We discuss the importance of promoting higher levels of resilience through the development of protective psychosocial variables in caregivers of people with dementia exposed to situations of mandatory social isolation as a modulator of the psychosocial well-being of these family caregivers.","SÃƒÂ¡nchez-Teruel, Robles-Bello, Sarhani-Robles, Sarhani-Robles","https://doi.org/10.1177/14713012211042187","20210914","COVID-19; dementia; family caregivers; perceived well-being; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-15","",17994,""
