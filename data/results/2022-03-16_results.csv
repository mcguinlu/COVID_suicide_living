"Alterations in the Experience of Time, Space, and Intersubjectivity and the Interaction with Pre-Existent Psychopathology during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures to protect the physically vulnerable may disproportionately affect people with mental health vulnerabilities, who receive psychotherapeutic inpatient treatment, as many of these measures impact the (inter)subjective space crucial to psychotherapy. We investigate how people with pre-existing mental health conditions and healthcare professionals experienced changes linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the first COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown in spring 2020, we conducted semi-structured interviews with patients and healthcare professionals at a clinic for psychosomatic medicine in Germany and analyzed them following the principles of descriptive phenomenology focusing on social interactions, intersubjectivity, and the therapeutic space. We conducted a total of &gt;30 h of interviews with 19 patients and 17 healthcare professionals. Analyses revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic and the related measures have led to a sudden loss of a sense of normality. Participants experienced changes in the perception of time, space, self, and embodied interaction with others, resulting in a profound feeling of alienation and ""unhomeliness"" which seemed to magnify pre-existing psychopathology. The inpatient psychotherapeutic environment provided safety by offering spatial and temporal structures and opportunities for social interaction, supporting people to find new ways to be in a changed world. Our study shows that despite the threat of infection, it is vital to continue to provide people with psychological vulnerabilities with a safe therapeutic space in which to regain a sense of safety in a changed world. This is particularly important, as those people seem to suffer intensely from the collateral measures of a pandemic.","Lau, Schaefer, Brons, Koch, Utz, Metodiev, Meyer, Rapp, Lahmann, Schmidt, Bauer","https://doi.org/10.1159/000522345","20220315","Anxiety; Depression; Face masks; Psychotherapy; Social distancing; Uncanny; Unheimlichkeit","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-16","",28501,""
"Mental Health and Social Support of Sexual and Gender Diverse People from QuÃƒÂ©bec, Canada During the COVID-19 Crisis","<b><i>Purpose:</i></b> Sexual and gender minority (SGM) people are at increased risk for psychological distress compared with cisgender heterosexual people. Specific SGM subgroups include lesbian, gay, bisexual, gender diverse, and asexual people who each experience unique psychosocial challenges that can result in different mental health outcomes. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may have further exacerbated mental health disparities among these groups. The aim of this study was to compare lesbian, gay, bisexual, gender diverse, asexual, and cisgender heterosexual people's mental health and social support during the first 4 months of the COVID-19 crisis. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> This study used a cross-sectional online survey from March 26th, 2020 to July 7th, 2020 in QuÃƒÂ©bec, Canada. A total of 2908 individuals (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°304 SGM people, <i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2604 cisgender heterosexual people) completed questionnaires measuring perceived social support, perceived stress, symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as loneliness. <b><i>Results:</i></b> SGM people presented worse health outcomes than cisgender heterosexual people on all questionnaires (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). <i>Post hoc</i> analyses showed that particularly marginalized SGM subgroups, including bisexual and asexual people, reported the poorest mental health.

"Depressive symptoms in higher education students during the COVID-19 pandemic: the role of containment measures","Students are a vulnerable group for the indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly their mental health. This paper examined the cross-national variation in students' depressive symtoms and whether this can be related to the various protective measures implemented in response to the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. Student data stem from the COVID-19 International Student Well-being Study, covering 26 countries during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Country-level data on government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic were retrieved from the Oxford COVID-19 Tracker. Multilevel analyses were performed to estimate the impact of the containment and economic support measures on students' depressive symptoms (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°78 312). School and workplace closures, and stay-at-home restrictions were positively related to students' depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, while none of the economic support measures significantly related to depressive symptoms. Countries' scores on the index of these containment measures explained 1.5% of the cross-national variation in students' depressive symptoms (5.3%). This containment index's effect was stable, even when controlling for the economic support index, students' characteristics, and countries' epidemiological context and economic conditions. Our findings raise concerns about the potential adverse effects of existing containment measures (especially the closure of schools and workplaces and stay-at-home restrictions) on students' mental health.","Buffel, Van de Velde, Akvardar, Bask, Brault, Busse, Chatzittofis, Ladner, Rabiee-Khan, Stathopoulou, Tavolacci, van der Heijde, Pischke, Matos Fialho, Wouters","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckac026","20220315","COVID-19 pandemic; comparative cross-country research; depressive symptoms; government containment and economic support measures; higher education students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-16","",28503,""
"Applying the Value Transformation Framework in Federally Qualified Health Centers to Increase Clinical Measures Performance","The transition in health care from a volume-based to value-based model of care, combined with pressures brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, makes the need for efficiency and coordination of the health center system imperative. The Value Transformation Framework (VTF), developed with health centers in mind, provides an organizing framework to support transformation of infrastructure, care delivery, and people systems. NACHC applied the VTF within a cohort of health centers across the country to drive systems change and improve performance on measures of clinical care. A comparison of health centers ""participating"" in application of the VTF relative to ""nonparticipating"" health centers nationally showed improvement during 3 years of program implementation. Significant differences (p &lt; .05) favoring health centers who participated were noted for screening of colorectal cancer (p &lt; .001), depression (p &lt; .001), hypertension (p &lt; .001), obesity (p = .001), and cervical cancer (p = .011). Performance for diabetes control also favored participating programs, although the difference did not quite reach significance (p = .45). Applying a systems approach, organized by the VTF, with evidence-based interventions and deployed in a learning community, can result in improved performance across multiple measures of clinical care.","Modica, Bay, Lewis, Silva","https://doi.org/10.1097/JHQ.0000000000000340","20220315","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-16","",28504,""
"Hyperinflammation in COVID-19 and suicide etiopathogenesis: Hypothesis for a nefarious collision?","Accumulating scientific and clinical evidence highlighted pathological hyperinflammation as a cardinal feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute COVID-19 disease. With the emergence of long COVID-19 syndrome, several chronic health consequences, including neuropsychiatric sequelae, have gained attention from the public and medical communities. Since inflammatory mediators have also been accredited as putative biomarkers of suicidal ideations and behaviors, hyper- and neuroinflammation might share some colliding points, overlapping and being interconnected in the context of COVID-19. This review aims to provide a summary of current knowledge on the molecular and cellular mechanisms of COVID-19-associated hyper/neuroinflammation with focus on their relevance to the inflammatory hypothesis of suicide development. Subsequently, strategies to alleviate COVID-19 hyper/neuroinflammation by immunomodulatory agents (many of which at experimental stages) as well as psychopharmacologic/psychotherapeutic approaches are also mentioned. While suicide risk in COVID-19 survivors - until now little known - needs further analysis through longitudinal studies, current observations and mechanistic postulates warrant additional attention to this possibly emerging mental health concern.","Costanza, Amerio, Aguglia, Serafini, Amore, Hasler, Ambrosetti, Bondolfi, Sampogna, Berardelli, Fiorillo, Pompili, Nguyen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2022.104606","20220315","COVID-19; COVID-19 survivors; cytokines; hyperinflammation, neuroinflammation; inflammatory peripheral cells, neural cells; long COVID-19 syndrome; suicidal behavior; suicidal ideation; suicide; systemic inflammation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-16","",28505,""
"Children's perspectives on friendships and socialization during the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative approach","Good quality friendships and relationships are critical to the development of social competence and are associated with quality of life and mental health in childhood and adolescence. Through social distancing and isolation restrictions, the COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on the way in which youth socialize and communicate with friends, peers, teachers and family on a daily basis. In order to understand children's social functioning during the pandemic, it is essential to gather information on their experiences and perceptions concerning the social changes unique to this period. The objective of this study was to document children and adolescents' perspectives regarding their social life and friendships during the COVID-19 pandemic, through qualitative interviews METHODS: Participants (N=67, 5-14 years) were recruited in May and June 2020. Semi-structured interviews were conducted via a videoconferencing platform. A thematic qualitative analysis was conducted based on the transcribed and coded interviews (NVivo) RESULTS: The upheavals related to the pandemic provoked reflection among the participants according to three main themes, each of which included sub-themes: 1) the irreplaceable nature of friendship, 2) the unsuspected benefits of school for socialization, and 3) the limits and possibilities of virtual socialization CONCLUSIONS: The collection of rich, qualitative information on the perspectives of children and adolescents provides a deeper understanding of the consequences of the pandemic on their socialization and psychological health and contributes to our fundamental understanding of social competence in childhood.","LariviÃƒÂ¨re-Bastien, Aubuchon, Blondin, Dupont, Libenstein, SÃƒÂ©guin, Tremblay, Zarglayoun, Herba, Beauchamp","https://doi.org/10.1111/cch.12998","20220315","Adolescence; Child Development; ChildrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Views; Qualitative Research Methods; School; Social Relationships","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-16","",28506,""
"Chain Mediation Model of Perceived Stress, Resilience, and Social Support on Coping Styles of Chinese Patients on Hemodialysis During COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown","BACKGROUND The recurrence of COVID-19 and the continuous escalation of prevention and control policies can lead to an increase in mental health problems. This study aimed to investigate the perceived stress, coping style, resilience, and social support among patients on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) during the COVID-19 epidemic lockdown in China. MATERIAL AND METHODS This cross-sectional observational study enrolled 197 patients on MHD from the Guangdong Province Traditional Chinese Medical Hospital and the Hedong Hospital of Guangzhou Liwan District People's Hospital during July 2021. AMOS 24.0 and PROCESS Macro 3.1 model 6 were used for analyses of moderating mediating effects. RESULTS Perceived stress was negatively correlated with positive coping style (r=-0.305, P&lt;0.001) and resilience (r=-0.258, P&lt;0.001), whereas resilience (r=0.631, P&lt;0.001) and social support (r=0.300, P&lt;0.001) were positively correlated with positive coping style among patients on MHD. In the moderated mediating model, perceived stress had significant direct predictive effects on positive coping style (95% CI -0.33, -0.07), and perceived stress had significant indirect predictive effects on positive coping styles through resilience (95% CI -0.26, -0.06) or social support (95% CI 0.01, 0.06). Perceived stress had significant indirect predictive effects on positive coping style through both resilience and social support (95% CI -0.04, -0.01). CONCLUSIONS Perceived stress not only predicted coping style directly, but also indirectly predicted coping style through resilience and social support. Coping style was affected by internal and external factors during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown period.","Peng, Ye, Wang, Qiu, Huang, Wang, He, Deng, Lin","https://doi.org/10.12659/MSM.935300","20220315","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-16","",28507,""
"Cutting Edge: Effect of Disease-Modifying Therapies on SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine-Induced Immune Responses in Multiple Sclerosis Patients","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating inflammatory disease of the CNS treated by diverse disease-modifying therapies that suppress the immune system. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 mRNA vaccines have been very effective in immunocompetent individuals, but whether MS patients treated with modifying therapies are afforded the same protection is not known. This study determined that dimethyl fumarate caused a momentary reduction in anti-Spike (S)-specific Abs and CD8 T cell response. MS patients treated with B cell-depleting (anti-CD20) or sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor agonist (fingolimod) therapies lack significant S-specific Ab response. Whereas S-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses were largely compromised by fingolimod treatment, T cell responses were robustly generated in anti-CD20-treated MS patients, but with a reduced proportion of CD4<sup>+</sup>CXCR5<sup>+</sup> circulating follicular Th cells. These data provide novel information regarding vaccine immune response in patients with autoimmunity useful to help improve vaccine effectiveness in these populations.","Yuzefpolskiy, Morawski, Fahning, Speake, Lord, Chaudhary, Morishima, Wener, Kita, McCarthy, Buckner, Campbell, Bettelli","https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.2101142","20220315","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-16","",28508,""
"Primary care consumers' experiences and opinions of a telehealth consultation delivered via video during the COVID-19 pandemic","This study examined consumers' experiences and opinions of a videoconference with a primary healthcare professional, and estimated the value of travel and time savings for consumers compared with face-to-face consultations. The online survey was conducted in Melbourne, Australia, between October 2020 and May 2021. The sample (n = 499) was highly educated (Bachelor degree or higher, 79%; 393/499), predominately female (70%; 347/499), mainly spoke English at home (78%; 390/499) and had a mean age of 31.8 years (s.d. 11.40). Reduced travel time (27%; 271/499) and avoiding exposure to COVID-19 (23%; 228/499) were the main reasons consumers chose a videoconference. Mental health and behavioural issues were the main reason for the consultation (38%; 241/499) and 69% (346/499) of consultations were with a general practitioner. Perceptions of the quality of care were uniformly high, with 84% (419/499) of respondents believing videoconference was equivalent to a face-to-face consultation. No association was found between reporting that telehealth was equivalent to a face-to-face consultation and education, language, health status, reason for consultation or provider type. The average time saved per consultation was 1 h and 39 min, and the average transport-related saving was A$14.29. High rates of acceptance and substantial cost savings observed in this study warrant further investigation to inform the longer-term role of videoconferences, and telehealth more broadly, in the Australian primary care system.","Manski-Nankervis, Davidson, Hiscock, Hallinan, Ride, Lingam, Holman, Baird, McKeown, Sanci","https://doi.org/10.1071/PY21193","20220315","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-16","",28509,""
"Attachment style and mental health during the later stages of COVID-19 pandemic: the mediation role of loneliness and COVID-19 anxiety","An insecure attachment style is an important risk factor for psychological problems. The aim of this study was to use Bartholomew and Horowitz's model (Bartholomew and Horowitz in J Pers Soc Psychol 61(2): 226, 2019) to test a sample of Italian individuals to determine the mediation role of loneliness and COVID-19-related anxiety symptoms in the relationship between attachment styles and mental health issues in the context of the pandemic. A cross-sectional research study was conducted using a sample of 330 Italian participants (82.1% women; mean ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°34.3Ã‚Â years; SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°13.16) who completed online self-reported measures of attachment styles (RQ), loneliness (RULS), COVID-19-related anxiety symptoms (C-19ASS) and mental health problems (GHQ-12). Serial mediation analyses were performed, and bootstrap tests were included. Our results supported the hypothesized model with respect to each attachment style (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). In particular, insecure attachment styles predict mental health problems both directly and indirectly, through loneliness and COVID-19-related anxiety symptoms. In addition, loneliness directly influences mental health problems and also mediates the relationship between insecure attachment styles and COVID-19-related anxiety symptoms which, in turn, positively predict mental health problems. Our findings reinforce the importance of attachment in people's processes of adapting to experiences during the coronavirus pandemic. The study makes an important contribution to developing effective prevention and intervention strategies to support people's wellbeing in the context of the pandemic.","Vismara, Lucarelli, Sechi","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-022-00767-y","20220315","Attachment styles; COVID-19 pandemic; COVID-19 related anxiety; Loneliness; Mental health problems","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-16","",28510,""

In our sample, 1 in 3 participants screened positive for postpartum depression and 1 in 5 had major depressive symptoms. Participants who fed their infants formula had 92% greater odds of screening positive for postpartum depression and were 73% more likely to screen positive for major depressive symptoms compared to those who breastfed or bottle-fed with their own human milk. Participants with infants admitted to a NICU had 74% greater odds of screening positive. Each 1Ã‚Â week increase in weeks postpartum increased the odds of screening positive by 4%.

"How did the first COVID-19 lockdown affect persons with concurrent mental health and substance use disorders in Norway? A qualitative study","The outbreak of COVID-19 with its severe social restrictions touched the daily life of most people. While everyday social life becomes difficult for citizens with economic and cultural capital, it becomes even worse for vulnerable groups such as persons with mental health and substance use disorders, who are particularly vulnerable to social exclusion. The aim of this study is to investigate how the first COVID-19 lockdown affected the everyday life and health of persons with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders. This qualitative study reports data from 17 individual interviews and one focus group of five participants, all with a self-reported mental health and substance use disorder. Interviews were conducted based on a semi-structured interview guide in September and October 2020 in a medium-sized local authority in Norway. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. A reference group of people with varied knowledge and experiences of the phenomenon were involved in study design, recruitment, data generation and analysis. The analysis identified four interrelated main themes, describing how the first lockdown affected the everyday life and health of persons suffering from a mental health and substance use disorder: (1) The COVID-19 outbreak as a perceived challenge, (2) A decline in mental health and well-being, (3) Increased substance use challenges, and (4) Diverse experiences with health and social services. The results show that people with a co-occurring disorder have challenges with digital tools and/or do not have the appropriate equipment. Further, participants were not concerned about becoming infected themselves, but infecting others. Persons with a mental health and substance use disorder face major challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a need to maintain continuous low-threshold services especially directed towards persons with co-occurring disorders during the pandemic. Furthermore, it is important to improve the digital skills of every service user or offer alternatives to digital consultations and meetings.","Leonhardt, Brodahl, Cogan, Lien","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-03812-7","20220315","COVID-19; Lockdown; Mental health disorder; Qualitative study; Substance use disorder; Thematic analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-16","",28512,""
"The impact of COVID-19 on access to harm reduction, substance use treatment and recovery services in Scotland: a qualitative study","People who use drugs (PWUD) are considered vulnerable to COVID-19 exposure and the sequelae of infection due to their social circumstances, health conditions, drug purchasing, and substance use. They can depend on access to services that provide harm reduction, substance use treatment, recovery and support, and general healthcare. Social distancing measures and service restrictions posed significant challenges to the health and wellbeing of PWUD. Ethical approvals were secured. PWUD were recruited from voluntary sector homeless and housing, harm reduction, and recovery organisations across central Scotland. Data was collected via semi-structured interviews and analysed using the Framework Method. Twenty nine PWUD participated and reported mixed experiences of the impacts of COVID-19 lockdown. Several benefitted from policy and practice developments designed to sustain or increase access to harm reduction services. Some PWUD reported improved access to substitute prescribing and/or appreciated being trusted to manage multiple take-home doses. Others noted the loss of regular in-person contact with treatment providers and dispensers. Access to recovery support was challenging for many, especially those unable to access or uncomfortable with online provision who experienced greater isolation. Lack of access to general healthcare services was common, and especially problematic for PWUD with chronic physical and mental health conditions. This qualitative research describes the impacts of COVID-19 social and service restrictions on PWUD in Scotland. These impacts were anticipated by policy makers and service providers. Effective and acceptable developments were shown to maintain and even increase service provision for PWUD. Developments were geographically dependent and significant challenges remained for many people. The learning generated can inform responses to increase service access and uptake in post-pandemic times.","Schofield, Dumbrell, Matheson, Parkes, Bancroft","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-12873-y","20220315","COVID-19; Harm reduction; Opioid replacement treatment; Recovery; Substance use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-16","",28513,""
"Household Chaos and Caregivers' and Young Children's Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Mediation Model","Based on 764 households with young children in Wuhan, China, where the COVID-19 pandemic started, this study investigated how household chaos during the pandemic was associated with the mental health problems of children and their caregivers. It also examined the familial correlates of household chaos. The results showed that household chaos was associated with caregiver-rated symptoms of anxiety/withdrawal, fearfulness and acting out exhibited by young children and the symptoms of anxiety and depression in their caregivers. Moreover, caregivers' depression and anxiety mediated the relations between household chaos and caregiver-rated child mental health problems. Additionally, caregivers living in families with a single caregiver, a larger family size, poorer physical health, and more significant income loss reported greater levels of household chaos during the pandemic. These findings highlight the importance of reducing household chaos to promote the mental health of young children and their caregivers during the pandemic. They also underscore the need to identify families with high levels of chaos based on key background variables.","Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10826-022-02283-4","20220315","COVID-19; Caregivers; Householdchaos; Mentalhealth; Young children","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-16","",28514,""
"The fear of COVID-19 and job insecurity impact on depression and anxiety: An empirical study in China in the COVID-19 pandemic aftermath","The employees' psychological health and resilience in times of emergency and general uncertainty was chosen due to the immense implications for economics, entrepreneurs, psychologists and psychiatrists, and policymakers. This study aims to provide an insight into uncertainty-induced anxiety and depression among Chinese employees in the aftermath of the COVID-19 outbreak. Analysis performed in the context of China in the COVID-19 pandemic aftermath is significant due to the universal nature of external shock impact on psychological welfare, applicable across nations and business sectors and in similar contexts. The statistical analysis was performed with SEM software AMOS version 23. The research model consisting of fear of COVID-19, job insecurity, anxiety, depression, was empirically tested. A purposive sampling technique was applied with the online questionnaire shared with employees in companies located in China. Respondents were working in educational services, information technology, engineering, electronics, and other sectors on white-collar jobs. The data collection was conducted from May to August 2020, in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic in China. The research sample consisting of 283 respondents was used for analysis. Path analysis was performed, and standardized parameter estimates, standard errors, and p-values were calculated. The results indicate a positive and significant impact of job insecurity on depression and anxiety.
