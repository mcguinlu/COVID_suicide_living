"Investigation of Activities of Daily Living and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Levels of COVID-19 Patients: A Descriptive Study","This study aimed to examine the COVID-19 patients' hospital anxiety, depression levels and independence in activities of daily living. This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted with n=100 COVID-19 patients. The data was collected using a patient descriptive information form, the ""Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living"", and the ""Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale"". Descriptive statistics, Student t-test, Mann Whitney U test, One-way ANOVA test, and Kruskal Wallis test were used to compare groups. The significance level is pre-specified as 0.05. The mean age of the patients was 41.77 +/- 12.10 years (Min: 20, Max: 70). More than half of the patients were male (68%), and 86% were treated and cared for in the service isolation rooms. Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale mean scores were 6.66 +/- 6.05 (Min: 0, Max: 21) and the Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living mean scores were 5.57 +/- 1.27 (Min: 0, Max: 6). It was determined that as the patients' level of independence in their daily living activities increased, their hospital anxiety and depression levels decreased. A negative moderate correlation (r = -0.530, r = -0.552) was found between the mean scores of these variables. Since these patients usually receive care in isolation in their rooms, activities of daily living should be monitored and supported in terms of the hospital anxiety and depression levels.","Tosun, B.; Dusak, I.; Unal, N.; Gungor, S.; Tosun, N.","https://doi.org/10.35365/ctjpp.22.2.07","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Cyprus Turkish Journal of Psychiatry and Psychology; 4(2):171-179, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-21","",34630,""

"ANTIVIRAL HERBS","Objective: Viruses are agents that can infect all kinds of living organisms, and the most important hosts are humans, animals, plants, bacteria and fungi. Viral diseases are responsible for serious morbidity and mortality worldwide, are a major threat to public health, and remain a major problem worldwide. The recently prominent Coronaviruses (CoVs) within this group belong to the Coronaviridae family, subfamily Coronavirinae, and are large (genome size 26-32 kb), enveloped, single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA ) viruses that can infect both animals and humans. The world has experienced three epidemics caused by betaCoVs in the last two decades: SARS in 2002-03, MERS in 2012, and COVID-19, first identified in 2019. COVID-19 continues to be our current health problem and studies on the subject continue. Result and Discussion: The term ""antiviral agents"" is defined in very broad terms as substances other than virus-containing vaccine or specific antibody that can produce a protective or therapeutic effect for the clearly detectable effect of the infected host. Nature has the potential to cure humanity's helplessness against viruses with many different plant species with strong antiviral effects. During the screening of plants with antiviral effects, focusing on plants used in folk medicine is of great importance in terms of maximizing the benefit to humanity - saving time and effort by dealing with valuable ancient knowledge on a scientific basis. In this review, viral diseases and the plants used in these diseases and determined to be effective are mentioned.","Kose, T. I.; Ozkan, A. M.

"Can living with COVID-19 patients in a hospital increase anxiety levels? A survey-based single-center study in Peru","Introduction: Anxiety can affect front-line healthcare workers (HCWs) during the COVID-19 pandemic mainly in settings with influencing factors. Living with COVID-19 patients in hospital settings could affect mental health during lockdown. The present study aimed to estimate the anxiety levels of HCWs of the care center for COVID-19 Villa Panamericana during the first outbreak of COVID-19 in Peru. Methods: This is a descriptive and correlational study. Ninety-six HCWs were enrolled in this study (mean age 30 +/- 5.6 years). The care center for COVID-19 Villa Panamericana houses COVID-19 patients and HCWs in the same environment. We used the 14-item Hamilton anxiety rating scale questionnaire. Professionals were interviewed directly at the VP-19 rest towers. SPSS V.23 were used to analyze the data. Results: Fifty-four (56.3%) were male and the most frequent age group was 26-35 years (81.3%). Thirty-nine (40.6%) were nurses, 28 (29.2%) were nursing technicians, 15 (15.6%) were physicians, and 14 (14.6%) were medical technologists. Of the total, 66 (68.8%) HCWs had a mild level of anxiety, while 6 (6.3%) had severe anxiety. Medical technologists and nursing technicians had the highest level of severe anxiety (14.3% and 7.1%), while nurses had the highest level of mild anxiety (76.9%). We report that 32 (33.3%) HCWs had COVID-19 while 93.7% had symptoms of anxiety [3(9.4%) mild to moderate, 21(65.6 %) moderate to severe, and 6(18.8%) severe]. We found a significant difference in anxiety levels between HCWs with and without COVID-19 (p=0.001). Conclusions: Levels of moderate and severe anxiety significantly increased in HCWs infected with COVID-19 during their coexistence with COVID-19 patients in the health center that houses both at the same time.","Moya-Salazar, J.; Contreras-Pulache, H.; Saciga-Saavedra, W.; Canari, B.; Chicoma-Flores, K.","https://doi.org/10.29333/ejgm/12140","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Electronic Journal of General Medicine; 19(5):6, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-21","",34633,""
"Shielding families' experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic: a review across the UK and Italy","As communities have gone into lockdown to stop the worldwide spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the mass efforts to save lives has put some people more at risk than others, and in their own homes. Starting with a comparison between Italy and the UK, this review examines the impact of pandemic measures for those shielding families who are affected by abusive relationships and those who, with health and social care needs. are considered at high risk of serious consequences if they are exposed to COVID-19 measures. Focusing on an increased number of DV cases reported, we explore the impact of pandemic measures on vulnerable people and families through a review on this topic, that comprises early research findings from initial web-based surveys, and subsequent online surveys, about life, health and wellbeing, and daily activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings show information on changes and disruptions experienced during lockdown by people lived across the UK and Italy, even if they were not nationally representative samples. The majority of results reports income changes, mostly decreased during the lockdown, as well as educational/employment activities changes. Significant gendered effects of the epidemic have pointed out adverse impacts of lockdowns, globally, on N\ omen. Moreover, of those receiving ongoing healthcare. most of all reported that it had been disrupted;especially women and young people, with previous mental health problems, were more likely to report disruptions to their care and services. Overall, a comparison between the two different countries and their community services highlights how lockdown has resulted in a reduction of available support for vulnerable people, while many others have experienced significant changes in how this care is provided. As results showed, modifiable psychological variables play a significant role in predicting distress, and indicated that emotional distress interventions might be helpful to mitigate the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially within shielding people.","Merenda, A.; Garro, M.","https://doi.org/10.23736/s2724-6612.22.02331-4","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Minerva Psychiatry; 63(2):89-98, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-21","",34634,""

"The psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic in health care workers: a cross-sectional study in Nepal","BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic has affected the healthcare workers (HCWs) worldwide. We plan to assess the psychological impact of this pandemic in different groups of HCWs including female community health volunteers (FCHVs) at various types of health facilities in Nepal, factors associated with it and the degree of satisfaction with the ongoing mental health support system. METHODS: A cross-sectional web-based survey with an option of telephone interview was conducted from June 20 to July 7, 2020. The questionnaire included socio-demographic characteristics, work related characteristics, substance use history, and degree of satisfaction with family, society and institutional support. Depression, anxiety, and stress scales (DASS-21) and the impact of events scale-revised (IES-R) tool were used to access the level of psychological impact. Linear regression was used to analyze factors associated with psychological outcome. RESULTS: Out of 608 respondents, the overall prevalence of depression, anxiety, stress, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was 20.89%. 24.18%, 13.82%, and 15.46% respectively. Nurses had higher depression, anxiety, stress, and PTSD scores while FCHVs had high depression and PTSD compared to doctors. For various types of health facilities, HCWs working in provincial-level hospitals had high-stress level. Similarly, ""have to go into quarantine"" and increased level of substance abuse were directly associated with poor psychological impact. Finally, 62% of HCWs did not have any institutional mental health support system. Among those who had institutional mental health support, 39.4% were not satisfied. CONCLUSIONS: We found mild to extremely severe level of depression, anxiety, stress, and PTSD among HCWs in Nepal.

"EMERGENCE OF NEW STRAINS OF SARS-COV-2: AFRICAâ€™S FATE AND ITS PREPAREDNESS AGAINST COVID-19 INFECTION WAVES","Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected over 100 million individuals worldwide with diverse impacts on nations. The rising cases of new strains and resultant infection waves create an urgent need to assess the readiness of countries especially in Africa to mitigate the impact on community transmission. This paper delivers a brief synopsis of the novel SARS-CoV-2, emerging cases of new variants reported worldwide, and implications for genetic surveillance of disease transmission in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) especially Africa. Materials and Methods: Literature search used keywords like SARS-CoV-2;COVID-19 epidemiology;pandemic waves;corona outbreak, clinical syndromes, treatments, prevention and control. Cross-sectional and observational studies published on COVID-19 from 2019 till date of study provided main information sources. Databases such as Web of Science, Embase, PubMed and Google Scholar were utilised. Main findings: Over 220 countries have documented COVID-19 cases with varied severity till date. Before the spikes in resurgence, a highly virulent mutated (&gt;90% fatality rate) novel strain of COVID-19 had been documented. There is very little data to ascertain the impact of the COVID-19 infection waves in LMICs. Discussion: LMICs especially African countries still grapple with significant challenges like inefficient surveillance mechanisms, inadequate vaccination coverage, inadequate enforcement of environmental health strategies, poor health systems etc. Hence, Africaâ€™s fate remains dicey in the face of the dynamic evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 and other identified challenges. Conclusion: The adoption of a multidisciplinary approach to mitigate the impact of emergence of mutant SARS-CoV-2 variants and resurgence of infection spike is recommended.","Chinenyenwa, O.; Solomon, B.

"Effect of COVID-19 social isolation on the fear of COVID-19, quality of life and cognitive functions in the elderly","Purpose: The purpose of this study is to appraise the impact of COVID-19 social isolation on fear of COVID-19, quality of life and cognitive functions. Materials and Methods: Individuals aged 65 and over who made an appointment for the CoronaVac vaccine via appointment system and 603 people residing in these houses, wanted to be vaccinated, gave informed consent for the vaccine and agreed to participate, were included in the study. Sociodemographic data form, Coronavirus 19 Phobia Scale, Mini Mental State Test and Short Form 36 Quality of Life Scale were filled in by the study population. Results: Patients included in our research, 63.0% were female (n=380) and 37.0% were male (n=223). The mean age was 77.65 +/- 8.05 (min:65, max:97) years. Status of having a relative with COVID-19, social function status of SF-36, mental health status of SF-36 economic status of CP19-S size and the total score of CP19-S were found as multivariate predictors of COVID-19 disease transmission. As the total score of the participants from the COVID-19 phobia scale increased, their cognitive functions significantly decreased. Conclusion: These findings reported important results regarding the effects of social isolation experienced by the elderly during the COVID-19 pandemic on quality of life, cognitive functions, and COVID-19 fear levels.","Yildirim, D.

"Assessment of psychosocial impact among medical interns working in a tertiary care hospital during the time of pandemic in Chennai district, Tamilnadu-A Cross-sectional study","Background:Medical interns develop apprehensions about the vulnerability of their exposure to infection while treating Covid-19 patients which may further affect their work pattern and efficiency. Studies have shown that the outbreak of infectious diseases would result in mental health issues. In view of this our study aims to assess the psychosocial factors such as anxiety, depression, stress, relationship with peers and change in personal roles among medical interns of a private medical college. Methodology:This cross-sectional was carried among 248 medical interns working in tertiary care hospitals by using simple random sampling method. Depression, anxiety, and stress were assessed using a standardized 21-item depression, anxiety, and stress questionnaire (DASSâ€“ 21). To acquire information regarding the study participants' socio-demographic data and social elements, a pretested semi-structured questionnaire was used. Results:The overall prevalence of Depression [58%], Anxiety [70%] and Stress [44%] were found among the 248 study participants.Around [70.6%] of the study participants reported thattheir social lifehad been affected. The prevalence of various factors associated with depression, anxiety and stress were assessed. Conclusion:This study reports higher levels of psychosocial distress among the study participants.

"Family relationship of nurses in COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative study","BACKGROUND This research demonstrates that nurses feel pain because the pandemic process has separated them from their family and children. AIM To examine the family relationship situation of nurses in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS The research adopted a descriptive qualitative design. Participants were selected by the snowball method. An individual in-depth interview technique was used while the participants were away. In-depth interviews were made with a total of 27 nurses. Nine of these nurses were excluded from the study due to communication problems and device problems during the interview. RESULTS This research showed that nurses suffered from family relationship breakdown and insufficiency in intrafamilial coping. The nurses stayed away from their families due to overtime and fear of COVID-19. They cannot meet the needs of their children and spouses for whom they are responsible, and they cannot spare time for them. They were living a tiring life with great responsibility and faced with mental problems such as burnout syndrome and depression. This study was conducted in three cities with a high number of COVID-19 cases in Turkey. We investigated three themes: Breakdown in continuity of intrafamilial relationship, ineffectiveness in role performance, and ineffective individual coping. CONCLUSION The nurses suffer from conditions such as change in parent-infant/child relation and insufficiency in intrafamilial process coping.","Ã‡elik, M.

"Pregnancy-related psychopathology: A comparison between preCOVID-19 and COVID-19â€“related social restriction period","BACKGROUND The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic impacted in a still undefined way pregnant womenâ€™s mental health. There are reports of mood and affect changes in the general population and the suggestion that similar changes occur also in the pregnant population. The greater vulnerability of women during the COVID-19 restriction period may translate into a greater risk for mental disorders in the gestational period. We hypothesised that pregnant women in the prepandemic period would have less psychopathology and more psychological support than pregnant women during the pandemic restriction period. AIM To compare pregnant women for anxiety, prenatal depression, psychopathology, and social support before and after the awareness of the pandemic.METHODS We administered to women willing to participate in their 2 nd-3rd trimesters of pregnancy the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Form Y (STAI-Y), and the Symptom CheckList-90-Revised (SCL-90R);we further collected sociodemographic variables and explored womenâ€™s social support. The comparison was cross-sectional. The first sample was termed nonCOVID-19 because data were gathered before the COVID-19 outbreak (January 2020-February 2020) was declared, and the second sample termed COVID-19 because participants were already subjected to the COVID-19â€“related restrictive measures (January 2021-February 2021). Since normal distribution was not met (Shapiro-Wilk test applied), we applied nonparametric Mann-Whitneyâ€™s U-test to compare psychometric tests. Ethical standards were met. RESULTS The nonCOVID-19 group reported higher support from partners only, while the COVID-19 group reported multiple support (<U+03C7> 2 = 9.7181;P = 0.021);the nonCOVID-19 group scored higher than the COVID-19 group only on state anxiety among psychometric scales [STAI-Y1, nonCOVID-19 median = 39 (95%CI: 39.19-51.10) vs COVID-19 median= 32 (95%CI: 30.83-38.90);Mann-Whitneyâ€™s U=117.5, P = 0.00596]. Other measures did not differ meaningfully between the two groups. Scores on the EPDS, the state and trait subscales of the STAI-Y, and most SCL-90R subscales intercorrelated with one another. The anxiety component of the EPDS, EPDS-3A, correlated poorly with other measures, while it was the Global Symptom Index of the SCL-90-R that correlated most strongly with most measures. Our results are at odds with most literature and do not confirm increased depression and anxiety rates in pregnant women during the pandemic. CONCLUSION The ability of pregnant women to deal with novel generalised threats involves mobilization of inner resources. Increasing sources of social support may have produced anxiolysis in the COVID19 sample.","Chieffo, D.; Avallone, C.; Serio, A.; Kotzalidis, G. D.; Balocchi, M.; De Luca, I.; Hirsch, D.; Castillo, A.

"Emergency Peripartum Hysterectomy in a Tertiary Care Centre of North India during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Retrospective Study","Introduction: The pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) had a significant impact on obstetric surgeries. Obstetric surgical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic affect individuals who are suspected or proven to be high-risk endeavors. Aim: To evaluate the demographic characteristics, indications, intraoperative and postoperative complications, and foetomaternal outcomes in the women who had an Emergency Peripartum Hysterectomy (EPH) during the first and second waves of the COVID-19 at a tertiary care centre in North India. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study, conducted in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at a tertiary care centre in Uttar Pradesh, India, including women who underwent EPH operated from March 2020 to May 2021 in terms of demographic characteristics, indications, intraoperative and postoperative complications, and foetomaternal outcomes. Information about their self-reported health issues due to traumatic birth (when they came for a follow-up visit at five weeks) were also obtained. Simple frequency, percentage, and proportion were calculated using descriptive statistics. Results: A total number of 1827 deliveries were conducted and out them 11 cases underwent emergency peripartum hysterectomy at our institute during the time frame of the COVID-19 pandemic. All of the patients were in their 20s or 30s, with ages ranging from 21 to 34. All of these were unplanned pregnancies and arrived at various gestational ages. Eight cases had the previous scarring on the uterus, with six women having morbidly adhered placenta. All of the women in the study cohort were unbooked, and 72.73 % (eight out of 11) of them were referred to our centre because they had high-risk factors. Due to substantial blood loss, five females required Critical Care Unit (CCU) support. The study sample had a poor newborn outcome, with three early neonatal deaths out of 11 deliveries. As a part of their 5th-week follow-up, after the women had been stabilized and discharged from the ICU, they were asked to share their major issues related to health, psychological status and social interaction. The main worries revolved around the newborn child's and COVID-19 positive husband's health. Pregnant women who delivered during the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant rate of postpartum depression and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Conclusion: The predominant cause of EPH in the study population was a morbidly adherent placenta. It is critical to protect women's physical and psychological health during traumatic childbirth in order to mitigate the pandemic's already-existing harmful impacts.","Singh, J.; Sachan, S.; Singh, D.; Pandey, U.","https://doi.org/10.7860/JCDR/2022/56598.16513","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research; 16(6):QC10-QC15, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-21","",34645,""

"Parental Burnout in Hungary: Development and Psychometric Evaluation of the Hungarian Parental Burnout Assessment (PBA-HUN)","Introduction: Parental burnout might take place when excessive demands overwhelm the parents' resources. Aims: To develop and validate the Hungarian version of the Parental Burnout Assessment (PBA-HUN), an instrument designed to measure parental burnout;and to determine the prevalence of parental burnout in Hungary. Methods: Data were collected via an online survey from parents with at least one child living in the household (N = 1215;82.6% mothers;M-age = 38.68 years;SDage = 6.27 years). Confirmatory factor analysis was used to investigate the factor structure of the PBA-HUN. Results: The four-factor structure of the original PBA was replicated, confirming the following factors: exhaustion in one's parental role, contrast with one's parental role, feelings of being fed up, and emotional distancing from one's children. A second-order model with a higher-order factor representing overall parental burnout also fit the data well. The internal consistency of both the subscale and total scores was excellent (alpha &gt;= 0.84). Parental burnout had a moderately strong negative correlation with life satisfaction, and weak or moderate positive correlations with perceived stress, depression, vital exhaustion, and COVID-specific perceived stress supporting the construct validity of the PBA-HUN. The prevalence of parental burnout stood at 5.8% in this sample. The weak relationship between PBA-HUN scores and sociodemographic factors was also similar to those found in prior studies. Parental burnout correlated negatively with the number of hours spent sleeping and engaging in spare time activity, respectively. Conclusions: The PBA-HUN is a reliable and valid tool to assess parental burnout in Hungary.","Hamvai, C.; Hidegkuti, I.; Vargha, A.; Konkoly Thege, B.","https://doi.org/10.5708/ejmh/17.2022.1.5","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: European Journal of Mental Health; 17(1):47-61, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-21","",34647,""
"Relationship between social support and COVID-19 anxiety in the elderly","Introduction and Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has been causing both physical and mental problems to peopleâ€™s health. The psychological effects are of a wide variety, such as panic disorders, fears, anxiety, depression. Of special interest is an increase of anxiety of people in the community, in the elderly, and people with underlying diseases. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the relationship between social support and the level of COVID-19 anxiety in the elderly in Fasa. Methods: The present study was cross-sectional research conducted on 600 elderly covered by urban and rural family physician clinics after obtaining permission from the Research Deputy and the Ethics Committee of the university through the Press Line program. The research data were collected through demographic information collection form, COVID-19 anxiety measurement questionnaire, and multidimensional scale of perceived social support. They were completed in a self-reporting manner. Data were analyzed in SPSS-23 software. Results: The mean age of the elderly was 65.91Â±4.84 years. Most of the participants (60%) were female. There was a significant negative relationship between anxiety and perceived social support and its components (p&lt;0.05). The results of regression analysis showed that the variables of social support, job, and marital status had a statistically significant relationship with anxiety (p&lt;0.05) and these variables explained 42% of the variance of the COVID-19 anxiety variable in the elderly (p&lt;0.05).

"The effect of spiritual leadership and spiritual intelligence on low nurse burnout in a hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic","During the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, hospital nurses who are one of the spearheads in dealing with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 sufferers are very at risk of experiencing psychological disorders due to feelings of depression called Burnout. Spiritual leadership that exists in the leaderâ€™s personal and spiritual intelligence possessed by nurses is expected to influence prevention of nurse burnout. This study aims to determine the extent of the influence of spiritual leadership and spiritual intelligence on the low Burnout of hospital employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study is quantitative. The data collection uses a questionnaire technique. The subjects of this study were the nurses of Siti Khodijah Muhammadiyah Hospital in Gurah Kediri, Indonesia. Data analysis was performed using Multiple Linear Regression. The regression line equation obtained is Y = 43.79 + 0.889 + 0.102 + e. H1 test shows the value of t count 2,314 &gt; t table 2,019;the significance value is 0.026 &lt; 0.05, and the correlation coefficient H1 shows a value of 0.457. H2 test shows the value of t arithmetic 0.26 &lt; t table 2.019;significance value 0.790 &gt; 0.05;and the correlation coefficient H2 shows a value of 0.331. The H3 test shows the calculated F value of 5.584 &gt; from F table 3.2;significance value 0.007 &lt; 0.05;and the value of the correlation coefficient H3 is 0.458. The determinant coefficient (R2) H3 is 0.210 which means that the results of this study can explain 21% of the variation in the high or low Burnout of hospital nurses which is influenced by spiritual leadership and spiritual intelligence, while the rest, 79% is influenced by other things that are not used as a model for this research. Spiritual leadership has a positive and significant effect on the low Burnout of nurses with a strong influence. Spiritual intelligence has no significant effect on the low Burnout of nurses. Spiritual leadership combined with spiritual intelligence has a positive and significant effect on the low Burnout of nurses with a strong influence.","Ardhani, M.

"COVID-19 Knowledge, Attitudes, Practices, and vaccination hesitancy in Moshi, Kilimanjaro Region, Northern Tanzania","Background: The COVID-19 vaccinations have reignited optimism in many cultures devastated by the pandemic's tremendous loss of lives and livelihoods. Vaccination hesitancy is a critical and growing international problem in the global effort to manage the COVID-19 pandemic. To successfully handle vaccination hesitancy concerns, it is necessary to understand the levels of knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors on COVID-19. The purpose of this study was to understand peopleâ€™s knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes about COVID 19 and its related vaccines. Methods: In October 2021, a cross-sectional study with 232 participants was conducted. A standardized interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Results: Most respondents in the present survey heard about COVID-19 between January and March 2020. Social media and newspapers are the most effective sources of information on COVID-19, reaching 34.48 % of the population. Basic COVID-19 knowledge was reported to be moderate. Nearly half of the respondents (48.3 %) thought SARSCOV-2 was man-made, while 36.21 % were unsure. Good preventive behaviors were indicated by 49.14 % of subjects. Overall, we find that around 65 % of people are reluctant to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Male gender, low education, and occupation were shown to be more hesitant about vaccination. In this study, healthcare workers were averse to getting the COVID-19 vaccine. The reasons for vaccination hesitation were ""unknown safety"" of the vaccines (17.4 %) and ""unknown long-term consequences"" of the vaccines (18.97 %). Almost a third (27.59 %) of those interviewed said they had no intention of being vaccinated. Conclusion: We report moderate knowledge on COVID-19, as well as effective preventive practices, but negative attitudes regarding COVID-19 vaccination, resulting in low vaccination rates of 6.9%. Misinformation regarding COVID-19 appears to play a key role in vaccination reluctance.","Chilongola, J. O.; Rwegoshola, K. M.; Balingumu, O. H.; Semvua, H. S.; Kwigizile, E.

"Designing a Mobile Intervention for Alzheimer's and Other Dementias","The number of the elderly experiencing cognitive disorders or dementia including Alzheimer's has been increasing worldwide. During COVID-19 pandemic, they are vulnerable not only to the coronavirus, but also to the social isolation with no family visits. The elderly are increasingly depressed, resisting care, refusing medications, and showing signs of agitation. These behavioral disturbances are leading to an increased use of psychotropic medications and/or increased hospitalizations to the already overloaded healthcare systems. To address this, the authors focus on a mobile intervention, named AlzhaTV, as a suite of mobile apps. The intervention, not requiring any technical interaction from the elderly, is available on both Android and iOS platforms. The mobile intervention has the potential to improve the quality of life and reduction in medications for the elderly. The results show that multiple personalized and non-personalized videos can be transmitted over existing wireless networks.

"Being COVID Warriors among COVIGNORANTS in Indonesia: The Importance of Mental Health Endurance","COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has spread across the globe. COVID-19 cases keep increasing as July 04, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announce about 11,046,917 confirmed cases of COVID-19 that spread in 216 countries. The WHO has published helpful advice to keep and reduce the chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 among the public such as cleaning hands regularly, maintaining physical distance, wearing masks properly, and encouraging to be in a ventilated area. An idiom for a person who ignores measures to prevent COVID-19 spread acts as if the world is not in the pandemic condition that is COVIGNORANT. Some of the COVIGNORANTS do not trust healthcare workers and spread a lot of false myths regarding COVID-19. Misperception and lack of knowledge about COVID-19 among COVIGNORANS lead to a sense of fear for healthcare workers. People are being a concern regarding contagion exposure from healthcare workers when they come home. Normalizing mental health discussion among healthcare workers should not be a stigma and must be considered one of the important policies that need to be applied among healthcare workers in Indonesia.","Seipalla, F.; Suwirman, W.","https://doi.org/10.3889/oamjms.2022.9710","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Open Access Macedonian Journal of Medical Sciences; 10(E):828-829, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-21","",34652,""
"The Role of Existential Concerns in the Individual's Decisions regarding COVID-19 Vaccine Uptake: A Survey among Non-Vaccinated Italian Adults during the Third Wave of the Pandemic","Recent studies have suggested that health constructs embraced by the Terror Management Theory (TMT) and the Basic Psychological Needs Theory (BPNT) may drive individuals' COVID-19 health-related decisions. This study examines the relationships between existential concerns (ECs;within the TMT), basic psychological needs (BPNs;within the BPNT) and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (VH), as well as the mediating role of negative attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines. A cross-sectional survey was carried out from April to May 2021 on a sample of two hundred and eighty-seven adults (Mage = 36.04 &plusmn;12.07;59.9% females). Participants provided information regarding existential concerns, basic psychological needs, attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines and vaccine hesitancy for Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca vaccines separately. Higher vaccine hesitancy (32.1%) and vaccine resistance (32.8%) rates were found for AstraZeneca than for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (22.3% and 10.1%, respectively). Structural equation modeling showed that existential concerns were related to Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca vaccine hesitancy both directly and indirectly through negative attitudes toward potential side effects of COVID-19 vaccines. The findings of the study confirm that the TMT is efficient in explaining COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Targeted efforts are needed to increase the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines.","Franchina, Vittoria, Bonfanti, Rubinia Celeste, Lo Coco, Gianluca, Salerno, Laura","https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10071079","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Vaccines; 10(7):1079, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-21","",34653,""
"The Self-Reported Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (S-LANSS) and PainDETECT Questionnaires in COVID-19 Survivors with Post-COVID Pain","This study aimed to analyze correlations between Self-Report Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms (S-LANSS) and PainDETECT with proxies of sensitization, pain-related, or psychological/cognitive variables in coronavirus disease, 2019 (COVID-19) survivors exhibiting post-COVID pain. Demographic, clinical, psychological, cognitive, sensitization-associated symptoms, and health-related quality of life were collected in 146 survivors with post-COVID pain. The PainDETECT and S-LANSS questionnaires were used for assessing neuropathic pain-related symptoms. Patients were assessed with a mean of 18.8 (SD 1.8) months after hospitalization. Both questionnaires were positively associated with pain intensity (p &lt; 0.05), anxiety (PainDETECT p &lt; 0.05;S-LANSS p &lt; 0.01), sensitization-associated symptoms (p &lt; 0.01), catastrophism (p &lt; 0.01), and kinesiophobia (p &lt; 0.01) and negatively associated with quality of life (PainDETECT p &lt; 0.05;S-LANSS p &lt; 0.01). Depressive levels were associated with S-LANSS (p &lt; 0.05) but not with PainDETECT. The stepwise regression analyses revealed that 47.2% of S-LANSS was explained by PainDETECT (44.6%), post-COVID pain symptoms duration (1.7%), and weight (1.1%), whereas 51.2% of PainDETECT was explained by S-LANSS (44.6%), sensitization-associated symptoms (5.4%), and anxiety levels (1.2%). A good convergent association between S-LANSS and PainDETECT was found. Additionally, S-LANSS was associated with symptom duration and weight whereas PainDETECT was associated with sensitization-associated symptoms and anxiety levels, suggesting that the two questionnaires evaluate different aspects of the neuropathic pain spectrum in post-COVID pain patients.","FernÃ¡ndez-de-las-PeÃ±as, CÃ©sar, Valera-Calero, Juan Antonio, Herrero-Montes, Manuel, del-Valle-Loarte, Pablo, RodrÃ­guez-Rosado, Rafael, Ferrer-Pargada, Diego, Arendt-Nielsen, Lars, ParÃ¡s-Bravo, Paula","https://doi.org/10.3390/v14071486","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Viruses; 14(7):1486, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-21","",34654,""
"Remote Working and Home Learning: How the Italian Academic Population Dealt with Changes Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown","The COVID-19 pandemic introduced changes in people's lives that affected their mental health. Our study aimed to explore the level of psychological distress in the academic population during the lockdown period and investigate its association with the new working or studying conditions. The study sample included 9364 students and 2159 employees from five Italian universities from the study IO CONTO 2020. We applied linear regression models to investigate the association between home learning or remote working conditions and psychological distress, separately for students and employees. Psychological distress was assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). In both students and employees, higher levels of distress were significantly associated with study/work&ndash;family conflicts, concerns about their future careers, and inadequacy of equipment;in employees, higher levels of distress were significantly associated with a lack of clarity on work objectives. Our results are in line with previous research on the impact of spaces and equipment in remote working/studying from home. Moreover, the study contributes to deepening the association between well-being and telework&ndash;family conflict, which in the literature is still equivocal. Practical implications require academic governance to promote sustainable environments both in remote and hybrid work conditions, by referring to a specific management by objectives approach.","Macciotta, Alessandra, Farinella, Domenica, Dellâ€™Aversana, Giuseppina, Fornili, Marco, Petri, Davide, Baglietto, Laura, Baccini, Michela, Berrocal Montiel, Carmen, Fiorentino, Giuseppe, Severi, Gianluca, Ricceri, Fulvio, Campolo, Maria Gabriella, Bruno, Andreina","https://doi.org/10.3390/su14138161","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(13):8161, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-21","",34655,""
"Has the Pandemic Altered Public Perception of How Local Green Spaces Affect Quality of Life in the United Kingdom?","Green spaces unquestionably improve both physical and mental health, but there is little information on how they affect quality of life. This study investigates whether the public perception of how local green spaces and their impact on quality of life have altered as a result of restrictions imposed by the U.K.'s SARS-CoV-2 pandemic containment strategy. Qualitative data were collected using an online questionnaire distributed via social media platforms and postal flyers. The results clearly demonstrate that 90% of participants believe that green spaces improved their quality of life during the pandemic, with over 85% thinking that green spaces will continue to have a positive impact on their quality of life once the pandemic is over. Whether this is a permanent change in public thinking or a short-term adaptation to the stresses of the pandemic can be assessed in future research studies. More detailed research is required to understand more clearly the aspects and types of green spaces that are the most valuable for improving quality of life so that future ones can be designed to provide maximum benefits.","Crossley, Alexandra Jane, Russo, Alessio","https://doi.org/10.3390/su14137946","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(13):7946, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-21","",34656,""
"The Health and Healthcare Outcomes of Trans and/or Non-Binary Adults in England: Protocol for an Analysis of Responses to the 2021 GP Patient Survey","Background: The large-scale quantitative evidence base to understand and improve health and healthcare outcomes for people who are trans and/or non-binary is still developing, although what research there is suggests that risk of poor health is high, and experiences of healthcare services are often poor. In 2021 the GP Patient Survey, which is carried out annually to measure patient experience in primary care in England, added inclusive questions about gender identity and trans status for the first time. Methods: This protocol paper pre-registers the methods that we will use for this work for a secondary analysis of these data, including both the statistical analysis protocol and early patient and public involvement work, to answer the following three research questions: (1) What are the (a) demographic characteristics, (b) health conditions, and (c) healthcare experiences of trans and/or non-binary adults in England? (2) Was there any difference in whether people who are trans and/or non-binary had been asked to shield during the COVID-19 pandemic or not compared with all other survey responders?

"Change in Neuroticism and Extraversion among Pre-University Education Employees during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background and objectives: Since the first reports of SARS-CoV-2 infection cases in China, the virus has rapidly spread to many countries, including Romania. In Romania, schools were closed in March 2020 to prevent the virus from spreading;since then, they have been sporadically opened, but only for a short time. Teachers had to adopt online education methods, experiencing real difficulties in their attempts to maintain high-quality teaching, as a result of social distancing from students and colleagues. The current study aimed to evaluate the burden on the neuroticism states of employees in the pre-university education system during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: A prospective study was conducted, in which personality trait data from 138 employees were collected via a questionnaire (EPI, Eysenck Personality Inventory), which measured extraversion&ndash;introversion and neuroticism scores before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Initially, 150 subjects were invited to participate in the study, although 12 of them refused to participate. Based on the questionnaire not being fully filled in a further three subjects were excluded from the study, leaving a total of 135, of which 115 were woman and 20 were men. Results: The results demonstrate that the subjects included in the study expressed higher neuroticism during the COVID-19 pandemic than in the pre-pandemic period. This change could promote more stress and depression symptoms. Subjects with high school education had significantly lower neuroticism scores over time than those with university education (p = 0.006). Furthermore, we found extraversion scores to be statistically significant in our population (p = 0.022). Conclusion: The gender and living environment of the teachers were not significantly associated with the reduction in the extraversion score, but were more frequently found among older persons and in subjects without higher education. Subjects of Hungarian ethnicity had lower extraversion scores than those of Romanian ethnicity.","Alexescu, Teodora-Gabriela, Nechita, Madalina-Stela, Maierean, Anca-Diana, Vulturar, Damiana-Maria, Handru, Mircea Ioan, Leucu<U+021B>a, Daniel-Corneliu, Ora<U+0219>an, Olga Hilda, Negrean, Vasile, Ciumarnean, Lorena, Todea, Doina Adina","https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina58070895","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Medicina; 58(7):895, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-21","",34658,""
"Antibody Responses after Two Doses of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine in Dialysis and Kidney Transplantation Patients Recovered from SARS-CoV-2 Infection","Background and Objectives: Hemodialysis patients (HD) and kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) have been heavily impacted by COVID-19, showing increased risk of infection, worse clinical outcomes, and higher mortality rates than the general population. Although mass vaccination remains the most successful measure in counteracting the pandemic, less evidence is available on vaccine effectiveness in immunodepressed subjects previously infected and recovered from COVID-19. Materials and Methods: This study aimed at investigating the ability to develop an adequate antibody response after vaccination in a 2-dose series against SARS-CoV-2 in HD patients and KTR that was administered after laboratory and clinical recovery from COVID-19. Results: Comparing SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG levels measured before and after 2 doses of mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2 vaccine, Comirnaty, Pfizer&ndash;BioNTech or mRNA-1273 vaccine, Spikevax, Moderna), highly significant increases of antibody titers were observed. The antibody peak level was reached at 3 months following second dose administration, regardless of the underlying cause of immune depression and the time of pre-vaccine serology assessment after negativization. Conclusions: Our data indicate that HD patients and KTR exhibit a satisfying antibody response to a 2-dose series of mRNA vaccine, even in cases when infection-induced humoral immunity was poor or rapidly fading. Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of booster doses in conferring effective and durable protection in weak patient categories.","Cappuccilli, Maria, Semprini, Simona, Fabbri, Elisabetta, Fantini, Michela, Bruno, Paolo Ferdinando, Spazzoli, Alessandra, Righini, Matteo, Flachi, Marta, La Manna, Gaetano, Sambri, Vittorio, Mosconi, Giovanni","https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina58070893","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Medicina; 58(7):893, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-21","",34659,""
"Difference between Minorities and Majorities in the Association between COVID-19-Related Stress and Psychological Distress: A Socio-Ecological Perspective and the Moderating Role of Parenthood","This study introduces a socio-ecological perspective of differences in psychological distress between the Palestinian minority and Jewish majority citizens of Israel during lockdown due to COVID-19. The study examines the association between COVID-19-related stress and psychological distress, and the moderating effect of parenthood. Online questionnaires, completed by 1934 participants (1391 Jews, 552 Palestinians;1306 parents, 637 without children;54.86% female, 45.13% male;M age = 40.38, SD = 13.77) assessed COVID-19-related stressors and depression, anxiety, and stress. The Palestinian minority showed a higher level of COVID-19-related stress and psychological distress than the Jewish majority. Parenthood showed a moderating effect on the association between COVID-19-related stress and distress for the Jewish majority but not the Palestinian minority. The results emphasize the significance of considering social status when seeking to understand the differences between minorities and majorities in terms of distress and resilience during pandemic events, and the need for cultural sensitivity and awareness when issuing instructions in such circumstances. Additionally, the results highlight the potential role of parenthood as a resilience factor, depending upon social status.","Tannous-Haddad, Lubna, Hadar-Shoval, Dorit, Alon-Tirosh, Michal, Asraf, Kfir, Tzischinsky, Orna","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19148283","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(14):8283, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-21","",34660,""
"Determinants of Pain-Induced Disability in German Women with Endometriosis during the COVID-19 Pandemic","(1) Background: The main aim of this research was to examine the factors leading to pain-induced disability by assessing the impact of demographic, endometriosis-specific, pandemic-specific, and mental health factors. (2) Methods: Women with endometriosis who attended online support groups were invited to respond to an online survey during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. The Pain Disability Index (PDI) was employed to assess disability-related daily functioning. Independent predictors of pain-induced disability were determined using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. (3) Results: The mean PDI score of the study population was 31.61 (SD = 15.82), which was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.001) than that reported in a previously published normative study of the German population. In the present study, a high level of pain-induced disability, as defined by scores equal to or higher than the median of the study population, older age (OR 1.063, 95% CI 1.010&ndash;1.120, p = 0.020), dysmenorrhea (OR 1.015, 95% CI 1.005&ndash;1.026, p = 0.005), dysuria (OR 1.014;95% CI 1.001&ndash;1.027, p = 0.029), lower back pain (OR 1.018, 95% CI 1.007&ndash;1.029, p = 0.001), and impaired mental health (OR 1.271, 95% CI 1.134&ndash;1.425, p &lt; 0.001) were found to be independent risk factors. Pandemic-specific factors did not significantly influence the pain-induced disability of the participants in this study. (4) Conclusions: The level of pain-induced disability was significantly higher among the women with endometriosis than among women in the normative German validation study. Our findings identified risk factors for experiencing a high level of pain-induced disability, such as demographic and specific pain characteristics. Pandemic-specific factors did not significantly and independently influence the pain-induced disability during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Impaired mental health negatively influenced functioning during daily activities. Thus, women with endometriosis should be managed by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals to prevent negative effects of pain-induced disability on their quality of life.","Schwab, Roxana, Stewen, Kathrin, Kottmann, Tanja, Theis, Susanne, Elger, Tania, Hamoud, Bashar Haj, Schmidt, Mona W.; Anic, Katharina, Brenner, Walburgis, Hasenburg, Annette","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19148277","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(14):8277, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-21","",34661,""
"Physical Activity and Stress of Children and Adolescents during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Germany-A Cross-Sectional Study in Rural Areas","Although infection with SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less dangerous for children and adolescents, research indicates that the measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic have had and continue to have negative effects on children's and adolescents' mental health and physical activity (PA). Due to the different health policies, country-specific studies as well as studies in different phases of the pandemic are important to obtain a differentiated picture of the effects of the pandemic. This study set out to investigate children's and adolescents' PA, stress, and well-being as well as the associations between these two variables during a phase of a gradual decline in measure to contain the pandemic in Germany. For this purpose, 1293 children and adolescents in a rural area of a federal state in Germany were investigated. The results indicated that children and adolescents felt sadder and less well during this period than children and adolescents before the pandemic. Results also revealed that they were more physically active than children and adolescents before the pandemic as well as in the second lockdown but less active than in the first lockdown.

"Managing the Mental Health of Healthcare Professionals in Times of Crisis: The Aruban COVID-19 Experience","Hospital workers in Aruba have been facing an increased demand for healthcare in the unique setting of a Small Island Developing State (SIDS). This study assessed the impact of the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on the mental health of staff at the major hospital in Aruba, examining the differences between employee groups, with the goal of providing recommendations for targeted support and coping strategies in future crises in a small island setting. Patients and methods: In a mixed-method cohort design, Dr. Horacio E. Oduber Hospital staff were asked to complete a 25-item questionnaire about their concerns and worries, organization of work, and general wellbeing;24% of the hospital staff filled in the questionnaire (mean age 41 &plusmn;11 years, 79% female). Alongside the needs assessment questionnaire, six focus groups were established to explore staff feelings on specific measures taken by hospital management during the COVID-19 crisis. Results: Questionnaire analysis (n = 231) revealed employees' concerns about infecting their relatives and their financial stability. In particular, nurses were significantly more concerned than other staff groups. In the wellbeing section of the questionnaire, items regarding future security scored poorest, alongside increased levels of tiredness and nervousness. Focus groups discussions revealed frustrations of the hospital staff with the foreign staff brought in to help during the crisis and a need for better leadership and communication practices from hospital management. Conclusions: Comprehensive and holistic approaches should be implemented by the hospital management to prevent occupational burnout and demoralized work ethics and further emotional exhaustion.","Duwel, Veronika, de Kort, Jaclyn M.

"A Remote Assessment of Anxiety on Young People: Towards Their Views and Their Different Pet Interaction","The lockdown was imposed in Italy on 9 March 2020 due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Restrictions severely limiting individual freedom were indispensable to protect the population and reduce virus diffusion. Italian people had never before experienced similar restrictions that undoubtedly tested psychological health. After 1 week, we developed an electronic survey to collect demographic data and information on the presence of pets and the type of interaction with them and to administer a self-assessment anxiety test. A total of 3905 subjects, pet owners and non pet owners, filled in the electronic survey;652 (16.7%, mean age 21.6) of them were young subjects, adolescents, and university students. The study first showed the feasibility and success of the technological solution used, capable of providing, at a distance, structured information on the participants and quantitative data on the psychological condition. Second, it reported that 23.1% of the youths showed anxiety above an attention level during the lockdown, in line with other studies. Third, it indicated, based on the outcome of the self-assessment test, that the pet presence could have a positive effect in mitigating the psychological impact and encourage to continue and deepen these investigations. Fourth, it reported positive feedback from the participants on the procedure, found useful during the pandemic and for the post-pandemic future.

"Experiences of Social Participation for Canadian Wheelchair Users with Spinal Cord Injury during the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic caused drastic life changes for people with spinal cord injury (SCI). The objective of the study is to explore the social participation of Canadian wheelchair users with SCI during the first wave of COVID-19. Methods: Fourteen participants from Quebec and British Columbia participated in a multi methods cross-sectional study. Three themes were identified, including (1) perceived participation restrictions for people with SCI and their loved ones, which revealed interruptions and changes in service provision during COVID-19, barriers and inconveniences to maintaining life habits and strategies developed during the pandemic to continue participating in meaningful activities;(2) There was no change in life habits (but some subjects found new ways to perform some activities), which highlights that life simply continued as usual and the participants developed new pastimes and interests;and (3) future hopes and concerns, which explained participants' concerns about changes in interpersonal relationships after the pandemic. This study highlights daily participation challenges for people with SCI during the pandemic. Even though the use of technologies, delivery services and social support seemed to facilitate engagement in meaningful activities, mental health challenges and concerns for future relationships persisted for some.","Fortin-BÃ©dard, NoÃ©mie, de Serres-Lafontaine, Annabelle, Best, Krista L.; Rahn, Caroline, Turcotte, Elizabeth, Borisoff, Jaimie, Sweet, Shane N.; Arbour-Nicitopoulos, Kelly P.; Routhier, FranÃ§ois","https://doi.org/10.3390/disabilities2030028","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Disabilities; 2(3):398-414, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-21","",34666,""
"Enhancing Hopeful Resilience Regarding Depression and Anxiety with a Narrative Method of Ordering Memory Effective in Researchers Experiencing Burnout","Depression and anxiety are prevalent, persistent, and difficult to treat industrialized world mental health problems that negatively modify an individual's life perspective through brain function imbalances-notably, in the amygdala and hippocampus. Primarily treated with pharmaceuticals and psychotherapy, the number of individuals affected plus the intensity of their suffering continues to rise post-COVID-19. Decreasing depression and anxiety is a major societal objective. An approach is investigated that considers depression and anxiety consequences of the particular method people adopt in ordering their memories. It focuses on narrative development and the acceptance of different perspectives as uniquely necessary in creating safe protection from research burnout. The method encourages thoughtful reconsideration by participants of the negative assessments of their circumstances that can lead to depression and anxiety. The aim is to determine if the method of ordering developed is helpful in reducing burnout. This is considered through inspecting and comparing group members' feedback form results, both pre- and post-COVID-19 restrictions. The method found useful to participants in reducing research burnout through developing hopeful resilience is comparable to authentic leadership. The conclusions offered encourage psychological and neurological research with respect to this method of promoting hopeful resilience for burnout to diminish depression and anxiety.","Nash, Carol","https://doi.org/10.3390/challe13020028","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Challenges; 13(2):28, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-21","",34667,""
"Prophylactic Architecture: Formulating the Concept of Pandemic-Resilient Homes","The lockdown instituted during the COVID-19 pandemic has drawn the world's attention to the importance of homes as integrated structures for practicing all aspects of life. The home has been transformed from a mere place to live into a complete piece of infrastructure accommodating all activities of life, including study, work, shopping, exercise, entertainment, and even telehealth. Although quarantines were necessary to protect against viral infection, we have faced social and psychological challenges due to the failure of the current home design to accommodate the new lockdown lifestyle during the pandemic. Thus, this study aims to set a foundation for the development and design of resilient homes in a post-quarantine world by establishing a comprehensive framework for quarantine-resilient homes. The framework was established on the basis of the relevant literature and proposals from architects and experts. It brings a perspective to the future requirements of homes so as to provide architects, stakeholders, and policymakers with the appropriate knowledge to mitigate the impact of lockdowns on mental health and well-being in residential buildings by focusing on the physical and architectural environment.","Elrayies, Ghada Mohammad","https://doi.org/10.3390/buildings12070927","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Buildings; 12(7):927, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-21","",34668,""
"Adolescent Resilience during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Review of the Impact of the Pandemic on Developmental Milestones","This review explores the literature regarding the ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the navigation of developmental milestones among adolescents, specifically those in late adolescence, across several domains of their lives. The exploration is contextualized globally, focusing on five key areas: mental health, physical health, education, peer relationships, and family relationships. Implications for practice and interventions are explored in each key area to provide recommendations for those working with adolescents, as well as future research. The changes brought about by the pandemic and the readjustment to what some have referred to as the 'new normalcy';will undoubtedly have lasting effects on all areas of life for this cohort of adolescents, who have shown remarkable resilience navigating this new and unfamiliar world. These changes are synthesized, with the aim to highlight differences and similarities of the shared experiences of the pandemic globally. After exploring the current realities, this chapter goes on to outline the ways in which the experience of such a significant developmental period of one's life during the COVID-19 pandemic will have an impact on adolescents for years to come. Although it is still impossible to comprehend the long-term effects, in examining proximal effects, we can postulate distal implications and potential future effects, as well as possible ways to mitigate these implications as we transition back to more of what was experienced pre-pandemic life, from a post-pandemic experience.","Garagiola, Erica R.; Lam, Queenie, Wachsmuth, Louise S.; Tan, Tse Yen, Ghali, Samara, Asafo, Seth, Swarna, Manjari","https://doi.org/10.3390/bs12070220","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Behavioral Sciences; 12(7):220, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-21","",34669,""
"A case study of cognitive behavioral therapy for illness anxiety and depression caused COVID-19 in a breast cancer","Cancer and the various medical treatments and tests are a major physical and psychological challenge for patients, their relatives and for the medical staff as well. Adherence and compliance become critical factors during prolonged oncological therapies. The mental health of people with malignant cancer, untreated psychological symptoms can affect survival by increasing distress and suffering, weakening quality of life and reducing adherence. Furthermore, they have a particularly high comorbidity with psychiatric disorders. The aim of this study is to introduce the tools of cognitive behavioural therapy and the therapeutic indications in the context of mental disorders associated with chronic somatic illness. Our study presents the case of a 66-year-old woman with breast cancer. She was diagnosed with mild depressive episodes and hypochondriasis based on psychodiagnostic assessment. Instead of interpreting the patient???s symptoms as a serious organic illness, the goal of psychotherapy is to develop new, more adaptive attitudes and more comforting perspective of the symptoms, and to reduce secondary depression. The elements of the 16 -session cognitive behavioural therapy included behavioural activation, analysis of symptomatic behaviour, diary management, development of new alternatives and behavioural experiments, conceptualisation, and summarising learned techniques and future planning.","Tamas, S.; Dora, P.

"Inner Peace in a Global Crisis: A Case Study of Supported Spiritual Individuation in Acute Onset Phase of COVID-19","Emerging-adult undergraduates (ages 18?25) are at increased risk for mental illness, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Simultaneously, emerging adults face developmental tasks including identity development, finding meaning and purpose, and spiritual individuation. A case study approach is used to elucidate processes of undergraduates coping with collective trauma as a potential pathway to trauma-related spiritual growth via Awakened Awareness for Adolescents (AA-A) and emerging adults, a spiritual-mind-body wellness intervention. Awakened Awareness for Adolescents fosters enhanced spiritual perception to support spiritual individuation for improved mental health and well-being. Processes of spiritual individuation supported by AA-A during the COVID-19 pandemic from February to May 2020 are presented using students? qualitative data and self-report measures of psychopathology, spiritual well-being, emotional regulation, and cognition.

"Working conditions and well-being in UK social care and social work during COVID-19","SummaryStress and mental health are among the biggest causes of sickness absence in the UK, with the Social Work and Social Care sectors having among the highest levels of stress and mental health sickness absence of all professions in the UK. Chronically poor working conditions are known to impact employees' psychological and physiological health. The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has affected both the mode and method of work in Social Care and Social Work. Through a series of cross-sectional online surveys, completed by a total of 4,950 UK Social Care and Social Workers, this study reports the changing working conditions and well-being of UK Social Care and Social Workers at two time points (phases) during the COVID-19 pandemic.FindingsAll working conditions and well-being measures were found to be significantly worse during Phase 2 (November?January 2021) than Phase 1 (May?July 2020), with worse psychological well-being than the UK average in Phase 2. Furthermore, our findings indicate that in January 2021, feelings about general well-being, control at work, and working conditions predicted worsened psychological well-being.ApplicationsOur findings highlight the importance of understanding and addressing the impact of the pandemic on the Social Care and Social Work workforce, thus highlighting that individuals, organizations, and governments need to develop mechanisms to support these employees during and beyond the pandemic.","Ravalier, Jermaine, McFadden, Paula, Gillen, Patricia, Mallett, John, Nicholl, Patricia, Neill, Ruth, Manthorpe, Jill, Moriarty, John, Schroder, Heike, Curry, Denise","https://doi.org/10.1177/14680173221109483","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Social Work;: 14680173221109483, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-21","",34672,""
"Effectiveness of WhatsApp for Measuring Migration in Follow-Up Phone Surveys Lessons from a Mode Experiment in Two Low-Income Countries during COVID Contact Restrictions","Phone surveys have increasingly become important data collection tools in developing countries, particularly in the context of sudden contact restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. So far, there is limited evidence regarding the potential of the messenger service WhatsApp for remote data collection despite its large global coverage and expanding membership. WhatsApp may offer advantages in terms of reducing panel attrition and cutting survey costs. WhatsApp may offer additional benefits to migration scholars interested in cross-border migration behavior which is notoriously difficult to measure using conventional face-to-face surveys. In this field experiment, we compared the response rates between WhatsApp and interactive voice response (IVR) modes using a sample of 8446 contacts in Senegal and Guinea. At 12%, WhatsApp survey response rates were nearly eight percentage points lower than IVR survey response rates. However, WhatsApp offers higher survey completion rates, substantially lower costs and does not introduce more sample selection bias compared to IVR. We discuss the potential of WhatsApp surveys in low-income contexts and provide practical recommendations for field implementation.","Ndashimye, Felix, Hebie, Oumarou, Tjaden, Jasper","https://doi.org/10.1177/08944393221111340","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: Social Science Computer Review;: 08944393221111340, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-21","",34673,""
"Launching a Virtual Bereavement CafÃ© Developed and Run by Staff, for Staff, in 2 National English Public Health Organisations During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background/aims: The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted bereavement experience by restrictions: visiting the dying, funerals, family meetings, access to bereavement services. Public health work on the pandemic and other essential functions has been unrelenting. Enforced home working enhanced isolation. Many colleagues were experiencing difficult bereavements with little access to support. Methods: A grassroots group of bereaved staff or with expertise in bereavement established an infrastructure to run Virtual Bereavement Cafes by staff for staff across the 2 national public health organisations. The Chief Executive gave support. MS Teams (video teleconferencing, chat and signposting to resources) was used to provide a safe, mutually supportive space for staff to meet virtually. CafÃ©s were 45 minutes every fortnight, facilitated with mental health first aiders present. Ground rules emphasised respect, confidentiality, the validity of all types of grief and all deaths whether pre or during the pandemic. Chat and comforting emojis were used to offer support. Post cafÃ© support was provided via email and/or a call. Results: 10 cafÃ©s were held May to September 2021. Attendance 14 to 34 with new staff at each. Topics emerged from shared experiences, including anticipatory, complicated, cumulative and disenfranchised grief. Thematic synthesis of discussions and chat identified isolation, distress from limited funeral attendance, presence at death, and lack of workplace understanding. Conclusions: Virtual Bereavement CafÃ©s have provided key emotional support during the pandemic. Improvements identified for implementation include: technical enhancements with use of interactive technologies to dynamically identify topics for discussion;increased facilitator capacity to enable break out groups and more monitoring;debrief sessions for facilitators to support their wellbeing;themed sessions publicised in advance, including practical topics;increased signposting to resources. The CafÃ©s will now implement the learning.","Verne, J.; Bowtell, N.; Brewer, A.; Deacon, L.; Groom, S.; Robson, J.; Thackeray, A.","https://doi.org/10.1177/02692163221093145","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Palliative Medicine; 36(1 SUPPL):110-111, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-21","",34674,""
"WATCH ME GROW-ELECTRONIC (WMG-E) SURVEILLANCE APPROACH TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS CHILD DEVELOPMENT, PARENTAL MENTAL HEALTH AND PSYCHOSOCIAL NEEDS","Background: Children and families from disadvantaged backgrounds are experiencing significant psychosocial and mental health (MH) issues due to the COVID-19 pandemic with inequity in service access particularly for culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) and regional/rural families. The Watch Me Grow-Electronic (WMG-E) platform is an innovative technology that reaches vulnerable families at their homes and communities. Objectives: To evaluate WMG-E as a digital support and navigation tool to identify and address parental MH, psychosocial well-being and child developmental needs. Methods: A two-group (intervention and control) by three time-points (baseline, 6 months, 12 months) randomised controlled trial for families with 6-month-old to 3-year-old children from multicultural Fairfield Local Government Area and regional/rural Murrumbidgee Local Health District. Both groups are to complete the WMG-E containing screening measures while the intervention group has access to a service navigator offering 'warm hand-over' and continuity of care. Findings: As of October 2021, a full sample of 300 families have been recruited. Preliminary data suggest that about 33% have no risk;27%, low;38%, moderate;and 3%, high risk. In addition to developmental concerns for their children, the top social needs included unemployment, smoking and food insecurity and one-third reported parental MH concerns. Families reported satisfaction following referral/linkage to relevant services. Conclusion: WMG-E was found to be feasible and acceptable as a digital engagement, monitoring and navigation tool. Families in the intervention group who receive wrap-around health and social care commensurate with needs are expected to show significantly improved engagement and health outcomes at 6-month and 12-month follow-up.","Winata, T.; Smead, M.; Cibralic, S.; Wang, S.; Woolfenden, S.; Kohlhoff, J.; Preddy, J.; Eapen, V.","https://doi.org/10.1177/00048674221088686","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry; 56(SUPPL 1):250, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-21","",34675,""
"â€œLife Turned Upside Downâ€: State of Mind and Mental Health During COVID-19","On the February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) gave the name of COVID-19 to a new coronavirus that had not been previously identified in humans. Although the virus began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, within weeks it spread worldwide to almost every continent. This virus is part of an ongoing pandemic that causes severe acute respiratory symptoms. Many countries went into complete lockdown in order to contain the proliferation of this virus. This lockdown due to the widespread pandemic experienced for the first time in a century worldwide, triggered concern, fear, anxiety and stress, all of which are expected and normal reactions to the altering and uncertain state that people found themselves undergoing. Some of the main concerns facing many was how to manage and react to the stressful situation of coronavirus, how to remain confined at home, and how to handle the unfolding narrative so rapidly unfolding in the lives within communities-lives that had been ?turned upside down? in a matter of a few weeks. This research looks at the state of mind of citizens in four continents: Africa, Australia, Europe, and India, of the world during lockdown. It also explores whether a novel illness such as COVID-19 can cause mental health issues, widespread fear, and anxiety, among people and the manner in which they deal with this. As the world deals with the physical health, financial, and social consequences of the pandemic, which has claimed many lives, the mental health impact and implications cannot to be ignored.","Singh, Shanta Balgobind","https://doi.org/10.1177/0972558X221096264","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: The Oriental Anthropologist;: 0972558X221096264, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-21","",34676,""

Objectives 1) To determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of the Salford Royal MND patients. 2) To improve the mental health support offered by the service by addressing patient concerns and feedback. Methods A survey was sent to patients who had been receiving care by the Salford Royal MND Team since the 1st of January, 2020. The answers were reviewed and measures were put in place to address concerns. Patients were resurveyed two months later and answers were compared. Results Patients reported a higher proportion of issues with their mental health during the pandemic compared to prior. The service was seen as doing adequately but areas were identified to address.

"NEGATIVE IMPACT OF COVID-19 LOCKDOWN ON PAPILLOEDEMA AND IDIOPATHIC INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION","Background Enforced national lockdown due to COVID-19 limited access to medical services. We evaluated the impact on those presenting with papilloedema, and those with a preexisting diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Design A single United Kingdom centre prospective cohort study between May 15, 2020 (start of emergency clinics after first 8 week national lockdown) and July 31, 2020. Demographics, diagnosis and outcomes were documented. Results The study recorded 130 individual patients, 123 with a diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hyper-tension. 92% were female and mean age was 32.5 years. Emergency cerebrospinal fluid diversion surgery was required in 13% (17/130), a 4.7-fold (367%) increase compared to the same period in 2019. Weight increased in 58% (mean 6.2kg SD 4.6) and corresponded to a significant increase in papilloedema (Optical Coherence Tomography retinal nerve fibre layer 15mm SD 57.3, p=0.014). Elevated anxiety levels (hospital anxiety and depression scale &gt;7) occurred in 64%. Conclusions There was a 367% increase in emergency shunting to save vision in idiopathic intracranial hypertension following national lockdown.

"INCREASE IN THE PRESCRIPTION OF BENZODIAZEPINES IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SARSCOV- 2 PANDEMIC","Background and importance The most frequently recorded mental health problem is anxiety disorder and in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, where an increase in anxiety cases has been evidenced, benzodiazepine derivatives (N05BA) have been one of the most prescribed pharmacological groups in most developed countries for this problem. Although their short-term benefits have been demonstrated, increasing their consumption may have longterm risks. Aim and objectives The main aim of this study was to find out the prescriptions of benzodiazepine derivatives from 2018 to 2021 in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the variation in them. A secondary objective was to learn which benzodiazepine derivatives varied more. Material and methods Retrospective, observational and crosssectional study. The study period included June 2018, June 2019, June 2020 and June 2021. The study population included the 710 581 inhabitants associated with the prescribing doctors of benzodiazepine derivatives from the study province. Results Total study population N=710 581;21.61% (153.574) with a benzodiazepine prescription, 67.33% (103 416) women, between June 2018 and June 2021. The prescribed benzodiazepine derivatives were: alprazolam, diazepam, diazepam/pyridoxine, clotiazepam, lorazepam, ketazolam, clobazam, pinazepam, clorazepato dipotassium, bromazepam, bentazepam, diazepam/sulpiride and diazepam/sulpiride/ pyridoxine. June 2018: 35 800 prescriptions, 67.30% (24 085) women;June 2019: 37 601, 67.20% (25 262) women;June 2020: 39 547, 67.30% (26 622) women;and June 2021: 40 626, 67.60% (27.477) women. From June 2018 to June 2019 prescriptions increased 5.03% (1801), from June 2019 to June 2020 they increased 5.20% (1946);and from June 2020 to June 2021 they increased 2.73% (1079), which represented a 13.48% increase in prescriptions (4826) from June 2018 to June 2021. The largest prescription increases were diazepam +23%, lorazepam +18%, bromazepam +12.5%, and alprazolam +12.3%. The largest prescription decreases were clotiazepam and bentazepam -100%, pinazepam -96.43% and clobazazam - 22.45%. Conclusion and relevance In the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic we have seen a progressive increase in benzodiazepines of 13.48% (4826 prescriptions) from June 2018 to June 2021, with women being the users of 67.33% of prescriptions on average. These data allow us to know the current situation of the prescription of benzodiazepine derivatives to the population and to focus on mental health both in the validation of treatments and in pharmaceutical care.","Elvira LadrÃ³n De Guevara, E.; Sanchez Rodriguez, B.; Rodriguez Goicoechea, M.; Sanchez Valera, M.; GÃ¡mez Torres, D.; Verdejo Reche, F.; Alferez Garcia, I.","https://doi.org/10.1136/ejhpharm-2022-eahp.188","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: European Journal of Hospital Pharmacy; 29(SUPPL 1):A90, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-21","",34679,""

"The healthy donor effect: Mental health among blood donors in the midst of the pandemic","Aims: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected lives of Danish citizens in different ways, for example, through social distancing and other public health measures introduced to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 spread or through economic consequences. We assessed changes in self-reported measures of physical and mental health-related quality of life (MCS, PCS), stress levels, quality of sleep and loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic in Denmark, and identified factors influencing such changes. Methods: This is a nation-wide prospective cohort study including 50,968 participants in the Danish Blood Donor Study, who answered health questionnaires before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The questionnaires included the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey, Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale 10-item version, the 3-item UCLA loneliness scale, and three selected questions evaluating insomnia. During the pandemic, the questionnaire also contained items on the personality trait stamina, behaviours undertaken to avoid infection, and changes in experienced changes in job situation during the pandemic. Finally, information on socio-demographic factors and previous use of anti-depressive medication was collected for all study participants from national registers. Descriptive statistics, multivariable linear and multinomial logistic regression analyses were applied. Results: Comparing measurements from before March 2020 with those after May 2020, MCS and quality of sleep both worsened, while the overall stress levels decreased.

"ACCEPTABILITY AND UTILITY OF AN OPPORTUNISTIC ADAPTION OF DIGITAL HEALTH INTERVENTION RESEARCH DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC FOR SERVICE DELIVERY TO OPTIMISE POSTNATAL CARE: SMARTMUMS TO HEALTHYMUMS@WESTMEAD","Background: Evidence demonstrates Digital Health Interventions (DHI) successfully support health promotion. We had developed a bank of text messages for a DHI postpartum trial (SmartMums) for women with gestational diabetes, this study was delayed because of the COVID pandemic. Instead, we repurposed these text-messages to address mental health, parenting and healthy lifestyle to support post-partum women as part of our pandemic response. From October to December 2020, women at our hospital discharged with term babies were sent a text invitation to register for the HealthyMums@Westmead program, and 97% registered completed the six-month program. The aim of this research is to assess acceptability of this DHI during the pandemic. Methods: Text-invitation to complete evaluation survey was sent to pre-registered participants. Questions included demographics and Likert response to message content and delivery. Results: 38 of 105 participants provided feedback. Most respondents were primiparous (62%) and born overseas (54%). All agreed the messages were easy to understand with 87% agreeing the text-support gave valuable information they could use. Three messages per week were considered just right for 89%. Half felt the messages helped increase physical activity and improve their diet. Free text responses included: 'Thanks for supporting in this difficult time','?made me feel like someone still cared for us', '?a major role in improving my mental health', 'It inspired me and helped me in weight loss', '?links to COPE and PANDA where very timely'. Conclusions: Text-messaging was an acceptable and valued support during COVID-19 interrupted services. Further research should review ongoing use of DHI postpartum.","Melov, S.

"GRIEF AND BEREAVEMENT SUPPORT FOR THOSE THAT DIE WITHIN 72 HOURS OF ADMISSION","Background: Supporting a patient's loved ones is an important component of end-of-life care, and health services have a responsibility to provide families and carers access to bereavement services. However, structured supports can be lacking despite established bereavement standards. Loved ones of patients who die within a short time from admission to hospital are potentially at risk of missing out on formal grief and bereavement assessment and support. This is particularly important because unexpected death can be a risk factor for poor adjustment in bereavement (1). Aim: The objective of this study is to identify for patients who die within 72 hours of admission to Alfred Health, what grief supports take place during the admission while the patient is still alive, and in bereavement. A secondary outcome is to identify differences in grief and bereavement support before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A retrospective audit of the electronic medical record was conducted to identify records of patients who died within 72 hours of admission to Alfred Health, from October to December 2019 (prior to the COVID-19 pandemic) and June to August 2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic). Results (preliminary): There were 159 patients included in this study, consisting of 74 patients who died prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and 85 patients who died during the pandemic. Patients ranged from 18 to 100 years old, with a median age of 81 years. Death occurred in the emergency department for 21.4% (n=34), in ICU for 33.3% (n=53), on the ward for 42.8% (n=68), and 2.6% (n=4) died in other locations. Unexpected deaths made up 64.0% (n=102), and 19.5% (n=31) were traumatic deaths or suicides. Of all cases, 52.0% (n=83) of loved ones had any input from either social work (specifically for end-of-life support), pastoral care, or a grief counsellor. There was no difference in this regard between the pre-pandemic and during pandemic groups. Social work provided end-of-life support to 37.7% (n=60) of patients;24.5% (n=39) received support before death, and 30.8% (n=49) after death. Pastoral care saw 11.3% (n=18) of cases, and 10.7% (n=17) had grief counsellor input, of which fourteen were in the form of a condolence letter. Palliative care reviewed 22.6% (n=36) of patients, consisting of 27.0% of patients before the pandemic, and 18.8% of patients during the pandemic. These patients were more likely to be referred to a grief counsellor (69.4%, n=25), and just over half of those referred were contacted by a grief counsellor (38.9%, n=14). Conclusion: Based on preliminary results, almost half of cases did not receive any formal grief or bereavement supports despite a significant proportion of deaths being unexpected or traumatic. We anticipate formal findings will identify areas for further improvement in provision of such supports, and encourage positive change to processes to improve the end-of-life experience for patients and families, as well as clinicians providing their care.","Coleman, C.; Corbett, C.; Katz, N.","https://doi.org/10.1111/imj.15766","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Internal Medicine Journal; 52(SUPPL 1):12-13, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-21","",34683,""
"Enabling participation in children and young people (CYP) with acquired brain injuries (ABI) and their families-mixed methods study-preliminary survey results","Introduction: Annually an estimated 40,000 CYP in the UK sustain an ABI with many experiencing significant, life-long impairments that impact on physical and psychological development, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), educational achievement and social inclusion. Patients and methods: A quantitative cross-sectional survey was completed as part of a mixed methods study which aims to explore the longer term needs of CYP-ABI aged 5-18 and their families in one region of the UK. Participants were recruited using eligibility criteria through a regional specialist clinical service. Ethical approval was gained (REC-20/ EM/0258). The survey consisted of demographic questions and standardised outcome measures completed by the parent or CYP-Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 (PedsQL), PedsQL-Family Impact Module (PedsQL-FIM), Child and Adolescent Scale of Participation (CASP), Parental Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4). Additional free text questions were included to capture parent and CYP goals, impact of Covid-19 lockdowns and any other information they wished to share. Results: 44 families have completed the survey so far, a response rate of 26%. CYP PedsQL scores indicated 31% were at risk of impaired HRQoL and the CASP indicated 68% had severely impaired social participation. 48% of families had impaired family HRQoL (PedsQL-FIM) and 48% of parents screened positive for anxiety, depression or both (PHQ-4). Conclusion: These preliminary results indicate the long-term impact of an ABI on CYP and family HRQoL and CYP social participation. The context behind these scores will be explored more deeply in qualitative interviews during the next phase of the study.","Keetley, R.; Manning, J.; Williams, J.; Stewart, I.; Radford, K.","https://doi.org/10.1111/dmcn.15215","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology; 64(SUPPL 3):62, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-21","",34684,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the field of childhood disability in Belgium: A survey of caregivers and professionals","Introduction: Belgium was one of the hardest hit countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Measures and restrictions were imperative to abate spreading of COVID-19. This study aimed to gain insights into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the accompanying restrictions on children with disabilities, their caregivers, and service providers/professionals in Belgium. Patients and Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional study of two voluntary-response sample surveys was carried out by the European Academy of Childhood Disability. 254 caregivers of individuals with childhood-onset disability and 279 professionals working in this field, living in Belgium, completed an online survey between April-May 2020 on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the accompanying restrictions. Quantitative analyses of survey responses were performed at group level for each survey. Results: 85% of the caregivers reported a reduced amount of therapy received per week in the survey period compared to before the COVID-19 crisis. 68% of the caregivers stated that less than 1 hour of therapy per week was provided during the survey period, compared to only 5% before the pandemic restrictions. 79% of the professionals noticed a physical health impact and 92% a mental health impact on individuals with a childhood-onset disability. Conclusion: Caregivers reported a strong decline in the amount of received therapy for people with a childhood-onset disability, while professionals reported noticing a physical and mental health impact. More insights into the (long-term) effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are warranted to provide best possible care and support for future health crises, other serious or daily events.","Van Wonterghem, E.; Konings, M.; Monbaliu, E.; Van Der Looven, R.; De Boeck, F.; Dan, B.; Vanmechelen, I.; Bekteshi, S.; Ortibus, E.","https://doi.org/10.1111/dmcn.15214","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology; 64(SUPPL 3):32, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-21","",34685,""
"The influence of the COVID19 pandemic in the patterns of acute poisoning presenting to an emergency department in Spain","Objective: COVID-19 has left no healthcare system untouched. Adjustments to accommodate COVID-19 pandemic needs resulted in widespread deferment of non-COVID19 scheduled healthcare activities, added to a general patient's reluctance to visit healthcare settings. This study is aimed to analyse retrospectively demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with acute poisoning attended at the Emergency Department (ED) in three different pandemic periods of time. Material and/or methods: We carried out an observational and retrospective study in which we included all the patients who visited the Emergency Department at Hospital Son Espases due to acute poisoning during three different periods of time from June to July in 2019 (pre pandemic), same period in 2020 (right after the strict confinement in Spain) and in 2021 (post-pandemic). This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Balearic Islands. Results: All cases of acute poisoning were included (n = 1182). Patients with acute poisoning presenting to the ED decreased significantly during the pandemic (2019: 1.9%, 2020: 1.5%;p &lt; 0.01). The ratio male/female and the mean age of the patients increased during the pandemic (2 vs. 1.4, p = 0.02, and 31.4 vs. 41.3 years, p &lt; 0.001, respectively). The roll of poisoning in suicide attempts increased substantially during the pandemic (2019: 8.71%, 2020: 21%;p &lt; 0.01), mostly driven by the increase in poisoning due to commercially available drugs (2019: 14.20%;2020: 28.76%, p &lt; 0.01), while recreational drug poisoning decreased (2019: 76.1%, 2020: 62%;p &lt; 0.01), while in 2021, figures tended to return to prior patterns. Conclusions: This study found significant changes in some clinical patterns in patients attending the ED due to acute poisoning in the context of COVID19, in line with the already described impact of the pandemic in other areas of the healthcare system.","Bermejo, A.

"A time to gather stones - barriers to use technologies before the COVID-19 school closures","Purpose The study examines how teachers and school administrative staff perceive external and internal barriers to the implementation of technologies into the teaching process and how teachers and school administrative staff technology readiness is related to these perceptions. These data were used for discussion and construction of an explanatory model. Design/methodology/approach The data from 8,188 Russian respondents who took the survey just before the first massive lockdown announcement due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) was used. First, descriptive statistics were shown for two groups: teachers and administrative staff. Second, confirmatory factor analysis was applied to construct external and internal barriers scales. These scales were then used as dependent in a series of regressions with the technology readiness index (TRI) and the respondent role in schools as independent variables. Findings Results showed that administrative staff compared to teachers were more likely to select internal barriers related to teachers, while teachers were more likely to choose external obstacles. The technology optimism scale was negative, and negative attitudes toward technologies were positively related to both barriers. Originality/value The originality of the study lies in determining the relationship between the technology readiness and choosing barriers perception as well as comparing the sense of responsibility for the introduction of technologies in schools experienced by teachers and administrators.","Kapuza, A.; Kolygina, D.; Khavenson, T.; Koroleva, D.","https://doi.org/10.1108/ijem-02-2022-0069","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Educational Management;: 14, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-21","",34687,""
"COVID-19 VACCINATION IMPROVED PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS (ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCORES) IN CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE PATIENTS: A PROSPECTIVE STUDY","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To our knowledge, the psychological impact of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccination has not yet been evaluated for the general population nor for chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. The purpose of the study is to analyse the impact of vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on anxiety and depression scores in patients with different modalities of CKD. METHOD: A total of 117 renal patients (50 haemodialysis patients, 13 peritoneal dialysis patients, 32 kidney transplants and 22 advanced CKD patients at pre-dialysis care) were evaluated for depression, anxiety, health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and perceived fears and resources with standardized (The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale;HADS) and self-reported questionnaires. The measure points were before vaccination and 15 days after vaccination. RESULTS: The main finding of the study is that there is a decrease in the global mean of normal scores for anxiety and depression symptoms in CKD patients, postvaccination. We did not find statistically significant differences in depression or anxiety scores, nor HRQOL differences between the treatment groups. The three main fears reported by the participants at baseline were those of adverse effects, not getting the vaccine and lack of information. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the potential interest of assessing psychological variables related to the impact of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. New studies will be required to assess the impact of comprehensive vaccine coverage and its psychological impact.","Gonzalez, N. P.; Alvarado, M.

"ASSESSING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF READY STEADY GO-PEEER PROJECT YOUTH WORK IN MEETING THE PSYCHOSOCIAL NEEDS OF CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE","BACKGROUND: Studies show that young people (YP) with chronic kidney disease do less well than their well peers in terms of mental health and employability. In the UK 30% of YP on renal replacement therapy have mental health issues compared to 15% of the general population and more are unemployed compared with their well peers. Many of the issues start in childhood as studies show that children with chronic kidney disease have significant psychosocial issues including: â€¢ Depression â€¢ Anxiety â€¢ Educational difficulties â€¢ Relationship issues â€¢ Lowself-esteem â€¢ Social isolation, family dependency â€¢ Professional restriction To address these issues, we developed the PEEER project to help improve Patient Empowerment, self-Esteem, Employability and Resilience. â€¢ PEEER brings YP together to participate in fun activities to help build selfesteem, develop an 'I can do' attitude, build a peer support group and reduce the sense of isolation patients feel. â€¢ PEEER offers a formal peer support mentorship and peer ambassador programme for those who wish to participate. Helping others will help the mentors and their peers by improving the self-esteem and psyche of both parties. PEEER offers the Duke Of Edinburgh Award and ASDAN to provide a range of nationally approved qualifications based around the development of individual and social skills leading to improved chances of employment. â€¢ Volunteering is an integral part of PEEER that helps to strengthen and improve self-esteem. â€¢ PEEER directly supports YP learn digital skills so they can develop appropriate information resources to help other young people, families and healthcare professionals. Pre-coronavirus disease (COVID-19) PEEER youth worker support was delivered face-to-face (F2F) in a 1:1 setting or group sessions in the hospital, youth spaces, or educational settings. With the onset of lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic from 23 March 2020 PEEER youth worker support was adapted to be delivered virtually on the ZOOM platform to meet the needs of CYP. AIMS: To assess the effectiveness of PEEER youth work project in meeting the psychosocial needs of children and young people with kidney disease when delivered virtually compared with F2F. METHOD: Group 1: Pre-COVID-19 lockdown: 1 January 2020-23 March 2020 CYP and their families received youth worker support F2F. Group 2: During COVID-19 lockdown: 23 March 2020-31 December 2020 youth work was delivered virtually. CYP in Groups 1 and 2 received 1:1 sessions, fun group activities and workshops. Feedback was collected on the effectiveness of these sessions. RESULTS: CYP: Group 1 n = 105. Group 2 n = 639. In Group 2 there was a 102% increase/month in CYP accessing PEEER events. In both Groups, 100% said they enjoyed the sessions, would like to attend future sessions. CYP in both Groups felt part of a friendship group, said the sessions allowed them to socialize with their peers. CYP in both Groups felt more confident, more independent and good about themselves. (See Table 2.) CONCLUSION: PEEER youth worker support is effective and can meet the psychosocial needs of CYP when delivered virtually and F2F. More work is needed on a hybrid approach of F2F and virtual delivery.

"ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION AMONG DIALYSIS CENTRE STAFF AND HAEMODIALYSIS PATIENTS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In Moscow, the nephrological service is organized as follows: (1) specialize centres of haemodialysis in which patients with COVID-19 are treated and (2) ordinary departments of haemodialysis, in which there are no patients with coronavirus infection, but patients with COVID-19 are identified in them and these patients are sent for treatment to specialize departments. This study was aimed at examining the level of anxiety and depression in patients on haemodialysis in comparison with a group of medical staff (doctors and nurses) working in the ordinary department of haemodialysis during the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, we were compared both groups with the level of anxiety and depression in the general population of healthy people who lived in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, based on the results of meta-analysis of 2189 current studies of depressive disorders during the pandemic [1]. METHOD: We used the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to evaluate the level of anxiety and depression. Before the study, informed consent was taken from all responders to participate in the study, as well as permission to publish the results. In this study, we included 40 stable patients receiving haemodialysis (15 women and 25 men). The average age was 58.6 years (45-84 years). Time spent on haemodialysis: up to 1 year: 9 patients;up to 5 years: 16 patients;and &gt;5 years: 15 patients. Average 4.9 years (1-20 years). The main causes leading to the end stage of renal failure were: polycystic disease (24%), type 2 diabetes mellitus (20%), hypertension (16%), glomerulonephritis (23%) and others (17%). The group of medical staff consisted of 43 people (16 doctors and 27 nurses). The ratio of men and women is 1: 3 and 1: 5.7, respectively. The average age of doctors is 50.3 Â± 15.6 years;nurses 34.1 Â± 8.2 years. For comparison, we used materials from the meta-analysis [1], where the prevalence of depression was 15.97% and anxiety was 15.15% as the consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic for the mentally healthy population. RESULTS: In the group of patients, anxiety and depression were detected in 16 patients (40%), in 4 patients (10%) -clinically significant. By the time spent on haemodialysis: up to 1 year: 4 patients (without clinically significant manifestations);up to 5 years: 7 patients (3 with clinically significant manifestations);and &gt;5 years: 6 patients (1 with clinically significant manifestations). In the group of medical staff, anxiety and depression were detected in 13 people (32.5%), of which clinically significant in 4 people (9.3%). Anxiety and depression were found in 6 doctors (37.5%) (2 men and 4 women) and in 7 nurses (25.9%) (1 man and 6 women). Clinically significant manifestations were noted in 2 doctors and 2 nurses. In the group of patients, anxiety and depression were observed in 1 young patient, in 5 middle-aged patients and in 10 elderly patients (60-74 years old). In the group of medical workers, an increased level of anxiety and depression were observed in 10 young people and in 3 middle-aged people. CONCLUSION: Patients on haemodialysis and dialysis centre staff, the levels of anxiety and depression were twice times higher compared with the data of anxiety and depression in healthy populations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients on haemodialysis and medical staff had same level of anxiety and depression. The level of anxiety and depression among doctors was significantly higher than in nurse;this difference can be explained by a small sample, as well as a higher level of education among doctors and a tendency to reflect.","Shutov, E.; Osipova, M.; Lukina, E.; Avedisova, A.; Osipov, V.","https://doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfac084.011","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation; 37(SUPPL 3):i665-i666, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-21","",34690,""
"PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT OF COVID-19 IN HEMODIALYSIS PATIENTS","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The COVID-19 pandemic has required containment measures in Morocco, as well as practice changes in haemodialysis centres. Haemodialysis patients are at risk of aggressive symptoms of COVID-19, which significantly increases mortality. This particular situation creates psychological disorders in those patients, such as anxiety, sleep disorders and irritability. The objective of our study is to assess the mental health status of haemodialysis patients during the pandemic and the psychological impact of confinement. This assessment will allow the adaptation of a supportive relationship with the patient through adequate psychological management. METHOD: This is a mono-centric, non-interventional study that included all haemodialysis patients at the haemodialysis centre of the nephrology department at Ibn Rochd University Hospital during the confinement period (March 2020- June 2020).This study is based on a pseudonymized paper questionnaire, during confinement, based on two psychiatric scores (GAD-7, PHQ-9) that assess anxiety, depression as well as sleep disorders, which allowed us to collect socio-demographic data, anxiety depressive symptomatology and an assessment of sleep disorders. RESULTS: The average age of our population is 47.4 years old, 54% of whom are men. Almost 34.54% have a primary level of education The higher level of education was 14.45%, while 14.54% are illiterate. Regarding family status, 45% are married. Those who are living alone accounted for 55%. Before confinement, 57.15% patients were daily workers;10 others had no work, among 3 of them were students;the 5 others were managers. After starting haemodialysis, 65.7% patients stopped their work. We noted that 38% of patients had a feeling of nervousness and anxiety for several days, while 9% had the same symptoms for more than half of the day. Concerning excessive anxiety, it was noted in 34% of patients for several days, while 16% showed excessive anxiety for more than half of the days. Concentration difficulties were noted in 41% of the patients for over several days and 5% more than half of days, while 58% of patients never had difficulties of concentration. The irritability feeling over several days was noted in 43% of patients, while 5.4% presented a feeling of irritability more than half of the days. Difficulty falling asleep is noted in 49% of patients, while 51% of patients have no difficulty falling asleep. The feelings of sadness, depression and despair are noted in 49% of patients for several days and 5% for more than half of the days. Sleep disorders were noted in 60% of patients on several days, while 40% had sleep disorders on more than half of the days. Loss of appetite was noted in 65% of patients. A lack of self-confidence was noted for several days in 43% of patients. 29% of patients lost the pleasure of having fun for several days. A total of 36% were slow or restless for several days. None of our patients expressed a desire to end their life, and 49% did not lose the pleasure of doing their daily activity. CONCLUSION: The mental health of dialysis patients assessed appears to be unaffected during this first wave of the pandemic. This could be due to high resilience, higher unemployment among dialysis patients, a reduced impact of social distancing on the haemodialysis population, strict precautionary measures and perceived support from health workers, who can all contribute to addressing this pandemic.","Afifi, R.; Maazouzi, C.; Zamd, M.; Mtioui, N.; Elkhayat, S.

"QUALITY OF LIFE OF PATIENTS UNDERGOING REGULAR HEMODIALYSIS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC-A RETROSPECTIVE SINGLE-CENTRE STUDY","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Patients on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) experience a heavy burden of the disease and frequently report poor quality of life (QoL) scores.[1,2] During the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, additional challenges were posed to this vulnerable group. Restriction policies affected social contact and physical activity, even leading to intradialytic exercise programs' suspension.[3] Few studies analyze the impact of the pandemic on the QoL of this population. Thus, we aimed to assess the QoL of HD-dependent patients during the pandemic. METHOD: This is a retrospective single-center study. Demographic data originated from electronical medical records. The health-related QoL EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, developed by the EuroQol Group in 2005 and widely used for various diseases, was applied and assessed the five following self-reported scores: health (0-100 points), mobility (1-5 points), self-care (1-5 points), usual activities (1-5 points), pain/discomfort (1-5 points) and anxiety/depression (1-5 points).[4] With the exception of health, higher scores relate to greater difficulties, as inverted scales. Patients undergoing regular HD who filled in the questionnaire during the pandemic and at least one year prior were included. IBMÂ® SPSS Â® 27 software was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: A total of 71 patients were included with a predominance of the male gender (54.9%). The median age was 77 years (IQR = 18 years) and the median time on HD was 78 months (IQR = 99 months). Thirty patients had diabetes (42.25%). During the pandemic, 12 patients (16.9%) had COVID-19. Analyzing the different QoL scores, no difference was reported concerning health (mean score 67.89 Â± 18.3 versus 65.23 Â± 20.6;T = 1.059, P = 0.297, IC (95%) = (-2.1;7.6);d = 0.126), usual activities (mean score 1.8 Â± 1.09 versus 1.97 Â± 1.32;T (71)= -1.136, P = 0.260, d = -0.135), pain/discomfort [mean score 1.8 Â± 0.95 versus 2.07 Â± 1.13;T (71) = -0.894, P = 0.260, d = -0.374], and anxiety/depression [mean score 1.8 Â± 0.82 versus 1.94 Â± 1.04;T (71) = -1.055, P = 0.295, d = 0.125] comparing with the pre-pandemic period. There was a statistically significant decrease in mobility (mean score of 1.96 Â± 1.09 versus 2.44 Â± 1.34) with moderate size effect [T (71) = -3.525, P &lt; 0.001, d = -0.418]. There was also a statistically significant decrease in self-care (mean score of 1.45 Â± 0.86 versus 1.82 Â± 1.43) with small size effect [T (71) = -2.983, P = 0.004, d = -0.354). There were no differences in any score when adjusting to diabetes or COVID-19. CONCLUSION: During the pandemic, most QoL scores appear to have been unaffected. Higher resilience among these patients and the support from caregivers and healthcare professionals might have contributed to better coping during this period. Nonetheless, mobility seems to have become compromised and movement restrictions could have accelerated this process. Therefore, even in such times, promoting physical activity may play a role in improving the QoL of HD-dependent patients.","Pimenta, G.; Fernandes, A.; Fonseca, N.

"Changes in UK Parental Mental Health Symptoms over 10 months of the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background. The threats to health, associated restrictions, and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have been linked to increases in mental health difficulties for many. Parents, in particular, have experienced many challenges such as having to combine work with home-schooling their children and other caring responsibilities. Yet, it remains unclear how parental mental health has changed throughout the pandemic or what factors may have mitigated or compounded the impact of the pandemic on parentsâ€™ mental health. Methods. We examined monthly survey data from two linked UK-based longitudinal studies: Co-SPACE and Co-SPYCE. Data from 5,576 parents/carers of 2-16-year-old children collected between April 2020 and January 2021 was analysed using mixed-effect modelling and latent class growth mixture modelling. Results. Parental stress and depression, but not anxiety, were higher during the periods of restrictions. This pattern was most pronounced for parents with primary-school-aged children, whilst parents with secondary-school-aged children showed greater continuous increases in mental health symptoms from the start of the pandemic. Although around three quarters of parents reported consistently low mental health symptoms, a substantial minority reported consistently high or increasing symptoms of anxiety, stress, and depression. The latter were more likely to be parents who were younger than average, were a single adult in the household, had a pre-existing mental health diagnosis, or had a child with special educational needs or a neurodevelopmental disorder. Conclusions. These findings emphasise how different personal circumstances and pre-existing inequalities shaped how parents were affected by this unprecedented global pandemic and highlight the need for support and consideration to meet the needs of families in the future.","Simona Skripkauskaite et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0252-2A7-FB9","20220721","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; longitudinal; parent; covid-19; pandemic; mental health","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-21","",34697,""
"Towards a dimensional model of risk and protective factors influencing childrenâ€™s early cognitive, social and emotional development during the COVID-19 pandemic","Variation in infantsâ€™ home environment is implicated in their cognitive and psycho-social development. The pandemic has intensified variations in home environments through exacerbating socioeconomic inequalities, and increasing psychological stressors for some families. This study investigates the effects of parental (predominantly maternal) mental health, enriching activities and screen use on 280 24- to 52-month-oldsâ€™ executive functions, internalising and externalising problems, and pro-social behaviour; with socioeconomic status and social support as contextual factors. Our results indicate that aspects of the home environment are differentially associated with childrenâ€™s cognitive and psycho-social development. Parents who experienced sustained mental distress during the pandemic tended to report higher child externalising and internalising problems, and executive function difficulties at follow-up. Children who spent more time engaged in enriching activities with their parents showed stronger executive functions and social competence six months later. Screen use levels during the first year of the pandemic were not associated with outcomes. To mitigate the risk of persistent negative effects for this â€˜pandemic generationâ€™ of infants, our study highlights the importance of supporting parentsâ€™ mental health. As our results demonstrate the impact of social support on mental health, investing in support services and interventions promoting building support networks are likely to be beneficial.","Alexandra Hendry et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0202-DB7-0DA","20220721","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Toddlerhood/Preschool Period; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Cognitive Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Infancy; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Social Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Emotional Development; parenting; pandemic; internalising problems; externalising problems; executive function; home environment; maternal mental health; social support; parental mental health; toddler; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-21","",34698,""
