"Prevalence and Factors associated with Mental health impact of COVID-19 Pandemic in Bangladesh: A survey-based cross-sectional study","Abstract Background: Feelings of isolation, insecurity, and instability triggered by COVID 19 could have a long-term impact on the mental health status of individuals. This study examined the prevalence and factors associated with the mental health symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress during the COVID 19 pandemic in Bangladesh. Methods: From 1st to 30th April 2020, we used a validated self-administered questionnaire to conduct a cross sectional study on 10,609 participants through an online survey platform. We assessed mental health status using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). The total depression, anxiety, and stress subscale scores were divided into normal, mild, moderate, severe, and multinomial logistic regression was used to examine associated factors. Results: The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 15%, 34%, and 15% for mild, moderate, and severe depressive symptoms, respectively. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms was 59% for severe anxiety symptoms, 14% for moderate anxiety symptoms, and 14% for mild anxiety symptoms while, the prevalence for stress levels were 16% for severe stress level, 22% for moderate stress level and 13% for mild stress level. Multivariate analyses revealed that the most consistent factors associated with mild, moderate, and severe of the three mental health subscales (depression, anxiety, and stress) were respondents who lived in Dhaka and Rangpur division, females, those who self quarantined in the previous 7 days before the survey and those respondents who experienced chills, breathing difficulty, dizziness, and sore throat. Conclusion: Our results showed that about 64%, 87%, and 61% experienced depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and levels of stress, respectively. In Bangladesh, there is a need for better mental health support for females especially those that lived in Dhaka and Rangpur division and experienced chills, breathing difficulty, dizziness, and sore throat during COVID 19 and other future pandemics.","Dr. Tanvir Abir; Dr. Nazmul Ahsan Kalimullah; Dr. L Osuagwu Uchechukwu; Dewan Muhammad Nur -A Yazdani; Taha Husain; Piwuna Christopher Goson; Palash Basak; Md Adnan Rahman; Dr. Abdullah Al Mamun; Dr. P.

"Augmented curation of clinical notes of COVID-19 and influenza patients reveals that long-term neuropsychiatric and coagulopathic symptoms are more associated with COVID-19","Less than one year into the COVID-19 pandemic, over 70 million individuals worldwide have been infected and case counts continue to accelerate, yet the long-term sequelae of COVID-19 are unknown. We leverage augmented curation to extract symptoms and signs occurring post-COVID as noted in follow up physician's notes of COVID-19 patients at the Mayo Clinic who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection between March and September 2020, or influenza between 2014 and 2019. We compare the chart prevalence of signs/symptoms and diseases in the 3-to-6 month post-diagnosis vs. 1-to-6 month pre-diagnosis period for each disease, and subsequently compare the observed effect size of each symptom across the two diseases. Relative to post-influenza, we observe a significant increase in the chart prevalence of terms including depression, anxiety, obesity, and bleeding in COVID-19 patients under the age of 55. Across all age groups, nodules and cysts were also significantly increased. These findings compel targeted investigations into what may be persistent neuropsychiatric, pulmonary, metabolic, and coagulopathic phenotypes following SARS-CoV2 infection.","Venky Soundararajan; Samir Awasthi; Jacob T Martin; Elliot Akama-Garren; Arjun Puranik; Saran Liukasemsarn; Aiveliagaram J Venkatakrishnan; John C O'Horo; Ryan T Hurt; Amy W Williams; Gregory J.

"Use of Asynchronous Virtual Mental Health Resources for COVID-19 Pandemic-Related Stress Among the General Population in Canada: Cross-Sectional Survey Study","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in profound mental health impacts among the general population worldwide. As many in-person mental health support services have been suspended or transitioned online to facilitate physical distancing, there have been numerous calls for the rapid expansion of asynchronous virtual mental health (AVMH) resources. These AVMH resources have great potential to provide support for people coping with negative mental health impacts associated with the pandemic; however, literature examining use prior to COVID-19 illustrates that the uptake of these resources is consistently low. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to examine the use of AVMH resources in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic among the general population and among a participant subgroup classified as experiencingÂ anÂ adverse mental health impact related to the pandemic. METHODS: Data from this study were drawn from the first wave of a large multiwave cross-sectional monitoring survey, distributed from May 14 to 29, 2020. Participants (N=3000) were adults living in Canada. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample, and bivariateÂ cross-tabulations were used to examine the relationships between the use of AVMH resources and self-reported indicators of mental health that included a range of emotional and coping-related responses to the pandemic. Univariate and fully adjusted multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine associations between sociodemographic and health-related characteristicsÂ and use ofÂ AVMH resources in the subgroup of participants who reported experiencing one or more adverse mental health impacts identified in the set of self-reported mental health indicators. RESULTS: Among the total sample, 2.0% (n=59) of participants reported accessing AVMH resources in the prior 2 weeks to cope with stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the highest rates of use among individuals who reported self-harm (n=5, 10.4%) and those who reported coping ""not well"" with COVID-19-related stress (n=22, 5.5%). Within the subgroup of 1954 participants (65.1% of the total sample) who reported an adverse mental health impact related to COVID-19, 54 (2.8%) reported use of AVMH resources. Individuals were more likely to have used AVMH resources if they had reported receiving in-person mental health supports, were connecting virtually with a mental health worker or counselor, or belonged to a visible minority group. CONCLUSIONS: Despite substantial government investment into AVMH resources, uptake is low among both the general population and individuals who may benefit from the use of these resources as a means of coping with the adverse mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research is needed to improve our understanding of the barriers to use.","Richardson, Chris G; Slemon, Allie; Gadermann, Anne; McAuliffe, Corey; Thomson, Kimberly; Daly, Zachary; Salway, Travis; Currie, Leanne M; David, Anita; Jenkins, Emily","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/24868","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(12): e24868, 2020 Dec 30.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(12): e24868, 2020 Dec 30.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-06","",8983,""
"COVID-19-Related Disruptions and Increased mHealth Emergency Use Intention: Experience Sampling Method Study","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has become a global public health event, which has raised concerns regarding individuals' health. Individuals need to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic with guidelines on symptom recognition, home isolation, and maintain mental health. Besides routine use of mobile health (mHealth) such as accessing information to keep healthy, individuals can use mHealth services in situations requiring urgent medical care, which is defined as mHealth emergency use. It is not known whether individuals have increased their daily mHealth services emergency use as a result of disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this diary analysis study is to assess the influences of daily disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals' mHealth emergency use. The secondary purpose of this study is to explore the mediating role of COVID-19-induced strain and the moderating role of promotion regulatory focus in the relationship between daily disruptions of COVID-19 and mHealth emergency use. Drawing from the cognitive activation theory of stress, we investigated the underlying mechanism and boundary condition of the influence of COVID-19-related disruptions on daily mHealth emergency use. METHODS: To test the proposed model, this study adopts the experience sampling method to collect daily data. The experience sampling method helps researchers to capture participants' fluctuations in emotions, mental engagement in an activity, and experienced stress. This study collected 550 cases nested in 110 samples in mainland China to test the conceptual model. In addition, we employed hierarchical linear modeling analysis to test the effect of COVID-19-related disruptions on mHealth emergency use. RESULTS: We found that COVID-19-related disruptions increased COVID-19-induced strain (ÃŽÂ³=0.24, P<.001) and mHealth emergency use on a daily basis (ÃŽÂ³=0.28, P<.001). COVID-19-induced daily strain mediated this relationship (effect=0.09, 95% CI 0.05-0.14). Promotion regulatory focus moderated the relationship between COVID-19-induced strain and mHealth emergency use (ÃŽÂ³=0.35, P=.02). In addition, the indirect relationship between disruptions and mHealth emergency use intentions through COVID-19-induced strain is contingent upon promotion regulatory focus: this relationship was stronger in those with high promotion regulatory focus (effect=0.12, 95% CI 0.06-0.19) than in those with low promotion regulatory focus (effect=0.06, 95% CI 0.02-0.11). CONCLUSIONS: Event disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic induced mHealth emergency use intention through increased psychological strain. Furthermore, individuals' promotion regulatory focus amplified this indirect relationship. Our findings extend our understanding of the factors underlying mHealth emergency use intention and illustrate the potential contingent role of promotion regulatory focus in the cognitive activation theory of stress. This study also opens avenues for future research on mHealth emergency use intention in other countries and cultural settings.","Zhang, Zhenduo; Zhang, Li; Zheng, Junwei; Xiao, Huan; Li, Zhigang","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/20642","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Mhealth Uhealth;8(12): e20642, 2020 Dec 30.; Publication details: JMIR Mhealth Uhealth;8(12): e20642, 2020 Dec 30.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-06","",8984,""

"Clinically distinct COVID-19 cases share notably similar immune response progression: A follow-up analysis","Inflammatory responses to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, range from asymptomatic to severe  Here we present a follow-up analysis of a longitudinal study characterizing COVID-19 immune responses from a father and son with distinctly different clinical courses  The father required a lengthy hospital stay for severe symptoms, whereas his son had mild symptoms and no fever yet tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 for 29 days  Father and son, as well as another unrelated COVID-19 patient, displayed a robust increase of SERPING1, the transcript encoding C1 esterase inhibitor (C1â€“INH)  We further bolstered this finding by incorporating a serum proteomics dataset and found that serum C1â€“INH was consistently increased in COVID-19 patients  C1â€“INH is a central regulator of the contact and complement systems, potentially linking COVID-19 to complement hyperactivation, fibrin clot formation, and immune depression  Furthermore, despite distinct clinical cases, significant parallels were observed in transcripts involved in interferon and B cell signaling  As symptoms were resolving, widespread decreases were seen in immune-related transcripts to levels below those of healthy controls  Our study provides insight into the immune responses of likely millions of people with extremely mild symptoms who may not be aware of their infection with SARS-CoV-2 and implies a potential for long-lasting consequences that could contribute to reinfection risk","Hausburg, Melissa A.; Banton, Kaysie L.; Roshon, Michael, Bar-Or, David","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05877","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Heliyon;7(1):e05877, 2021.; Publication details: Heliyon;7(1):e05877, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-06","",9019,""

We focused on empirical works and brief case reports of H1N1 flu and COVID-19. Our review included 32 papers published both in English or Spanish. We built a set of tables that allowed us to classify the information in four main categories, namely the psychological impact of the pandemic, whether people follow or not official measures to protect themselves against the pandemic, psychological adherence considerations implied as mediators to respect official strategies, and relevant methodological characteristics of the pandemic research. Results show that there are significant impacts on the psychological behavior of people, social groups and organizations in several dimensions, namely emotion, cognition, behavior, mental health, organization and psychosocial factors. In addition, we found that certain social groups experienced a critical psychosocial impact likely due to the pandemic. Psychosocial factors affecting adherence were also identified, which allow us to better understand how health strategies are followed by the population.

"The Impact of COVID-19 on Job Prospects and Educational Training for Pediatric Gastroenterology Fellows","The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted graduate medical education with redistribution of trainees, altered clinical care, and decreased research. For graduating trainees, there remains concern that financial stability of health systems will affect the availability of new positions and hiring practices. This survey aims to evaluate the pandemic's impact from pediatric gastroenterology fellows' perspectives. An anonymous survey was distributed by e-mail from June 11 to July 1, 2020 to all North American pediatric gastroenterology and advanced training fellows. The survey was tailored for the fellows' year of training including questions on education, clinical experience, research, and job outlook. Of the 434 pediatric gastroenterology fellows, 145 completed the survey. Of all respondents, negative impact was reported in 52% on clinical training, 46% research projects, and 41% procedural confidence. A majority (93%) of third-year respondents had a job contract signed at the time of the survey; however, 18% of those contracts were subsequently altered with five respondents having job contracts rescinded due to hiring freezes. Fifty-four percent of first- and second-year fellow respondents reported concern regarding finding a job with the majority being second-year fellows (78%). The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the medical system and healthcare professionals. This survey identified significant impact on job acquisition for graduating pediatric gastroenterology fellows as well as other critical components of training, which are likely applicable to other pediatric trainees. The survey results raise questions about potential strategies to improve medical education and job search success for graduating trainees.","Irastorza, Hopson, Ta, Kemme, Mallon, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1097/MPG.0000000000003037","20210105","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-06","",9051,""

COVID-19-perceived stress was collected through COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI). Binomial regression analysis was used to identify the extent of the relationship between CPDI and sociodemographic factors by estimating the odds of having significant stress. P Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.05 was considered significant. A total of 2,317 valid responses were received. Of the respondents, 830 (35.82%) were males, 1,084 (46.79%) were below 25 years of age, and 2,297 (99.14%) were native residents of TN. The mean(Ã‚Â±SD) CPDI was 20.66Ã‚Â±12.03. While 1,830 (77.2%) respondents had low or no stress, 478 (20.2%) had mild to moderate stress, and 63 (2.7%) had severe stress. The bivariate model included marital status, age, nativity, and income. The odds of having significant stress (mild-moderate or severe) for a 25-34 year age group as compared to &gt;55 years group was 2.38 (P &lt; 0.001). As compared to widowed, the married had higher odds ratio (3.41, P = 0.05). Compared to those with &gt;10 lakh annual income, those with 2.5-5 lakhs annual income had odds ratio of 1.65 (95% CI = 1.01 to 2.7, P = 0.05). During the lockdown due to COVID-19, every 1 in 5 TN population had some form of stress, as measured by CPDI. Our model identified certain factors driving the stress, which would help policy framers to initiate an appropriate response.","Ramasubramanian, Mohandoss, Rajendhiran, Pandian, Ramasubramanian","https://doi.org/10.1177/0253717620935581","20210105","COVID-19; Tamil Nadu; mental health; pandemic; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-06","",9053,""
"Mental Health of the COVID-19 Patients in Bangladesh","The mental health aspect of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) patients in Bangladesh has remained less focused and has not been addressed properly. The objective of the study was to assess the levels of anxiety and depression in COVID-19 patients. We adopted a mixed online and telephone-based survey using Google Forms. Recruitment was performed through a snowball sampling approach. The Google Form was initially circulated in Facebook to identify interested participants. Then, three trained physicians interviewed the online responders over telephone for a period spanning from April 2020 to June 2020. Two well-known questionnaires, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), were used for the assessment of anxiety and depression, respectively. Here, the severity of anxiety was classified with the standard thresholds: minimal or none (0-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10-14) and severe (&gt;15) for the GAD-7. Depression severity score: 0-4 was considered as none or no depression, 5-9: mild, 10-14: moderate, 15-19: moderately severe, 20-27 was for severe depression. A total of 237 patients were finally analyzed. The mean age Ã‚Â±SD of the patients was 41.59Ã‚Â±13.73 years. Most of them were male (73%) and lived in urban areas (90.29%). Half of the patients were unemployed, and 17.7% admitted loss of job due to lockdown. The overall prevalence of anxiety and depression was 55.7% and 87.3%, respectively. The mean GAD-7 score was 5.79Ã‚Â±4.95, and the mean PHQ-9 score was 5.64Ã‚Â±5.15. Among the depressive patients, 3% had minimal depression, 38.4% had mild depression, 32.1% had moderate depression, 11.8% had moderate depression, and 2.1% had a severe depression. Similarly, 37.1%, 10.5% and 8% had mild, moderate and severe levels of anxiety, respectively. Nearly half of the study population (47.7%) was suffering from both depression and anxiety. Living in urban area was an independent predictor for depression (OR 3.882; CI: 1.249-12.069). Considering the high comorbid burden, the mental health issues of these patients need to be addressed and reinforced to the existing health system on a priority basis.","Hasan, Tabssum, Ambia, Zaman, Rahman, Khan","https://www.google.com/search?q=Mental+Health+of+the+COVID-19+Patients+in+Bangladesh.","20210105","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-06","",9054,""
"Impact of Lockdown due to COVID-19 on the Modalities of Intoxicated Patients Presenting to the Emergency Room","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic influences health care facilities world-wide. The flow rate, type, and severity of cases presented to emergency departments varied during the pandemic in comparison to the past years. However, this change has not been well-described among the cases of hospital admission due to toxic exposure. Recognition of the pattern of toxic exposure among the cases refereed to Tanta Poison Control Center (TPCC; Tanta, Egypt) during the past five years, and furthermore, exploration of the impact of lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic on the pattern of presented cases. The current study is a five-year retrospective, comparative cross-sectional study carried out among acutely intoxicated patients admitted to TPCC during the spring months (March through May) of 2016-2020. A total of 1,916 patients with complete medical records were recruited. The type and manner of toxic exposure, demographic, clinical data, and outcomes were analyzed. The current study noted that there were delays in time from toxic exposure to emergency services during the lockdown period. This was reflected in significant lower recovery rates (884.8/1,000 population; z = -3.0) and higher death rates (49.4/1,000 population; z = 2.1) despite the marked decrease in the total number of hospital admissions in comparison to the past four years. The lockdown period showed significantly higher phosphides (z = 3.5; Ãâ€¡2 = 34.295; P &lt;.001) and antipsychotics exposure (z = 3.6; Ãâ€¡2 = 21.494; P &lt;.001) than the previous years. However, predominance of female exposure and intentional self-poisoning was maintained over the past five years, including the lockdown. COVID-19-associated lockdown greatly reformed the usual intoxication pattern of the cases admitted to emergency room. Also, it played a role in delaying time of hospital arrival, which was reflected as lower recovery rates and higher death rates.","Fayed, Sharif","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1049023X20001533","20210105","COVID-19; antipsychotics; drug poisoning; lockdown; pesticides","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-06","",9055,""
"The psychological effects of staying home due to the COVID-19 pandemic","The most significant individual safety measures taken during the COVID-19 pandemic include physical distancing, quarantine, and isolation. Although such steps are taken to control the spread of the pandemic, they may also cause various psychological problems. This study attempts to identify individual perceptions of staying home due to the COVID-19 pandemic through metaphors, and examines the relationship between these perceptions and stress, depression, and anxiety. This research utilizes a mixed method design called the embedded design. The analyses were performed on data collected from 96 women and 80 men aged 18-57. Qualitative data were analyzed using a content analysis technique, while quantitative data were analyzed through the Kruskal-Wallis test. The findings showed that most of the participants viewed staying home as confinement, experienced boredom/depression because of staying home, and felt helpless. On the other hand, some participants concentrated on the positive sides of staying home and considered it a responsible behavior, an opportunity, and a requirement for feeling safe. The individuals who viewed staying home as confinement and a cause for boredom/depression experienced more psychological problems, whereas those who perceived it as a responsibility or opportunity experienced fewer psychological problems. Considering the literature on the contribution of positive thinking to the well-being of individuals, as well as the lower levels of psychological problems in individuals who maintain their positive perspectives despite the negativities of staying home due to the pandemic, we recommend that mental health professionals focus on the development of positive feelings and thoughts in their interventions.","BozdaÃ„Å¸","https://doi.org/10.1080/00221309.2020.1867494","20210105","COVID-19; Confinement; lockdown; social distancing; staying home","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-06","",9056,""
"Mental Health Services in a US Prison During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Pandemics pose unique risks to people in correctional facilities. Among other vulnerabilities, incarcerated populations often have high rates of mental disorders and substance use disorders, which may increase risks for morbidity and mortality during a pandemic. California's San Quentin State Prison (SQSP) experienced multiple outbreaks during the 1918 influenza pandemic, and, a century later, the prison faces a new pandemic. This Open Forum describes the modification of mental health services in SQSP during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors explore the challenges of reducing risks of viral contagion while maintaining high-quality mental health care in a correctional setting.","Burton, Morris, Hirschtritt","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202000476","20210105","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-06","",9057,""

"COVID-19-Related Fear and Anxiety: Spiritual-Religious Coping in Healthcare Workers in Portugal","The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the mental health of the general population, and for healthcare workers (HCWs) it has been no different. Religiosity and spirituality are known coping strategies for mental illnesses, especially in stressful times. This study aimed to describe the role of spiritual-religious coping regarding fear and anxiety in relation to COVID-19 in HCWs in Portugal. A cross-sectional quantitative online survey was performed. Socio-demographic and health data were collected as well as the Duke University Religion Index, Spirituality Scale, Fear of COVID-19 Scale, and Coronavirus Anxiety Scale. Two hundred and twenty-two HCWs participated in the study, 74.3% were female and 81.1% were physicians. The median age was 37 years (Q1, Q3: 31, 51.3). Religiosity was neither a significant factor for coronavirus-related anxiety nor it was for fear of COVID-19. Participants with higher levels in the hope/optimism dimension of the Spirituality Scale showed less coronavirus-related anxiety. Female HCWs, non-physicians, and the ones with a previous history of anxiety presented higher levels of fear and/or anxiety related to COVID-19. HCWs' levels of distress should be identified and reduced, so their work is not impaired.","Prazeres, Passos, SimÃƒÂµes, SimÃƒÂµes, Martins, Teixeira","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18010220","20210105","COVID-19; anxiety; coping skills; fear; health personnel; religion; spirituality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-06","",9059,""
"Reduced Hedonic Tone and Emotion Dysregulation Predict Depressive Symptoms Severity during the COVID-19 Outbreak: An Observational Study on the Italian General Population","The COVID-19 pandemic has spiked stress-related symptoms worldwide. This study aims to assess depressive symptoms related to the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak among the Italian general population and to analyze anhedonia and emotion dysregulation as potential predictors of depression severity. Through an online questionnaire, we collected sociodemographic and lockdown-related information; depressive symptoms, hedonic tone, and emotion dysregulation were assessed through the Beck Depression Inventory II, the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale, and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, respectively. In our sample (n = 500), 122 individuals (24.4%) reported depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak. Individuals with and without depression differed in gender (X<sup>2</sup> = 4.77, df = 1, <i>p</i> = 0.02) and age (X<sup>2</sup> = 15.7, df = 4, <i>p</i> = 0.003). Among individuals presenting with depressive symptoms, those reporting close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 were at higher risk for severe depression (<i>p</i> = 0.026). Reduced hedonic tone (<i>p</i> = 0.014) and emotion dysregulation (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) also predicted depression severity. To the best of our knowledge, these are among the earliest data that focus on the risk for depression among a sizeable sample of the Italian general population during the COVID-19 outbreak. Our results indicate emotion dysregulation and reduced hedonic tone as potential factors predicting COVID-19-related depression severity and provide insight into developing targeted intervention policies.","Moccia, Janiri, Giuseppin, Agrifoglio, Monti, Mazza, Caroppo, Fiorillo, Sani, Di Nicola, Janiri","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18010255","20210105","SARS-CoV-2; affect regulation; anhedonia; coronavirus; depression; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-06","",9060,""
