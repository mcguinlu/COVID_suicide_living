"A Descriptive Study of Patient Quality Care via Telehealth During COVID-19 (preprint)","The COVID-19 pandemic has seen a rise in reported symptoms of anxiety or depressive disorders, difficulty sleeping or eating, and an increase in alcohol and substance use primarily resulting from isolation and job loss. Social distancing guidelines created the perfect opportunity for mental healthcare organizations across all mental health care settings and levels of care to connect with individuals and families suffering from mental abnormalities virtually;however, widespread adoption of telehealth programs by mental health practitioners continues to fall short. This study uses a non-experimental descriptive survey design to answer descriptive questions on how participants rated their experience with telehealth as a standalone service delivery method in private practice settings. When patients experience quality care, they are more likely to return for future services and refer others. Quality experiences do correlate with positive financial performance, and this study describes how patients are rating their experience. The survey in this study contained Likert Scale questions, and the researcher used cross-tabulation and pivot tables to describe how participants responded to the survey. Results from this study are intended to provide insight into telehealth acceptance and effectiveness. This study also provides a foundation for further research to discover participant perceptions and examine participant responses as it relates to telehealth as a standalone mode of treatment in a private practice setting.","","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/xyre8","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",34979,""
"Evaluating a Telehealth Single-Session Consultation Service for Clients on Psychotherapy Wait-Lists (preprint)","Outpatient mental health clinics across the country are struggling to meet acute demand for mental health services, resulting in months-long waitlists for people seeking care. Providing evidence-based, single session interventions to treatment-seeking individuals while they are waiting for treatment may help address this crisis. One such intervention, the Single-Session Consultation (SSC), was found to be an effective, acceptable, and feasible low-intensity treatment option when delivered in person. The current study evaluates the telehealth delivered SSC during the COVID-19 pandemic to individuals waiting to access mental health care. Of the 147 people offered an SSC, 95 (64.63%) accepted the invitation, 74 (77.89%) scheduled with a clinician, and 65 (87.84%) attended the session, surpassing feasibility benchmarks. Participants saw pre-to-post intervention improvements in hopelessness (dz = .91, p &lt;.001) and readiness for change (dz = -0.49, p &lt;.001). At 2-weeks follow-up, anxiety symptoms reduced significantly (dz = .40, p = .04) but depression symptoms did not decrease significantly (dz = .21). Participants rated telehealth-SSC sessions as highly acceptable and developed a close therapeutic alliance (M = 6.13, SD = 0.76). The telehealth-SSC was acceptable, feasible, and effective in the short-term, suggesting its utility as a low-intensity, scalable interventions for people on waiting lists for outpatient mental health care.","","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/k7u4r","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",34980,""
"Changes in UK Parental Mental Health Symptoms over 10 months of the COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)","Background. The threats to health, associated restrictions, and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have been linked to increases in mental health difficulties for many. Parents, in particular, have experienced many challenges such as having to combine work with home-schooling their children and other caring responsibilities. Yet, it remains unclear how parental mental health has changed throughout the pandemic or what factors may have mitigated or compounded the impact of the pandemic on parentsâ€™ mental health.Methods. We examined monthly survey data from two linked UK-based longitudinal studies: Co-SPACE and Co-SPYCE. Data from 5,576 parents/carers of 2-16-year-old children collected between April 2020 and January 2021 was analysed using mixed-effect modelling and latent class growth mixture modelling.Results. Parental stress and depression, but not anxiety, were higher during the periods of restrictions. This pattern was most pronounced for parents with primary-school-aged children, whilst parents with secondary-school-aged children showed greater continuous increases in mental health symptoms from the start of the pandemic. Although around three quarters of parents reported consistently low mental health symptoms, a substantial minority reported consistently high or increasing symptoms of anxiety, stress, and depression. The latter were more likely to be parents who were younger than average, were a single adult in the household, had a pre-existing mental health diagnosis, or had a child with special educational needs or a neurodevelopmental disorder.Conclusions. These findings emphasise how different personal circumstances and pre-existing inequalities shaped how parents were affected by this unprecedented global pandemic and highlight the need for support and consideration to meet the needs of families in the future.","","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/gnfwa","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",34981,""
"Depression, anxiety and resilience during COVID-19 in Dutch patients with Cystic Fibrosis or Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia and their caregivers (preprint)","Background:  The COVID-19 pandemic has spread across the world, leading to government measures associated with a negative impact on mental health. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on depression, anxiety and resilience in Dutch people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF) or primary ciliary dyskinesia (PwPCD) and their caregivers during the pandemic. Methods: . Adolescents (12-17 years), adults and caregivers of children (0-17 years) with CF or PCD completed questionnaires on depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7) and resilience (BRS) between September 2020 and February 2021. The psychosocial impact of COVID-19 was measured by the Exposure and Family Impact Survey (CEFIS) Part 2. Mixed model analyses compared PHQ-9 and GAD-7 results to participantsâ€™ pre-pandemic scores. Results: . 110 participants (10 PwCF, 31 PwPCD, 52 CF caregivers, 17 PCD caregivers) completed questionnaires during the pandemic. Pre-pandemic outcomes were available for 87 participants. The prevalence of symptoms of depression and anxiety (PHQ-9 or GAD-7 scores =5) in PwCF and PwPCD and their caregivers before and during the pandemic was high, with an increase in depression in PwCF (2.75;95%-CI: 0.82 to 4.68) and increase in anxiety in CF caregivers (1.03;0.09 to 1.96) during the pandemic. Resilience was within the normal range for all groups, CEFIS scores corresponded to a low to normal impact. Conclusion:  PwCF and PwPCD and their caregivers were at high risk of increased depression and anxiety symptoms both before and during the pandemic, which emphasizes the importance of mental health screening and psychological care in CF and PCD.","","https://doi.org/10.22541/au.165769390.01619557/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",34982,""
"The rapid change of mental health in college students after on-campus quarantine in Shanghai 2022 Covid lockdown (preprint)","Importance: Social isolation during outbreaks of epidemics always challenge psychological resilience profoundly. However, it still remains unclear how studentsâ€™ mental health would be affected by strict o n-campus quarantine, which means students stayed at dormitories or on-campus for quarantine. We analyzed the data from one of the earliest universities releasing strict on-campus quarantine to prevent the Omicron spread-out in Shanghai, to evaluate the time course of the psychological resilience in the influence of an unexpected change in the living space in university students. Objectives:  : The campus was locked down on 9 th March. From 9 th to 23 rd , all students on campus were asked to stay in their dormitries, and teachers sent food supplies three times a day. From 24 th March to early April, students were gradually allowed to enter the campus for necessary activities. We quantify dynamic changes in depression severity during the campus locked down. Method:  All participants were undergraduate or graduate students. The survey was released on 5th, April. All survey was dropped a public link on www.wjx.cn and administered from April 5th to 7th, 2022. Following the schedule of quarantine area, we assessed depressive symptoms in SJTU students from Period 1 (two weeks before 9 th , March), Period 2 (9 th to 23 rd , March), and Period 3 (24 th March to 5 th April). 274 students completed the online survey, and two incomplete data were excluded for further analysis. All these participants aged range from 18 to 25 years old and were quarantined in dormitories since 9 th March 2022. Findings:  A remarkable increase in depression was observed in university students after stringent quarantine. The portion of students with depression started at 9.1% before quarantine and rapidly increased to 36.1% right after quarantine. No more increase in depressive symptoms was observed with time though quarantine was ongoing, which can be predicted by the food supplement satisfaction and the duration of physical fitness per day. Interestingly, the impact of a sudden change in living space on the psychological resilence was more evident in students who have a romatic relationship than singles.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1848919/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",34983,""
"Religiosity Was Associated With Lower Scores on Anxiety and Depression Symptoms in Medical Students During the COVID 19 Pandemic (preprint)","BACKGROUND: The prevalence of anxiety symptoms in medical students is 63% and depression symptoms exceed 30.6%. The medical degree and the way academics work their training are known to generate stress and affect the health and performance of students. The religious apparatus can be a helpful tool to reduce these symptoms. To associate anxiety, depression and religiosity among medical students during home isolation period in the pandemic by COVID-19. METHODS: Students were randomly selected to complete a questionnaire with sociodemographic data, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Duke religiosity scale. The Kruskal-Wallys test was used to analyze the groups in independent samples and the Spearmam test was used to correlate the variables. RESULTS: 255 subjects were selected, 67.1% (171) female and 32.9% (84) male. Regarding the HADS scale, 57.3% (146) exceeded cut-off points for anxiety and 32% (82) and for depression. A higher prevalence of depression was found, with high statistical significance, in students of the clinical cycle (I suggest starting the sentence by the significant findings) and a p&gt;0.05 value demonstrated the absence of difference in anxiety indices between course cycles. When correlating anxiety, depression and religiosity, there was a significant and inversely proportional relationship between anxiety and intrinsic religiosity. We also observed, with statistical significance, an inversely proportional correlation between organizational religiosity and depression among participants. CONCLUSIONS: There was an inversely proportional association between anxiety and intrinsic religiosity, as well as, between depression and organizational religiosity among medical students during the period of home isolation in the pandemic by COVID-19. The stressful event triggered by the pandemic favored the analysis of the aforementioned association with religiosity, whose protocol for defining risk or protection in longitudinal studies becomes a challenge due to the unlikely repetition of the severity of the time when the present study was conducted.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1847768/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",34984,""
"The psychological impact of COVID19 pandemic on health care workers in Pontevedra (Spain)Â  (preprint)","The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed health care workers (HCWs) to increased workload and high risk of contagion with a negative impact in their mental healthWe present a descriptive and observational study performed with a total sample of 306 healthcare workers (HCWs) in the Pontevedra Area, which include two Hospitals: Hospital do SalnÃ©s and Hospital Clinico-Universitario de Pontevedra and Primary Care Health Centers (â€œCentros de SaÃºdeâ€: CS and AP, â€œPuntos de AtenciÃ³n Continuadaâ€: PACS) from 3th to 16th May 2021. (Figure1) (1)Aim: To study the psychological impact in healthcare workers in our community, (Pontevedra, 300000 inhabitants). Method: An online massive survey was administered with â€œGoogle Formsâ€. We performed a battery of sociodemographic and work conditions questions, medical history, psychiatric drugs consumption, substance use, personality test (Salamanca Personality test), SCL-90-R (depression and anxiety subscales) and perceived stress scale (PSS-10). Respondents were 306 HCWs (80.4% women;19.3% men, 1 non-binary)Results: We find that 22.4% of HCWs present high perceived stress, 85.7% have sleep problems and 20.6% are using psychiatric drugs (either anxiolytics or antidepressants). 65.5% of HCWs on psychiatric medication recognize the need to increase doses during the pandemic. Besides, 12.1% has started taking antidepressants. We find an increase in alcohol and tobacco use. The fear to infect family, the front-line professionals and the extreme working conditions (work overload and the feeling of having few means and little support available) are the main variables that impact the mental health of HCWs during the pandemic. The personality traits shape coping strategies. The highest perceived stress happens in HCWs working in Primary Health Centers (especially those that work in both places: hospitals and Primary Health Centers).","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1847719/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",34985,""
"Spontaneous pneumomediastinum: a surrogate of P-SILI in critically ill COVID-19 patients (preprint)","Spontaneous pneumomediastinum (SP) was described early during the COVID-19 pandemic in large series of patient with severe pneumonia, but all partly involved patients with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) at the time of SP diagnosis. We aimed, in this retrospective multicenter observational study, to describe the prevalence and outcomes of SP during severe COVID-19 pneumonia before any IMV, in order to rule out mechanisms induced by IMV in the development of pneumomediastinum. A total of 551 patients were included. Twenty-one (4%) developed a SP while under non-invasive respiratory support, with a median of 6 days [4â€“12] from ICU admission. Although the proportion of patients eventually requiring IMV was similar, time to tracheal intubation was longer in patients with SP (6 days [4â€“13] vs. 2 days [1â€“4];P  = 0.0001), with a higher first-line use of non-invasive ventilation (n = 11;52% vs . n = 150;28%). By focusing on the 21 patients who developed a SP we noticed persisting signs of severe lung disease and respiratory failure with lower ROX index between admission and occurrence of SP (3.94 [3.15â€“5.55] at ICU admission vs. 3.25 [2.73â€“4.02] the day preceding SP;P  = 0.1) which may underlie potential indirect signals of patient-self inflicted lung injury (P-SILI). In this series of critically-ill COVID-19 patients, prevalence of SP without invasive mechanical ventilation was not uncommon, affecting 4% of patients and was associated with higher need for vital supports and longer ICU length of stay. One pathophysiological mechanism may potentially be carried-out by P-SILI related to a prolonged respiratory failure as underlined by a delayed use of IMV and the evolution of ROX index between ICU admission and the day preceding SP.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1832455/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",34986,""
"Acceptability and expected changes in parental practices after an online behavioural parent program for ADHD during the Covid-19 pandemic (preprint)","Background:  Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder in children and adolescents, characterized by attention deficit, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Treatments for this population should be multidisciplinary and must be initiated as soon as possible. Non-pharmacological interventions for ADHD include psychoeducation, parent behavioural training programs and school interventions and accommodations. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed an online version of a combined psychoeducation and behavioural training program to facilitate access to mental health treatment and ensure continuity of care. The study assessed the acceptability of this online parent training program, among parents and/or caretakers of children and adolescents with ADHD. Methods:  The program consisted of 10 online sessions over the course of 2 consecutive days (5 sessions a day). Satisfaction, usefulness and general comments about the program were assessed with open-ended questions and visual-analogous scales. Parents/caretakersâ€™ use of strategies to manage behavioural problems was assessed using the Parenting and Family Adjustment Scales. Results:  A total of 206 parents participated in the online program and 175 of them completed the evaluation. Overall, participants were satisfied with the content of the program and found it beneficial for their child. The engagement was high and no major obstacles were identified to participation, except some internet connection issues. More than half of participants had already used some of the strategies included in the program. Despite this, some difficulties in implementing new strategies were observed. Conclusions:  Our study contributes to the growing body of papers evaluating online behavioral training program to improve their efficacy and content. With these measures, we hope to improve engagement in online psychoeducation and behavioural therapy programs. Future research evaluating online behavioural training programs should focus on ways to make them more accessible and adaptable to familiesâ€™ obstacles.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1830149/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",34987,""
"Depression, Anxiety, & Loneliness Among Cancer Survivors During the COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)","Purpose:  Although studies have evaluated the mental health impacts in those recently diagnosed with cancer during the pandemic, few studies focused on cancer survivors who are past their primary cancer treatment. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on depression, anxiety, and loneliness between those with and without a history of cancer. Methods:  Kaiser Permanente Research Bank participants were invited to complete a series of surveys from May to December 2020. The difference in score of depression, anxiety, and loneliness were estimated using linear mixed regression. All models adjusted for age group, sex, race/ethnicity, Kaiser Permanente region, smoking status, and Charlson comorbidity score. Results:  Among cancer survivors, 21% and 19% met the thresholds for increased risk of depression and anxiety. Among those without a history of cancer, 24% met the thresholds for increased risk of depression and anxiety. Both groups reported decreases in mean depression, anxiety, and loneliness scores between May and July 2020, however, scores increased from August to December 2020. Cancer survivors had decreased depression, anxiety, and loneliness scores compared to those without a history of cancer. Among cancer survivors, younger age groups and females reported increased depression, anxiety, and loneliness scores, while non-Hispanic Black and Asian participants reported decreased depression, anxiety, and loneliness scores. Conclusion:  The results of this study highlight the continued necessity of addressing mental health needs and social support in cancer survivors, especially those who are younger and female, during and after a public health emergency.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1829156/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",34988,""

"Self-report of mental health distress among pregnant and parenting adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic in Malawi (preprint)","Objective:  Few studies have examined the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health among young people in sub-Saharan Africa and particularly pregnant and parenting adolescents exposed to multiple stressors. Our study addresses this gap by examining self-report of mental health challenges among pregnant and parenting adolescent girls during the pandemic. Methods: : We undertook a cross-sectional survey involving 666 girls aged 13-19 in Blantyre district, southern Malawi, between March and May 2021. We recruited eligible respondents from households in 66 randomly selected rural (26) and urban (40) enumeration areas. Mental distress was assessed using nine symptoms including worry, restlessness, fear, anxiety, sadness, loneliness, frustration, fear, stress, and boredom. Girls were asked whether they experienced more of these symptoms after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Any girl experiencing one of these symptoms was considered to have experienced mental distress. Bivariate and multivariable regression models were used to examine correlates of mental distress. Findings:  Girlsâ€™ median age was 18 years with a range of 13-19 years. Most girls (68.3%) reported having experienced somewhat more or much more mental distress, with 17.6% indicating all nine symptoms. In the adjusted model, pregnant and parenting girls aged 19 were more likely to report having experienced more mental distress (OR=1.79;95% CI 1.15 â€“ 2.77) during the pandemic compared to those aged 13-17 years. Similarly, girls who had ever worked had a higher likelihood of experiencing more mental distress (AOR:1.65;95% CI 1.12 â€“ 2.41) than before the pandemic. On the contrary, perceived neighborhood safety was protective against mental distress (OR=0.81 95% CI 0.69 â€“ 0.95 p&lt;0.01). Conclusion:  Pregnant and parenting adolescent girls' mental health was adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, thereby exacerbating their vulnerabilities and increasing risk of poor mental health. Our findings could inform interventions targeting adolescentsâ€™ mental health during pandemics.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1809318/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",34991,""
"Post COVID-19 condition diagnosis: A population-based cohort study of occurrence, associated factors, and healthcare use by severity of acute infection (preprint)","Background:  The occurrence and healthcare use trajectory of post COVID-19 is poorly understood. Our aim was to investigate these aspects in SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals with and without a post COVID-19 condition diagnosis. Methods We conducted a population-based cohort study of adults in the entire Stockholm Region, Sweden, with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test from 1 March 2020 to 31 July 2021, stratified by severity of the acute infection. The study outcome was a post COVID-19 condition diagnosis registered any time 90 to 360 days after positive test. We performed Cox regression models to assess baseline characteristics associated with post COVID-19. Individuals with post COVID-19 were then propensity-score matched to individuals without post COVID-19 to assess healthcare use beyond the acute infection. Findings: Among 204 805 SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals, the proportion receiving a post COVID-19 diagnosis was 1% among individuals not hospitalized for their COVID-19 infection, 6% among hospitalized, and 32% among ICU-treated individuals. Female sex was associated with post COVID-19 among non-hospitalized and hospitalized individuals, with interactions between age and sex. Previous mental health disorders and asthma were associated with post COVID-19 among non-hospitalized [aHR 2Â·18 (95% CI 1Â·98 - 2Â·39), aHR 2Â·09 (95% CI 1Â·82 - 2Â·40)] and hospitalized [aHR 1Â·38 (95% CI 1Â·17 - 1Â·64), aHR 1Â·64 (95% CI 1Â·34 - 2Â·00)] individuals. Among individuals with post COVID-19, the monthly proportion with outpatient care visits after the infection compared to before the infection was substantially elevated up to one year after the acute infection, with substantial proportions of this care attributed to care related to post COVID-19. Interpretation: The differential association of age, sex, comorbidities, and healthcare use with severity of the acute infection indicates different trajectories and phenotypes of post COVID-19 condition, with incomplete resolution one year after infection.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1804130/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",34992,""
"Fear of COVID-19, psychological distress, general health and quality of life among baccalaureate nursing students at one year into the COVID-19 pandemic: a mixed method study (preprint)","Background:  The COVID-19 pandemic led to major changes in peopleâ€™s lives via protective strategies aimed at limiting the transmission of COVID-19, including social distancing, lockdowns, cancelled or limited leisure activities and tutorials and supervision for students taking place digital. All of these changes may have influenced studentsâ€™ health and quality of life (QOL). Aim:  To describe and explore fear of COVID-19 and psychological distress, as well as general health and QOL, among baccalaureate nursing students at 1 year into the COVID-19 pandemic. Method:  We used a mixed method study design, including quantitative data from one university in southern Norway that was a part of a national survey of baccalaureate nursing students and qualitative data from focus group interviews from the same university. The quantitative data were collected using well-validated measures of fear of COVID-19, psychological distress, general health and QOL, and the data were analysed using the ANOVA-tests for continuous data and chi-square tests for categorical data. The qualitative data were analysed using systematic text condensation. Results:  The quantitative survey included 396 baccalaureate nursing students (response rate: 46%). The mean score (standard deviation [SD]) for fear of COVID-19 was 2.32 (0.71), for psychological distress was 1.53 (1.00), for general health was 3.51 (0.96) and for overall QOL was 6.01 (2.06).Five focus group interviews were conducted with a total of 23 students (7 men, 16 women). In the qualitative data, we identified the overarching theme effect of COVID-19 on studentsâ€™ QOL and the three main themes;importance of personal relations, physical health challenges and mental health challenges. Conclusion:  The COVID-19 pandemic influenced negatively nursing studentsâ€™ QOL and physical and mental health, and they often felt lonely. However, most of the participants also adapted strategies and resilience factors to cope with the situation. Via the pandemic situation, the students learned additional skills and mental mindsets that may be useful in their future professional lives.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1803383/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",34993,""
"Maternal and infant NR3C1 and SLC6A4 epigenetic signatures of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown: When timing matters (preprint)","Stress exposure during pregnancy is critically linked with maternal mental health and child development. The effects might involve altered patterns of DNA methylation in specific stress-related genes (i.e., glucocorticoid receptor gene, NR3C1 , and serotonin transporter gene, SLC6A4 ) and might be moderated by the gestational timing of stress exposure. In this study, we report on NR3C1 and SLC6A4 methylation status in Italian mothers and infants who were exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown during different trimesters of pregnancy. From May 2020 to February 2021, 283 mother-infant dyads were enrolled at delivery. Within 24 hours from delivery, buccal cells were collected to assess NR3C1 (44 CpG sites) and SLC6A4 (13 CpG sites) methylation status. Principal component (PC) analyses were used to reduce methylation data dimension to one PC per maternal and infant gene methylation. Mother-infant dyads were split into three groups based on the pregnancy trimester (first, second, third) during which they were exposed to the COVID-19 lockdown. Mothers and infants who were exposed to the lockdown during the first trimester of pregnancy had lower NR3C1 and SLC6A4 methylation when compared to counterparts exposed during the second or third trimesters. The effect remained significant after controlling for confounders. Women who were pregnant during the pandemic and their infants might present altered epigenetic biomarkers of stress-related genes. As these epigenetic marks have been previously linked with heightened risk of maternal psychiatric problems and less-than-optimal child development, mothers and infants should be adequately monitored for psychological health during and after the pandemic.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1792374/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",34994,""
"The prevalence of violence and its association with mental health among the Iranian population in one year after the outbreak of COVID-19 disease (preprint)","Objective:  The current study aimed to determine the prevalence of violence and its association with mental health among Iranians older than 15 years in 2020. Methods:  Data was collected through National Mental Health Survey on 24,584 Iranians older than 15 years in 2020. were analyzed to determine the prevalence of violence and its association with mental health. Multi-stage sampling method was used, and data on demographic characteristics and domestic-social violence and mental health (GHQ-28) were collected. Data analysis was administered using descriptive statistics and chi-square test at 95% level. Results:  The mean age of participants was 44.18Â±16.4 years. The overall prevalence of domestic and social violence was 11.4% and 5.5%, respectively. Verbal violence was the most common type;61.8% and 66.8% for domestic and social violence, respectively. A suspected case of mental disorder, female gender, being younger than 25 years, living apart together, unemployment, low education, and history of COVID-19 infection presented a significant association with domestic and social violence (p&gt;0.05). Conclusion:  In comparison to the previous study in 2015, the prevalence of violence has increased. Therefore, domestic and social violence are the social concerns of Iranian society, indicating the necessity of appropriate interventions, particularly for those suspected of mental disorders and young women with low education levels.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1723648/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",34995,""
"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of university students in the United Arab Emirates: a cross-sectional study (preprint)","Background:  The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the mental well-being of students worldwide. There is a scarcity of information on the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on university students in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This study aimed to investigate the mental health impact of the COVID-19, including depression, anxiety and resilience among a sample of university students in the UAE. Methods: : A cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted from September to November 2021. The patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9), generalized anxiety disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Connorâ€“Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10) were used to assess depression, anxiety, and resilience. The COVID-19 impact was assessed using a list of questions. Results: : Only, 798 students completed the survey and were analyzed for this study. Overall, 74.8% of the students were females, 91.2% were never married, and 66.3% were UAE-nationals. Based on PHQ-9 and GAD-7 cut-off scores (= 10), four out of ten of the students self-reported moderate and severe depression (40.9%) and anxiety (39.1%). Significantly higher mean PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores were found among students who were impacted by COVID-19 than those non-impacted (mean PHQ-9 of 9.51Â± 6.39 and 6.80 Â±6.34;p= 0.001, respectively) and (mean GAD-7 of 9.03 Â±6.00 and 8.54 Â±6.02;respectively, p &lt; 0.001). Female students who were impacted by COVID-19 had statistically significant higher depression and anxiety scores than the non-impacted females (mean PHQ-9 of 9.14 Â±5.86 versus 6.83 Â±6.25, respectively;p&lt;0.001 and mean GAD-7 of 9.57 Â±6.32 versus 5.15 Â±3.88, respectively;p= 0.005). Never married students had significantly higher PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores than ever-married (9.31 Â± 6.37 versus 6.93 Â± 5.47, P=0.003) and (8.89 Â± 6.11 versus 7.13 Â± 5.49, respectively;p=0.017). Only one in ten of the students revealed high resilience levels, however, differences in the mean CD-RISC-10 scores by COVID-19 impact were not statistically significant. Conclusions: : The results of this study demonstrate that the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the mental health of this sample of university students in terms of depression and anxiety. The results highlight the need to adopt culturally appropriate interventions for university students and focus on vulnerable groups.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1713025/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",34996,""
"Mental health experiences of HIV/TB healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic â€“ lessons for provider well-being and support from a qualitative study in seven South African provinces (preprint)","Background:  COVID-19 has substantially reshaped health service delivery. Healthcare workers have had to serve more clients, work longer shifts, and operate in conditions of uncertainty. They have experienced multiple stressors related to the additional â€˜labour of careâ€™, including managing the frustration of inadequate therapeutic or symptom relief options, witnessing clients dying, and having to give this news to clientsâ€™ family members. Ongoing psychological distress among healthcare workers can severely undermine performance, decision-making and well-being. We sought to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health experiences of healthcare workers delivering HIV and TB services in South Africa. Methods:  We used a pragmatic and exploratory design to understand HCWsâ€™ mental health experiences with in-depth qualitative data. We implemented the study in ten high HIV/TB burden districts across seven of South Africaâ€™s nine provinces among healthcare workers employed by USAID-funded implementing partners. We conducted in-depth interviews (virtual) with 92 healthcare workers across 10 cadres. Results:  Healthcare workers reported experiencing a range of extreme and rapidly fluctuating emotions because of COVID-19 that negatively impacted on their well-being. Among these, many healthcare workers report experienced a great deal of guilt at their inability to continue to provide quality care to their clients. In addition, a constant and pervasive fear of contracting COVID-19. Healthcare workersâ€™ stress coping mechanisms were limited to begin with, and often further interrupted by COVID-19 and non-pharmaceutical response measures e.g., â€˜lockdownsâ€™. Healthcare workers reported a need for greater support for managing the everyday burden of work â€“ not only when experiencing a mental well-being â€˜episodeâ€™. Further, that whenever they were exposed to stressor events, e.g., supporting a child living with HIV who reports sexual abuse to the healthcare worker, that this this would trigger additional support interventions and not rely on the healthcare worker seeking this out. Further, that supervisors spend more effort demonstrating appreciation toward staff. Conclusions:  The COVID-19 epidemic has added significant mental health burden for healthcare workers in South Africa. Addressing this requires broad and cross-cutting strengthening of everyday support for healthcare workers and centring staffâ€™s mental well-being as core to delivering quality health services.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1695494/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",34997,""
"Psychological Distress in South African Healthcare Workers early in the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Analysis of Associations and Mitigating Factors (preprint)","While the global COVID-19 pandemic has been widely acknowledged to affect the mental health of health care workers (HCWs), attention to measures that protect those on the front lines of health outbreak response has been limited. In this cross-sectional study, we examine workplace contextual factors associated with how psychological distress was experienced in a South African setting where a severe first wave was being experienced with an objective of identifying factors that can protect against HCWs experiencing negative impacts. Consistent with mounting literature on mental health effects, we found a high degree of psychological distress (57.4% above General Health Questionnaire cut-off value) and a strong association between perceived risks associated with the presence of COVID-19 in the healthcare workplace and psychological distress (adjusted OR = 2.35, p &lt;.01). Our research indicates that both training (adjusted OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.21 &ndash;0.81) and the reported presence of supportive workplace relationships (adjusted OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.27 &ndash;0.97) were associated with positive outcomes. This evidence that workplace resilience can be reinforced to better prepare for the onset of similar outbreaks in the future suggests that pursuit of further research into specific interventions to improve resilience is well merited.","","https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202207.0151.v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",34998,""
"Understanding the stress and coping experiences of undergraduate university students in the COVID-19 context: A qualitative study (preprint)","Background:  The various psychological challenges experienced by university students have been well- characterised. The university experience can be stressful, which can negatively impact on mental health. Student stress was further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic due to the lack of on-campus learning and peer contact. This study aims to understand the stress experiences and coping strategies of undergraduate university students in Ireland during the COVID-19 pandemic and to explore the differences between first-year and returning studentsâ€™ experiences. Methods: : Undergraduate students at the National University of Ireland, Galway, took part in online semi-structured interviews via Microsoft Teams. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using inductive reflexive thematic analysis. Results: : Nineteen students were interviewed (10 first-years and 9 returning students). Three themes were developed in relation to perceived stressors: (1) â€˜ The unknown. The dragon. The fear of getting sick â€™ with sub-themes, â€˜Fear of COVID-19â€™ and â€˜Chronic uncertainty and negative media messagesâ€™;(2) â€˜Online learning is overwhelmingâ€™ with sub-themes â€˜Difficulties with university workloadâ€™ and â€˜ One place, same screen, same things â€™;(3) â€˜Social isolationâ€™ with sub-themes â€˜Lack of peer contactâ€™ and â€˜Fear of missing outâ€™. Two themes in relation to coping were also developed: (1) â€˜ Help each other, keep each other afloat â€™ and (2) â€˜Focusing on the positives in a shared storm.â€™ First-year students described additional stressors not experienced by returning students such as navigating university for the first time remotely and making friends virtually. Conclusion:  All students struggled with various additional stressors due to the COVID-19 situation, particularly first-year students who experienced additional stressors while adjusting to university in a pandemic context. All students described coping strategies to help manage stress, which may be useful in developing future interventions and mental health supports for university students.","","https://doi.org/10.12688/hrbopenres.13573.1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",34999,""
"What did you do to stay â€˜saneâ€™ during the pandemic? A qualitative study to identify self-care mental health strategies utilized in a socially vulnerable population (preprint)","Background:  Mental health has deteriorated during the COVID-19 pandemic. These impacts are likely to be more severe in socially vulnerable communities. Previous research has identified useful self-help strategies that individuals may use to maintain and improve mental health. However, these studies have typically ignored economically and socially marginalized communities and have used researcher pre-defined practices. Little is known what activities or actions members of poor urban communities from low and middle income countries may utilize to take care of their mental health. Â  Methods:  During March and April 2021, we conducted open-ended interviews with 317 community members in Complexo de Favelas da MarÃ©, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, one of the largest slum areas in South America. Individuals were interviewed in selected public spaces to provide a representative sample of the wider area. Our sample consisted of 178 (56.1%) cis women, 133 (41.9%) cis men, 3 (0.9%) trans men, and 3 (0.9%) classified themselves as other. The majority of participants had incomplete middle school or less (54.2%) and were between 30 and 60 years (54.1%).Â  Results:  Using thematic analysis, we identified eight major themes in the responses. The most common themes that emerged were work, leisure activities (including watching TV & physical exercise) and religion/prayer. These findings did not clearly align with previous mental health recommendations. Some results were noteworthy by their absence, e.g., cost-effective mental health practices such as yoga, meditation or mindfulness were not mentioned. Only 4 individuals reported consulting mental health professionals during the pandemic.Â  Conclusions:  Our findings highlight the need for better public health campaigns that disseminate information for effective mental health practices during acute crises, especially for communities that are most vulnerable during public health crises.","","https://doi.org/10.12688/gatesopenres.13658.1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35000,""
"Mental health burden and predictors among Egyptian healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)","Background:  The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is known to have negatively affected the physical and mental well-being of healthcare workers. Estimating such a burden in a limited-resource setting may be essential in the ongoing fight against the pandemic. This research aims to assess the prevalence of mental health problems, that is, depression and anxiety, among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Egypt and their associated factors and predictors. Methods: : A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online survey to screen for anxiety using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) score and depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score among healthcare workers in direct or indirect contact with COVID-19 cases. Results: : Analysis of participantsâ€™ responses showed that 36.7% suffered from depression, while 30.7% had moderate to severe anxiety. Independent predictors of depression were feeling unsure or dissatisfied with oneâ€™s income (AOR =8.87 and 8.51, respectively), working exclusively in private or governmental hospitals (AOR = 8.15 and 5.1, respectively), and serving in central or insurance hospitals (AOR = 2.21). Meanwhile, independent predictors of anxiety were working in governmental hospitals (AOR = 5.87), working duration from 5 to 10 years (AOR = 4.65), and suffering from other comorbidities (AOR = 2.18). Working as a nurse was a protective factor against anxiety (AOR = 0.36). Conclusions: : The COVID-19 pandemic considerably affected the mental well-being of health care workers in Egypt. Income, type of hospital, working duration, and other comorbidities were the main predictors of health care workersâ€™ mental health. Examining the mental burden of the pandemic on health care workers is important so that current and future crises can be managed better.","","https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.122800.1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35001,""
"The effect of ICU diaries on the occurrence of impaired mental health and quality of life of ICU SARS-CoV-2 patients and their families: a protocol for an observational cohort study (preprint)","Background:  The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic puts patients and their relatives at risk of developing post-intensive care syndrome (PICS and PICS-family). The use of an intensive care unit (ICU) diary for these patients could help fill in memory gaps and complete their fragmented illness narrative. Objectives:  The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of an ICU diary on the occurrence of impaired mental health in patients admitted with a SARS-CoV-2 infection and their relatives. Methods: : An observational cohort study of SARS-CoV-2 patients treated in the ICU of Elizabeth-Tweesteden Hospital (ETZ) in Tilburg, The Netherlands will be conducted. Adult patients admitted at the ICU because of respiratory insufficiency due to SARS-CoV-2, who are mechanically ventilated, are included. During treatment in the ICU a diary is kept of the patient. Anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, cognitive dysfunction and quality of life will be screened in patients and their relatives by using the psychosocial screening instrument for adult trauma patients (PSIT), the Cognitive Failure Questionnaire (CFQ) and the short-form health survey 36 (SF-36). The recollection of patientsâ€™ memory of the ICU stay will be evaluated by the ICU memory tool. The appreciation of the ICU diary will be assessed using a questionnaire. Results: : Participantsâ€™ characteristics including how they valued the diary, and their memory of ICU treatment will be reported. Multiple logistic regression analysis will be performed for analyzing the relation between mental health outcome and the use of ICU diaries. Change in PICS symptoms over time will be analyzed using longitudinal data analysis. Missing values in questionnaires will be analyzed using missing value analysis and multiple imputations at item level will be performed if necessary. Conclusions: : This study will contribute to the knowledge of mental health outcome in SARS-CoV-2 patients and the use of ICU diaries in this group.","","https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.121821.1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35002,""
"SARS-CoV-2 causes brain inflammation via impaired neuro-immune interactions (preprint)","The brain inflammation that frequently occurs in SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of neurological complications and long COVID. However, many aspects of its pathogenesis mechanism remain unknown and no method of treatment has been established. By administering a non-proliferating adenovirus vector expressing SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein into the nasal cavity of mice, we developed a mouse model (S1 mouse) reproducing brain inflammation, fatigue, depressive symptoms, and lung inflammation. Having intracellular calcium elevating activity, S1 protein increased olfactory bulb apoptosis, and reduced the number of acetylcholine producing cells in the medial septal and the diagonal band of Broca as well as the amount of acetylcholine in the brain. This resulted in disrupting the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) and enhancing inflammation in the brain. Previously, nothing was known about anti-inflammatory factors in the CAP but we discovered that, in the inflammation occurring in the S1 mouse brain, the action of the RNA binding protein ZFP36 in degrading inflammatory cytokine mRNA was impaired. The symptoms exhibited by the S1 mouse were improved by administering donepezil, a drug with a cholinergic action used in the treatment of dementia. These findings clarify the mechanism of brain inflammation in COVID-19 and indicate the possibility of applying donepezil in the treatment of neurological complications in COVID-19 and long COVID.","","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.07.13.499991","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35003,""
"Structural epitope profiling identifies antibodies associated with critical COVID-19 and long COVID (preprint)","Antibodies can have beneficial, neutral, or harmful effects so resolving an antibody repertoire to its target epitopes may explain heterogeneity in susceptibility to infectious disease. However, the three-dimensional nature of antibody-epitope interactions limits discovery of important targets. We describe and experimentally validated a computational method and synthetic biology pipeline for identifying structurally stable and functionally important epitopes from the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. We identify patterns of antibodies associated with immunopathology, including a non-isotype switching IgM response to a membrane protein epitope strongly associated with severe COVID-19 (adjusted OR 72.14, 95% CI: 9.71 â€“ 1300.15).

"A Case-Crossover Phenome-wide Association Study (PheWAS) for Understanding Post-COVID-19 Diagnosis Patterns (preprint)","Importance: Post COVID-19 condition (PCC) is known to affect a large proportion of COVID-19 survivors. Robust study design and methods are needed to understand post-COVID-19 diagnosis patterns in all COVID-19 survivors, not just the ones clinically diagnosed with PCC. Objective: To assess which diagnoses appear more frequently after a COVID-19 infection and how they differ by COVID-19 severity and vaccination status. Design: We applied a case-crossover phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) in a retrospective cohort of COVID-19 survivors, comparing the occurrences of 1,649 diagnosis-based phenotype codes (PheCodes) pre- and post-COVID-19 infection periods in the same individual using a conditional logistic regression. Setting: Patients tested for or diagnosed with COVID-19 at Michigan Medicine from March 10, 2020 through May 1, 2022. Participants: 36,856 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients and 141,615 age- and sex-matched SARS-CoV-2-negative patients as a comparison group for sensitivity analysis. Exposure: SARS-CoV-2 virus infection as determined by RT-PCR testing and/or clinical evaluation. Main Outcomes and Measures: We compared the rate of occurrence of 1,649 disease classification codes in ""pre-"" and ""post-COVID-19 periods"". We studied how this pattern varied by COVID-19 severity and vaccination status at the time of infection. Results: Using a case-crossover PheWAS framework, we found mental, circulatory, and respiratory disorders to be strongly associated with the ""post-COVID-19 period"" for the overall COVID-19-positive cohort. A total of 325 PheCodes reached phenome-wide significance (p&lt;3e-05), and top hits included cardiac dysrhythmias (OR=1.7 [95%CI: 1.6-1.9]), respiratory failure, insufficiency, arrest (OR=3.1 [95%CI: 2.7-3.5]) and anxiety disorder (OR=1.7 [95%CI: 1.6-1.8]). In the patients with severe disease, we found stronger associations with many respiratory and circulatory disorders, such as pneumonia (p=2.1e-18) and acute pulmonary heart disease (p=2.4e-8), and the ""post-COVID-19 period,"" compared to those with mild/moderate disease. Test negative patients exhibited a somewhat similar association pattern to those fully vaccinated, with mental health and chronic circulatory diseases rising to the top of the association list in these groups. Conclusions and Relevance: Our results confirm that patients experience myriad symptoms more than 28 days after SARS-CoV-2 infection, but especially mental, circulatory, and respiratory disorders. Our case-crossover PheWAS approach controls for within-person confounders that are time-invariant. Comparison to test negatives with a similar design helped identify enrichment specific to COVID-19. As we look into the future, we must be aware of COVID-19 survivors' healthcare needs in the period after infection.","","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.07.07.22277394","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35005,""
"Race, class, and place modify mortality rates for the top 12 causes of death in the United States, 1999-2021 (preprint)","Objectives:  To disarticulate the associations of race (whiteness), class (socioeconomic status), and place (county) with risk of cause-specific death in the US. Methods We studied mortality in US counties for 11 causes of death (1999-2019) and COVID-19 (2020-2021). We adjusted for race and age using the American Community Survey and socioeconomic status using the Area Deprivation Index. Bayesian regressions with spatial county effects were estimated for inference. Results County whiteness and socioeconomic status modified death rates;geospatial effects differed by cause of death. Other factors equal, a 20% increase in county whiteness was associated with 5-8% increase in death from three causes and 4-15% reduction in death from others, including COVID-19. Other factors equal, advantaged counties had significantly lower death rates, even when juxtaposed with disadvantaged ones. Geospatial patterns of residual risk varied by cause of death. For example, cancer and heart disease death rates were better explained by age, socioeconomic status, and county whiteness than were COVID-19 and suicide deaths. Conclusions There are important independent contributions from race, class, and geography to risk of death in the US.","","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.14.22276404","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35006,""
"The Effect of COVID-19 Vaccine Misinformation on Authenticity Identification and Vaccination Behavior (preprint)","Misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines is a serious problem around the world. In this study, two research questions were quantitatively tested using survey data (N=5, 569): How is authenticity identification of COVID-19 vaccine misinformation related to vaccination behavior? And What is the relationship between the type of COVID-19 vaccine misinformation and vaccination behavior? Using a logit model, the results demonstrated that the probability of vaccination was lower when the respondents were exposed to misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines, both when they thought the information was correct and when they did not know whether the information was true or not. However, this varied depending on the field of misinformation. Misinformation about side effects (political content), efficacy, and conspiracy theories was associated with a tendency not to get a COVID-19 vaccine whether one believed the information or not, and the marginal effect was large for conspiracy theories. Misinformation about side effects (self-harm) demonstrated a tendency not to get a COVID-19 vaccine only when it was believed. In addition, misinformation about side effects (harm to others) demonstrated a tendency not to get a COVID-19 vaccine only when they were not known to be true. Furthermore, misinformation about the ingredients demonstrated no significant relationship with COVID-19 vaccination behavior.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Effect+of+COVID-19+Vaccine+Misinformation+on+Authenticity+Identification+and+Vaccination+Behavior+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35007,""
"Mobile Health Solution for College Student Mental Health: Interview Study and Design Requirement Analysis (preprint)","Background: Mental health problems are prevalent in college students. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the problems, and created a surge in the popularity of telehealth and mobile health solutions. Despite that mobile health is a promising approach to help students with mental health needs, few studies exist in investigating key features students need in a mental health self-management tool. Objective: The objective of our study was to identified key requirements and features for the design of a student-centered mental health self-management tool. Methods: An interview study was first conducted to understand college students' needs and preferences on a mental health self-management tool. Functional information requirement analysis was then conducted to translate the needs into design implications. Results: A total of 153 university students were recruited for the semi-structured interview. The participants mentioned several features including coping techniques, artificial intelligence, time management, tracking, and communication with others. Participant's preferences on usability and privacy settings were also collected. The desired functions were analyzed and turned into design-agnostic information requirements.

Emerging technologies have made significant contributions to the fight against the pandemic. An extensive review of the application of technology will help facilitate future research and technology development to provide better solutions for future pandemics. In contrast to the extensive surveys of academic communities that have already been conducted, this study explores the IT community of practice. Using GitHub as the study target, we analyzed the main functionalities of the projects submitted during the pandemic. This study examines trends in projects with different functionalities and the relationship between functionalities and technologies. The study results show an imbalance in the number of projects with varying functionalities in the GitHub community, i.e., applications account for more than half of the projects. In contrast, other data analysis and AI projects account for a smaller share. This differs significantly from the survey of the academic community, where the findings focus more on cutting-edge technologies while projects in the community of practice use more mature technologies.

"Towards Knowledge-based Mining of Mental Disorder Patterns from Textual Data (preprint)","Mental health disorders may cause severe consequences on all the countries' economies and health. For example, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as isolation and travel ban, can make us feel depressed. Identifying early signs of mental health disorders is vital. For example, depression may increase an individual's risk of suicide. The state-of-the-art research in identifying mental disorder patterns from textual data, uses hand-labelled training sets, especially when a domain expert's knowledge is required to analyse various symptoms. This task could be time-consuming and expensive. To address this challenge, in this paper, we study and analyse the various clinical and non-clinical approaches to identifying mental health disorders. We leverage the domain knowledge and expertise in cognitive science to build a domain-specific Knowledge Base (KB) for the mental health disorder concepts and patterns. We present a weaker form of supervision by facilitating the generating of training data from a domain-specific Knowledge Base (KB). We adopt a typical scenario for analysing social media to identify major depressive disorder symptoms from the textual content generated by social users. We use this scenario to evaluate how our knowledge-based approach significantly improves the quality of results.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Towards+Knowledge-based+Mining+of+Mental+Disorder+Patterns+from+Textual+Data+(preprint)","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35010,""
"Key Lessons Learned from COVID-19 Intra-Action Reviews in the Republic of Moldova, Montenegro, Kosovo* and North Macedonia 2020â€“2021 (preprint)","Background: WHO developed the intra-action review (IAR) methodology to support countries in reviewing their coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic response through reflection and sharing of perceptions. Our study describes how the WHO IAR methodology was operationalized and customized in three Western Balkan countries and territories and the Republic of Moldova and what were the common key findings to inform analyses of the lessons learned from the pandemic response. Methods: IARs were conducted in the Republic of Moldova, Montenegro, Kosovo and the Republic of North Macedonia between December 2020 and November 2021. We extracted data from the respective IAR reports and performed thematic content analysis to identify common (between countries and territories) and cross-cutting (across the response pillars) themes on best practices, challenges and priority actions brought up by the involved experts. Results: The IARs were conducted at different time points relative to the respective pandemic trajectories (14-day incidence rate ranging from 23 to 495Â per 100Â 000). The number of reviewed pillars (technical areas/capacities) ranged from two to nine, based on country requests. The case management pillar was reviewed in all the IARs, while the infection prevention and control, surveillance and country-level coordination pillars were reviewed in three countries. The thematic content analysis identified four common and cross-cutting best practices, seven challenges and six priority recommendations. Recommendations included investing in sustainable human resources and technical capacities developed during the pandemic, providing continuous capacity-building and training (with regular simulation exercises), updating legislation, improving communication between health-care providers at all levels of health care, and enhancing digitalization of health information systems. Conclusions: The IARs provided an opportunity for continuous collective reflection and learning with multisectoral engagement. They also offered an opportunity to review public health emergency preparedness and response functions in general, thereby contributing to generic health systems strengthening and resilience beyond COVID-19. However, follow-up of actions are essential. Success in strengthening the response and preparedness requires leadership and resource allocation, prioritization and commitment by the countries and territories themselves. *All references to Kosovo in this document should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Key+Lessons+Learned+from+COVID-19+Intra-Action+Reviews+in+the+Republic+of+Moldova,+Montenegro,+Kosovo*+and+North+Macedonia+2020â€“2021+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35011,""
"Mobile Mental Health Apps: Alternative Intervention or Intrusion? (preprint)","Mental health is an extremely important subject, especially in these unprecedented times of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ubiquitous mobile phones can equip users to supplement psychiatric treatment and manage their mental health. Mobile Mental Health (MMH) apps emerge as an effective alternative to assist with a broad range of psychological disorders filling the much-needed patient-provider accessibility gap. However, it also raises significant concerns with sensitive information leakage.The absence of a transparent privacy policy and lack of user awareness may pose a significant threat to undermining the applicability of such tools. We conducted a multifold study of - 1) Privacy Policies (Manually and with Polisis, an automated framework to evaluate privacy policies);2) App permissions;3) Static Analysis for inherent security issues;4) Dynamic Analysis for threat surface and vulnerabilities detection, and 5) Traffic Analysis. Our results indicate that apps' exploitable flaws, dangerous permissions, and insecure data handling pose a potential threat to the users' privacy and security. The Dynamic analysis identified 145 vulnerabilities in 20 top-rated MMH apps where attackers and malicious apps can access sensitive information. 45% of MMH apps use a unique identifier, Hardware Id, which can link a unique id to a particular user and probe users' mental health. Traffic analysis shows that sensitive mental health data can be leaked through insecure data transmission. MMH apps need better scrutiny and regulation for more widespread usage to meet the increasing need for mental health care without being intrusive to the already vulnerable population.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Mobile+Mental+Health+Apps:+Alternative+Intervention+or+Intrusion?+(preprint)","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35012,""
"AABAC -- Automated Attribute Based Access Control for Genomics Data (preprint)","The COVID-19 crisis has demonstrated the potential of cutting-edge genomics research. However, privacy of these sensitive pieces of information is an area of significant concern for genomics researchers. The current security models makes it difficult to create flexible and automated data sharing frameworks. These models also increases the complexity of adding or revoking access without contacting the data publisher. In this work, we investigate an automated attribute-based access control (AABAC) model for genomics data over Named Data Networking (NDN). AABAC secures the data itself rather than the storage location or transmission channel, provides automated data invalidation, and automates key retrieval and data validation while maintaining the ability to control access. We show that AABC when combined with NDN provide a secure and flexible combination for work with genomics research.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=AABAC+--+Automated+Attribute+Based+Access+Control+for+Genomics+Data+(preprint)","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35013,""
"Extended Reality for Anxiety and Depression Therapy amidst Mental Disorders -- A Systematic Review (preprint)","This systematic study is aimed to investigate the implementation level of different extended reality (XR) techniques in the care of mental disorder. We point out some XR technologies used to deliver care for mental disorders, and to evaluate the effectiveness of using XR systems for anxiety and depression amidst other mental disorders. A search period of May 2017 and August 2021 was defined to filter out articles related to the usage of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (AR) in a mental health context. Search done on three databases namely Google Scholar, PubMED, and Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library yielded 689 articles. Also, 10 articles were recommended. Upon eligibility filtering, only 72 articles were found relevant and were utilized for the study. Results show that the 72 studies were done in only 23 countries across the globe, with the majority of studies being reported for developed countries such as USA (20.64%) and Germany (11.11%). Thus this could rapidly aid intervention of mental health disorder with XR. Meanwhile, none of the studies observed was from an African country. The majority of the articles reported that XR techniques led to significant reduction in symptoms of anxiety or depression. The majority of studies (23, 36.51%) were published in the year 2021 of the total studies included. In a sense, this data might be attributed to COVID-19 pandemic. Most studies (30, 47.62%) focused a population with age range of 18 to 65 years, while fewer studies (4, 6.35%) focused on each of adolescents (10 - 19 years) and seniors (over 64 years). Also, more studies were done experimentally (52, 82.54%) rather than by analytical and modeling approach (5, 7.94%) as found in other XR studies domain.

"Framework for Behavioral Disorder Detection Using Machine Learning and Application of Virtual Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)","In this modern world, people are becoming more self-centered and unsocial. On the other hand, people are stressed, becoming more anxious during COVID-19 pandemic situation and exhibits symptoms of behavioral disorder. To measure the symptoms of behavioral disorder, usually psychiatrist use long hour sessions and inputs from specific questionnaire. This process is time consuming and sometime is ineffective to detect the right behavioral disorder. Also, reserved people sometime hesitate to follow this process. We have created a digital framework which can detect behavioral disorder and prescribe virtual Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (vCBT) for recovery. By using this framework people can input required data that are highly responsible for the three behavioral disorders namely depression, anxiety and internet addiction. We have applied machine learning technique to detect specific behavioral disorder from samples. This system guides the user with basic understanding and treatment through vCBT from anywhere any time which would potentially be the steppingstone for the user to be conscious and pursue right treatment.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Framework+for+Behavioral+Disorder+Detection+Using+Machine+Learning+and+Application+of+Virtual+Cognitive+Behavioral+Therapy+in+COVID-19+Pandemic+(preprint)","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35015,""

"Disparities in greenspace access during COVID-19 mobility restrictions (preprint)","More than half of the human population lives in cities meaning that most people predominantly experience nature in urban greenspace. Nature exposure is an important contributor to social, mental and physical health. As the world faces a pandemic which threatens the physical and mental health of billions of people, it is crucial to understand that all have the possibility to access nature exposure to alleviate some of these challenges. Here, for the first time, we integrate data from Facebook, Twitter, and Google Search users to show that people looked for greenspace during COVID-19 mobility restrictions but may not have always managed to reach it. People spent more time in areas with greenspace when they could and that depended on the level of multiple deprivation in the neighbourhood where the greenspace was embedded. Importantly, while people sought greenspace throughout the first 20 months of the pandemic, this preference intensified through the waves of lockdown. Living in an affluent area conferred a greenspace advantage in London and Paris but we find that in Berlin more deprived neighbourhoods sought greenspace more, including outside their neighbourhood. This highlights the need to understand how greenspace access and deprivation interact to create more sustainable communities.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Disparities+in+greenspace+access+during+COVID-19+mobility+restrictions+(preprint)","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35017,""
"An Economic Analysis of Indian Emigrants in Saudi Arabia during COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)","The current pandemic of Covid-19 has not only changed the life style of billions of persons in the world but also severely disturbed their livelihood. Travel ban and business restrictions has frozen the movement of people, changed the occupational status and consumption pattern of people in almost every country. India is leading country to supply labour ( around 18 million ) in the world and top remittances receiving country globally from 2008 to 2020-21 and Saudi Arabia is third largest remittances source country in the world. The oil boom of 1970s in the Gulf countries increased the demand for unskilled and semiskilled labour. Majority of the skilled or semi-skilled labour were supplied to the Gulf countries from southern state of India like Kerala or Tamil Nadu and unskilled or semi-skilled labour had been supplied from northern states of India like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The migrants or the refugees in any society agonized the most during any pandemic, hence it is essential to analyze the economic impact of Indian emigrants in Saudi Arabia during the Coronavirus disease. This study is quantitative in nature and based on both primary and secondary data. The sample of 100 unskilled or semi-skilled labour were collected through a structured questionnaire. 60 samples of migrants from Uttar Pradesh and 40 samples of migrants from Bihar were collected through multi-stage sampling technique in the month of March-April 2021. The study has confirmed that remittances and earnings of the migrants had been negatively affected during COVID-19. The loss of earnings and spread of Coronavirus in their native place had a severe mental impact on the migrants.

"Stock Trading Optimization through Model-based Reinforcement Learning with Resistance Support Relative Strength (preprint)","Reinforcement learning (RL) is gaining attention by more and more researchers in quantitative finance as the agent-environment interaction framework is aligned with decision making process in many business problems. Most of the current financial applications using RL algorithms are based on model-free method, which still faces stability and adaptivity challenges. As lots of cutting-edge model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) algorithms mature in applications such as video games or robotics, we design a new approach that leverages resistance and support (RS) level as regularization terms for action in MBRL, to improve the algorithm's efficiency and stability. From the experiment results, we can see RS level, as a market timing technique, enhances the performance of pure MBRL models in terms of various measurements and obtains better profit gain with less riskiness. Besides, our proposed method even resists big drop (less maximum drawdown) during COVID-19 pandemic period when the financial market got unpredictable crisis. Explanations on why control of resistance and support level can boost MBRL is also investigated through numerical experiments, such as loss of actor-critic network and prediction error of the transition dynamical model. It shows that RS indicators indeed help the MBRL algorithms to converge faster at early stage and obtain smaller critic loss as training episodes increase.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Stock+Trading+Optimization+through+Model-based+Reinforcement+Learning+with+Resistance+Support+Relative+Strength+(preprint)","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35019,""

"The Problem of Semantic Shift in Longitudinal Monitoring of Social Media: A Case Study on Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)","Social media allows researchers to track societal and cultural changes over time based on language analysis tools. Many of these tools rely on statistical algorithms which need to be tuned to specific types of language. Recent studies have shown the absence of appropriate tuning, specifically in the presence of semantic shift, can hinder robustness of the underlying methods. However, little is known about the practical effect this sensitivity may have on downstream longitudinal analyses. We explore this gap in the literature through a timely case study: understanding shifts in depression during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that inclusion of only a small number of semantically-unstable features can promote significant changes in longitudinal estimates of our target outcome. At the same time, we demonstrate that a recently-introduced method for measuring semantic shift may be used to proactively identify failure points of language-based models and, in turn, improve predictive generalization.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Problem+of+Semantic+Shift+in+Longitudinal+Monitoring+of+Social+Media:+A+Case+Study+on+Mental+Health+During+the+COVID-19+Pandemic+(preprint)","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35022,""
"Risk, Resilience and Reward: Impacts of Shifting to Digital Sex Work (preprint)","Workers from a variety of industries rapidly shifted to remote work at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. While existing work has examined the impact of this shift on office workers, little work has examined how shifting from in-person to online work affected workers in the informal labor sector. We examine the impact of shifting from in-person to online-only work on a particularly marginalized group of workers: sex workers. Through 34 qualitative interviews with sex workers from seven countries in the Global North, we examine how a shift to online-only sex work impacted: (1) working conditions, (2) risks and protective behaviors, and (3) labor rewards. We find that online work offers benefits to sex workers' financial and physical well-being. However, online-only work introduces new and greater digital and mental health risks as a result of the need to be publicly visible on more platforms and to share more explicit content. From our findings we propose design and platform governance suggestions for digital sex workers and for informal workers more broadly, particularly those who create and sell digital content.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Risk,+Resilience+and+Reward:+Impacts+of+Shifting+to+Digital+Sex+Work+(preprint)","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35023,""
"Does Chess Play Habit Improve Mental Health Conditions in the COVID-19 Pandemic? ~ An Assessment through the DASS Index among Indians (preprint)","Background and Aim: The COVID-19 pandemic has created the most vulnerable health situation, forcing it to change the lives of billions. The main aim of this study is to evaluate the difference in mental health conditions between a chess-playing and non-chess-playing (control) group to determine the positive impacts of the game. Methods: 400 participants were selected for the study (cases=100, controls=300) during the second wave of COVID-19 in India. An individual with a record of playing chess was included in the case group, while anyone who does not play chess was chosen as the control. This was a voluntary study wherein self-administered google forms were used as questionnaires to obtain data. Internal consistency, categorical analysis using Pearson Chi-Square Test at 95% confidence, t-test for the mean difference of DASS scores, and odds ratio at 95% confidence intervals were assessed. Results: Internal consistency of the DASS index was high, with Cronbach's alphas of 0.9103 and 0.9443, respectively, for the chess-playing and control groups. Categorical analysis revealed that regularity and intensity had no association in alleviating mental health situations but reduced the risk of mental health deterioration among chess players (OR= 0.3628;95% CI 0.166-0.789). Independent t-tests revealed significantly lower DASS scores for the chess-playing group concerning depression and total DASS index. Conclusion: This study has generated preliminary evidence and calls for further research to understand the extent of this positive outcome. Enough evidence in this regard would appeal to the popularization and extensive coverage of chess.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Does+Chess+Play+Habit+Improve+Mental+Health+Conditions+in+the+COVID-19+Pandemic?+~+An+Assessment+through+the+DASS+Index+among+Indians+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35024,""

"OMAD: On-device Mental Anomaly Detection for Substance and Non-Substance Users (preprint)","Stay at home order during the COVID-19 helps flatten the curve but ironically, instigate mental health problems among the people who have Substance Use Disorders. Measuring the electrical activity signals in brain using off-the-shelf consumer wearable devices such as smart wristwatch and mapping them in real time to underlying mood, behavioral and emotional changes play striking roles in postulating mental health anomalies. In this work, we propose to implement a wearable, {\it On-device Mental Anomaly Detection (OMAD)} system to detect anomalous behaviors and activities that render to mental health problems and help clinicians to design effective intervention strategies. We propose an intrinsic artifact removal model on Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal to better correlate the fine-grained behavioral changes. We design model compression technique on the artifact removal and activity recognition (main) modules. We implement a magnitude-based weight pruning technique both on convolutional neural network and Multilayer Perceptron to employ the inference phase on Nvidia Jetson Nano;one of the tightest resource-constrained devices for wearables. We experimented with three different combinations of feature extractions and artifact removal approaches. We evaluate the performance of {\it OMAD} in terms of accuracy, F1 score, memory usage and running time for both unpruned and compressed models using EEG data from both control and treatment (alcoholic) groups for different object recognition tasks. Our artifact removal model and main activity detection model achieved about $\approx$ 93\% and 90\% accuracy, respectively with significant reduction in model size (70\%) and inference time (31\%).","","https://www.google.com/search?q=OMAD:+On-device+Mental+Anomaly+Detection+for+Substance+and+Non-Substance+Users+(preprint)","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35026,""
"The Burden of Being a Bridge: Analysing Subjective Well-Being of Twitter Users during the COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)","The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic triggers infodemic over online social media, which significantly impacts public health around the world, both physically and psychologically. In this paper, we study the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of influential social media users, whose sharing behaviours significantly promote the diffusion of COVID-19 related information. Specifically, we focus on subjective well-being (SWB), and analyse whether SWB changes have a relationship with their bridging performance in information diffusion, which measures the speed and wideness gain of information transmission due to their sharing. We accurately capture users' bridging performance by proposing a new measurement. Benefiting from deep-learning natural language processing models, we quantify social media users' SWB from their textual posts. With the data collected from Twitter for almost two years, we reveal the greater mental suffering of influential users during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through comprehensive hierarchical multiple regression analysis, we are the first to discover the strong {relationship} between social users' SWB and their bridging performance.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Burden+of+Being+a+Bridge:+Analysing+Subjective+Well-Being+of+Twitter+Users+during+the+COVID-19+Pandemic+(preprint)","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35027,""

To complete this program, students apply and deepen the knowledge acquired in their previous levels of training. An analysis of the situation of intern nursing students during the pandemic caused by SARs CoV2 is presented. The regulations for the development of the internship were analyzed, evidencing educational gaps in biosafety matters and it became necessary to reorient the current regulations for the realization of the rotating internship and other clinical practices in terms of the functions of the interns and the obligations of the establishments of Health. It is concluded that the rotating nursing internship program must be reviewed and analyzed to prevent students from risking their physical and mental health in practice, for this, the Ministry of Public Health of Ecuador and the universities must reorient inter-institutional agreements towards the health care and optimal training of future professionals.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Nursing+Internship+in+COVID-19+Times+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35028,""
"Stress/Depression Across the COVID-19 Pandemic in Denmark (preprint)","Background: Global estimates suggest strained mental health during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the lack of nationally representative and longitudinal data with clinically validated measures limits knowledge longer into the pandemic. Methods: Data from 10 rounds of nationally representative surveys from Denmark tracked trends in risk of stress/depression from just before the first lockdown and through to April 2022. We focused on age groups and men and women in different living arrangements, and controlled for seasonality in mental health that could otherwise be spuriously related to pandemic intensity. Findings: Older respondents (+70 years) experienced increasing risks of stress/depression early in the pandemic, while all other groups experienced decreases. But longer into the pandemic, risks increased for all age groups and reached (and sometimes exceeded) pre-pandemic levels. Prior to first lockdown, we observed a 'parent gap', which closed with the first lockdown. Instead, a gender gap materialized, with women experiencing higher risks than menâ€”and higher than pre-pandemic levels. Interpretation: Denmark had low infection rates throughout most of the pandemic, low mortality rates across the entire pandemic, and offered financial aide packages to curb financial strains. Despite this circumstance, initial improvements to mental health during the first lockdown in Denmark were short-lived. Two years of pandemic societal restrictions correspond with deteriorating mental health. This deterioration especially holds for Danish women.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Stress/Depression+Across+the+COVID-19+Pandemic+in+Denmark+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35029,""
"Mental Health Pandemic during the COVID-19 Outbreak: Calls for Help on Social Media (preprint)","Heightened social isolation during the COVID-19 outbreak puts individuals at greater risks of loneliness (Bu et al., 2020) where elevated levels of loneliness are closely associated with depression (Killgore et al., 2020;Palgi et al., 2020;Weeks et al., 1980). Prior research has suggested that lonely individuals are more likely to seek mental health help from an online social platform (e.g., Reddit), a perceived comfortable environment for lonely people to seek mental health support through anonymous communication with a broad social network (Andy, 2021;Bonetti et al., 2010;Morahan-Martin et al., 2003). Therefore, this study aims to identify and analyze depression-related dialogues on loneliness subreddits during the COVID-19 outbreak, with the impact on depression-related infoveillance during the pandemic. With the collected data using Reddit API, our study utilized logistic regression and topic modeling to classify and examine depression related discussions on loneliness subreddits during the outbreak. Our results reveal that lonely individuals engaging in depression-related discussions are likely to be experiencing elevated risks of mental health problems and domestic issues, higher level of relationship seeking, and heightened need of social support. Furthermore, the results suggest an increase in dog adoption as a coping behavior and challenges in the online learning environment. Finally, returning users disclose and seek information on triggering factors of mental health problems, indicating the significance of peer-to-peer mental health support on loneliness subreddits. Our future work will clinically validate the current approach, which has implications on designing surveillance system during the crisis.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Mental+Health+Pandemic+during+the+COVID-19+Outbreak:+Calls+for+Help+on+Social+Media+(preprint)","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35030,""
"The Prevalence of Emotional Distress among Athletes during COVID-19 Movement Control Order Period in Malaysia","Background. The outbreak of Coronavirus-19 or COVID-19 has detrimental effects on the sports industry. Cancellation of sports training and competitions, movement restriction, and social isolation present an emotional challenge for athletes. Objectives. This cross-sectional study examined the prevalence of emotional distress among athletes during the MCO of Covid-19 in Malaysia Methods. 224 male and 264 female athletes participated in this study in May 2020. The majority of the participants were archers (20.7%), followed by athletics (12.9), netball (8.4%), and badminton (6.6%). An online survey was employed, which consists of three measures: (a) demographic information, (b) Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale -21, and (c) Kessler Psychological Distress Scale - 10. Results. The results indicated that 7.2% (N=35) of the participants reported severe to extremely severe stress, 20.5% (N=100) of participants experienced severe to extremely severe anxiety, and 10% (N=49) participants reported severe to extremely severe depression. Moreover, Chi-Square analysis revealed no significant differences between the level of stress, anxiety, and depression based on age, gender, and category of sports (individual vs. team sports), except for gender and depression (X-2 (4, N=488) = 12.18, P= 0.016). More female athletes reported severe depression (20.3%) compared to male athletes (13.4%). Conclusion. This finding suggests further assessment, monitoring, and treatment plan for athletes, especially female athletes, to ensure their mental health and emotional wellbeing during this Covid-19 pandemic.","Txi, M.

"Telemedicine interventions in the management of diabetes mellitus in special epidemiological conditions","The COVID-19 pandemic, an unprecedented epidemiological context, has brought multiple swift changes in public policies, healthcare facilities and the daily life of individuals worldwide. While the management of infections with SARS-CoV-2 has become a priority in most medical settings, a drastic reduction in the outpatient visits for non-communicable diseases, an avoidance of hospitals and also a limitation in non-urgent medical appointments with delayed diagnosis and treatment have been reported. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a lifelong condition that requires continuous non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions to achieve and maintain adequate control of glycemic levels and of other cardiovascular risk factors. The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to increased difficulty in patientsâ€™ access to state-of-the-art diabetes care, a situation that has found its solution through the inclusion of telemedicine into routine clinical practice. These interventions have been shown to improve glycemic control, mental health, and the communication between patients with DM and their healthcare providers, while also lowering the risk of potential infections with SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this review is to describe the epidemiological context that has led to the increased usage of telemedicine in diabetes and the diversity and benefits of these interventions.","Patrascu, R.; Gaita, L.; Braha, A.; Albai, A.; Lazar, S.; Timar, B.","https://doi.org/10.46389/rjd-2022-1081","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Romanian Journal of Diabetes, Nutrition and Metabolic Diseases; 29(1):104-109, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35032,""
"Locked Up and Locked Down: How the Covid-19 Pandemic has Impacted the Mental Health of Male Prisoners and Support Staff","Background: The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on prisons across the world has been of much concern due to the increased risk of virus spread among a particularly vulnerable population. Efforts made to prevent spread of the virus have resulted in a range of restrictive measures with the aim of reducing contact between prisoners and staff. Unfortunately, restrictions have also resulted in increased time confined to cells, reduced occupation, and restricted access to services. The potential impact of this on a population that already presents with high rates of mental health difficulties requires consideration. Male prisoners may be at particularly high risk of experiencing negative outcomes. Methods: This study evaluated the impact of the pandemic and related changes upon the mental health of prisoners and staff within a male urban prison in the United Kingdom. A mixed methods approach with a convergent parallel design was used. Correlational and feature selection analysis was conducted on quantitative data. Qualitative data were subject to a thematic analysis. Findings were integrated at the point of summary and interpretation. Results: Prisoners and staff reported finding it hard to cope with changes and stressors associated with the pandemic. For prisoners, time spent locked in one???s cell with limited access to activities and support was associated with poor mental health outcomes, and salient themes emerged of feeling trapped, isolated and neglected. For staff, concerns about prisoner welfare and worry about catching the virus was associated with increased anxiety and worry. Additionally finding it hard to cope with constant changes at work and reduced staffing resulted in unhealthy coping behaviours such as drinking and smoking. Conclusions: Findings suggest that the implementation of additional restrictions, within the already restricted prison environment, has had a significant negative impact on the mental health of both prisoners and staff. The potential long-term mental health difficulties resulting from this require further investigation, as does the likely negative impact on staff wellbeing and staff turnover. The effects of the pandemic appear to have heightened an already desperate need to consider the mental health and wellbeing of prisoners and prison","Kothari, R.; Sparrow, J.; Henshall, J.; Buchan, D.; Kemp, J.; Owen, A.; Blakeman, I.; Sarkissian, N.","https://doi.org/10.31083/j.jomh1806141","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Mens Health;: 25, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35033,""

"Cognitive and Neuropsychiatric Manifestations of COVID-19 in elderly people with and without dementia: A literature review","During the severe acute respiratory syndrome due to the COVID-19 pandemic, dementia has been identified as disproportionately common in elderly people than 65 years who develop a serious viral infection. Data from the International Consortium on Severe and Emerging Acute Respiratory Infections confirmed a high prevalence of dementia in elderly people hospitalized. Dementia is likely to be associated with a variety of comorbidities, in particular, frailty, which can further exacerbate the risk of serious infection. In addition, up to a third of patients with COVID-19 have demonstrated cerebral/neurological sequelae with direct (brain infection, vascular effects) and indirect (host immune response, treatment impact) effects. It is possible that the infection may accentuate any pre-existing neurodegenerative disease. Several studies have described cognitive decline, depressed mood, anxiety, insomnia, and post-traumatic stress disorder in a proportion of patients after discharge. Therefore, chronic illnesses, such as dementia, can be associated with higher hospitalization and mortality rates, and may exacerbate the vulnerability of elderly people and the breakdown of their caregivers.","BombÃ³n-AlbÃ¡n, P.

"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Gambling","Introduction. Gambling is a well-known social issue, which seems to address immediate needs of a large portion of population in the entire world. Throughout various periods of curfews enacted by the medical authorities, the society experiences various challenges, a fact that puts a great amount of psychological pressure on gamblers and their families, that is rather difficult to he asssessed. Aim. The presentation seeks to assess the effects of anti-pandemic social measures, especially those imposed after March 2020, on mental wellfare and behaviour of bettors. By assessing the intentions and measures related to sport competitions in the near future, we tried to identify the overall impact on pending routines and lifestyle from any available data. Materials and method. The paper found sources in the psychological and medical literature in order to identify spending routines of bettors and pathological behaviours, as expressed in DSM-5. The paper also discusses the factors introduced into society by coronavirus and the restrictions that accompanied the phenomenon of gambling. Sources from the international media are used to assess the intended measures upon gambling industry and the possible general impact on the mental health of the Romanian population. Results. The changes of some social routines, imposed upon population in the context of coronavirus, are simply supposed to be accompanied by increases in depression and anxiety. The new economic and societal challenges bring with them the risk of increasing mental health disturbances among the gamblers. Conclusion. Worldwide gambling spending has decreased during the pandemic. Various attempts of assessing whether this is a bad phenomenon or not should take into consideration the amount of money left in the economy by these measures, the unpaid taxes from a reduced activity in gambling, the psychiatric impact upon diagnosed gamblers. New lockdowns imposed on the population are possible in the near future, so better ways to deal with the impact upon gamblers are necessary.","Dinu, B.; Vlad, C.; Balan, G.; Luca, L.; Bichescu, C.

"Social Resets and Suicides during Covid-19 Pandemic","Introduction. Well-known as a public health problem, suicide is known to cause many deaths during periods of economic and social unrest. Through the social changes imposed by the political and medical actors, the society knows old challenges, but also some completely new ones, which seem to influence the suicidal behavior among the population. Aim. The paper tries to present the effects of anti-Covid-19 social measures, especially those decided by the Romanian authorities between March 2020 and March 2021, on mental health and suicidal behavior. Also, by assessing the public polity intentions expressed publicly in European leadership circles for the medium-term future, we wanted to identify the impact on lifestyle and suicidal behaviour. Materials and method. The paper uses the medical literature in order to identify traditional or new risk factors for suicide, introduced into society by SARS-Cov-2 and the social restrictions that accompanied it. Also, sources from the domestic and international media are used to evaluate the future announced social resets and the possible impact on the suicidal behavior among the Romanian population. Results. The feeling of induced fear and the change of some social routines, imposed by the political factors in the context of the Covid-19 virus, are supposed to he accompanied by increases in the suicide rate. The new economic challenges and social antagonisms, predictable for the near future, bring with them the risk of increasing suicidal behavior among the world's population and Romania. Conclusion. In various countries, suicide rates have risen during the pandemic. New social measures are announced in authoritarian tones, with no intention of assessing the impact on the mental health of the population. Me implementation of these innovative measures should be done only after balancing the psychological and psychiatric impact.

"Is it possible that our generation will deal a new pandemic caused by another Coronavirus?","The current COVID-19 pandemic was induced by the emergence of a coronavirus from an animal as a reservoir. Thus, it is of great importance to know how the evolution of these viral agents occurs in the nature. In this article, the main mechanisms associated with the evolution of coronaviruses were presented, indicating the animal species that act as reservoirs or evolutionary hosts, the viral genetic mechanisms involved in the generation of viral variants, the contribution of human actions to generate recombinant coronaviruses with pandemic potential. From the points discussed in the article, we conclude that the generation of new coronaviruses can be avoided with the implementation of public policies that propose health actions and thus there will only be human health if there is environmental health and animal health.","Miller, M.

"Social Distancing Covid 19: Impact on Working Professionalsâ€™","The paper attempts to investigate the psychological and physical risks of social distancing on people. Mental health professionals unanimously agree that the quarantine imposed on more than a billion people around the world because of the Corona virus pandemic is neither easy nor a matter to be underestimated, as it is an exceptional and unprecedented measure that restricts individual freedoms even in democratic areas. This situation causes psychological problems for many people, especially for those who fail to deal positively with this issue. Being confined between the walls of the home for several days or weeks as a result of the quarantine is unusual for the general public except in exceptional circumstances, which in many cases causes severe psychological effects, requiring follow-up and treatment by specialists. The methodology used in this study is descriptive field study, which implements multi-disciplinary approach. A questionnaire is administered among professionals to explore the impact of social distancing on their life.","Ashifa, K.

"Cross-sectional Study of College Students' Depression, Coping Techniques, and Health Risk Behaviors during the Initial Transition to Remote Learning: COVID-19 Pandemic","Objective: COVID-19 has brought many challenges to college campuses. In this cross-sectional study, we assessed depression, coping, and past 30-day health risk behaviors of college students attending a mid-sized liberal arts university in Florida. Methods: We sent a survey link to all undergraduates. The data, which included depression scores (PHQ-9), coping techniques (Brief COPE), health risk behaviors (alcohol and vape use) and demographics were collected approximately 40 days after the university transitioned from face-to-face to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. We used descriptive and regression analyses using SPSS to analyze data. Results: A total 45.6% of the respondents (N = 759) self-reported moderate to severe depression (PHQ-9 mean = 9.96, SD = 6.2). Students indicated positive and negative coping strategies. Alcohol and vape use increased with higher depressive symptoms scores (p &lt; 0.01). Seniors had a greater odds of alcohol consumption (p &lt; .01);however, freshmen and juniors had greater odds of vape use. Our data revealed some opportunities for positive behavior change. Conclusion: The online transition did modify students' behaviors. Students who self-reported depressive symptoms were most vulnerable to adopting greater risk behaviors. These students require ongoing monitoring and resources. Colleges should implement rapid assessment of students' depressive status and risk behaviors during volatile times.","Loi, C. X.

"Concerns, attitudes and comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic impact on the mental state of medical and nonmedical employees","Aim. The aim of this study is to compare the manifestation of anxiety and depressive disorders as well as attempt to identify factors influencing their occurrence among healthcare system employees and nonmedical staff. Method. A survey was conducted with participation of 921 people using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - Modified (HADS-M) and a survey prepared to assess the attitudes of the respondents towards the epidemic. Results. The obtained results allow to state that the examined groups do not differ in the level of perceived anxiety or the level of depression, however, they had different attitudes towards the epidemic. A number of factors increasing the risk of occurrence of these disorders have been identified. Among medical professions, nurses are the professional group particularly vulnerable to anxiety disorders. Conclusions. The epidemic has a significant impact on human mental well-being. Recognizing the factors increasing the risk of mental disorders and their prevalence during an epidemic can help identify individuals who are particularly at risk of developing them. The knowledge resulting from empirical explorations is the basis for implementing preventive and therapeutic measures among people affected by mental disorders during the pandemic.","Podwalski, P.; Szczygiel, K.; Tyburski, E.; Samochowiec, A.; Samochowiec, J.","https://doi.org/10.12740/pp/127006","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatria Polska; 56(2):277-288, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35044,""

"Severe Retroperitoneal Hemorrhage in a COVID-19 Patient on a Therapeutic Dose of Low Molecular Weight Heparin: A Case Report","Extensive drug treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) includes low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). At therapeutic doses of LMWH, there is an increased risk of bleeding complications. Spontaneous, non-traumatic bleeding into the retroperitoneum is a life-threatening condition that can progress very rapidly. We describe a complication of COVID-19 bronchopneumonia treatment in which a patient developed a shock condition caused by non-traumatic bleeding into the retroperitoneum and abdominal wall due to LMWH overdose. The patient was operated on under difficult conditions - in biosafety level 3 (BSL-3). This case is exceptionally fascinating and informative. Nowadays, it is essential to point out possible complications associated with the treatment of COVID-19. Based on this report, we emphasize the need for careful LMWH dosing and quick and accurate diagnosis. Surgeons should maintain a higher index of suspicion for spontaneous bleeding in non-specific abdominal pain patients with COVID-19 or patients receiving therapeutic doses of LMWH.","Dubovsky, M.; Hajska, M.; Panyko, A.; Vician, M.","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.26275","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Cureus Journal of Medical Science; 14(6):8, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35046,""
"Saffron for mood improvement in children and adolescents: a narrative review","Depressive and anxious disorders could be experienced by children and adolescents worldwide and are associated with psychiatric syndromes diagnosed in adulthood. In this context, the COVID-19 outbreak and digital media arising use have worsened mental conditions in the pediatric population. Older adolescents, girls, and patients living with neurodiversity and/or chronic physical conditions are more likely to develop negative mental health outcomes. Crocus sativus L. (saffron) is a medicinal plant whose most biologically relevant components are two carotenoids (crocin and crocetin) and two apocarotenoids (picrocrocin and safranal). Crocin seems to inhibit the uptake of dopamine and norepinephrine, while safranal inhibits the serotonin reuptake;in vitro and in animal models, crocin also displayed neuroprotective abilities, increasing the intracellular levels of neurotrophic factors. Further studies are required to strengthen these results;however, multiple studies have already demonstrated significant positive effects of saffron on psychiatric disorders - including depression and anxiety in young patients. Saffron administration appears to reduce depression symptoms and to strengthen antidepressant effects of current drugs (fluoxetine), also lowering adverse events of these therapies. Consequently, saffron could have an important role as a complementary therapy for depressive and anxious disorders in children and teenagers.","Trapani, G.; Maiocco, G.; Spadavecchia, A.","https://doi.org/10.7363/110222","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Pediatric and Neonatal Individualized Medicine; 11(2):5, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35047,""

"Adapting PCIT-Health for Telehealth Delivery: A Case Study","During the COVID-19 pandemic, children's physical health and access to mental health resources have been two critical concerns. Parent-Child Interaction Therapy-Health (PCIT-Health) is a treatment model aimed at helping parents manage children's general behavior and their behavior in obesogenic contexts (screen time and mealtime). Due to social distancing guidelines, PCIT-Health was adapted for remote delivery through video conferencing. In this article, we describe the experience of implementing virtual PCIT-Health with a family. The family's progress through treatment is described, along with the challenges associated with remote service delivery and how those challenges were addressed. Progress through treatment was measured with questionnaires administered to caregivers and with observational measures of parent-child interactions. The results from these measures indicate that caregivers experienced a reduction in stress and improvements in their child's behavior after PCIT-Health completion. They also reported engaging in healthier management of their child's screen time and mealtime behaviors. As coded from observational assessments, parents increased their use of positive parenting practices. Telehealth-delivered PCIT-Health is a promising treatment modality for increasing parenting skills and improving child behavior.","Domoff, Sarah E.; Overton, Mikaela M.; Borgen, Aubrey L.; Niec, Larissa N.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19148352","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(14):8352, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35056,""

We constructed an ad-hoc narrative interview asking nurses to narrate the memory, and the associated emotion, of an event in which they felt they could not do the right thing for the patient. We conducted a theory-driven analysis, using the categories proposed by the literature, identifying the main emotion for each category. Results show that 36 memories of events are representative of moral distress;among these, 7 are representative of none of the categories considered, and we categorized them as moral compromise. The main emotional trajectories are powerlessness, worthlessness, anger, sadness, guilt, and helplessness. From a clinical psychological point of view, our findings highlight the narration of the memories of moral events as a tool to use in the ethical sense-making of critical experiences, in order to promote well-being and moral resilience among nurses in emergency situations.","Lemmo, Daniela, Vitale, Roberta, Girardi, Carmela, Salsano, Roberta, Auriemma, Ersilia","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19148349","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(14):8349, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35057,""
"COVID-19 Pandemic Impact on Undergraduate Nursing Students: A Cross-Sectional Study","COVID-19 is a challenge for education systems around the world. This study aimed to evaluate the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on nursing students, by assessing their emotions, the level of concern in contracting the virus and their perceived stress. We conducted an observational cross-sectional study. A total of 709 nursing students completed an anonymous questionnaire. The levels of anxiety and stress were assessed using the generalized anxiety disorder scale and the COVID-19 student stress questionnaire, respectively. In total, 56.8% of the sample often or always found it difficult to attend distance-learning activities. The main difficulty referred to was connection problems (75.7%). The mean generalized anxiety disorder score was 9.46 (SD = 5.4) and appeared almost homogeneous among students across the three years of study;most of the students showed mild (35%) to moderate (27%) levels of anxiety;19% had severe anxiety. The overall COVID-19 stressor mean scores were 11.40 (SD = 6.50);the majority of the students (47.1%) showed scores indicative of moderate stress, 25% showed low stress levels, and 28% showed high-stress levels.

"Physical Activity in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension during Pandemic COVID-19 and the Potential Impact of Mental Factors","One of the non-pharmacological recommendations for stable patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is to increase physical activity. The study aimed to analyze the degree of physical activity of PAH patients and check if mental factors may have a potential negative impact during the COVID-19 pandemic. Forty patients with stable PAH were included in the study. Physical activity was assessed by pedometer (Omron HJ-321-E) for four weeks. At baseline, in addition to the 6 min walk test (6MWT) and functional assessment, patients completed the quality-of-life questionnaire SF-36, fear of COVID-19 scale, and hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS). The mean age of the study group was 45.5 years, 80% were women, and 62.5% had idiopathic/heritable PAH. Low physical activity defined as &lt;5000 steps/day had 19 (47.5%), and moderate/high physical activity (&ge;5000 steps/day) had 21 (52.5%) patients. Patients with low physical activity less frequently worked compared with the moderate&ndash;high-activity sub-group, 42% vs. 81%, p = 0.03, and had the shorter distance in 6-6MWT, p = 0.03. There was no significant correlation between steps/day and different mental factors. Almost half of the study group had low activity during the pandemic.

"Burnout in Specialized Care Nurses during the First COVID-19 Outbreak in Spain","Background: One of the most outstanding consequences of the pandemic is the impact it had on the mental health of nurses caring for patients with COVID-19 in specialised services. Aim: The aim was to analyse the burnout levels of nursing professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic in specialised care and their relationship with variables of the socio-occupational context. Method: This was a quantitative, descriptive, observational, cross-sectional study, which included a sample of 355 nursing professionals. The instrument used was a questionnaire (Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS)). Results: A mean score of 27.44 (SD = 12.01) was obtained in the subscale 'Emotional exhaustion';;in 'Depersonalisation';, the mean score was 7.26 (SD = 6.00);and, finally, in 'Personal fulfilment';, the mean score was 38.27 (SD = 7.04). Statistically significant differences were found in the subscale 'Emotional exhaustion';, which is higher in women than in men. The subscale 'Personal Accomplishment';was higher in the age group 51&ndash;65 years. Regarding the 'Depersonalisation';subscale, statistically significant differences were found with respect to the years of experience in the current service, which is higher in the group aged 39 years or more.

"Through the COVID-19 to Prospect Online School Learning: Voices of Students from China, Lebanon, and the US","Online learning has emerged as a widely used learning mode and will likely supplement traditional learning in the post-pandemic era. The purpose of this study is to present student voices of online school education by investigating students' online learning experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic in various contexts, and explain why the impacts are important to student learning and well-being. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with nine students from China, Lebanon, and the United States to gain direct insight into students' perceptions of each country. The results showed that the online learning environment provided at the national level, such as social conflicts, and the facilities provided at the individual level, such as information access, increase the educational inequity. High-school students experienced numerous psychological changes and encountered academic cheating issues in the home online-learning environment. We recommend that online school education should make significant improvements in pedagogy, students' mental health, and learning assessment, and consider factors beyond technology solutions.","Xu, Zhining, Pang, Jia, Chi, Jin","https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci12070472","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Education Sciences; 12(7):472, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35061,""

"The Impact of COVID-19 on Participation, Effort, Physical Activity, and Well-Being of Sea Anglers in the UK","Recreational sea angling is an important recreational activity in the United Kingdom with around 1.6% of adults participating and a total economic impact of around 1.5 pound billion each year. There are positive impacts of angling on physical health and mental well-being. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in several national lockdowns in the UK, which along with additional local restrictions and personal circumstances due to the pandemic, have impacted people's ability to fish. Angling was not allowed in the UK for some of the first lockdown (March to May 2020), and further restrictions were implemented subsequently that varied between the countries and regions. The impact of COVID-19 on the participation, effort, physical activity, and well-being of UK sea anglers remains unknown. A panel of UK sea anglers, which record their activity and catches as part of the Sea Angling Diary Project, were surveyed to assess changes in sea angling participation, physical activity, mental well-being, and expenditure between 2019 and 2020. We compared the sea angling effort and catches of the diary panel between 2019 and 2020. We found reduced sea angling effort in the panel, including sessions and catches, between 2019 and 2020, with the largest impact being in April 2020. We found that there was a significant reduction in expenditure during April 2020 with 64% of respondents spending less on sea angling than in a typical April. In total, 67% of respondents reported reduced happiness and 45% were less active due to sea angling restrictions. Using a general linear model, we found that even though anglers said that being able to go fishing has resulted in high World Health Organization Five Well-being Index scores, other factors also had significant effects. These included: age;physical and mental health status;angling activity;travel to fish during COVID-19;and whether they fished in July 2020. Of those who responded, 66% classified themselves as at either high or moderate risk to COVID-19. This work has shown that COVID-19 has negatively affected marine recreational fisheries in the UK, and not being able to go sea angling has negatively impacted participation, effort, physical activity and well-being.","Hook, S.

"Development and Evaluation of an eLearning Training Module to Improve United Kingdom Secondary School Teachers' Knowledge and Confidence in Supporting Young People Who Self-Harm","BackgroundSelf-harm is a major public health concern with evidence suggesting that the rates are higher in the United Kingdom than anywhere else in Europe. Increasingly, policy highlights the role of school staff in supporting young people (YP) who are self-harming, yet research indicates that school staff often feel ill-equipped to provide support and address self-harm behaviors. Here, we assess the impact of a bespoke eLearning module for United Kingdom secondary school teachers on teacher's actual and perceived knowledge of self-harm, and their self-reported confidence in supporting and talking to YP who self-harm. MethodsTwenty-one secondary schools across the West Midlands and South East of England were invited to complete a 30-min web-based eLearning module on self-harm in schools. Participants completed pre-and post-intervention measures. ResultsOne-hundred and seventy-three teachers completed the eLearning, and pre-and post-measures. The eLearning significantly enhanced participants' perceived knowledge, actual knowledge, and confidence in talking to and supporting YP who self-harm. The majority of participants (90.7%) felt that eLearning was a good way to receive training. ConclusionThe 30-min eLearning module was rated highly and may be an effective way to increase secondary school teachers' knowledge of self-harm, and confidence in supporting and talking to YP who self-harm.","Price, C.; Satherley, R.

"Understanding the Broader Impacts of COVID-19 on Women and Girls in the DRC through Integrated Outbreak Analytics to Reinforce Evidence for Rapid Operational Decision-Making","Whilst men and boys account for more COVID-19 cases and deaths, the secondary impacts of the outbreak on women and girls in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are cross-cutting and far-reaching. School closures put girls at increased risk of adolescent pregnancy, sexual violence and early marriage;more women working in the informal sector have lost jobs and been affected by closures of markets and borders;and frequent restrictions on sexual and reproductive healthcare have impacted access to services for women. Lessons learnt from previous health crises can help to highlight the extent of these issues. However, a lack of sex disaggregated data around COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in the DRC means that it is impossible to fully measure and understand the impact of the outbreak on women and girls or develop and implement appropriate interventions.

"Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy: Narrative Review With Relation to COVID-19","Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC) is a unique heart disease which mimics the clinical symptoms and features of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and is seen more commonly in postmenopausal females. In this condition, abnormal electrocardiographic findings like ST-segment elevation/depression, T wave inversion, and an abnormal/absence of Q wave, along with echocardiographic disturbances like regional wall motion abnormalities and a sudden decrease in the ejection fraction are observed. However, coronary angiography shows no coronary artery obstruction. Interestingly, the left ventricle in TC develops a characteristic appearance similar to that of a ?Tako-tsubo? (Japanese pot). Such peculiar observations become important when diagnosing TC in a clinical setting. TC is often caused by a catecholamine surge due to mass sympathetic activation usually preceded by an emotional/physical trigger, however the exact etiology and mechanism of pathophysiology still remain unclear. With growing awareness and prevalence of TC, it becomes crucial for clinicians to differentially diagnose TC from other heart conditions with the help of well-known diagnostic tools. Moreover, amidst the ongoing pandemic, the cytokine storm associated with COVID-19 may be accompanied with a catecholamine surge in the body, which in turn might increase the risk and incidence of TC in patients.","Kalra, Ravi, Wasir, Amanpreet Singh, Bhavsar, Aadya Sachin, Singh, Virendra Prasad, Padwal, Meghana K.","https://doi.org/10.1177/26324636221109051","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: Indian Journal of Clinical Cardiology;: 26324636221109051, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35068,""
"IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON QUALITY OF LIFE IN A NORWEGIAN STROKE COHORT","Background and aims: The implementation of interventions like closing exercise facilities and restrictions in social activities in order to minimize spreading of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, may have affected quality of life (QOL) among stroke survivors. The study aimed to assess how changes in physical activity levels, mental health, and feeling of loneliness were associated with QOL during the pandemic. Methods: A survey was conducted between March and July 2021 among the 150 first stroke patients included in an ongoing randomized controlled trial (RCT) on long-term follow-up after stroke (The LAST-LONG Trial ClincalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03859063) recruiting patients from three Norwegian hospitals at 3 months poststroke. Patients were asked to complete a questionnaire about self-reported health at inclusion or during follow-up. Univariate and multivariate binomial regression analyses were used to explore the association between physical activity, loneliness, mental health, and QOL. Results: In all, 116 (77%) patients completed the questionnaire. Median age was 74 (range 35-93) years, and 48 (41%) were female. A total of 79 (68%) reported less physical activity, 36 (31%) felt lonelier, and 43 (37%) reported worse mental health, while 49 (42%) reported reduced quality of life during the lock-down.

"Psychological Distress and Political Distrust during a Global Health Crisis: Evidence from a Cross-National Survey","In addition to causing unprecedented mortality and wreaking havoc on national economies, the coronavirus disease pandemic has significantly undermined public mental health. How has the pandemic-induced psychological and mental distress contributed to declining political trust cross-nationally? Using a large-scale global survey comprising respondents from Africa, Americas, Asia, Middle East, and Europe, the present study addresses this question. Results from multilevel analysis show that across dozens of low- as well as high-income countries, pandemic distress experienced by individuals is negatively linked with political trust (public confidence in the government?s capacity and transparency). Moreover, this relationship is conditional on alternative ?performance measures? or contextual moderators: Human Development Index, Corruption Perceptions Index, and Fragile States Index. Specifically, the magnitude of the association between pandemic distress and political distrust increases in countries that are less economically developed, perceived to be more corrupt, and politically more fragile or vulnerable.","Kim, Harris Hyun-soo","https://doi.org/10.1177/14789299221106006","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: Political Studies Review;: 14789299221106006, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35070,""

"EXPRESS: Consumer Responses to COVID Policy Across the World: The Role of Community Resilience","The authors examine the role of community resilience in consumer mental, behavioral, and attitudinal responses to policy interventions, which were implemented in response to the worldwide SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) pandemic. Three adaptive capacities (economic development, communication and information, and transformative potential) are used to capture community resilience in various geographies. Using a difference-in-difference approach in a large sample of consumers from multiple countries, which introduced such interventions in March-April 2020, we assess the moderating effect of these capacities on the strength of the impact of interventions on mental health, personal protective behavior, and perception of such policies. Our measure of COVID policy intervention reflects mandatory closure of workplaces, transportation, and schools. Significant findings include robust empirical evidence that adaptive capacities mute negative impact of COVID policy intervention on mental health. Furthermore, the policy's impact on personal protective behaviors was more substantial in countries with the higher levels of economic equality, communication spending, social engagement, and human development. Economic development and communication and information capacities strengthened the positive impact of the intervention on the perception of such policies. This research offers actionable insights on individual responses during COVID for managers, marketers, and policymakers.","Krasnikov, Alexander V.; Shultz, Clifford J.; Rebiazina, Vera A.","https://doi.org/10.1177/1069031x221115371","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of International Marketing;: 1069031X221115371, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35073,""

As a result, employees in the Covid-19 clinic are faced with problems such as fear of transmitting the infection to their families, difficulty in carrying the burden of their children, increased levels of anxiety and depression, and social and family life being affected.","Sisman, Hamide, GÃ¶kÃ§e, Esma, Akpolat, Refiye, Alptekin, Dudu, Gezer, Derya, Arslan, Sevban","https://doi.org/10.1177/0192513x221115184","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Family Issues;: 0192513X221115184, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35074,""
"Exploring the Facilitators and Barriers to Maintaining Intimate Relationships during Covid-19 through Online Photovoice Methodology","The pandemic has challenged couples and family relationships and resulted in conflict. Albeit the challenges, some positive outcomes on people may have been possibly protecting and repairing their relationships. The current study aimed to explore the potential barriers and facilitators for individuals. Online Photovoice method was applied to 118 individuals, who were in a romantic relationship. Data were analyzed using the Online Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis to identify themes. The findings revealed 16 facilitators and 13 barrier themes. Among those themes, spending more time with the loved ones, finding opportunities to develop spirituality and peace, and using technology to sustain a sense of connectedness, were the most frequently reported facilitators. On the other hand, the most expressed barriers were reported as the Covid-19 restrictions, home confinement, separation from family, and having destructive feelings. Implications for future research and mental health providers are discussed.","Genc, Emel, Tanhan, Ahmet, Kose, Ozlem","https://doi.org/10.1177/0192513x221113855","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Family Issues;: 0192513X221113855, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35075,""
"Covid-19 Outcome: A One-Year Follow-Up Study of Patients Recovered from Covid-19 Infection at Lung Center of the Philippines","Introduction: To date, the Philippines had tallied more than 3 million COVID-19 cases with 91.5% recovery rate and 1.72% mortality rate. Some patients who recovered from COVID-19 are left struggling with symptoms which persist through weeks, months and even a year.Objectives: To determine the clinical outcome after 1 year of COVID-19 recovered patients in terms of persistent symptoms, functional capacity, and survival status and their relationship with disease severity.Methods: This is a cross sectional-analytical study. Subjects include those who were discharged improved from April - August 2020 at Lung Center of the Philippines. Their clinical outcome after 1 year which include persistent symptoms, functional capacity and survival status were determined and analyzed.Results: A total of 100 subjects were included in this study. Forty three subjects (43.9%) had persistent symptoms. Fatigue (28, 28.6%), depression (13, 13.3%), and brain fog (11, 11.2%) were the most frequently reported symptoms. Ninety two (92.9%) patients had none to negligible functional capacity limitations. Ninety seven (97%) patients survived after 1 year. Persistent symptoms of fatigue and difficulty of breathing, as well as functional capacity differ across COVID-19 disease severities. Higher proportion of patients with persistent fatigue and difficulty of breathing were noted as the severity increases. Higher proportion of patients with functional scale 1-2 (no to negligible functional limitation) were noted in moderate severity group as compared to the severe and critical severity group.Conclusions: This one-year follow-up study of COVID-19 recovered patients revealed high proportion of survivors, very few with significant functional capacity limitations, and some with persistent symptoms. Favorable clinical outcomes after 1 year were evident in less severe disease. Care for patients with COVID-19 infection does not conclude at the time of hospital discharge, and interdisciplinary cooperation is needed for comprehensive care of these patients in the outpatient setting.","Donguines, M.

"Innovative Program of Physical and Cardiopulmonary Conditioning in Patients After the Diagnosis of Covid-19 in a Health Institution","Background: COVID-19 disease can cause a wide variety of long-term health problems, including impaired lung function, reduced exercise performance, and decreased quality of life. Objectives: Our study aimed to investigate the efficacy, feasibility and safety of pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with COVID-19 and to compare the results between patients with a mild / moderate and severe / critical course of the disease. Methodology: Patients in the post-acute phase of a mild to critical course of COVID-19 admitted to a comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation program were included in this prospective and observational cohort study, 43 patients were included in the study (20 with mild / moderate COVID and 23 with severe / critical COVID-19). Main measures: Several measures of exercise performance, 6-minute walking distance, lung function (forced vital capacity (FVC)), and quality of life (36-question short-format health survey (SF-36 )). Results: Results: At admission, the patients had a reduced walking distance (mild: median 401 m, interquartile range (IQR) 335-467 m;severe: 108 m, 84-132 m), a deteriorated FVC (mild: 72 % ,;severe: 35%,) and a low SF-36 mental health score (mild: 52 points, severe: 32 points. The patients received sessions adjusted to their physical capacities, the patients of both subgroups improved in the test of 6 minute walk (mild / moderate: +54 m, severe / critical: +117 m, both p &lt;0.002), FVC (mild / moderate: + 8.9%, p = 0.004;severe / critical: + 12, 4%, p &lt;0.003) and mental component SF-36 (mild / moderate: +6.8 points, p = 0.062;severe / critical: +16.7 points, -p &lt;0.005). Conclusions: An exercise program Well structured results in a benefit in the areas of aerobic capacity, lung volumes and quality of life, in this sense it is recommended to expand population samples to be able to apply our protocol to other centers in charge in the rehabilitation of COVID-19 patients.

"The Effect of Sedation with Inhaled Anesthetics on Cognitive and Psychiatric Outcomes in Critically Ill Adults: A Systematic Review","Rationale: The COVID-19 pandemic has renewed interest in the use of inhaled anesthetics for sedation of ventilated critically ill patients. Compared to intravenous sedatives, inhaled anesthetics reduce lung inflammation, time to extubation, and ICU length of stay. However, their impact on cognitive and psychiatric outcomes is less clear. In this systematic review we summarize the impact of inhaled sedatives on cognitive and psychiatric outcomes in ventilated critically ill patients. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsychINFO for studies from 1970 - 2021 that assessed cognitive and psychiatric outcomes in critically ill adult patients sedated with inhaled anesthetics. We included case series, observational, cohort, and randomized controlled trials. Outcome(s) of interest included cognition, anxiety, depression, hallucinations, psychomotor recovery, and PTSD, as well as instruments for assessing these outcomes. Results: We identified a total of twelve studies that examined at least one of our outcomes of interest (16 total outcomes). Four studies were in post cardiac arrest survivors, three in post-operative (non-cardiac) patients, two in post-operative cardiac patients, and three more in mixed medical-surgical patients. Seven studies reported incidence of delirium, two assessed neurologic recovery post cardiac-arrest, and two examined ICU memories. One study reported on each of anxiety, depression, hallucinations, PTSD, psychomotor recovery, and long-term cognitive dysfunction more than 3 months following ICU discharge. Of the seven studies reporting on delirium, only one reported an increase in delirium for those sedated with intravenous sedation compared to volatile. The remaining studies did not report any difference in delirium incidence between modes of sedation. Similarly, no difference between sedation methods were observed for neurologic recovery following cardiac arrest, anxiety, depression, hallucinations, PTSD, psychomotor recovery, or long-term cognitive dysfunction. The most commonly used tool used was the CAM-ICU tool (delirium outcome;3 studies). Five studies used subjective chart review to assess their outcome of interest, or did not report their method of assessment. Conclusions: Few studies examined cognitive and psychiatric outcomes in critically ill adults sedated with volatile anesthetics. As volatile anesthetics offer a promising alternative mode of sedation in the ICU, future studies should incorporate assessment of these important patientcentered outcomes using validated objective tools during and following hospital stay.","Cuninghame, S.; Jerath, A.; Gorsky, K.; Sivajohan, A.; Francoeur, C.; Withington, D.; Burry, L.; Slessarev, M.","https://doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm-conference.2022.205.1_MeetingAbstracts.A5395","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine; 205(1), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35078,""
"A Self-Guided App-Based Adaptive Coping Skills Training Intervention for Patients with Cardiorespiratory Failure: The Blueprint Pilot RCT","Rationale: Cardiorespiratory diseases are common causes of persistent psychological distress symptoms. To fill this gap, we developed Blueprint, a month-long mobile app-based adaptive coping skills training intervention based on lessons learned about intervention delivery and population targeting from a multicenter RCT of a hybrid telephone- and web-based intervention (Figure). However, Blueprint requires further testing before broader use. Methods: The objectives were to (1) Optimize the usability of the new Blueprint system by incorporation of features based on lessons learned and (2) Test two Blueprint iterations vs. usual care in a pilot 3-arm RCT with 3-month follow up among a targeted sample of 45 patients. Usability was assessed using the Systems Usability Scale (SUS). The two Blueprint iterations differed by their response to weekly changes in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) scores within the app (app-based response with additional digital content vs. therapist response). The key inclusion criterion was hospitalization in an ICU or stepdown unit with a need for cardiorespiratory support (e.g., ventilation, vasopressors) plus a HADS total score =8 just after arrival home. Method of minimization was used to balance across strata (ICU service, baseline HADS, age). The 1-month HADS score was the primary outcome, with secondary outcomes at 1 and 3 months including HADS, Post-Traumatic Stress Scale (PTSS), and physical symptoms (PHQ-10) Results: Usability testing was performed among 5 patients asked to perform core tasks in the Blueprint app. The mean (SD) SUS score was 83.5 (9.5), exceeding the benchmark target of 80. Subsequently, the RCT was initiated. A total of 1,133 were screened, 416 (37%) appeared to be eligible, 229 (55%) were approached, 65 (28%) consented, and 45 (69%) randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio by group. A total of 19 (29%) were excluded post-consent for low baseline HADS scores. To date, 25 have completed the trial and 20 are still active in the protocol. The relatively high refusal rate reflects the conduct of the RCT by the study team completely by distance via telephone and SMS texting (including screening and consenting) during the COVID pandemic. Conclusion: We successfully transformed an adaptive coping skills intervention into a highly usable, fully self-guided, mobile app-based version called Blueprint that delivers content responsive to weekly changes in psychological distress symptoms. We reached the target sample size and follow-up for the RCT continues. We anticipate completion by January 2022 with full results ready for presentation by the time of ATS 2022.","Cox, C.

"Mindfulness in Motion: A Mindfulness Based Intervention in Pulmonary Rehabilitation to Improve Self-Efficacy in Chronic Respiratory Disease","Rationale: Patients with chronic lung disease experience dyspnea and other symptoms that significantly affect quality of life and can result in elevated rates of depression and anxiety. Concomitant anxiety and depression can often result in poorer outcomes in these patients and can hinder their confidence in self-management of their disease. Mindfulness involves non-judgmental attention to a person's surroundings and experiences cultivates the ability to be aware of the present moment. A formal mindfulness-based intervention developed at Ohio State University called Mindfulness in Motion offered within the established structure of a pulmonary rehabilitation program was implemented in both virtual and in-person format to promote disease self-efficacy, reduce stress and improve symptoms of anxiety and depression that often accompany chronic symptomatic lung disease. Methods: This is a prospective feasibility/pilot study pre/post-test design with an intervention and control wait list groups. All new adult patients enrolling in pulmonary rehabilitation were eligible. Mindfulness in Motion (MIM) is a Mindfulness Based Intervention that is offered in a group format for 1hr/week/8 weeks combined with 10-20 online audio and video programs to facilitate individual mindfulness practice. The Mindfulness in Motion program relaced one of the usual 1 hour pulmonary rehabilitation education sessions. One round of the intervention was done virtually via Microsoft Teams due to the restrictions of the Covid-19 pandemic and an additional in-person round of this program is currently ongoing. The primary outcome is the PROMIS Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Conditions-Symptoms. Breath counts pre and post intervention are of interest as well. Secondary outcomes are: PROMIS Percieved Stress Scale, PROMIS Anxiety Short Form, PROMIS Depression short form and Respiratory Rate. These measures were collected pre-intervention, post-intervention, 6 months and 1 year. Results: Data collection and analysis of primary and secondary endpoints is currently ongoing. However, early analysis shows a decrease in respiratory rate immediately post-intervention. In initial 4 subjects in which respiratory rate data was recorded, 3 out of 4 patients showed significant consistent reduction in respiratory rate from the beginning to the end of each session in the 7 weeks of the intervention already completed (see Table 1). Conclusion: Mindfulness in Motion is a mindfulness intervention that is implementable within the existing structure of pulmonary rehabilitation. Further, it may be effective at slowing breathing rate in these patients prior to exercising which may be beneficial to participation. Further investigation with a larger randomized control trial would be feasible and warranted for further study.

"Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis in a Twelve-Year-Old BoyReceiving Montelukast: A Case Report","Introduction: Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) is a multisystem disorder characterized by asthma, prominent peripheral blood eosinophilia, and small-vessel vasculitis. We report a case of EGPA in an adolescent with uncontrolled asthma who was receiving montelukast. Case: A 12-year-old boy who is known to have asthma and allergic rhinitis which were previously controlled on ICS, intranasal steroids, and prolonged use of montelukast for 4 years. He presented with cough and nasal blockage for 2 months. He also reported an increase in the frequency of asthma attacks and received multiple courses of systemic steroids. Subsequently, his asthma controller medications were upgraded to ICS/LABA few weeks prior to admission. His symptoms were also associated with weight loss, diarrhoea and haematochezia. He was vitally stable and maintained oxygen saturation on room air. Physical examination revealed nasal polyps, purple skin flat lesions on palms and feet (Figure1), and bilateral crackles on chest auscultation. His blood investigations were significant for leukocytosis with marked eosinophilia (11x103/uL, (51%)), high inflammatory markers and total-IgE (1975 kU/L). Initial chest XR showed bilateral interstitial thickening and small pleural effusions (Figure2). Chest CT showed centrilobular nodules and peripheral ground-glass opacities, tree-in-bud appearance with no peripheral sparing in addition to moderate pericardial effusion and bilateral mild pleural effusion (Figure3). Sinus CT showed extensive sino-nasal polyposis with pansinusitis (Figure4). Initial echocardiography showed moderate pericardial effusion with normal biventricular function. Patient was started on IV furosemide. During his hospitalization, patient developed chest pain. His serial troponin was rising and LV contractility was depressed. ECG showed ST-segment depression. Therefore, EGPA with cardiac involvement was suspected. Cardiac MR showed features of a peri-myocarditis. IVIG was commenced for suspicion of coronary artery involvement, which was later disputed by cardiac cath. He was also started on IV pulse steroids at a dose of 30 mg/kg for 3 days which resulted in dramatic decrease in troponin level, eosinophil count and CRP. Skin biopsy, which was later performed after administration of steroids, showed perivascular non-necrotizing granulomas. His ANA, ANCA and COVID-19 PCR came negative. Serum chemistries and urine microscopy were unremarkable. Patient was later started on Rituximab with significant clinical, serological and radiological (Figure5,6) improvement after 10-months of follow-up. Discussion: EGPA is rare but should be considered in children with uncontrolled asthma, eosinophilia and rhino-sinusitis. This case shows the importance of being aware that montelukast could cause EGPA, in spite of the uncertainty about its mechanism. (Figure Presented).","Kammouh, H.; Hamad, S.

"A Telehealth Approach to Addressing ICU Healthcare Worker Mental Health Distress","Rationale: Burnout and distress amongst ICU staff are prevalent and have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this context, recent data have revealed an increased incidence of adverse mental health events (AMHE) amongst healthcare workers (HCW). However, identifying HCWs at risk for AMHE and offering timely support services remains a challenge. Our aim is to develop a telehealth-based platform to provide mental health screening and tailored interventions to ICU HCW at an academic medical center. Methods: A multidisciplinary team comprised of clinical and behavioral psychologists, resiliency coordinators, pulmonary critical care fellows, and faculty iteratively developed a screening questionnaire using validated tools directed at various domains of mental health including sleep disturbance, depression, anxiety, PTSD, resiliency, alcohol misuse, and burnout. Using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) with an integrated Twilio platform, we developed a text-based, interactive tool designed to 1) screen HCWs for AMHE, 2) communicate results to respondents in real-time, and 3) provide risk-stratified referrals to support services such as a mental health practitioner or self-help mobile applications. We performed cognitive pretesting on the amalgamated survey instrument with 6 ICU HCW stakeholders including three ICU RNs, one RT, and two physicians. We sought feedback on survey length, concerns about confidentiality, likelihood to accept mental health referrals, and pertinence of the questions to ICU HCWs. Feedback was obtained via a 4-question survey and through qualitative field notes. Results: The mean duration required to complete the survey during beta-testing was 6.97 mins +/-2.46 mins (SD). 100% of participants reported that the questionnaire was â€not overly burdensomeâ€ (5/6) or â€œminimally burdensomeâ€ (1/6). Participants were also â€œvery confidentâ€ (4/6) or â€œconfidentâ€ (2/6) their confidentiality would be maintained with this intervention. 83% (5/6) of participants stated that they were either â€œextremely likelyâ€ (3/6) or â€œlikelyâ€ (2/6) to accept real-time feedback including a mental health referral if their responses suggest possible mental health distress. Only 17% (1/6) reported that they are unlikely to accept a mental health referral. All participants rated the pertinence of the questions to the healthcare workers to be high with 33% (2/6) characterizing the pertinence as excellent and 67% (4/6) as very good. Illustrative comments from the qualitative assessment are included in the Table. Conclusion: A telehealth-based platform for a mental health screening with real-time feedback and support service referral is feasible and was well-received by ICU HCW during cognitive pretesting.","Shah, N.; Goodwin, A.

"Factors Associated with Disability Over the 6 Months After a COVID Hospitalization Among Older Adults: The VALIANT (CO&lt;underline&gt;V&lt;/underline&gt;ID-19 in Older &lt;underline&gt;A&lt;/underline&gt;dults: A &lt;underline&gt;L&lt;/underline&gt;ong&lt;underline&gt;i&lt;/underline&gt;tudinal &lt;underline&gt;A&lt;/underline&gt;ssessme&lt;underline&gt;nt&lt;/underline&gt;) Study","Rationale: Although mortality from COVID-19 increases with advanced age, most older adults survive a COVID hospitalization. Disability, or dependence in functional activities, is known to increase after a serious illness among older adults, with adverse consequences for patients, families, and society. Little is known about disability, and the factors associated with disability, after a COVID hospitalization among older adults. Methods: We enrolled 341 older (=60 years) adults during their index COVID-19 hospitalization between 7/6/2020-6/24/2021 from five hospitals in the Yale-New Haven Health System. Upon enrollment, participants underwent an assessment of baseline (prehospitalization) disability, frailty, general health, social support, hearing, vision, mental health, and assessments of current (in-hospital) symptom burden and cognitive function. These assessments were linked to EMR data including demographics, SOFA score, comorbidities, biomarkers, respiratory support, pressors, length of stay, and COVIDspecific treatments. Disability was assessed at baseline and 1, 3, and 6 months by asking about dependence in 15 basic, instrumental, and mobility activities. The primary outcome was the disability count (0-15) over the 6 months after the COVID hospitalization. The analytic sample included 304 participants who survived their hospitalization and had at least one post-discharge follow-up. We determined the mean (SD) number of disabilities over the 6 months after discharge and evaluated 27 factors for their association with the 6-month disability count using backwards selection based on minimization of the Bayesian Information Criterion with a zero-inflated negative binomial distribution and adjustment for baseline disability count and months of follow-up. Results: The mean age was 71.2 years (SD 8.5), 158 (51.8%) were women, and 108 (35.5%) were of nonwhite race or Hispanic ethnicity (Table). The mean prehospitalization disability count was 2.2 (SD 3.4), and the mean disability count over the 6 months after the COVID hospitalization was 2.9 (SD 3.7). In the multivariable model, greater baseline disability, older age, higher BMI, higher comorbidity count, cognitive dysfunction, greater symptom burden during the hospitalization, and the need for advanced respiratory support were all associated with greater disability over the 6 months after a COVID hospitalization. Conclusions: Other than the need for advanced respiratory support, factors associated with disability after a COVID hospitalization among older adults reflect vulnerability at baseline (comorbidities, baseline disability, age, BMI) or during the hospitalization (symptom burden, cognitive dysfunction), rather than biomarkers or severity of illness. These factors may identify older adults for referral to Post-COVID clinic programs to improve the likelihood of functional recovery after discharge. (Table Presented).","Ferrante, L.

"Acute Interstitial Pneumonia and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) from a Forgotten Plant","Introduction: Conium maculatum, poison hemlock, is native to Europe, North Africa and Western Asia. Over the last 50 years, it has become more prevalent as an invasive species in the United States. Notorious for its role in Socrates' suicide in 399 BC and frequently referenced by Shakespeare, the plant has a rich history of toxicity in man. We present a case of an accidental hemlock exposure leading to acute interstitial pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Case Presentation: A 58 year old male presented with acute dyspnea and cough with hemoptysis the morning after clearing wooded brush in his backyard. Other symptoms included tachycardia, diaphoresis, nausea, and diarrhea. His condition rapidly progressed to acute respiratory failure with imaging suggestive of ARDS. Thorough investigation for infectious and inflammatory etiology was unremarkable. Open lung biopsy was consistent with diffuse alveolar damage. Further history from the wife revealed the presence of significant amounts of poison hemlock identified in photos from the yard. Initial treatment included prednisone with prolonged taper with eventual transition to mycophenolate mofetil. After a prolonged hospital course, he was discharged with tracheostomy and continued ventilatory support. Discussion: Hemlock produces piperidine alkaloids akin to nicotine including coniine and <U+03B3>-coniceine. These inhibit the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors of the central nervous system causing an array of symptoms that without intervention lead to respiratory depression and death. Diagnosis is based on history. Treatment is supportive, in many instances requiring mechanical ventilation. Conclusions: Even in the Covid era, ARDS differential diagnosis is dependent on thorough history taking, including obscure environmental exposures.","McCann, T.; Hayner, C.; Patel, N.","https://doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm-conference.2022.205.1_MeetingAbstracts.A2986","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine; 205(1), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35084,""
"Splatter Paint Room Event in the ICU - An Effort to Mitigate Burnout","Background - Among all the specialties, Critical Care Medicine physicians have reported the highest rate of burnout in the year 2021[Medscape National Physician Burnout & Suicide Report 2021]. Likewise, all Intensive Care Unit (ICU) staff such as nurses, respiratory therapists and patient care assistants as frontline workers have been experiencing stress during g the past 18 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we present an initiative of Center for Performing Arts (CPAM) department at a tertiary care academic medical center to help reduce fatigue and burnout among ICU staff through splatter painting. Methods - This study was conducted in a 36-bed Cardiovascular ICU at a tertiary care hospital. Permission was obtained from the relative departments for the use of data. CPAM planned a 3-day splatter tent event in the ICU. This event was mainly for the ICU staff but was open to all the hospital staff. The event was advertised using colorful flyers. Each participant was led to a quiet room where they would drape, pick their favorite music selection, and color prop. Participants were then left alone to unwind and release all the feels in the form of creating art and could stay as long as they wanted. Pre- and post-completion surveys were recorded and, data was analyzed. Results - A total of 49 staff participated. 32 out of 49 participants returned their surveys. Overwhelmingly majority of the comments were positive. The most popular music genre was rap/hip hop. Average stress levels 1(low) to 5(high) were 4.19 - before to 2.56 - after. The average score (1-least) to 5-most) for if the intervention helped with compassion fatigue (F) and mental exhaustion (ME) was 4.22 and 4.44 respectively. The average score for if the intervention helped them feel more engaged at work (EW) and instilled positive attitude (PA) towards organization was 4.34 and 4.77 respectively. We did Pearson's correlation for the four components of the activity i.e., F, ME, EW and PA. Our R was strongly positive with value of 0.9913, using formula r = S((X - My)(Y - Mx)) / v((SSx)(SSy)). We also cross checked meta-numerics. Our value of R2 (the coefficient of determination) was 0.9827. Our P-Value was .001199, with significance at p &lt; .05. Conclusions - The level of burnout amongst healthcare workers is at a critical level globally. Healthcare administrations need to find ways to mitigate feelings of burnout and fatigue amongst staff.

"Mobile Mindfulness Intervention to Reduce Emotional Distress and Burnout in Frontline Healthcare Workers: The LIFT-HCW Pilot RCT","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to extremely high levels of emotional distress and burnout amongst frontline healthcare workers. Rapidly deployable and scalable interventions are desperately needed to help combat the burgeoning mental health crisis among frontline healthcare works. Methods: We designed a prospective, randomized, waitlist-controlled pilot study assessing the impact of a mobile mindfulness app (LIFT) among nurses working in COVID-19 units. Participants were randomized in a 2:1 fashion to receive access to mobile mindfulness content (intervention) or to a waitlist to receive access to mobile mindfulness content outside the study period (control). All patients completed a survey that includes the Patient Health Questionairre-9 (PHQ-9), The General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), the Perceived Stress Scale-4 (PSS-4), and the Maslach Burnout Index (MBI) at baseline (T1) and at the end of the study period (28 days after enrollment, T2). Primary outcomes are feasibility as assessed by the number of participants completing all 4 weeks of mindfulness therapy as well as the total number of daily mindfulness sessions completed. Secondary outcomes included change in PHQ-9, GAD-7, PSS-4, and MBI scores from T1 to T2. Results: Enrollment began in May of 2021. To date 82 participants have been enrolled and randomized, 56 to intervention and 24 to waitlist, with a target enrollment of 100. Median PHQ-9 scores in each group were 8 (IQR 6-11.25) and 7 (IQR 5-10) indicating moderate amounts of emotional distress in each group. Enrollment and follow-up are ongoing, with enrollment planned to be completed in December 2021. Conclusions: We have successfully enrolled 82 participants in an ongoing randomized, waitlist-controlled trial testing the clinical impact of a mobile mindfulness intervention on emotional distress and burnout in frontline healthcare workers. Final results will be presented at ATS International Meeting.","Pratt, E. H.; Cox, C. E.; Olsen, M.

"Uncovering Cocaine Induced Eosinophilic Pneumonia","Cocaine use has a significant public health impact, causing over 1.2 million ER visits annually. Cocaine can cause a wide range of pulmonary pathology, including diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (â€œCrack Lungâ€), barotrauma, bronchiectasis, granulomatous disease, and pulmonary vascular disease. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) is a rare and potentially life-threatening complication of cocaine use that can be successfully treated if identified. We describe a case of persistent fevers, hypoxemia, and air space opacities due to AEP related to cocaine use.A 34-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse was found unresponsive, apneic, and surrounded by vomitus at a party, where he had smoked marijuana and cocaine and injected heroin. Upon hospital arrival, he was hypotensive and severely hypoxic and was intubated. He had severe rhabdomyolysis, lactic acidosis, acute kidney injury, and acute liver injury. His chest radiograph demonstrated diffuse bilateral alveolar infiltrates. COVID-19 was ruled out. Sputum cultures grew Klebsiella and E. Coli;Streptococcus Pneumoniae urine antigen was positive. He received IV fluids, vasopressors, and broad spectrum antibiotics for septic shock and aspiration pneumonia in the setting of drug overdose. His septic shock and hypoxemia improved, allowing tracheostomy and gastrostomy to be performed. Despite prolonged courses of antibiotics, he had persistent fevers, worsening infiltrates on chest radiograph, and persistent hypoxemia. CT imaging demonstrated diffuse, bilateral ground glass opacities and consolidations, with reticulation and interlobular septal thickening. Viral, bacterial, and fungal cultures collected via bronchoscopy were negative, however, cell count revealed 315 WBC / mm3, with 27% eosinophils. He was started on methylprednisolone 80mg IV every eight hours and had resolution of fevers and improvement in oxygenation and infiltrates. 1 month after discharge, he was decannulated and did not require supplemental oxygen. DiscussionThis case highlights an important aspect of assessing fever in the ICU despite broad spectrum antibiotics in patient with drug overdose. In the above , bronchoscopy unmasked an eosinophilic pneumonia allowing a rapid transition to trach collar and prevention of progression to pulmonary fibrosis.

"Mental Health of People with Difficult to Treat Asthma in a Large National Population Survey","Rationale Difficult to treat asthma (DTTA) is asthma that is uncontrolled despite medium/high ICSLABA treatment and/or maintenance oral corticosteroids (OCS);severe asthma is a subset. Previous research suggests that anxiety and depression are common among patients with severe asthma;these may impact asthma control and quality of life. Screening for anxiety and depression has been recommended, followed by appropriate psychiatrist/psychologist referral. However, little is known about whether the mental health support needs of people with DTTA are being met, and any attributable health service utilisation. The aims of this study were to explore mental health issues, and healthcare utilization, in people with DTTA within a nationally-representative population of people with a diagnosis of asthma.Methods The DTTA Survey was a cross-sectional survey in February-March 2021 of 5457 participants aged =18 years with current asthma, randomly selected from a large web-based survey panel of adult Australians. All survey participants answered demographic questions and questions regarding asthma symptoms, medications and health service use, with additional questions for those with DTTA. DTTA was identified based on ERS/ATS criteria.Mental status was assessed via reported comorbidities, mental health referrals and treatment, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) which assesses feelings in the previous week. The Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE) measure was also used to gauge participants' perceptions about the consultation process with their general practitioner.Results 1170 (21.4%) of participants had DTTA. Of these 56.8% (664/1170) were female (Table). The proportions of DTTA participants who reported being told by a doctor/nurse that they had anxiety or depression, and selected â€œhave at presentâ€ for these diagnoses, were 35.9% and 28.9% respectively;21.8% indicated both. However, by HADS, 63.4% self-reported current anxiety symptoms and 39.9% current depression symptoms. 50% reported feeling more anxious about their asthma due to COVID19. Overall, 47.9% of those with DTTA (561/1170) reported treatment for anxiety or depression in the previous year. Treatments included medication (72.7%);Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (42.8%);and mindfulness training (23.9%). Concerning mental health support, 611 participants (52.2%) had consulted with a psychologist or counsellor in last 5 years;38.8% of those visits were within the previous 3 months. Over half these consultations (52.5%) were initiated by the participant, and 33.6% by the GP. Conclusion The findings from this representative population survey provide insights regarding prevalence and management of anxiety and depression among people with DTTA, and may assist clinicians in supporting their mental health needs.

"COVID-19 on the Navajo Nation: Experiences of Dine Families of Children with Asthma","BACKGROUND: Approximately 173,000 persons live on the Navajo Nation (NN) and 14.7% live in multi-generational households. One-third of the Nation's residents are children and 44% live in poverty. The median household income is $27,389 with 1/3 having incomes &lt; $15,000/year. The first confirmed case of COVID-19 on the NN was identified March 17, 2020. The Navajo government took swift action to combat COVID-19 by declaring a public health state of emergency which established the Navajo Department of Health Command Operations Center, closed the government offices except for essential employees, ceased inperson classroom instruction for all schools located within the borders of the NN and issued travel restriction for governmental employees. Even with strong public health efforts, Navajo Nation saw the highest per capita infection rate in the US during May of 2020 with 2450/100,000 versus New York 2119/100,000. METHODS: The Community Asthma Program is an NHLBI funded program working to improve health outcomes for children with asthma on the NN. We sought to determine the impact of COVID- 19 on the families of children with asthma who were participating in our study. RESULTS: Sixty-six of 193 families (34%) were interviewed about their pandemic experience. The average age of the child with asthma was 13.5 (SD=3.9) and 33% were female. On average, 5.2 people lived in each house (SD=2.1). Results of the interviews are shown in the table. Our data indicate that most DinÃ© children with asthma in our study did not contract COVID-19. However, the pandemic had a significant impact on them and their families. Many family members contracted COVID-19, some children lost family members, and half of interviewed parents reported a decline in their child's mental health. Responses suggest that Navajo families may have been less able to work remotely than the US population at large, perhaps increasing stress for families. Despite the trauma from COVID-19, families adopted strategies to cope with the pandemic. Most diligently followed health guidelines including washing hands, wearing masks, and social distancing. One in four families sought the help of a traditional healer. Many accessed medical care through telehealth and most were able to obtain asthma medications when needed. More recently, as the pandemic subsides, parents indicate that their outlook and mental health have significantly improved. CONCLUSION. Despite significant challenges, our research indicated resilience among Navajo families and we heard stories of positive community structures and relationships that are particular to the DinÃ© culture.

"Effects of Home-Based Respiratory Physiotherapy and Telephone- Based Psychological Support on Pulmonary and Mental Health Outcomes in Peru: A Feasibility Randomized Controlled Trial","Introduction: We sought to determine whether a 6-week integrated rehabilitation program improved pulmonary function, physical and mental health outcomes in patients discharged alive after surviving a severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: Parallel, open-label, feasibility randomized controlled trial in participants aged 18-75 years who were discharged for severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The intervention consisted of 12 in-person home respiratory rehabilitation sessions and 6 telephonebased, emotion-centered problem-solving therapy psychological sessions. We measured the 6- minute walk test (6MWT), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), Impact of Event Scale- Revised (IES-R) and Short Form 36 health survey (SF-36). Following the recommendation by Cocks and Torgerson, we used a one-sided 80% confidence interval to determine if this feasibility trial should proceed to a phase III trial. Results: We randomized 103 participants (mean age, 48 years;71% men). There were no differences at baseline assessments of outcomes between the two groups. Intervention participants walked 15 and 45 meters more during a 6MWT at 7 and 12 weeks, respectively, than controls after accounting for baseline distance. In both instances, the onesided 80% lower bound was above 0. Intervention participants also had a greater improvement of lung function for week 7 (mean difference FEV1, 0.05 L;95% CI, -0.14 to 0.24;mean difference FVC, 0.10 L;95% CI, -0.12 to 0.31) and at week 12 (mean difference FEV1, 0.10 L;95% CI, -0.18 to 0.37;mean difference FVC, 0.15 L;95% CI, -0.17 to 0.47). Likewise, the prevalence of depression (percentage difference PHQ-9, 24.3%;95% CI, -4.3 to 44.3), anxiety (percentage difference GAD-7, 20.7%;95% CI, 0.8 to 40.6) and post-traumatic stress (percentage difference IES-R, 14.0%;95% CI, -5.7 to 33.7) were lower in the intervention group at week 2 after hospital discharge. At week 7, the intervention group had a greater improvement of physical (mean difference, 10.8;95% CI, -1.8 to 23.4) and social (mean difference, 6.43;95% CI, -0.65 to 13.5) function on the SF-36. Conclusion: We demonstrated that an integrated rehabilitation program administered over a 6-week after discharge in Lima, Peru was both feasible and acceptable, and had positive benefits on physical and pulmonary function and on mental health during the 12 weeks of follow-up. Measured improvements in the primary outcome of 6MWT distance recommend that we consider a phase III trial to test the efficacy of our integrated rehabilitation intervention in a larger sample.","Soriano, A.

"Effect of Home-Based Rehabilitation with Health Coaching on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Outcomes: A Randomized Study","Importance Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is the guideline-recommended most effective nonpharmacological therapy for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) improving all outcomes. Despite the proven benefits, PR programs have low participant uptake, insufficient attendance, and high drop-out rates. Home programs are proposed as a solution: however, there is no randomized study to date in the US to inform remote programs.Objective To determine whether unsupervised home-based rehabilitation with technology and health coaching improve physical and emotional disease specific quality of life, daily physical activity, and self-management in patients with moderate to severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).Design, Setting, and Participants This multicenter, randomized, allocation-concealed, clinical trial enrolled 235 adult patients with COPD, of a planned sample size of 200, between March 2018 and December 2021 from two major health care systems in the US.Interventions Participants were randomized to unsupervised home-based rehabilitation with health coaching (N=116) or standard care (n = 119).Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome were disease-specific physical and emotional quality of life after the 12-week intervention. Prespecified secondary outcomes included measured daily physical activity, selfmanagement abilities, sleep, and symptoms of depression and anxiety.Results Among 307 patients who were randomized (mean age, 69 years;56% women) 235 (77%) completed the intervention and had measures. The was a significant difference in the intervention compared to the control group in the primary outcomes, daily physical activity, self-management, sleep, and depression scores: (adjusted Difference, Mean Change (95% CI) 0.47 points (0.27, 0.67) p&lt;0.001, 0.48 (0.27, 0.69)p&lt;0.001 for the physical and emotional quality of life respectively.

"Anxiety Management among Non-Clinical Society towards C OVI D-19 Pandemic in the Iranian Context","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major effect on our lives. Many of us are facing challenges that can be stressful and overwhelming and cause strong emotions in adults and children. The purpose of this study was to measure the level of anxiety of nonclinical individuals in the Iranian community towards COVID-19 in Tehran. The present study is a descriptive correlational method with 308 individuals participating in the study through an online recall. A researcher-made coronary anxiety questionnaire with 18 questions was used to collect data. The data were analyzed by using Cronbach's alpha internal consistency and Guttman's lambda 2 method. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using Lisrel-8.8 software was used to evaluate the tool construct validity. To standardize the raw scores, they were converted to standard T scores and percentile rank using Jmetrik-4.1.1 software and were prepared as normative tables. The Guttman's lambda 2 value for the whole questionnaire was obtained as (lambda = 0.922), Cronbach's alpha coefficient for psychological symptoms as (alpha = 0.879), physical symptoms as (alpha = 0.861), and for the whole questionnaire as (alpha = 0.919). The range of scores of the questionnaire factors and total score of COVID-related anxiety severity based on standard T scores was divided into three domains: mild, moderate, and severe. The increase in psychological and physical symptom scores of coronavirus anxiety was significantly associated with physical symptoms, anxiety, depression, and social dysfunction. The fact that anxiety acts as a predisposing and health-threatening variable has confirmed that other researchers should examine its psychometric properties in other populations (especially compared to the clinical population to increase the diagnostic value of this questionnaire) as well as in relation to other psychological, social and medical concepts and variables.","Amani, V.

"Hospital-based ambulatory clinic adoption of video and telephone visits before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: a convergent mixed-methods study","Purpose The purpose of this study is to understand virtual care use (e.g. telephone and video visits) during the COVID-19 pandemic across three hospital-based ambulatory clinics (i.e. mental health, renal and respiratory care) and to describe associated patient and provider experiences. Design/methodology/approach A mixed-methods convergent study was conducted including quantitative electronic medical records data on virtual care use, electronic surveys assessing domains of experience (e.g. satisfaction, acceptance and technology use) among patient and providers and semi-structured interviews exploring the associated barriers and facilitators of virtual care adoption. Findings Virtual care adoption rates and relative modality use (telephone vs video) varied across specialty clinics. Mental health clinics) showed the greatest use of virtual care and greater use of video over telephone, as compared to renal and respiratory care, where telephone was used almost exclusively. Patients and providers reported an overall good satisfaction and acceptance of virtual care (60-72%) across clinics, but commonly observed barriers (technical problems, behavioral adaptations needed and inequity) persisted. Good value propositions, tech support and the presence of early adopters who can support others in workflow re-design and highlight value propositions of virtual care were listed as adoption facilitators. Originality/value The study provides a unique opportunity to compare the rate of virtual care adoption before and during the COVID-19 pandemic across distinct specialties that operate within the same organizational and political setting. This study showed that the nature of the condition (e.g. mental health conditions) and the characteristics of the users (e.g. younger patients) may drive models of care with higher rate of video use. Focusing on removing common barriers, like providing tech support and ensuring equitable access to patients, continues to be important even in the context of high virtual care adoption rates during the pandemic.","Stamenova, V.; Budhwani, S.; Soobiah, C.; Fujioka, J.; Khan, R.; Liu, R.; Halperin, I.; Bhatia, R.

"Assessing the influence of COVID-19 protocol on online health information seeking intention of athletes in India","Purpose The Internet is used as a tool to seek health information by individuals. Mental health concerns are the high prevalence of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and preventive steps are required to curb the illness. Therefore, to gain more insight into health concerns, it is now a common practice to seek health information on the Internet. This study propose an integrated theoretical model to explore the relationship between COVID-19 protocols and perceived online trust with online health information seeking intention (OHISI) and a moderating effect of perceived severity and perceived urgency. Design/methodology/approach Data are collected from 325 athletes in the category of individual and team sports through an online survey in a Likert-scale questionnaire. The analysis is performed with a quantitative methodology. Findings The study reveals the bright side of online health information (OHI), which brings athletes together and has played out with virtual happy hours, meetings and events. The bright side of OHI reflects social, cultural, technological and economic benefits. An OHI chatbot offers bright personalised side information to the individual seeker, which is more convenient and efficient than human capabilities. Originality/value The pivotal contribution is the integrated theoretical framework that is derived from multidisciplinary literature to capture the complexity of OHI. Also, it conceptualises the constructs in the context of OHI and COVID-19.","Behera, R. K.; Bala, P. K.; Rana, N. P.; Dwivedi, Y.

"A UNIQUE CASE OF SEVERE SLEEP ONSET AND MAINTENANCE INSOMNIA FOLLOWING COVID-19 VACCINATION","Introduction: The COVID-19 vaccines have documented transient side effects, including injection site soreness, redness, headache, fatigue, and fever. In addition, there have been few reported long-term side effects, including Guillain-Barre, pericarditis, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. We present a rare case of severe insomnia as a long-term side effect following COVID-19 vaccination. Report of Cases: A 59-year-old female with a past medical history of well-controlled hypothyroidism and migraine presented to the sleep center with four months of insomnia. She had a history of COVID infection in November 2020 with only mild symptoms of sore throat and fatigue. The patient finished her two-shot series of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in April 2021. Immediately following the vaccination, the patient had severe trouble falling and staying asleep. Her insomnia was resistant to multiple medications including zolpidem Immediate-release(IR), Controlledrelease( CR) formulas, zaleplon, eszopiclone, trazodone, melatonin, clonazepam, suvorexant, and lemborexant. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain imaging only showed nonspecific white matter disease. She had no mood disorders or psychosocial stressors, and the patient had excellent sleep hygiene measures. However, insomnia caused severe impairment of her daily life activities to a point where she was almost seeking inpatient admission for her insomnia. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the effects on sleep have been significant, particularly insomnia. Prescriptions for sleep medications have increased. Many have attributed the rise of insomnia to pandemic-related stress, disturbance of circadian rhythm from home confinement, and worsening mental health. Conclusion: To our knowledge, there have not been documented side effects of insomnia on the COVID-19 vaccines, with some studies suggesting sleep deprivation reducing their effectiveness. As vaccination efforts continue worldwide, awareness of side effects from vaccines is paramount for clinicians facing the challenges in patient care.This case demonstrates that chronic insomnia can be a side effect of the COVID-19 vaccines. Therefore, further surveillance of patients and side effects from COVID-19 vaccination is warranted as insomnia can have significant clinical and psychosocial consequences.","Aryal, S.; Kramer, J.; Azzouz, M.; Stansbury, R.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsac079.856","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sleep; 45(SUPPL 1):A370, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35095,""

Then, suvorexant 5mg was added at bedtime while the following sleep medications were continued: gabapentin total daily dose of 1500mg (300mg in morning and 3pm;900mg at bedtime, 300mg one hour later if still awake), ramelteon 8mg, mirtazapine 7.5mg and olanzapine 10mg at bedtime and bid prn aggressive behavior. He also takes the following daily medications: bisacodyl, polyethylene glycol, simethicone, hyoscyamine, cholecalciferol, aspirin, levothyroxine, hypoallergenic nutritional formula, starch and albuterol prn. With the addition of suvorexant 5mg, he had been able to get 9.5 hours of consolidated sleep at night with improvement in his behavior until he contracted Covid-19 and regressed. The suvorexant dose was increased to 10mg which again improved his insomnia and behavior. Conclusion: Various medications have either not worked at all or have worked suboptimally for insomnia in this medically complex patient who has an irregular Circadian rhythm disorder. Adding an orexin receptor antagonist as a novel mechanism to his regimen has shown promise. At this time, this patient has been stable for one month with suvorexant 10mg at bedtime after regression on the 5mg dose that coincided with a Covid-19 infection. We are proceeding with cautious optimism.","Culp, M.; Wani, A.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsac079.811","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sleep; 45(SUPPL 1):A353, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35096,""
"PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND SLEEP PATTERNS BEFORE AND DURING THE COVID-19-PANDEMIC - RESULTS FROM A CROSS-SECTIONAL AND RETROSPECTIVE STUDY","Introduction: In general, higher physical activity is related to lower symptoms of insomnia, depression, and anxiety. The COVID-19- pandemic and its related restrictions unfavorably impacted both physical activity and sleep patterns. However, it remains unknown how better sleep and physical activity prior to the pandemic confer resilience to psychological and health-related disturbances during the pandemic. We investigated whether people with higher physical activity and lower insomnia scores before the COVID-19-pandemic also reported higher physical activity, lower insomnia scores, and lower symptoms of depression and anxiety during COVID-19- pandemic-related restrictions. Methods: A total of 826 adults (mean age: 34.58Â±12.37 years) completed self-rating questionnaires covering physical activity, and symptoms of insomnia, depression, and anxiety during the COVID-19-pandemic. Further, participants retrospectively rated their physical activity and insomnia before the COVID- 19-pandemic. Hypotheses were tested using Pearson's correlations and paired t-tests with significance at p &lt; 0.05. Results: Retrospectively assessed higher physical activity levels before the COVID-19-pandemic were associated with lower symptoms of depression (r = 0.84, p = 0.041), but neither insomnia (r = 0.02, p = 0.67) nor anxiety scores during the COVID-19- pandemic (r = 0.05, p = 0.20). Retrospectively assessed lower insomnia scores before the COVID-19-pandemic were associated with lower symptoms of insomnia (r = 0.57, p &lt; 0.001), depression (r = 0.30, p &lt; 0.001) and anxiety (r = 0.31, p &lt; 0.001) during the COVID-19-pandemic. Consistent with other studies both insomnia and physical activity worsened;insomnia scores increased (p &lt; 0.001, d = 0.66) and physical activity decreased (p &lt; 0.001, d = 0.19) from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: These results suggest that those with lower levels of insomnia prior to the pandemic may be resilient to the psychological and health-related consequences of the COVID-19-pandemic and its related restrictions in everyday life, while those with higher physical activity prior to the pandemic were more resilient specifically to depression during the pandemic).","Sadeghi-Bahmani, D.; O'Hora, K.; Osorno, R.; Lopez, M.; Morehouse, A.; Krause, A.; Goldstein-Piekarski, A.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsac079.688","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sleep; 45(SUPPL 1):A303, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35097,""
"IMPROVING PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS FOR BETTER SLEEP DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: ANALYSES OF DATA FROM A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL","Introduction: Psychological distress has been associated with sleep problems. Emerging evidence suggests positive psychological well-being is associated with better sleep. However, most of these studies are cross-sectional and do not provide information on the effect that changes in psychological outcomes have on sleep. The aim of this secondary analysis was to test whether changes in distress and well-being following a 7-week intervention to improve sleep and mental health were associated with changes in sleep among adults reporting poor sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]&gt;5) and moderate distress (Perceived Stress Scale [PSS]=14) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Thirty individuals (age 40.7Â±12.9y, 80% female, 50% racial/ ethnic minority) completed a pilot study testing a well-being and sleep hygiene intervention vs. sleep hygiene alone. Questionnaires were administered at baseline and post-intervention to assess distress (PSS and the Symptom Questionnaire), well-being (Psychological Well- Being scales), and sleep (PSQI and Insomnia Severity Index). A sleep diary was administered to collect information on total sleep time (TST), variability in TST, sleep onset latency, wake time after sleep onset, bedtime, and variability in bedtime. Change scores were calculated for each variable as the difference between post-intervention and baseline. Separate linear regression models were estimated with psychological variables as predictors and sleep variables as outcomes. Analyses were adjusted for intervention group, baseline scores of predictors and outcomes, age, and sex. Results: Reductions in anxiety were associated with improvements in insomnia (B=0.6Â±0.2 (SE), p=0.008) and TST (B=-10.1Â±3.5, p=0.009);reductions in depression, somatization, and hostility were each associated with improvements in sleep quality (B=0.2Â±0.1, p=0.007), TST (B=- 10.3Â±4.5, p=0.03), and earlier bedtime (B=8.8Â±3.0, p=0.008), respectively;and reductions in perceived stress were associated with improvements in sleep quality (B=0.2Â±0.1, p=0.005) and insomnia (B=0.3Â±0.1, p=0.02). No associations were found between changes in well-being and sleep. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that reductions in distress following well-being and sleep hygiene or sleep hygiene alone interventions predict improvements in sleep. Focusing interventions on improving distress may be relevant to ameliorate sleep quality in the context of psychological distress. The association between well-being and sleep should be further delineated to determine the role of well-being in sleep promotion.","Benasi, G.; St-Onge, M.

"ASSOCIATION OF POOR SLEEP WITH STRESS, ANXIETY, EMOTIONAL SUPPORT, SOCIAL ISOLATION, AND DEPRESSION DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted multiple facets of daily living: personal finances, physical activity, and mental and physical health. These changes can result in additional stress and negatively affect sleep. It is important for sleep medicine providers to understand how their patients are impacted by these changes to optimize their care. In this study, we evaluated the association of poor sleep with stress, anxiety, emotional support, social isolation, and depression among sleep medicine clinic patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Sleep medicine clinic patients were distributed an online survey at baseline followed by a 6-month follow-up survey (December 2020 - May 2021). Participants answered questions regarding Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures (sleep disturbance and sleeprelated impairments), and COVID-19 testing. Stepwise linear regression was performed using SAS to determine if self-reported poor sleep predicted stress, anxiety, emotional support, social isolation, and depression. This study was approved by Baylor College of Medicine IRB. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects involved in the study. Results: Eighty-one adults completed baseline survey, and 54 adults (mean age 55.2Â±18.4 years, 61% female, 70% Caucasian) completed 6-month follow-up survey. At baseline, anxiety had a significant effect on sleep disturbance (0.43Â±0.11, p=0.0001), sleeprelated impairments (0.53Â±0.12, p=0.0001) and ISI (0.28Â±0.08, p=0.0004). Upon follow-up, an increase in ISI predicted higher perceived stress (0.18Â±0.07, p=0.013) and worse anxiety (0.61Â±0.16, p=0.0003). An increase in sleep disturbance predicted a decrease in emotional support (0.25Â±0.12, p=0.038). Additionally, an increase in sleep-related impairments predicted an increase in social isolation (0.39Â±0.11, p=0.0002) and depression (0.57Â±0.07, p&lt;0.0001). Interestingly, only 3 participants tested positive for COVID-19. Conclusion: In this study of sleep medicine clinic patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed that poor sleep predicted greater stress, anxiety, social isolation, and depression along with less emotional support. This study illustrates the importance of addressing stress management, mental health (anxiety, depression), and emotional support when treating sleep medicine clinic patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Teague, T.; Debian, A.; Kokonda, M.; Malhotra, S.; Arentson-Lantz, E.; Shaib, F.; Nowakowski, S.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsac079.677","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sleep; 45(SUPPL 1):A298-A299, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35099,""
"SLEEP QUALITY AND DEPRESSION AMONG HIGHRISK PERINATAL WOMEN: IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted sleep and mood on a global scale. To date, a handful of studies have reported on sleep and mood in perinatal women during the pandemic. They suggest that many pregnant women have poor sleep quality and depression. However, since these studies are cross-sectional with no comparison group, it is difficult to determine whether they are suffering more now. Methods: The current study compared sleep quality and the presence of likely clinical depression in perinatal women from two studies (one prior to the pandemic (~1998)) and one during the pandemic (Aug 2020 - April 2021). All women had a history of MDD/PPD. Sleep quality and depression were ascertained at ~36 weeks and 4 weeks postpartum for both groups. Sleep quality was characterized by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Depression was ascertained by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HRDS) for the non-pandemic group and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) for the pandemic group. PSQI scores were analyzed continuously and categorically, while the depression scales were categorized according to published cutoffs. Results: The Mage = 31.1 (4.2) and did not differ between groups;84% were White. Sleep quality in late pregnancy did not differ between groups (7.62 (3.5) vs 7.16 (3.8), (ns), prepandemic vs pandemic), but they did differ at 1 month PP (7.10 (3.1) vs 8.7 (2.6), P &lt; .001). The number of women who met criteria for depression in late pregnancy differed (28(41.1%) vs 7 (7.5%) X2 = 26.1, P &lt; .001), but not at 1 month PP (9 (13.2%) vs 18(19.3%), X2 = 1.05, P = .31). Sleep quality in late pregnancy was correlated with whether a woman met criteria for depression during pregnancy (r = .22, P = .005), but not at 1-month postpartum (ns). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the pandemic negatively impacted sleep quality in the first month postpartum, but not the rate of depression. We interpret these findings with caution due to varying methodologies. The pre-pandemic group was a RCT of 4 drug treatment groups in postpartum, and the pandemic group women used the SNOOÂ®, a robotic, responsive bassinet.","Okun, M.; Kohl, V.; Wisner, K.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsac079.662","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sleep; 45(SUPPL 1):A292, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35100,""
"SLEEP, MENTAL HEALTH, AND STRESS IN COLLEGE STUDENTS: IMPACT OF COVID-19","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unparalleled impact on sleep, mental health, and stress globally. This has been particularly true among college students. While Universities recognize the surge in mental health visits and high stress, few have evaluated sleep, even though poor sleep is a known contributor to poor mental health and stress. Methods: To address this gap, data from 116 college students were examined for sleep disturbance (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)), as well as stress, depression, and anxiety scores from the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Data were collected between May 2020-October 2021. Results: Participants included N = 10 (8.7%) males and 106 (91.3%) females, Mage = 23.1 (6.5) years. MPSQI scores = 7.8 (2.0) and 7.0 (3.9), for males and females, respectively. As a comparison, prepandemic data from 866 undergraduates from Dietch et al (2016) found a MPSQI = 5.64 (SD = 2.79). Examination of individual components indicate that MTST = 7.06 (1.65) hours, with a range of 1-12. Average bedtime = 10:25PM (44.0 minutes) with a range between 9:00PM-5:00AM, and average waketime = 7:45AM (.09 minutes) with a range between 4:30AM - 2:00PM. SOL was high with 48 (41.0%) indicating an average of 16-30 minutes and 41.8% reporting 31+ minutes. Sixty-seven (57.3%) indicated that they had fairly bad or a very bad time initiating sleep in the past month, while 54 (46.2%) reported difficulty staying asleep at least 2x/week. Medication use at least 3x/ week was noted in 20 (17.1%) of the sample and 50 (42.7%) stated that keeping up their enthusiasm was somewhat or a big problem. MDASS- 21 scores indicate that this sample was in the moderate to severe range for Depression =14.9 (11.4), Anxiety = 12.9 (10.0), and Stress = 19.1 (9.8). As a comparison, Kia-Keating et al., (2018) assessed 1400+ undergraduates and reported depression (M = 4.1, SD = 4.3), anxiety (M = 3.9, SD = 3.6), and stress (M = 6.0, SD = 4.1). Conclusion: Regrettably, undergraduates are experiencing 'long-haul' impacts on sleep, mental health, and stress. Recognition of the enduring struggles is critical if we intend to mitigate a major health crisis among college students.","Okun, M.; Dupy, C.; Sollenberger, A.; Raval, F.; Blide, J.; Gooding, C.

"SYMPTOMS OF INSOMNIA AND DEPRESSION AMONG INDIVIDUALS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS BEFORE AND DURING THE COVID-19 - RESULTS FROM A PROSPECTIVE LONGITUDINAL STUDY","Introduction: There is some - but inconsistent - evidence that sleep and psychological health have deteriorated in the general population as a result of the COVID-19-pandemic and its related social restrictions. In the present study, we investigated whether and to what extent symptoms of insomnia, depression, fatigue, and paresthesia changed from before to during the COVID-19-pandemic among women diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: A total of 90 women with MS (mean age;37.62 (SD = 8.61) years;EDSS score: median: 2.5 (range: 0-6.50)) completed a series of self-rating scales at two time-points: Nine months before the COVID-19-outbreak in May 2019 (baseline) and during the COVID-19-pandemic (study end;12 months after baseline: May 2020). Self-rating questionnaires covered sociodemographic and disease-related information, symptoms of insomnia, depression, fatigue, and paresthesia. Results: Symptoms of depression increased over time (medium effect size: Cohen's d = 0.53), while symptoms of insomnia (small effect size: Cohen's d = 0.43), fatigue (trivial effect size: Cohen's d = 0.19), and paresthesia (trivial effect size: Cohen's d = 0.08) did not. The only predictor for insomnia during the COVID-19-pandemic was insomnia before the COVID-19-pandemic (ÃŸ = 0.36;p = 0.001);the only predictor for depression during the COVID-19-pandemic was insomnia before the COVID-19-pandemic (ÃŸ = 0.66;p = 0.001). Conclusion: Overall, among a sample of female individuals with MS the COVID-19-pandemic and its related social restrictions may have had a modest influence on participants' core concerns of insomnia, depression, fatigue, and paresthesia.","Sadeghi-Bahmani, D.; Mohammadian, Y.; Piri, N.; Bahmani, L.

"DEPRESSION, ANXIETY AND COPING-AVOIDANCE BEHAVIORS ASSOCIATED WITH LONG-TERM INSOMNIA SYMPTOMS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Introduction: Stressful events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can have long-lasting, detrimental effect on sleep. It is important for practitioners to understand how their patients may be stil experiencing residual negative effects of the pandemic to optimize their care. In this study we evaluated how measures of self-reported measures of anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic predicted measures of sleep disturbnce 6 months later among sleep medicine clinic patients. Methods: Between June-November 2020, 81 sleep medicine clinic patients (54.8Â±15.9 y, 44% male, 69% Caucasian) completed an online survey that included PROMIS measures (Sleep Disturbance, Sleep-Related Impairments, Informational Support, Emotional Distress-Anxiety) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Patients were recontacted 6 months later to complete the same surveys. 54 patients (55.2Â±18.4 y, 39% male, 70% Caucasian) completed the follow-up survey and were included in this present analysis. We conducted multivariate regression analyses to determine how the change in self-reported PROMIS measures from baseline during the pandemic were predictive of post-pandemc 6 month follow-up PROMIS measures and ISI. Results: PROMIS depression score at baseline was predictive of both sleep disturbance (0.63 Â± 0.15;p&lt;.0001) and sleep impairment (0.49 Â± 0.18;p=0.01) 6 months later. Baseline brief coping avoidance also predicted 6 month sleep disturbance (0.85 Â± 0.33;p&lt;0.009) and sleep impairment (0.85 Â± 0.33;p=0.014) as well as ISI (0.52 Â± 0.18 units;p=0.006). Baseline anxiety predicted ISI at 6 months (0.25 Â± 0.09 units, p=0.009). Conclusion: Higher levels of self-reported depression, anxiety and coping-avoidance behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic lead to long-lasting increase in sleep disturbance and impairment as well as insomnia. Addressing depression, anxiety and coping behaviors that occur as result as a stressful event is advised to avoid long-term detrimental effects on sleep.","Arentson-Lantz, E.; Kokonda, M.; Debian, A.; Shaib, F.; Nowakowski, S.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsac079.601","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sleep; 45(SUPPL 1):A265, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35103,""
"CHARACTERIZING SLEEP AND MOOD DURING COVID FOR YOUTH WITH ALLERGIC DISEASE","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted the daily lives of children and adolescents. This study aimed to characterize sleep and mood during COVID in youth with asthma and/or eczema at two times: shortly after the lifting of stay at home orders (Summer 2020 [T1]) and after youth returned to school (Winter 2021 [T2]). Methods: Pediatric PROMIS measures (Sleep Disturbances, Sleep- Related Impairment, Anxiety, Depressive Symptoms) and the Pediatric Sleep Practices Questionnaire were administered through REDCap. Parents of younger children (YC, 5-7 years, n=16) completed proxy measures for their children, while older children (OC, 8-12 years, n=16) and adolescents (ADOL, 13-17 years, n=17) completed self-report measures. Results: For YC, mean Sleep Disturbances T-scores significantly decreased between T1 and T2 (62.0 vs. 56.4, p=.02), with no significant changes in the other variables. For OC, there were no significant changes in mean T-scores for any of the outcomes. For ADOL, there was a significant increase in Sleep-Related Impairment between T1 and T2 (52.0 vs. 57.7, p=.003), as well as a significant increase in Depressive Symptoms (48.2 vs. 52.5, p=.04). At T1, technology use prior to bedtime was more common in ADOL (YC=37.5%, OC=37.5%, ADOL=88.2%). At T2, technology use was also more common in ADOL (YC=50.0%, OC=37.5%, ADOL=64.7%), with an increase in YC technology use and a decrease in ADOL technology use observed. Parental presence while falling asleep was greatest in YC at both time points, with no noted changes in any group across time (T1: YC=56.3%, OC=18.8%, ADOL=17.6%;T2: YC=50.0%, OC=25.0%, ADOL=11.8%). Conclusion: This study was limited by a small sample size, but provides some insights into the sleep and mood of children and adolescents with allergic disease during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although YC had fewer sleep disturbances at T2, there was an increase in technology use prior to bedtime. For ADOL, some of the changes in sleep, technology use, and depressive symptoms were likely due to the return to school at T2. Finally, it was notable that multiple OC and ADOL required parental presence to fall asleep. Additional research is needed to understand how the ongoing pandemic is impacting children and adolescents.","Booster, G.; Jump, S.; Meltzer, L.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsac079.513","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sleep; 45(SUPPL 1):A228, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35104,""
"DOES SOCIAL MEDIA USE BEFORE BED LEAD TO SLEEP CONTINUITY DISTURBANCE?","Introduction: Research shows that the use of electronics before bed can negatively impact the circadian rhythm and sleep. Less is known, however, about social media use in relation to sleep continuity disturbance (i.e., insomnia). In the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, social media use increased and updates about the pandemic were easily accessible online. It is possible that social media use before bed could introduce additional psychological stressors due to availability of negative content online and known correlations to depression and anxiety. Thus, the aim of this research was to examine how social media use before bed influenced different subtypes of insomnia during the initial months of the pandemic. Methods: 4,138 adults (mean age = 45.8 years;79% women) completed a national online survey during April - June 2020. Social media use before bed was measured using the first item on the Social Media Engagement questionnaire (i.e., â€œHow often do you use social media in the 15 minutes before you go to sleep?â€). Participants responded to this item based on how many days per week (range = 1-7). Sleep disturbance was assessed using a retrospective sleep diary and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). The sleep diary asked about sleep continuity (e.g., sleep latency, wake after sleep onset, total sleep time) during the past month. Results: Results from separate regression analyses supported that social media use before bed was positively related to greater ISI scores, b = 0.25, t = 8.0, p &lt; 0.001. For example, those who use social media before bed every day reported greater mean ISI scores and sleep latency times (mean ISI = 9.5;SL = 37.5 minutes) compared to those who reported never using social media before bed (mean ISI = 7.7;SL = 27.9 minutes). In contrast, social media use before bed was not related to other sleep continuity variables. Conclusion: The present data supports that social media use before bed is related to insomnia symptoms, specifically difficulty with sleep initiation. These findings are significant as they may help us understand which aspects of insomnia are most vulnerable to the negative impact of online social interactions, especially during a highly stressful period, such as the COVID- 19 pandemic.","Snyder, H.; Walker, J.; Bell, J.; Egeler, M.; Hire, V.; Vargas, I.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsac079.430","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sleep; 45(SUPPL 1):A192-A193, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35105,""
"THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SLEEP HEALTH AND MOOD IN SEDENTARY DESK WORKERS","Introduction: Poor sleep, most commonly insufficient sleep duration or low sleep quality, has been linked with disruptions of mood. However, it is unclear how sleep healthmore broadly, other multiple dimensions of sleepis associated with mood. The purpose of this study was to investigate the associations between sleep health and mood in a sample of desk-working sedentary adults. Methods: This cross-sectional study used baseline data from inactive adults with desk-based jobs (N=125, 49.6% female, 43.9Â±10.6 years) who enrolled in an ongoing clinical trial. Sleep was assessed using validated questionnaires and 7 nights of actigraphy. Collectively, these measures were utilized to assess six different sleep dimensions: regularity, satisfaction, alertness, timing, efficiency, duration. Each dimension was categorized as good or poor. A sleep health score was calculated by summing the number of good dimensions (range: 0-6;higher is better). Mood was assessed using Profile of Mood States (POMS);its 7 subscales (tension, anger, fatigue, depression, esteem-affect, vigor, confusion) were summed (with a constant of 100) to create a Total Mood Disturbance (TMD) score. Multiple linear regression models examined associations between sleep health and mood adjusting for age, gender, and whether pre- or post-COVID-19. Results: The mean sleep health score was 4.7Â±1.1;the mean TMD score was 96.6Â±18.5. Better sleep health was associated with lesser TMD (ÃŸ=-0.32, p&lt;0.001) and better mood on each of the POMS subscales (ÃŸ=0.18, p&lt;0.05), aside from esteem-related affect (p=0.31). Of the individual sleep dimensions, only satisfaction, alertness, and efficiency were associated with TMD (ÃŸ=0.18, p&lt;0.05). Satisfaction was the only individual sleep dimension that was consistently associated with better mood on each subscale (ÃŸ=0.17). Alertness, efficiency, and duration were inconsistently associated with individual mood subscales. Regularity and timing were not associated with any mood subscales (p=0.267 and p=0.073, respectively). Conclusion: Better sleep health was associated with less TMD. Satisfaction was the sleep dimension that consistently associated with each subscale of mood. The cross-sectional, observational design limits casual inference between sleep health and mood disturbance due to a lack of temporality and the potential for residual confounding.","Vogan, O.; Cheruka, C.; Egeler, M.; Kubala, A.; Sanders, R.; Paley, J.; Patel, S.; Hall, M.; Perera, S.; Jakicic, J.; Gibbs, B.; Kline, C.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsac079.251","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sleep; 45(SUPPL 1):A113-A114, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35106,""
"RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PRE-PANDEMIC TRAUMA AND STRESS WITH SLEEP DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN YOUNG ADULTS","Introduction: Young adults, particularly those with histories of interpersonal trauma or stress, are more likely to experience to adverse psychosocial outcomes (e.g., depression) during the COVID- 19 pandemic, compared to those without these histories. However, few studies have examined sleep and most rely on retrospectivelyreported pre-pandemic experiences. We tested whether prepandemic trauma and stress were prospectively related to worse ecological momentary assessment (EMA)-reported sleep during the pandemic. Methods: The sample includes 114 regular drinkers aged 21-30 years from two ongoing studies of alcohol use and sleep who completed a shared assessment battery and a 10-17-day EMA protocol before and during the pandemic (conducted July- November 2020;M=13.9 months after baseline). Participants reported past-month perceived stress (10-item Perceived Stress Scale) and interpersonal traumas (e.g., abuse, conflict), via scores on the Current Partner and Personal (persons other than spouse/ partner) subscales of the Difficult Life Circumstances Scale. The EMA protocol measured daily sleep (total sleep time [TST];sleep efficiency [SE]), relational stress (1-5 ratings for family, spouse/ partner, friends), and alcohol use. Paired t-tests compared prepandemic vs. pandemic sleep. Separate linear regressions tested associations between pre-pandemic trauma and stress with average pandemic TST and SE, adjusted for baseline age and sleep, racial identity, assigned sex at birth, time between assessments, and drinking days (averaged across timepoints). Results: Participants were on average 23.8 years old (61% female;7% Asian;39% Black;1.8% Mixed race;0.9% Other race;0.9% Pacific Islander;55% White). Average TST increased from baseline to pandemic (7.5 vs. 7.8;t(113)=-2.57, p=.01);no change was observed in SE (95% vs. 94%;t(113)=1.01, p=.31). Pre-pandemic perceived stress (B[SE]=-.003[.001], p=.02) and average EMAreported family stress (B[SE]=-.04[.02], p=.05) predicted worse pandemic SE. No associations emerged with friend or partner stress, trauma, or TST (ps&gt;.11). Conclusion: Pre-pandemic perceived stress (but not trauma nor relational stress) predicted worse sleep during the pandemic. Perceived stress reflects feeling overwhelmed and difficulty coping, which is relevant given dramatic pandemic-related impacts on daily life. The overall accumulation of stress, versus day-to-day stress in specific relationships, may be most detrimental for sleep during the pandemic. Perceived stress is amenable to evidence-based (and remotely-delivered) interventions, including mindfulness-based stress reduction.","Jakubowski, K.; Wallace, M.; Pedersen, S.; Hasler, B.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsac079.241","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sleep; 45(SUPPL 1):A109-A110, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35107,""
"SLEEP REACTIVITY PROSPECTIVELY PREDICTS DISTRESS REACTIONS TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 3-4 YEARS LATER","Introduction: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is a protracted stressor with far-reaching effects on daily life. Although most individuals exhibit resilience in the wake of adversity, it is not clear which characteristics reliably predict resilience versus longstanding distress. It is vital to delineate predictors of pandemic-related distress to highlight modifiable risk factors that can be targeted to enhance psychological resilience. Sleep reactivity may be an important predictor of pandemic reactions because it reflects a vulnerability to experience pronounced sleep disturbances in response to stress, which serve as barriers to healthy adjustment to adversity. Therefore, this study tested sleep reactivity as a prospective predictor of pandemic-related distress. Methods: Participants were recruited from a previous randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing self-guided digital CBT-I against a sleep education control in treating insomnia and preventing depression. Participants in the RCT were enrolled between 2016-2017 and were eligible for this follow-up study conducted between April and May 2020 (N = 208;dCBT-I: n = 102;control: n = 106). Pre-treatment sleep reactivity was measured in 2016-2017 (T1) using the Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test (FIRST). COVID-19 distress was measured in April 2020 (T2) using the Impact of Events Scale (IES) and Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS). All analyses controlled for treatment condition and COVID-19 impact. Results: T1 FIRST predicted T2 IES (b = 0.29, + 0.14 SE, p &lt; .05) and QIDS (b = 0.16, + 0.04 SE, p &lt; .001), such that higher sleep reactivity pre-pandemic predicted more severe stress responses and depressive symptoms during the pandemic 3-4 years later. Exploratory analyses revealed T1 FIRST was a predictor of the IES subscales arousal and intrusions (bs = 0.02, + 0.01 SEs, ps &lt; .05), but not avoidance. Conclusion: These findings build on evidence that sleep reactivity prospectively predicts reactions to trauma and demonstrate its predictive utility generalizes to pandemic responses. Sleep reactivity is a modifiable risk factor that may be targeted using cognitivebehavioral or mindfulness-based approaches, and thus may offer a new pathway to resilience.","Reffi, A.; Cheng, P.; Kalmbach, D.; Sultan, Z.; Drake, C.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsac079.235","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sleep; 45(SUPPL 1):A107, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35108,""
"SLEEP QUALITY AND DISTURBANCES, EMOTIONAL REGULATION AND RESILIENCY IN ADOLESCENTS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve internationally, increasing levels of psychological stress in adolescents around the world, and thereby increasing their risk for emotional disorders associated with chronic stress. This ongoing threat to adolescents mental health requires that we identify factors that contribute to their ability to cope with situations shown to carry significant risks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., their resiliency).Negative emotions are associated with chronic stress, and factors that reduce levels of negative emotions are associated with improved resiliency. Healthier sleep is associated with lower levels of negative emotions. Cognitive reappraisal (changing the way one thinks about potentially emotioneliciting events) is an emotional regulation strategy that downregulates negative emotions. However, there is little information about the associations between sleep quality, emotional regulation, and resiliency in adolescents. The present study sought to fill this gap by examining the associations between adolescents sleep quality and disturbances, emotional regulation strategies and adolescents resiliency during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Forty-five adolescents (M=13.47, SD=1.7 years) participated in the study during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada (May 15 to June 30, 2020). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was used to assess adolescents self-reported sleep quality and disturbances. The Emotion Regulation Questionnaire was used to assess respondents' tendencies to regulate their emotions using cognitive reappraisal or expressive suppression. The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale was used to measure resilience. Behavioral/emotional problems were assessed before the pandemic using the Youth Self Report (YSR). Results: Hierarchical multiple linear regression analyses revealed that lower levels of sleep disturbances and frequent use of cognitive reappraisal to regulate emotions were associated with a higher level of resiliency during the COVID-19 pandemic, above and beyond the contributions of gender or pre-pandemic emotional or behavioral problems. Conclusion: Better sleep quality and the habitual use of an emotional regulation strategy that is effective in downregulating negative emotions are associated with higher resiliency in adolescents facing the COVID-19 pandemic. The cross-sectional nature of the study does not allow the inference of causation.","Gauthier-GagnÃ©, G.; Jensen, J.; Somerville, G.; Little, C.; West, G.; Daigneault, J.; Risi, N.; Gruber, R.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsac079.231","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sleep; 45(SUPPL 1):A105, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35109,""
"SPRINGING FORWARD: THE INFLUENCE OF DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME ON TEAM PERFORMANCE IN PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL","Introduction: Daylight Savings Time (DST) has been a well-studied occurrence in United States society. Past literature has documented numerous detriments related to cardiovascular and mental health, as well as heightened accident risk (e.g., traffic, construction, healthcare) due to this time shift. Given the scant research in pro-fessional sports though, the current study examines the impact of DST among National Basketball Association (NBA) teams. Methods: Following the 2011-12 lockout-shortened season, data for all games played during the 2012-13 to 2019-20 NBA sea-sons were collected from the publicly-available sports database, Basketball-Reference. Data from the 2020-21 season were ex -cluded due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. During this period, data from 8,843 games were obtained, with 65 of these games being played the same day as DST. We investigated the influence of DST on points scored, points allowed, and game outcomes for both the home and visiting teams using mixed-winning percentage. Specifically, we compared team performance for games immediately following DST with season averages. Results: For both home and visiting teams, our regression models revealed no meaningful variations in performance between games played following DST and season averages. There were no stat-istically significant differences across points scored (pHome = .98, R2Marginal = .21, R2Conditional = .29;pVisiting = (pHome = .84, R2Marginal = .34, R2Conditional = .42;pVisiting = .44, R2Marginal = .22, R2Conditional = .33), and game outcomes (pHome = .77, R2Marginal = .11, R2Conditional = .11;pVisiting = .71, R2Marginal = .10, R2Conditional = .18). Conclusion: The present analysis offers preliminary evidence that DST may not produce any observable effects on the selected in-dicators of team performance. However, our results could be explained by organizational and athlete sensitivity toward potential compromised performance during games played following DST. Furthermore, our study did not consider other variables that could impact teams (e.g., actual sleep schedules and travel), and was limited by a relatively small sample size of games played on DST. We suggest that future studies examine additional metrics impli -cated in team performance, such as shooting percentages, rebound rates, turnovers, among others.","Pradhan, S.; Alton, D.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsac079.133","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sleep; 45(SUPPL 1):A61, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35110,""
"THE ROLE OF SOCIAL ISOLATION ON SLEEP PROBLEMS INTERFERING WITH DAILY FUNCTIONING","Introduction: Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, widespread feelings of social isolation have become more prevalent than ever before as lockdowns and social distancing measures led people to remain in their homes. The constructs of social isolation and loneliness are similar but reflect slightly different aspects of social experience. Social isolation reflects the amount of social contact a person experiences, whereas loneliness reflects the subjective experience of an emotional yearning for such contact. While is known that sleep problems have increased during the pandemic, there has been little research into the potential effects of social isolation on sleep problems. Here, we examined the influence of social isolation on the extent to which insomnia has interfered with daily life activities. We hypothesized that social isolation would contribute to greater disruption in daily functioning from insomnia, exclusive of the effects of loneliness. Methods: 13,298 English-speaking adults from across the U.S. (18-92 years old;57.5% female) completed an online battery of assessments that included demographic questions, the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and the UCLA Loneliness Scale - Version 3 between April 2020 and April 2021. Participants were grouped based on whether they felt socially isolated or not at the time of assessment. Social isolation groups were compared for the extent that insomnia interfered with daily functioning, while statistically controlling for loneliness. Results: After controlling for loneliness, socially isolated individuals reported much greater daily interference from sleep problems, M=1.58, SD=1.19, compared to those who denied feeling socially isolated, M=0.96, SD=1.04, F(1,13295)=287.67, p=7.5x10-64. Conclusion: Social isolation during the pandemic was associated with significantly greater disruption of daily functioning due to sleep-related issues, even after adjusting for self-reported loneliness. Thus, feeling isolated and lacking social contact was related to functional degradation due to sleep problems. Prior evidence suggests that social isolation can have a dramatic negative impact on mental health and can lead to increased all-cause mortality, but these results suggest social isolation may also impact sleep health and functional outcomes (whether that be physical, cognitive, or psychological). Thus, being isolated during the pandemic was associated with greater degradation of functional outcomes of sleep, regardless of subjective loneliness.","Wellman, C.; Jankowski, S.; Grandner, M.; Reign, D.; Dailey, N.; Killgore, W.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsac079.051","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sleep; 45(SUPPL 1):A24, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35111,""
"THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SLEEP HEALTH AND WORK- AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE IN DESK WORKERS AND DIFFERENCES IN ASSOCIATIONS PRE- AND POST-COVID-19 EMERGENCE","Introduction: COVID-19 resulted in many office workers switching to remote work. Emerging studies report working from home has negatively affected sleep health (SH) and psychological well-being. Our aim was to evaluate the relationship between SH and healthand work-related quality of life and explore whether these associations differed pre- and post-COVID-19 emergence. Methods: Baseline data from 125 adults enrolled pre- (n=59) and post-COVID-19 emergence (n=66) in a clinical trial with desk jobs were included in this analysis (86.4% White;49.6% female;43.9Â±10.7 y). Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was assessed using the SF-36 questionnaire, which addresses eight health concepts (physical, social, and role functioning;mental health;health perceptions;energy or fatigue;pain;general health) and yields 2 summary scales (mental component summary, physical component summary). Workplace productivity and worker health was measured using the Health and Work Questionnaire (HWQ). Six SH dimensions were assessed using questionnaires (satisfaction, alertness) and 7 nights of actigraphy (regularity, timing, efficiency, duration). Each dimension was categorized as good or poor;a composite score was created based on the sum of good SH dimensions. Multiple linear regression models were adjusted for gender and age and stratified by enrollment pre- or post-COVID-19 emergence. Data are presented as standardized coefficients (ÃŸ) and p-values (p). Results: Compared to participants enrolled prior to COVID-19, those enrolled post-COVID-19 had worse SF-36 emotional, social, and general health and greater HWQ-assessed impatience (all p&lt;0.05);however, SH did not differ between those enrolled pre- and post-COVID. Prior to COVID-19, greater SH was associated with higher SF-36 physical component scores (ÃŸ=.389, p=.003);however, no association was observed post-COVID (ÃŸ=.137, p=.271). In contrast, no association was observed pre-COVID between SH and SF-36 mental component scores (ÃŸ=.181, p=.160), but greater SH was associated with greater mental component scores post- COVID (ÃŸ =.308, p=.004). Furthermore, better SH was associated with lower stress post-COVID (ÃŸ =-.423, p&lt;.001). Conclusion: SH was associated with HRQoL and workplace and worker health, though these associations sometimes differed between pre- and post-COVID emergence. Research should explore whether promoting SH in employees impacts their personal and workplace-related quality of life.","Sanders, R.; Vogan, O.; Gibbs, B.

"RELATIONSHIP OF EMOTIONS, SOCIAL ISOLATION, AND COVID-RELATED MEDIA TO SUBJECTIVE SLEEP QUALITY DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic safety restrictions led to changes in social interactions and information seeking about the virus. For some, these led to increased negative emotions, feelings of social isolation, and increased COVID-related media consumption. We examined the relationship of these variables to subjective sleep quality from participant daily diaries kept early in the pandemic. Methods: From April 20th-May 12th, 2020, college (students, faculty/ staff, alumni, parents) and local (churches, community centers, libraries) community members (N=94, 72 women, ages 18-77) completed a 30-minute survey for before and during social distancing (measuring: mental health, personality, social distancing, and demographics) for possible prizes. Participants then completed daily evening and morning diaries for 5-14 days describing daily affect, social isolation, emotion regulation, COVID media consumption, and subjective sleep quality. Results: Emotions: During the pandemic, poor sleep quality was predicted by less positive mood (r(91)=.486, p&lt;.001) and more negative mood (r(91)=-.433, p&lt;.001). Participants with poorer sleep quality reported less success regulating their emotions that day (r(90)=.292, p=.005) and greater suppression of emotions (rather than cognitive reappraisals to regulate them) (r(91)=-.260, p=.012). Social Isolation: Subjective sleep quality was not predicted by social distancing behaviors (r(88)=.069, p&gt;.05);however, poorer sleep quality was significantly predicted by greater daily feelings of social isolation (r(91)=-.264, p=.005) and lower feelings of social life satisfaction (r(91)=.338, p&lt;.001). COVID-related media: Sleep quality was not significantly related to COVID-media consumption for all participants;however, moderation analyses showed that participants with low avoidance coping, low neuroticism, and high emotional well-being did experience poorer sleep quality associated with greater COVID media consumption (all p's&lt;.05). Conclusion: That mood and social isolation are associated with sleep quality replicates previous findings. The pandemic, however, provided a unique opportunity to observe these relationships in individuals not normally socially isolated because of confounding variables (e.g., health issues, depression, anxiety) with known relationships to sleep quality. That COVID-related media was only related to sleep quality for more well-adjusted participants (low avoidance coping, low neuroticism, high emotional well-being) was surprising, suggesting some may find COVID-19 information anxiety-relieving rather than anxiety-provoking.","Peszka, J.; Mastin, D.; Kennedy, L.; Sestir, M.; Harsh, J.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsac079.045","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sleep; 45(SUPPL 1):A21-A22, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35113,""
"EXAMINING THE ASSOCIATION OF TRAIT SLEEP REACTIVITY WITH CHANGES IN SLEEP, DEPRESSION, AND ANXIETY IN THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Introduction: Sleep Reactivity (SR), a trait-like tendency for stressful events to trigger sleep disturbances, is an established diathesis for insomnia and depression. However, no studies to date have examined SR in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and it's related restrictions. Thus, the goal of this analysis is to test whether SR confers a vulnerability for greater sleep and mood symptoms due to the stress of COVID-19 and it's related restrictions. We hypothesized that (1) The onset of the pandemic will trigger greater increases in insomnia symptoms in highly sleep reactive individuals. 2) Sleep-reactive individuals would experience reduced recovery of insomnia, anxiety, and depression symptoms over the course of the pandemic. Methods: SR, insomnia, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were assessed by the Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test (FIRST), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI II), respectively, at two time points (early-pandemic, 6-month follow-up). Additionally, participants retrospectively reported ISI prior to the pandemic. N = 253 adults from Stanford's COVID-19 Pandemic Sleep Study (April-November 2020) provided baseline insomnia measures, and were excluded if they reported pre-pandemic clinical insomnia (ISI &gt;10). Rankedcorrelation tests were used to test the current hypotheses. Paired t-tests were used to evaluate changes in mean insomnia, depression, and anxiety scores. Covariates included essential worker status, sex, and age. Results: ISI after COVID-19 was significantly higher than retrospective, pre-pandemic ISI (t = 8.2, d = 0.55, p &lt; 0.0001). However, SR was not significantly correlated with the pandemic-related increase in ISI (<U+03C1> = 0.07, p = 0.34). Depression significantly increased after 6-months (t = 2.0, d = 0.27, p = 0.047), whereas anxiety did not (t = 1.7, d = 0.26, p = 0.10). Neither changes in depression nor anxiety were predicted by SR (Depression: <U+03C1> = 0.15, p = 0.32;Anxiety: <U+03C1> = -0.13, p = 0.40). Conclusion: Insomnia and depression, but not anxiety, increased with the onset of the pandemic. However, trait SR was not a predisposing factor for pandemic-related sleep and mood changes. This is the first analysis examining SR as a risk factor for insomnia and mood symptoms in the pandemic.","Cirelli, A.; Krause, A.; O'Hora, K.; Osorno, R.; Sadeghi-Bahmani, D.; Lopez, M.; Morehouse, A.; Goldstein-Piekarski, A.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsac079.043","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sleep; 45(SUPPL 1):A21, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35114,""
"PRE-PANDEMIC CIRCADIAN PHASE PREDICTS PANDEMIC SLEEP, DEPRESSION, AND ALCOHOL USE AMONG ADOLESCENTS","Introduction: Growing evidence links later circadian timing during adolescence to worse sleep, more severe depression, and greater alcohol involvement, perhaps due to circadian misalignment and sleep restriction imposed by early school start times. School schedules initially shifted later during the COVID-19 pandemic, which hypothetically should reduce circadian misalignment and sleep restriction for adolescents with later circadian timing, and thus may mitigate any problems with sleep, depression, and alcohol. Here we used the pandemic as a natural experiment to test whether adolescent drinkers with later circadian timing, relative to those with earlier circadian timing, showed improved sleep, depressive symptoms, and alcohol involvement. Methods: We studied 42 high school students reporting alcohol use (aged 16-18;27 female participants), assessing circadian phase via the dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) during prepandemic conditions, and then following them over four remote assessments every 3 months during the pandemic. Sleep characteristics were assessed via the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire, depressive symptoms were assessed via the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, and alcohol use was assessed via a 90-day Timeline Followback. Mixed-effect models focused on the pre-pandemic baseline, COVID baseline (Apr/May 2020), and COVID-9-mo (Jan/Feb 2021) timepoints, and covaried for age, time between pre-pandemic and COVID baselines, and current school/work status. Results: In the pre-pandemic period, compared to those with earlier circadian timing, individuals with later circadian timing (later DLMO) got relatively less sleep (shorter total sleep time) on school nights. During the pandemic, earlier and later groups no longer differed on school night sleep. Over the course of the pandemic, compared to the earlier group, individuals with later circadian timing also reported larger increases in alcohol use (number of drinks, drinking days, and maximum drinks). Individuals with later circadian timing reported relatively greater depressive symptoms both pre-pandemic and 9-months into the pandemic. Conclusion: While individuals with later circadian timing benefitted in terms of more school night sleep during the pandemic, this did not translate to mitigating depression or alcohol use. These findings suggest that later circadian timing may contribute to risk for depression and alcohol use over and above effects due to insufficient sleep.","Hasler, B.; Wallace, M.; Graves, J.; Buysse, D.; Siegle, G.; Clark, D.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsac079.042","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sleep; 45(SUPPL 1):A20-A21, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35115,""
"CHRONOTYPE PREDICTS HEALTH OUTCOMES BUT NOT SLEEP DURATION IN EARLY PANDEMIC SLEEP SCHEDULES","Introduction: Lockdowns associated with the COVID-19 pan-demic allowed for individuals to change their schedules. Chronicity is a trait-like preference for individuals' times of the day for activity and feeling best. As a result of the lockdowns, some individuals were able to adjust their schedule to reflect personal chronotype needs. This study examined whether chronotype predicted sleep duration and health outcomes. Methods: A sample of 304 participants were recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk service to fill out surveys relating to personality and health. Individuals responded with their normal bedtime and waketime for weeknights and weekends and filled out the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ;Horne & Ã–stberg, 1976). Self-reported health outcomes were measured via 9 items on the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS;Cella et al., 2010). Data were cleaned and analyzed via linear regressions in SPSS with age, sex, race, ethnicity and education as covariates. Results: Participants reported an average of 8.52 hours of sleep (SD = 1.97 hours). 35.3% of the sample scored strong- or moder-ately morning-type, 54.7% were neither morning-nor evening-type and 10% scored as evening- or strong-evening types (M = 54.95;SD = 9.42). Results from the PROMIS ranged from 18 to 45 (M = 32.24, SD = 5.49). The model predicting sleep duration (R2 = .06, p = .03) produced a significant effect of ethnicity but not chronicity. Hispanic or Latino ethnicity reported shorter sleep durations relative to those who self-identified as non-Hispanic or Latino. The model predicting PROMIS (general health) scores (R2 = .14, p &lt; .001) produced effects of education (b = .46, p = .04) and Morningness (b = .21, p &lt; .001). People with higher educa-tional levels and those with morning preferences reported better health. Conclusion: Morningness is often associated with better self-regula- tion, lower risky behaviors, better physical and mental health and better sleep. During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdowns allowed many individuals more scheduling flexibility.

"Nationwide Adoption of a Digital Contact Tracing App: Examining the Role of Privacy Concern, Political Trust, and Technology Literacy","Digital contact tracing (DCT) has become an efficient method for authorities to curb COVID-19. However, the current public opinion studies on the adoption of DCT primarily focus on Western countries and rarely explore citizen attitudes in Asian contexts where DCT is often mandatory. Moreover, the existing literature extensively explores how privacy concern negates the adoption of DCT without illuminating the solutions to such barriers. To unveil the mechanisms of DCT adoption, this study explores how Singaporeans' privacy concern, political trust, and technology literacy can influence their attitudes toward TraceTogether (a local DCT program). An analysis of survey data suggests that privacy concern is positively associated with negative attitudes toward DCT. Those with high levels of political distrust also hold negative attitudes toward DCT. Political distrust is also found to positively mediate the relationship between privacy concerns and negative attitudes toward DCT. Finally, moderated mediation findings suggest that the indirect effects of privacy concern on negative attitudes toward DCT via political distrust increase with an increase in technological literacy. Simply put, the indirect effects are stronger for those with higher-tech literacy. We discuss the tension between privacy concerns and public health during the pandemic and propose policy suggestions.","Wang, Y.

"Internally displaced people in Lagos: environmental health conditions and access to healthcare in the context of COVID-19","The paper documents environmental health conditions and healthcare access challenges faced by internally displaced people (IDPs) from Borno State living in informal settlements in Lagos, Nigeria, in 2020, during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. This qualitative study with 32 IDPs suggests a high vulnerability to COVID-19. Their accommodation often lacked basic sanitation including water and toilet facilities;overcrowding and high population density restricted ability to adhere to social distancing;and IDPs experienced serious consequences from lockdown, as the majority depended on daily wages, and did not receive food packages or other support from the State. Finally, there were obstacles to accessing healthcare. We highlight the importance of an integrated approach, consolidating the efforts of communities, non-governmental organisations, environmental and public health, and international organisations to address the health and well-being issues of IDPs in urban informal settlements.","Adejoh, S.

"Enhancing Sharing Capabilities Housing and Neighborhood Planning Opportunities for Improving Health","The global COVID-19 pandemic has led households to find creative ways to share resources to address isolation, stress, and anxiety. We build on these social experiments to suggest that sharing in housing and neighborhoods can lead to better mental health and wellbeing. The capabilities approach, popularized by philosophers Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum, provides a theoretical perspective for integrating sharing options into housing and neighborhood design, regulation, and investment. We offer a framework delineating dimensions of sharing that has the potential to encourage more sharing and shift planning emphasis from housing as an outcome to one that promotes sharing.","Mukhija, V.; Takahashi, L.

"A meta-review of psychological resilience during COVID-19","Psychological resilience has emerged as a key factor in mental health during the global COVID-19 pandemic. However, no work to date has synthesised findings across review work or assessed the reliability of findings based on review work quality, so as to inform public health policy. We thus conducted a meta-review on all types of review work from the start of the pandemic (January 2020) until the last search date (June 2021). Of an initial 281 papers, 30 were included for review characteristic reporting and 15 were of sufficient review quality for further inclusion in strategy analyses. High-level strategies were identified at the individual, community, organisational, and governmental levels. Several specific training and/or intervention programmes were also identified. However, the quality of findings was insufficient for drawing conclusions. A major gap between measuring the psychological resilience of populations and evaluating the effectiveness of strategies for those populations was revealed. More empirical work, especially randomised controlled trials with diverse populations and rigorous analyses, is strongly recommended for future research.","Seaborn, Katie, Henderson, Kailyn, Gwizdka, Jacek, Chignell, Mark","https://doi.org/10.1038/s44184-022-00005-8","","Database: Pmc; Publication type: article; Publication details: npj Mental Health Research; 1(1):5-5, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35120,""
"A Longitudinal Investigation of Resilience as a Protective Factor During the COVID-19 Pandemic","COVID-19 is a global stressor that has been shown to impact mental health outcomes. Given that COVID-19 is a unique stressor that has been shown to have mental health consequences, identifying protective factors is imperative. The protective influences of resilience are demonstrated through the extant literature, though less is known about resilience and COVID-19 impact. The current study seeks to expand the existing literature on resilience, and on mental health outcomes influenced by COVID-19, by longitudinally investigating relative resilience as a buffer against posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and alcohol consumption, in the wake of a global pandemic. Participants included 549 undergraduates with a history of lifetime trauma exposure. Using a longitudinal path model, we tested the interaction between relative resilience (i.e., an individual's deviation from distress levels predicted by prior trauma exposure relative to other individuals in the same cohort) and COVID-19 impact domains (i.e., social media use, worry, exposure, change in substance use, and housing/food insecurity) on PTSD symptoms and alcohol consumption. Findings demonstrate a significant interaction between the COVID-19 worry impact domain and baseline resilience on later PTSD symptoms, whereby COVID-19 worry impacts PTSD symptoms at low levels of resilience (beta = .26, p &lt; .001), marginally impacts PTSD symptoms at mean levels of resilience (beta = .09, p = .05), and does not impact PTSD symptoms at high levels of resilience (beta = -.08, p = .16). There were no significant main effects nor interaction effects of resilience on alcohol consumption. This article adds to the literature on resilience and COVID-19 through examining both internalizing (i.e., PTSD) and substance use outcomes, using longitudinal data, and using a quantitative measure of resilience.","Cusack, S.

"Vulnerable Group Members Coping With COVID-19 in Jamaica: A Qualitative Study","As COVID-19 pandemic continues, documentation about the experiences and coping strategies of members of vulnerable groups is needed to inform appropriate interventions. This study's aims were to describe the lived experiences of persons from these groups during the pandemic;to describe the strategies and interventions that authorities, family members, and caregivers used to support them;and to identify opportunities for collaboration and closing gaps in care. Data for this study were collected as part of a larger study on health risk communication for vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. Semistructured interviews focusing on three purposefully selected administrative areas were conducted remotely using Zoom, WhatsApp video, or telephone call for the majority of participants, and with appropriate safety protocols in place where necessary. A sign language interpreter assisted. Vulnerable persons (n(older persons) = 9, n(deaf persons) = 2, n(blind persons) = 3, n(persons with a physical disability) = 6, n(persons with a mental illness) = 5) and nine key informants from advocates and service providers shared perspectives about experiences, resources, unmet needs, and gaps for these target groups. Inductive thematic analysis indicated that members of vulnerable groups experienced stigma and societal insensitivity, fears of contracting COVID-19, social isolation, and emotional distress, exacerbated by diminished resources and increased barriers to accessing necessary services and support during the pandemic. Deductive thematic analysis (using the American Psychological Association recommendations for eliminating disparities in mental health status and care) highlighted the need for increased research and partnerships that incorporate the voices of the vulnerable for the development of evidence-informed, segmented strategies and interventions, and mechanisms for more equitable access to support.","Govia, I.; Palmer, T.; Stubbs, M.; Harris, M.; Bogle, D.; Miller, S.; Walters, C.; Muir, S.

"The Impact of Reduced Working Hours and Furlough Policies on Workers' Mental Health at the Onset of COVID-19 Pandemic: A Longitudinal Study","Although reduced working time and furlough policy initiatives are widely regarded as important for economic and business reasons, little is known about their impacts on workers' mental health at the onset of COVID-19 pandemic. Using data from the UK Household Longitudinal Panel Study data from 2018 to February 2020 and April 2020 and change score analysis, this study aims to compare mental health changes between those who worked reduced hours, were furloughed and left/lost paid work. The results suggest that at the onset of COVID-19 reduced working time and furlough can protect workers' mental health, but only for men not for women. The gender differences remain significant even after controlling for housework and childcare responsibilities at the onset of COVID-19. These results highlight the importance of distributing paid work more equitably and formulating gender-sensitive labour market policies in protection of workers' mental health.","Wang, S.

"Levels of depression, anxiety, and psychological distress among Ugandan adults during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic: cross-sectional evidence from a mobile phone-based population survey","Objectives. Policy measures to slow the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), such as curfews and business closures, may have negative effects on mental health. Populations in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) may be particularly affected due to high rates of poverty and less comprehensive welfare systems, but the evidence is scarce. We evaluated predictors of depression, anxiety, and psychological distress in Uganda, which implemented one of the world's most stringent lockdowns. Methods. We conducted a mobile phone-based cross-sectional survey from December 2020 through April 2021 among individuals aged 18 years or over in Uganda. We measured depression, anxiety, and psychological distress using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-2, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)-2, and the PHQ-4. We applied linear regression to assess associations between experiences of COVID-19 (including fear of infection, social isolation, income loss, difficulty accessing medical care, school closings, and interactions with police) and PHQ-4 score, adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics. Results. 29.2% of 4066 total participants reported scores indicating moderate psychological distress, and 12.1% reported scores indicating severe distress. Distress was most common among individuals who were female, had lower levels of education, and lived in households with children. Related to COVID-19, PHQ-4 score was significantly associated with difficulty accessing medical care, worries about COVID-19, worries about interactions with police over lockdown measures, and days spent at home. Conclusions. There is an urgent need to address the significant burden of psychological distress associated with COVID-19 and policy responses in LMICs. Pandemic mitigation strategies must consider mental health consequences.","Clarke-Deelder, E.; Rokicki, S.; McGovern, M. E.; Birabwa, C.; Cohen, J.

"Patient Impact and Economic Burden of Waiting for Cataract Surgery in Canada: A Targeted Literature Review","Objectives: To collate and review published evidence to assess patient impact and economic burden of cataract surgery wait times in Canada. Methods: A targeted literature search was conducted using PubMed from January 1, 2007â€“December 10, 2021, and supplemented by grey literature search. Included studies were those reporting Canada-specific data. Results: Overall, six publications were included. All 6 reported patient impact related to waiting for cataract surgery in Canada, including decline in visual acuity(n=4);greater risk of falls(n=4), motor vehicle accidents(n=3), and depression(n=3);reduced quality life(n=3);interference with treating other eye diseases such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and AMD(n=1);permanent disability(n=1);and even increased risk of death(n=1). Eye Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario (2018) also highlighted challenges recent ophthalmology graduates face to secure operating room time. This can potentially lead to a lack of surgical competency resulting in more complications, greater incidence of unsuccessful surgeries, decline in ophthalmologists able to perform cataract surgery, and ultimately longer wait times. Canadian Council of the Blind reported an estimated 143,000 necessary eye surgeries missed or delayed in 2020 due to COVID-19, resulting in increased risk of vision loss (vision loss costing $27,251/person/year). Itâ€™s also projected from 2021 to 2023, costs of vision loss due to additional wait times of ophthalmic surgeries (most specifically cataract surgery) will be $520.2 million annually in Canada;owing 85% of these costs to loss of well-being ($442.2 million/year) and the remainder to direct healthcare system costs ($78 million/year). Further, average costs incurred by someone with vision loss until they receive surgery is $54/day. Conclusions: Increased cataract surgery wait times in Canada has negative implications, including worse patient outcomes and increased patient and healthcare system costs. There remains an urgent need to reduce wait times to ensure timely treatment access for individuals undergoing cataract surgery in Canada.","Mills, K.; Dhariwal, M.; Gill, R.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2022.04.1714","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Value in Health; 25(7):S613, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35126,""
"PCR63 Adoption and Use of a Digital Health Tool (HEALTH STORYLINES) for Self Management By People with Schizophrenia","Objectives: There is often an assumption that remote monitoring is challenging to implement among individuals with schizophrenia, due to symptoms such as paranoia and suspicion of technology, however the promise of digital approaches for passive and real-time data collection has recently been emphasized as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and increased need for digitally-enabled approaches to care and research. This research describes the use of a mHealth app by a self-selected population of users with Schizophrenia to assess the feasibility of using mobile apps for remote monitoring and research. Methods: Data from Health Storylines users between 2016-2021 who self-identified as being diagnosed with Schizophrenia is described. Data includes quantitative tracking and free text journal entries from tools designed to support the self-management of a variety of health conditions, including Schizophrenia. Results: 5,012 app users reported Schizophrenia as a diagnosed condition, all of whom reported having additional comorbidities with 70% reporting two comorbid conditions. The most frequently reported comorbidities are Anxiety disorder, Depression, Bipolar Disorder and ADD/ADHD. The three most commonly used tools were the Medication Tracker, Symptom Tracker, and Daily Moods. The most commonly reported symptoms were Hallucinations, Paranoid behavior, Hearing voices, Anxiety, Depressed mood and Delusions. Among the qualitative data, several broad themes were consistently the most frequently reported across the duration of the time period examined: Psychosocial impact of the condition, Quality of life, and Experience of the condition. Conclusions: This descriptive analysis of patient engagement with the Health Storylines app reveals that many people with Schizophrenia are willing and able to engage in mobile health technology for the purpose of self-monitoring, engagement, and research. Further research is required to understand the degree of representation of the full spectrum of patientsâ€™ experience with Schizophrenia, and the role of patient engagement in completeness and quality of data collected using mobile health apps.","Willmon, R.; Gorla, J.; Jardine, N.; Adams, J.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2022.04.1408","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Value in Health; 25(7):S552, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35127,""
"CO8 Health-Related Quality of Life Reported By Patients of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS)","Objectives: Pandemic circumstances induce the increased prevalence of chronic diseases due to the limitations in accessibility of outpatient treatment and the frequently detected long-term consequences of COVID-19 infection. Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), as one of the proven consequences of COVID-19, is a disease characterised by chronic fatigue not alleviated by rest, and multi-system disorder leading to deterioration in quality of life. The aim of this research is to evaluate the Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL) of the patients suffered by ME/CFS. Methods: Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were collected through the survey performed in Latvia (project No lzp-2019/1-0380). Diagnostics of ME/CFS is complicated and occasionally imprecise, therefore 74 patients with symptomatically similar diagnoses were involved in the survey (ICD-10 code G93.3, R53 and B94.8). Patients were asked to rate their HRQL on a scale from 1 to 100 (100â€”the best possible HRQL, and 1â€”the worst) for the year prior to onset of illness, and for the current state. The detailed current level of HRQL was assessed by EuroQol-5D-5L measure (1â€”the best possible option, and 5â€”the worst). Descriptive and analytical statistical methods were utilised for analysis of obtained data. Results: PROs demonstrated the mean HRQLâ€”74.6 (SD 24.0, 95% CI 69.0â€“80.2) for the year prior to illness and 57.3 (SD 16.3, 95% CI 53.5â€“61.1) for the current state. The initial relatively low HRQL slightly corelates with the overall HRQL of Latvian population, as Eurostat data discover that only 47.1% of Latvians report good or very good health state (EU average measure is 68.6%). The data of EuroQol-5D-5L of ME/CFS patients were in diapason from 2.9 (self-care) to 3.3 (anxiety/depression). Conclusion: The results indicate the relatively poor HRQL in ME/CFS, and due to disease progress, coverage predictably will affect a significant ratio of people of working age.","Araja, D.; Berkis, U.; Murovska, M.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2022.04.106","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Value in Health; 25(7):S305, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35128,""
"Investigation and analysis of cognitive function and psychological status in stroke patients with COVID-19","Objective To investigate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with stroke and the changes of cognitive function and mental state within 6 months after discharge. Methods Retrospective analysis of 32 patients with COVID-19 complicated with stroke in the Third people's Hospital of Hubei Province from January 21 to June 1, 2020, and 32 patients with COVID-19 patients without stroke and 32 common pneumonia patients complicated with stroke treated in the same period as the control group. The clinical data and experimental parameters in the hospital were counted. They were followed up within 6 months after discharge, and the cognitive function of the patients was evaluated by Montreal cognitive function evaluation form, GAD-7 extensive anxiety scale and PHQ-9 depression scale, to test the psychological state of patients. The significant differences under three scores of the groups were analyzed, and the related risk factors of anxiety and depression were analyzed by binary logistic regression. Results Kruskal-wallisH test showed that there was a significant difference in cognitive score, anxiety score, depression score among groups(P&lt;0. 05). Binary logistic regression analysis showed that female gender (PÂ =Â 0.004) and COVID-19 infection(P &lt; 0.001) were independent risk factors for anxiety and depression in stroke population. Conclusion COVID-19 was indeed associated with prognosis anxiety and depression, but not with cognitive impairment. Women and patients with COVID-19 infection were independent factors of anxiety and depression in stroke population. There are serious negative emotions such as anxiety and depression within 6 months after discharge, and there are still many psychological problems. After discharge, taking corresponding psychological intervention for patients can maintain their mental health and promote disease rehabilitation.","Fanji, Kong, Xiaolong, Yao, Jun, Li","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2022.106657","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Stroke and Cerebrovascular Diseases;: 106657, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35129,""
"COVID-19 perceptions and vaccine hesitancy: Acceptance, attitude and barriers among Cameroonians","Background Information about Camerooniansâ€™ views toward COVID-19 and amenability to receiving a vaccine is emerging. Learning more about Camerooniansâ€™ vaccine perspectives could guide prevention messaging and facilitate optimal communication modalities. Objectives The primary objective of this study was to analyze willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine among Cameroonians, pending availability. The secondary objectives were to assess perceptions of COVID-19â€™s origin and to gauge views toward government-mandated vaccinations. Methods An 11-item questionnaire queried Cameroonians in-person and online, from March through May 2021, about their demographics and whether they believed COVID-19 was man-made, if COVID-19 vaccinations should be governmentally mandated, and if they would receive a COVID-19 vaccine, if available. A free text option inviting rationales for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was included. In-person participation took place on the grounds of St. Louis University in Douala, Cameroon, and was restricted to participants lacking internet access or electronic mobile devices. Online participation included use of an electronic link that contained questionnaire content located within Google Forms. Results 591 respondents participated by replying to at least eight items on the questionnaire, 386 online and 205 in-person. Over 80% stated they previously received a seasonal influenza vaccine. Roughly, 87% reported unwillingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, if available. Approximately 95% of respondents disagreed with governmental mandates on COVID-19 vaccinations. About 75% attributed COVID-19 to man-made as opposed to natural beginnings. Seven respondentsâ€™ free text comments cited lacking confidence in a COVID-19 vaccine;discriminatory COVID-19 vaccine distribution patterns in other parts of the world relative to Africa;and improper COVID-19 vaccine approval timeline. Conclusion Raising awareness of COVID-19 misconceptions and barriers to vaccine acceptance is integral to accomplishing immunization goals. Camerooniansâ€™ pessimism in this study towards COVID-19 vaccination was multifaceted.

"Living through the psychological consequences of COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review of effective mitigating interventions","This review assesses interventions and their effectiveness in mitigating psychological consequences from pandemic. Published English literatures were searched from four databases (Medline, PubMed, Embase and PsycINFO) from January 2020 and September 2021. A total of 27 papers with 29 studies (one paper reported three studies) met inclusion criteria. Cochrane risk-of-bias tool is applied to assess the quality of all randomised controlled trials (RCT). All studies were recently conducted in 2020. Publications were from high-income (13, 44.8%), upper middle-income (12, 41.4%) and lower middle-income countries (3, 10.3%) and global (1, 3.5%). Half of the studies conducted for general population (51.7%). One-third of studies (8, 27.6%) provided interventions to patients with COVID-19 and 20.7% to healthcare workers. Of the 29 studies, 14 (48.3%) were RCT. All RCTs were assessed for risk of biases; five studies (15, 35.7%) had low risk as measured against all six dimensions reflecting high-quality study.Of these 29 studies, 26 diagnostic or screening measures were applied; 8 (30.9%) for anxiety, 7 (26.9%) for depression, 5 (19.2%) for stress, 5 (19.2%) for insomnia and 1 (3.8%) for suicide. Measures used to assess the baseline and outcomes of interventions were standardised and widely applied by other studies with high level of reliability and validity. Of 11 RCT studies, 10 (90.9%) showed that anxiety interventions significantly lowered anxiety in intervention groups. Five of the six RCT studies (83.3%) had significantly reduced the level of depression. Most interventions for anxiety and stress were mindfulness and meditation based. Results from RCT studies (11%, 78.6%) were effective in mitigating psychological consequences from COVID-19 pandemic when applied to healthcare workers, patients with COVID-19 and general population. These effective interventions can be applied and scaled up in other country settings through adaptation of modes of delivery suitable to country resources, pandemic and health system context.","Lekagul, Piancharoen, Chattong, Suradom, Tangcharoensathien","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-060804","20220726","COVID-19; mental health; psychiatry; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35131,""
"Changes in perinatal mental healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic: a protocol for a collaborative research study between the COST actions RISEUP-PPD and DEVOTION","Significant changes in routine maternity care have been introduced globally in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce infection risk, but also due to lack of medical facilities, staff shortages and the unpredictable nature of the disease. However, it is yet to be established if specialised perinatal mental health (PMH) services have been similarly affected. As a Task Force in PMH and COVID-19 pandemic within Riseup-PPD COST Action, this study aims to identify changes in PMH practices, policies and protocols during the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. An online survey of experts in the PMH who are members of the COST Action 'Riseup-PPD' and the COST Action ''DEVOTION"" across 36 European countries will be conducted. A questionnaire on changes in PMH care practices during the COVID-19 Pandemic will be administered. It consists of open-ended questions, checklists and ratings on a 7-point scale addressing seven domains of interest in terms of PMH: (1) policies, guidelines and protocols; (2) PMH care practices at a national level; (3) evidence of best practice; (4) barriers to usual care; (5) resources invested; (6) benefits of investment in the policies and (7) short-term and long-term expectations of the policies. Data will be collected using Qualtrics. Descriptive statistics will be reported and differences between countries will be examined using the Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> statistic or Student's t-test. Ethical approval was obtained from The Ethics Committee for Research in Life and Health Sciences of the University of Minho (Portugal) to undertake an anonymous online survey. The findings will be disseminated to professional audience through peer-review publication and presentations and shared widely with stakeholders, policy-makers and service user groups. A position paper will be developed to influence policy-making at a European level to alleviate the adversities caused by COVID-19.

"[COVID-19 and Bipolar Affective Disorder: Subjective Changes in Lifestyle Variables During the First Lockdown During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Austria]","The COVID-19 pandemic with its protective measures (e.Ã¢â‚¬â€°g. lockdown) had far-reaching effects on everyone's well-being. The aim of this study was to examine lifestyle variables during the first Austrian lockdown in patients with bipolar disorder in comparison to a healthy control group and to assess subjective changes caused by the pandemic. At the beginning of April 2020, an online survey of n=75 participants (35 people with bipolar disorder and 40 healthy controls) with standardized questionnaires (Beck Depression Inventory-2, Food Craving Inventory, Altman Self Rating Mania Scale) as well as non-standardized COVID-19-specific questions on the subject of ""Psychological stress and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in bipolar disorder"" was created and distributed via LimeSurvey. Both groups reported a negative impact on their mental health. The participants with bipolar disorder showed significantly higher values in the Beck Depression Inventory-2 score (p&lt;0,001), in emotional distress due to social distancing (p=0,003) and significantly lower values in muscle-strengthening exercise (p=0,039) and in sport units (p=0,003) compared to the control group. In addition, patients with bipolar disorder smoked more often than individuals of the control group. People with bipolar disorder were 42,9% more likely to report they were less efficient during the pandemic, and 22,9% experienced weight gain compared to before the pandemic. The control group, on the other hand, was less efficient at 17,5% and 5,0% reported weight gain. However, a comparison with pre-pandemic data showed a decrease in food craving in both groups. This study provided first evidence of self-reported adverse effects on mental stress and lifestyle in people with bipolar disorder at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychiatric care and early interventions for patients with bipolar disorder would be particularly important in times of crisis in order to help maintain a healthy lifestyle and thus counteract unfavourable developments. Die COVID-19-Pandemie mit ihren SchutzmaÃƒÅ¸nahmen (z.Ã¢â‚¬â€°B. Lockdown) hat einen weitreichenden Einfluss auf die Befindlichkeit aller Menschen. Das Ziel dieser Studie war es, Lebensstilvariablen wÃƒÂ¤hrend des ersten ÃƒÂ¶sterreichischen Lockdowns bei Patient*innen mit bipolarer Erkrankung im Vergleich zu einer gesunden Kontrollgruppe zu untersuchen und subjektive VerÃƒÂ¤nderungen durch die Pandemie zu erheben. Anfang April 2020 wurde eine Online-Befragung mit 75 Teilnehmer*innen (35 Patient*innen und 40 Kontrollpersonen) mit standardisierten FragebÃƒÂ¶gen (Beck Depression Inventory-2, Food Craving Inventory, Altman Self Rating Mania Scale) sowie nicht-standardisierten COVID-19-spezifischen Fragen zum Thema Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Psychische Belastung und Auswirkungen der COVID-19-Pandemie bei bipolarer StÃƒÂ¶rungÃ¢â‚¬Å“ per LimeSurvey durchgefÃƒÂ¼hrt. Beide Gruppen gaben an, dass sich die Pandemie negativ auf ihre psychische Gesundheit ausgewirkt habe. Die Studienteilnehmer*innen mit bipolarer StÃƒÂ¶rung zeigten signifikant hÃƒÂ¶here Werte im Beck Depression Inventory-2 (p&lt;0,001), in der emotionalen Belastung durch die rÃƒÂ¤umliche Distanzierung (p=0,003) und signifikant niedrigere Werte im Kraftsport (p=0,039) sowie im Sport generell (p=0,003) im Vergleich zur Kontrollgruppe. AuÃƒÅ¸erdem rauchten Patient*innen mit bipolarer Erkrankung wÃƒÂ¤hrend dieser Zeit kompensatorisch mehr als Personen der Kontrollgruppe. Personen mit bipolarer StÃƒÂ¶rung gaben mit 42,9% hÃƒÂ¤ufiger an, wÃƒÂ¤hrend der Pandemie weniger leistungsfÃƒÂ¤hig zu sein, und 22,9% verzeichneten eine Gewichtszunahme im Vergleich zu vor der Pandemie. Die Kontrollgruppe war hingegen mit 17,5% weniger leistungsfÃƒÂ¤hig und 5,0% berichteten ÃƒÂ¼ber eine Gewichtszunahme. Ein Vergleich mit PrÃƒÂ¤-Pandemie-Daten zeigte jedoch eine Abnahme im Food Craving in beiden Gruppen. Diese Studie lieferte erste Hinweise auf die psychische Belastung und auf die ungÃƒÂ¼nstigen Auswirkungen auf den Lebensstil von Menschen mit einer bipolaren StÃƒÂ¶rung zu Beginn der COVID-19-Pandemie. Eine psychiatrische Betreuung und Erste-Hilfe-MaÃƒÅ¸nahmen fÃƒÂ¼r Patient*innen mit psychischer StÃƒÂ¶rung wÃƒÂ¤ren gerade in Krisenzeiten wichtig, um einen gesunden Lebensstil zu pflegen und so ungÃƒÂ¼nstigen Entwicklungen gegenzusteuern.","Ortner, Bengesser, Wagner-Skacel, Fellendorf, Fleischmann, Ratzenhofer, Lenger, Queissner, Tmava-Berisha, Platzer, Maget, Pilz, Birner, Reininghaus, Dalkner","https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1871-9628","20220726","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35134,""

"Adapting PC CARES to Continue Suicide Prevention in Rural Alaska During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Narrative Overview of an In-Person Community-Based Suicide Prevention Program Moving Online","This paper presents how a community mobilization program to prevent suicide was adapted to an online format to accommodate the impossibility of in-person delivery in Alaska Native communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. The intervention, Promoting Community Conversations About Research to End Suicide (PC CARES), was created collaboratively by researchers and Alaska Native communities with the goal of bringing community members together to create research-informed and community-led suicide prevention activities in their communities. To continue our work during the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions, we adapted the PC CARES model to a synchronous remote delivery format. This shift included moving from predominantly Alaska Native participants to one of a mainly non-Native school staff audience. This required a pivot from Alaska Native self-determination toward cultural humility and community collaboration for school-based staff, with multilevel youth suicide prevention remaining the primary aim. This reorientation can offer important insight into how to build more responsive programs for those who are not from the communities they serve. Here, we provide a narrative overview of our collaborative adaptation process, illustrated by data collected during synchronous remote facilitation of the program, and reflect on how the shift in format and audience impacted program delivery and content. The adaptation process strove to maintain the core animating features of self-determination for Alaska Native communities and people as well as the translation of scientific knowledge to practice for greater impact.","Wells, White, Schmidt, Rataj, McEachern, Wisnieski, Garnie, Kirk, Moto, Wexler","https://doi.org/10.5820/aian.2902.2022.126","20220726","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35137,""
"Mental health support for Canadian postsecondary students during COVID-19 pandemic: An environmental scan","This study explored how Canada's postsecondary institutions have informed students about campus mental health (MH) services via websites and social media during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a Web-based environmental scan of 20 universities and 24 colleges across the province of Ontario, Canada, between October 2020 and July 2021. 91% of the institutions offered virtual counseling services and 84% offered general psychoeducational resources, whereas only 55% had COVID-19 specific MH resources. Larger institutions had more MH support to students than small schools. There was a trend toward outsourcing counseling and emergency services to external professionals via apps and hotlines. Limited MH information was available for out-of-province and international students. It is vital for equitable campus MH services to address unique MH challenges associated with the crisis and intentional outreach to students with special circumstances. Schools can leverage peer support and self-help to promote student mental well-being.","Seko, Meyer, Bonghanya, Honiball","https://doi.org/10.1080/07448481.2022.2103379","20220726","COVID-19 pandemic; Campus mental health services; environmental scan; postsecondary schools","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35138,""

"Response and ongoing skills use following a single-session virtual cognitive behavioral workshop for graduate students","Graduate students frequently experience anxiety, depression, and psychological distress. Counseling centers struggle to meet this need. Brief, skills-based treatments to mitigate burgeoning or mild mental health problems could alleviate this problem. Participants were 51 graduate students in years one through seven of their respective programs. We examined a single-session virtual cognitive behavioral workshop and outcomes up to 6-months later. The program was feasible, acceptable, and beneficial for mood, anxiety, and emotion regulation, even during the COVID-19 pandemic. A majority of participants reported ongoing skills use at follow-up. Primary barriers to more frequent use were forgetting, time constraints, and difficulty when experiencing strong emotions. Few participants endorsed expecting that skills would not be helpful or forgetting how to use skills. This intervention may provide scalable, much needed aid to graduate schools.

"College students' intent to intervene with a hypothetical peer exhibiting depression: Leveraging lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic","This study assesses college students' intent to intervene when presented with a hypothetical peer exhibiting depression in one of three scenarios: depression, sadness, and depression in quarantine during COVID-19. Using the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), variations in constructs associated with intent were examined by context (external triggers vs. no trigger), knowledge of, and experience with depression. One hundred and sixteen health sciences students read three vignettes and completed an enhanced TPB questionnaire. Intent to intervene was greater when the vignette target was experiencing depression with external stressors. Prior experience with depression and knowing someone with depression were associated with greater intent to connect the hypothetical peer to counseling resources regardless of vignette scenario. Due to increased mental health concerns resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, efforts promoting awareness of mental illness in peers may benefit from increasing education about stressors and causes of depression that may not be observable.","Blackstone, Stocks, Johnson, Henry","https://doi.org/10.1080/07448481.2022.2094201","20220726","COVID-19 mental health; Depression; college students; mental health education; theory of planned behavior","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35141,""
"Oncology provider experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic upended nearly all aspects of daily life and of medical care, placing a double burden of professional and personal concerns on those who provide medical care. We set out to assess the burden of the pandemic on provider outlook and understand how cancer survivorship providers experienced rapid changes to practice. We distributed a survey through the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer (CoC) to its accredited organizations in mid-October 2020. We included questions on provider characteristics, changes in patient care practices resulting from the pandemic, worry about COVID-19, and concern about impact on cancer survivors. Of the n = 607 participants, three-quarters were female and three-quarters were White. Only 2.1% of participants reported having had COVID-19, but 43% reported anxiety about getting COVID-19 and over a quarter experienced sadness or depression, anxiety about the future, changes to sleep, difficulty concentrating, or social isolation. Approximately half of providers also expressed significant concern about progression of cancer in patients who experienced care delays or were afraid of accessing in-person care. In terms of changes to survivorship care, respondents reported changes to visitor policies, delays or cancellations, and efforts to reduce in-person visits. COVID-19 has taken a significant toll on front-line healthcare professionals, including oncologists and cancer care allied health professionals. Findings support proactive mental health support of healthcare professionals as well as emergency preparedness to manage delays to care for cancer patients in the event of future unexpected pandemics.","Arem, Moses, Nekhlyudov, Killackey, Sieloff, Cisneros, Pratt-Chapman","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0270651","20220726","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35142,""
"What might COVID-19 patients experience after recovery? A comprehensive review","The objective of this review was to describe the COVID-19 complications after recovery. The researchers systematically reviewed studies that reported post-COVID-19 complications from three databases: PubMed, Google Scholar and the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 database. The search was conducted between 21 November 2020 and 14 January 2021. Inclusion criteria were articles written in English, with primary data, reporting complications of COVID-19 after full recovery. The review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) 2020 statement. This review included 69 studies with 146 725 patients from 22 countries related to post-COVID-19 complications. Thirty-six studies reported post-cure respiratory complications, ranging from dyspnoea to residual pulmonary fibrosis. Cardiac symptoms were reported in nine studies, including palpitation, chest pain and diastolic dysfunction. Neurological complications included post-traumatic stress syndrome, anxiety, depression, memory issues, insomnia and sleeping disturbance, cognitive impairments and stigma. Gastrointestinal symptoms included nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and acute liver injury. The physical decline was the most common symptom reported in the musculoskeletal complications. COVID-19 may cause several types of complications after recovery (testing negative PCR). The identified complications include respiratory, neurological/mental, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, musculoskeletal and miscellaneous complications. However, the key impairments were pulmonary consequences, psychological problems and exercise intolerance.

"Systematic voiding programme in adults with urinary incontinence following acute stroke: the ICONS-II RCT","Urinary incontinence affects around half of stroke survivors in the acute phase, and it often presents as a new problem after stroke or, if pre-existing, worsens significantly, adding to the disability and helplessness caused by neurological deficits. New management programmes after stroke are needed to address urinary incontinence early and effectively. The Identifying Continence OptioNs after Stroke (ICONS)-II trial aimed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a systematic voiding programme for urinary incontinence after stroke in hospital. This was a pragmatic, multicentre, individual-patient-randomised (1Ã¢â‚¬â€°:Ã¢â‚¬â€°1), parallel-group trial with an internal pilot. Eighteen NHS stroke services with stroke units took part. Participants were adult men and women with acute stroke and urinary incontinence, including those with cognitive impairment. Participants were randomised to the intervention, a systematic voiding programme, or to usual care. The systematic voiding programme comprised assessment, behavioural interventions (bladder training or prompted voiding) and review. The assessment included evaluation of the need for and possible removal of an indwelling urinary catheter. The intervention began within 24 hours of recruitment and continued until discharge from the stroke unit. The primary outcome measure was severity of urinary incontinence (measured using the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire) at 3 months post randomisation. Secondary outcome measures were taken at 3 and 6 months after randomisation and on discharge from the stroke unit. They included severity of urinary incontinence (at discharge and at 6 months), urinary symptoms, number of urinary tract infections, number of days indwelling urinary catheter was in situ, functional independence, quality of life, falls, mortality rate and costs. The trial statistician remained blinded until clinical effectiveness analysis was complete. The planned sample size was 1024 participants, with 512 allocated to each of the intervention and the usual-care groups. The internal pilot did not meet the target for recruitment and was extended to March 2020, with changes made to address low recruitment. The trial was paused in March 2020 because of COVID-19, and was later stopped, at which point 157 participants had been randomised (intervention, <i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°79; usual care, <i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°78). There were major issues with attrition, with 45% of the primary outcome data missing: 56% of the intervention group data and 35% of the usual-care group data. In terms of the primary outcome, patients allocated to the intervention group had a lower score for severity of urinary incontinence (higher scores indicate greater severity in urinary incontinence) than those allocated to the usual-care group, with means (standard deviations) of 8.1 (7.4) and 9.1 (7.8), respectively. The trial was unable to recruit sufficient participants and had very high attrition, which resulted in seriously underpowered results. The internal pilot did not meet its target for recruitment and, despite recruitment subsequently being more promising, it was concluded that the trial was not feasible owing to the combined problems of poor recruitment, poor retention and COVID-19. The intervention group had a slightly lower score for severity of urinary incontinence at 3 months post randomisation, but this result should be interpreted with caution. Further studies to assess the effectiveness of an intervention starting in or continuing into the community are required. This trial is registered as ISRCTN14005026. This project was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in <i>Health Technology Assessment</i>; Vol. 26, No. 31. See the NIHR Journals Library website for further project information. Urinary incontinence affects around half of stroke survivors. It causes embarrassment and distress, affecting patientsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ability to take part in rehabilitation. It also has a major impact on families and may determine whether or not patients are able to return home. Finding the underlying cause and addressing it can prevent, cure or reduce problems. Doing this in a systematic way for everyone with incontinence problems as early as possible after the stroke, while they are still in hospital, may work best. We also wanted to avoid using catheters in the bladder to drain the urine away, as these are often unnecessary and can cause urinary tract infections. This study aimed to test whether or not continence problems and the use of urinary catheters could be reduced if everyone with incontinence was fully assessed and given the right management and support early after hospital admission. We also wanted to find out if the benefits outweighed the costs. We planned to involve 1024 men and women with incontinence from 18 stroke units in the study, with 512 people receiving the intervention and 512 receiving usual care. However, the trial was paused because of COVID-19, at which time only 157 participants had been recruited. When we were thinking about restarting the study and looked at its progress, we found that not enough people had agreed to take part and, of those who had agreed, many had not returned their outcome questionnaires. This indicated that the trial was not feasible and should not restart. We could not make any firm conclusions about whether or not the intervention worked, as not enough people were involved. We found that stays in hospital after stroke are shorter than they were in the past. This suggests that future studies investigating ways of treating incontinence should consider interventions with management and support for incontinence that continue after patients leave the hospital.","Watkins, Tishkovskaya, Brown, Sutton, Garcia, Forshaw, Prescott, Thomas, Roffe, Booth, Bennett, Roe, Hollingsworth, Mateus, Britt, Panton","https://doi.org/10.3310/EFTV1270","20220726","BLADDER TRAINING; SECONDARY CARE; STROKE; SYSTEMATIC VOIDING PROGRAMME; URINARY INCONTINENCE, URINARY CATHETER","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35144,""

"Pregnant women: psychology, cognitive and behavioral responses, and solutions towards COVID-19","COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019) has spread globally and is highly infectious, causing psychological disturbances such as anxiety, depression, or both. Pregnant women, as a vulnerable population, need further attention. This study aims to evaluate the psychological impact of pregnant women during COVID-19 to constitute base data for solution guidance. Using a self-designed questionnaire, self-rated anxiety scale (SAS), and self-rated depression scale (SDS), we conducted a web-based survey on 1160 pregnant women from February 20 to April 30, 2020. The prevalence of anxiety and depression during pregnancy was shown to be 12.93% and 31.21%, respectively. Besides, younger age, housewives, lower education level, and early pregnancy all contributed to psychological disturbance during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results revealed significant variations in cognitive and behavioral responses based on the levels of the COVID-19 pandemic concerns, perceptions of life impacts and family concerns, preparation of personal protection equipment and motherhood, and the need for psychological counseling (PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05). Regarding their primary concerns, 73.2% of the participants worried about the health and safety of childbirth. And 90.6% of respondents anticipated scheduling prenatal appointments to avoid crowds. Pregnant women are susceptible to anxiety/depression during the COVID-19 outbreak, necessitating immediate psychological care and intervention.","Chen, Zhuang, Chen, Li","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2022.2104881","20220726","Coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19); Self-rating Anxiety Scale(SAS); Self-rating Depression Scale(SDS); pregnant women; psychological disturbance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35146,""
"Pandemic and student mental health: mental health symptoms among university students and young adults after the first cycle of lockdown in the UK","Early COVID-19 research suggests a detrimental impact of the initial lockdown on young people's mental health. We investigated mental health among university students and young adults after the first UK lockdown and changes in symptoms over 6 months. In total, 895 university students and 547 young adults not in higher education completed an online survey at T1 (July-September 2020). A subset of 201 university students also completed a 6 month follow-up survey at T2 (January-March 2021). Anxiety, depression, insomnia, substance misuse and suicide risk were assessed. At T1, approximately 40%, 25% and 33% of the participants reported moderate to severe anxiety and depression and substance misuse risk, clinically significant insomnia and suicidal risk. In participants reassessed at T2, reductions were observed in anxiety and depression but not in insomnia, substance misuse or suicidality. Student and non-student participants reported similar levels of mental health symptoms. Student status was not a significant marker of mental health symptoms, except for lower substance misuse risk.Cross-sectionally, greater symptoms across measures were consistently associated with younger age, pre-existing mental health conditions, being a carer, worse financial status, increased sleep irregularity and difficulty since lockdown. Longitudinally, T2 symptoms were consistently associated with worse financial status and increased difficulty sleeping at T1. However, these associations were attenuated when baseline mental health symptoms were adjusted for in the models. Mental health symptoms were prevalent in a large proportion of young people after the first UK lockdown. Risk factors identified may help characterise high-risk groups for enhanced support and inform interventions.","Tang, McEnery, Chandler, Toro, Walasek, Friend, Gu, Singh, Meyer","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.523","20220726","COVID-19; University students; mental health; well-being; young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35147,""
"Factors influencing nurses' intent to provide care involved in coronavirus disease 2019: Theory of planned behaviour perspectives","To identify the factors influencing the intent to provide care among nurses involved in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) care. COVID-19 was first reported in Wuhan, China, in 2019. In 2020, the World Health Organisation declared it a pandemic, leading to 5,827,104 deaths and 421,203,495 confirmed cases as of 19 February 2022. The high transmissibility of COVID-19 has prolonged the pandemic for over 2Ã¢â‚¬â€°years, resulting in deleterious effects on nurses' physical and mental health. The fear of infection and isolation may lead to negative experiences and perceptions among COVID-19 frontline nurses, which may ultimately degrade the quality of patient care. Thus, it is essential to identify factors influencing of nurses' intent to provide care. Cross-sectional study. Data were collected from 169 nurses involved in direct COVID-19 care at a hospital designated for infectious disease care in Korea from August to September 2021 using an online questionnaire. STROBE checklist was followed. Nurses' intent to provide care significantly differed based on whether they lived with parents and had adequate availability of personal protection equipment. The correlation analysis indicated that the intent to provide care was significantly positively correlated with normative beliefs, control beliefs, attitude towards the behaviour, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control. Perceived behavioural control, control beliefs and attitude towards the behaviour were significant factors influencing nurses' intent to provide COVID-19 care. This study showed that nurses perceived behavioural control and positive behaviour towards providing COVID-19 care fundamentally influenced their intent to provide care. In clinical practice, the safety and rights of individual nurses who participated in COVID-19-related patient care are promoted, and ultimately, the quality of patient care is improved. Furthermore, active support at the organisation and government level is needed to strengthen the capabilities necessary for nursing patients with infectious diseases.","Hwang, Kim","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.16468","20220726","COVID-19; intent to provide care; nurses; theory of planned behaviour","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35148,""
"Has the COVID-19 pandemic affected the psychological state of arab cancer patients?","The Covid-19 pandemic has increased the vulnerability of cancer patients to psychological symptoms, in addition to treatment modality issues. The present study has aimed to determine the psychological state of Arab cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic and to explore the contributing factors. A cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational design with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue subscale (FACT-F), and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) were used to collect the data. Out of 291 participants, 60.5% were female; 22.7% were 51-60 years; 31.6% were diagnosed with breast cancer; 44.3% with stage 2 cancer; 23% had contracted COVID-19; and 43.3% had received their first dose of the vaccine. The main study findings are: 74.9% had anxiety, 64.3% experienced depression, 68% suffered from insomnia, and 69.8% had fatigue. Quality of life (QoL) was low among cancer patients who had marked anxiety, depression, insomnia, or fatigue, and these findings were statistically significant (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Predictive factors showed males were 5.09 times more likely to report depression; gynecological cancer patients were 40.4 times more likely to experience insomnia, and patients who had COVID-19 were 5.13 times more likely to report fatigue. The study findings reveal that the COVID-19 pandemic affected the psychological state of cancer patients and had a significant effect on their quality of life. Hence, there is a need to develop a holistic cancer health care approach, which is often limited in Arab countries, to help patients manage these symptoms effectively and to decrease the prevalence of mental health morbidity.","Madkhali, Ameri, Al-Naamani, Madkhali, Alshammari, ALMeqbali","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-03414-2","20220726","Anxiety; COVID-19 pandemic; Cancer; Depression; Fatigue; Insomnia; Quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35149,""
"Suicide in the context of infodemic during COVID-19 pandemic: A global perspective","Surges of technology use along with limited interpersonal interactions have led to the amplification and dissemination of false information during the COVID-19 pandemic. Infodemic refers to an overabundance of information that may have increased burden of covid-19 pandemic and mental disorder. Given the rise of suicide behavior during the pandemic, infodemic has been considered as a risk of suicidal behavior. The aim of this article is to address suicide in the context of infodemic and provide some strategy to adjust the impact of infodemic on mental health.","Shoib, Armiya'u, Das, Hussaini, Ahmed, Chandradasa","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2022.104070","20220726","COVID-19; Infodemic; Mental health; Pandemic; Suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35150,""
"Repercussions of perceived threat to health in the Spanish population","Studies have shown that COVID-19 has had a worldwide psychological impact. Confinement due to COVID-19 has had important repercussions on the mental health of the general population, with high levels of stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, post-traumatic stress disorder, and so forth. Similarly, important labor, economic and social changes taking place are affecting people's well-being. The objective of this study was to analyze the repercussions of perceived threat from COVID-19 on the mental health of the population, and to evaluate the mediating role of perceived economic impact. The participants were 1160 adult residents of Spain aged 18 to 82, 69.9% of whom were women. A sociodemographic questionnaire, the Questionnaire on Perception of Threat from COVID-19 and the General Health Questionnaire were administered. Perceived threat had a positive direct effect on all four health dimensions analyzed. Among the indirect effects, the perceived economic impact of COVID-19 mediated in the relationship between perceived threat and each of the health dimensions. The results of this study have demonstrated the need to promote joint action promoting public mental health to minimize the psychological repercussions of new outbreaks.","Molero Jurado, Martos MartÃƒÂ­nez, PÃƒÂ©rez-Fuentes, SimÃƒÂ³n MÃƒÂ¡rquez, MÃƒÂ©ndez Mateo, BarragÃƒÂ¡n MartÃƒÂ­n, GÃƒÂ¡zquez Linares","https://doi.org/10.1177/17579759221102192","20220726","COVID-19; general population; mental health; perceived threat","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35151,""
"'Beyond the Bump': an online wellbeing and lifestyle pilot program during COVID-19 for first year postpartum mothers: a research article","Establishing a healthy lifestyle post-delivery is pivotal to reduce the incidence of chronic diseases. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, access to postpartum health programs has been increasingly difficult. The aim of this study was to inform, develop and evaluate Beyond the Bump (BtB); an online program to improve access to health and wellbeing education and support for physical activity in the postpartum. A three-phase mixed-methods design of a 10-week Australia-wide online pilot program during COVID-19 with women less than 1Ã‚Â year postpartum and their primary care health professionals was utilised. Phase-one: needs assessment focus groups and interviews. Phase-two: BtB program implementation pre-post health measures survey, attendance and engagement with the program. Phase-three: program evaluation with feedback surveys and interviews. Women (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°12) and health professionals (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°16) expressed strong need for a postpartum program with access to education from experts on exercise, pelvic floor, sleep and baby nutrition. Despite BtB being developed from women's suggestions (including time-of-day 'morning'), attendance to all ten sessions was poor (of 162 registrations; 23% participated in the first session and 5% in the last session). Barriers to attendance included 'too busy',' forgot' and 'topic not relevant for age of child'. 88% of women reported the education as the most enjoyable component of the program. 100% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°26) of women interviewed would recommend the program to a friend. There is a continuing need for postpartum support. Online programs with access to expert education and exercise were reported to be of significant interest and value. However, more research is needed to improve the uptake and value placed on mothers' wellbeing and physical activity.","Christie, Roach, Kennedy, Beetham, Meyer, Schoenaker, Francois","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-022-04913-7","20220725","Community; Exercise; Health; Mental Health; Postnatal","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35152,""
"Mental health indicators and their lifestyle associations in German students: a gender-specific multivariable analysis","Statistics show that the number of received psychosocial counselling sessions remains at a constantly high level or has even increased since the COVID-19Ã‚Â pandemic situation in 2020. The objective of this work is to identify factors associated with students' mental health to improve prevention and promotion in mental health at universities. The analyses were based on a cross-sectional data set collected by an online survey among 1,842 students from a German University of Applied Sciences in 2014. Descriptive statistics as well as nine different multiple linear regression models were calculated with IBMÃ‚Â® SPSSÃ‚Â® Statistics software. Mental health indicators used were mental health-related quality of life (mental HRQOL), depression, and anxiety, which were analysed in a gender-specific manner. The analyses showed that the mean of the mental HRQOL score of the SF-36 for the student sample (46.68) was lower than the values for German (48.76) or American (51.34) norm samples. A key finding was the differences in mental health indicators between male and female students. Women reported worse mental health status in comparison to men. Female gender (ÃƒÅ¸ of -.09; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01), age (ÃƒÅ¸ of -1.05; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01), underweight (ÃƒÅ¸ of -.09; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05), smoking (ÃƒÅ¸ of -.10; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05) and drug consumption (ÃƒÅ¸ of -.15; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) were negatively associated with mental health indicators. In our sample, a moderate consumption of alcohol within the female population (ÃƒÅ¸ of .12; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01) and physical activity within the male sample (ÃƒÅ¸ of .09; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05) were positively associated with mental health indicators. The gender-specific differences of students' mental health and its associations could be an important result for counselling services at universities to adjust methods according to gender. Contrary to the general societal perception, students have lower mental health than a norm sample even before the pandemic. Due to the additional mental stress caused by the pandemic, it can be assumed that mental health problems have increased even more. Universities should therefore pay more attention to the mental health of their students.","Spagert, Janssen, Geigl","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-13777-7","20220725","Anxiety; Counselling; Depression; Gender differences; Mental health; Students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35153,""
"How is COVID-19 changing the ways doctors make end-of-life decisions?","This research explores how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the ways doctors make end-of-life decisions, particularly around Do Not Attempt Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (DNACPR), treatment escalation and doctors' views on the legalisation of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. The research was conducted between May and August 2021, during which COVID-19 hospital cases were relatively low and pressures on NHS resources were near normal levels. Data were collected via online survey sent to doctors of all levels and specialties, who have worked in the NHS during the pandemic. 231 participants completed the survey. The research found that over half of participants reported making more patients DNACPR than prepandemic, and this was due, at least in part, to an increased focus on factors including patient age, Clinical Frailty Scores and resource limitations. In addition, a sizeable minority of participants reported that they now had a higher threshold for escalating patients to ITU and a lower threshold for palliating patients, with many attributing these changes to formative experiences gained during the pandemic. Finally, our study found that there has not been a statistically significant change in the views of clinicians on the legalisation of euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide since the start of the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic appears to have altered several aspects of end-of-life decision making, and many of these changes have remained even as COVID-19 hospital cases have declined.","Chang, Matthews","https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2022-108268","20220725","COVID-19; Death; Euthanasia; Palliative Care; Terminal Care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-27","",35154,""
