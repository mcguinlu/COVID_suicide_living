"A predictive model for hospitalization and survival to COVID-19 in a retrospective population-based study","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is highly transmissible and has been responsible for a pandemic associated with a high number of deaths. The clinical management of patients and the optimal use of resources are two important factors in reducing this mortality, especially in scenarios of high incidence. To this end, it is necessary to develop tools that allow early triage of patients with the minimal use of diagnostic tests and based on readily accessible data, such as electronic medical records. This work proposes the use of a machine learning model that allows the prediction of mortality and risk of hospitalization using simple demographic characteristics and comorbidities, using a COVID-19 dataset of 86867 patients. In addition, we developed a new method designed to deal with data imbalance problems. The model was able to predict with high accuracy (89-93%, ROC-AUC = 0.94) the patient's final status (expired/discharged) and with medium accuracy the risk of hospitalization (71-73%, ROC-AUC = 0.75). These models were obtained by assembling and using easily obtainable clinical characteristics (2 demographic characteristics and 19 predictors of comorbidities). The most relevant features of these models were the following patient characteristics: age, sex, number of comorbidities, osteoarthritis, obesity, depression, and renal failure.","Alejandro Cisterna-Garcia; Antonio Guillen-Teruel; Marcos Caracena; Enrique Perez; Fernando Jimenez; Francisco J.

"Psychoneuroimmunology concerns of the Olympic boycotts","Just weeks away from the Opening Ceremony of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, the United States, followed by Australia, the United Kingdom, and Canada, has declared a diplomatic boycott of the Games. A diplomatic boycott stipulates that while government officials of these countries will not attend the event, the athletes' scheduled attendance will largely remain intact. An unintended consequence of the boycotts is that they force the attending athletes to cope with the stress and distress associated with the 2022 Winter Olympics in an unfamiliar environment on their own. It is important to underscore that many of the challenges the athletes could face amid the Games are either deep-rooted or unprecedented, ranging from stressors fuelled by the nonstop media reports, the competitions, to the Omicron scares. These insights combined, in turn, underscore the imperative for effective and preemptive mental health support for Olympic athletes. To shed light on the issue, this paper highlights the reasons why timely solutions are needed to adequately safeguard Olympic athletes' mental health and overall wellbeing, and underlines promising technology-based solutions that can be cost-effectively designed and developed for the athletes.","Su, McDonnell, Bennett, Bentley, Ahmad, Ã…Â egalo, Cheshmehzangi, Pereira da Veiga, Xiang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2022.02.028","20220303","COVID-19; Olympics; Psychoneuroimmunology; diplomatic boycotts; mental health; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-04","",27792,""
"Lifestyle predictors of depression and anxiety during COVID-19: a machine learning approach","Recent research has suggested an increase in the global prevalence of psychiatric symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to assess whether lifestyle behaviors can predict the presence of depression and anxiety in the Brazilian general population, using a model developed in Spain. A web survey was conducted during April-May 2020, which included the Short Multidimensional Inventory Lifestyle Evaluation (SMILE) scale, assessing lifestyle behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Depression and anxiety were examined using the PHQ-2 and the GAD-7, respectively. Elastic net, random forest, and gradient tree boosting were used to develop predictive models. Each technique used a subset of the Spanish sample to train the models, which were then tested internally (vs. the remainder of the Spanish sample) and externally (vs. the full Brazilian sample), evaluating their effectiveness. The study sample included 22,562 individuals (19,069 from Brazil, and 3,493 from Spain). The models developed performed similarly and were equally effective in predicting depression and anxiety in both tests, with internal test AUC-ROC values of 0.85 (depression) and 0.86 (anxiety), and external test AUC-ROC values of 0.85 (depression) and 0.84 (anxiety). Meaning of life was the strongest predictor of depression, while sleep quality was the strongest predictor of anxiety during the COVID-19 epidemic. :Specific lifestyle behaviors during the early COVID-19 epidemic successfully predicted the presence of depression and anxiety in a large Brazilian sample using machine learning models developed on a Spanish sample.

"Stress, Anxiety, Depression, and Perfectionism Among Graduate Students in Health Sciences Programs","Graduate students in occupational therapy, physical therapy, physician assistant, and speech-language pathology programs in the United States were surveyed using an online questionnaire in spring 2020. The 1,916 students reported on mental health diagnoses and completed the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale and three Hewitt-Flett Perfectionism subscales. Students in all four programs scored significantly higher than national norms on depression, anxiety, and stress; and females scored higher than males on anxiety and stress. There were small differences between students in the four programs, with speech-language pathology students demonstrating higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. First-year students had higher levels of anxiety than third-year students, and third-year students had lower levels of stress than both first-year and second-year students. All three perfectionism subscales were positively, although weakly, correlated to depression, anxiety, and stress. Finally, students reported significantly higher rates of anxiety after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic than prior to the pandemic. These findings can be used to inform health science graduate programs of concerns related to student stress, anxiety, and depression as they re-evaluate program or curricular design.","Bogardus, Armstrong, VanOss, Brown","https://www.google.com/search?q=Stress,+Anxiety,+Depression,+and+Perfectionism+Among+Graduate+Students+in+Health+Sciences+Programs.","20220303","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-04","",27794,""
"Thriving in a pandemic: Determinants of excellent wellbeing among New Zealanders during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown; a cross-sectional survey","The COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictions are associated with adverse psychological impacts but an assessment of positive wellbeing is required to understand the overall impacts of the pandemic. The NZ Lockdown Psychological Distress Survey is an on-line cross-sectional survey of 3487 New Zealanders undertaken during a strict lockdown for COVID-19. The lockdown extended from 25 March 2020 to 28 April 2020 and the survey was undertaken between 15 April 2020 and 27 April 2020. The survey measured excellent wellbeing categorised by a WHO-Five Well-being Index (WHO-5) score Ã¢â€°Â¥22. The survey also contained demographic and pre-lockdown questions, subjective and objective lockdown experiences, and questions on alcohol use. The proportion of participants with excellent wellbeing is reported with multivariate analysis examining the relative importance of individual factors associated with excellent wellbeing. Approximately 9% of the overall sample (303 participants) reported excellent wellbeing during the New Zealand lockdown. In the multivariable analysis, excellent wellbeing status was positively associated with increasing age (p&lt;0.001), male gender (p = 0.044), MÃ„Âori and Asian ethnicity (p = 0.008), and lower levels of education (certificate/diploma level qualification or less) (p&lt;0.001). Excellent wellbeing was negatively associated with smoking (p = 0.001), poor physical (p&lt;0.001) and mental health (p = 0.002), and previous trauma (p = 0.033). Nine percent of New Zealanders reported excellent wellbeing during severe COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. Demographic and broader health factors predicted excellent wellbeing status. An understanding of these factors may help to enhance wellbeing during any future lockdowns.","Beaglehole, Williman, Bell, Stanley, Jenkins, Gendall, Hoek, Rapsey, Every-Palmer","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0262745","20220303","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-04","",27795,""
"Neurological outcomes one year after COVID-19 diagnosis: a prospective longitudinal cohort study","Neurological sequelae from COVID-19 may persist after recovery from acute infection. Here, we aimed to describe the natural history of neurological manifestations over one year after COVID-19. We performed a prospective, multicentre, longitudinal cohort study in COVID-19 survivors. At 3-month and 1-year follow-up, patients were assessed for neurological impairments by a neurological examination and a standardized test battery including the assessment of hyposmia (16-item Sniffin-Sticks-test, SS-16), cognitive deficits (Montreal Cognitive Assessment&lt;26), and mental health (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-5). Eighty-one patients were evaluated one year after COVID-19, out of which 76/81 (94%) patients completed 3-month and 1-year follow-up. Patients were 54 (47-64) years old and 59% were male. New and persistent neurological disorders were found in 15% (3-months) and 12% (10/81; 1-year). Symptoms at 1-year follow-up were reported by 48/81 (59%) patients, including fatigue (38%), concentration difficulties (25%), forgetfulness (25%), sleep disturbances (22%), myalgia (17%), limb weakness (17%), headache (16%), impaired sensation (16%), and hyposmia (15%). Neurological examination revealed findings in 52/81 (64%) patients without improvement over time (3-months: 61%, p=0.230) including hyposmia (SS-16&lt;13; 51%). Cognitive deficits were apparent in 18%, whereas depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorders were diagnosed in 6%, 29%, and 10% one year after infection, respectively. These mental and cognitive disorders did not improve since 3-month follow-up (all p&gt;0.05).

"COVID-19 Related Stressors, Parent-Child Relationship, and Alcohol Use and Mental Health Profiles Among White and Hispanic/Latinx First-Year College Students","Transitioning to college during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may increase risk for alcohol use and mental health problems. We examined how COVID-19 related stressors and parent-child relationships are independently and interactively associated with alcohol use and mental health profiles in a sample of first-year college students (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°425, 34.8% Hispanic/Latinx; 74.9% female) who completed an online survey in October 2020. Latent profile analysis identified four profiles: well-adjusted (53.2%), mental health problems only (21.6%), alcohol use only (17.4%), and comorbid (7.8%). COVID-19 related stressful events increased risk of being in the alcohol use only and comorbid profiles, whereas COVID-19 related worries increased risk of being in the mental health problems only profile. Parent-child relationship quality lowered risk of being in the mental health problems only and the comorbid profiles. In addition, parent-child relationship quality moderated the role of COVID-19 related worries such that COVID-19 related worries were associated with lower odds of being in the comorbid profile when parent-child relationship quality was high but not when parent-child relationship quality was low. Strengthening parent-child relationship quality appears important for promoting college students' well-being.","Su, Conroy, Trevino, Zheng, Kuo","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10578-022-01337-4","20220303","Alcohol; COVID-19; Mental health; ParentÃ¢â‚¬â€œchild relationship; Person-centered analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-04","",27797,""
"A Smartphone Serious Game for Adolescents (Grow It! App): Development, Feasibility, and Acceptance Study","Anxiety and mood problems in adolescents often go unnoticed and may therefore remain untreated. Identifying and preventing the development of emotional problems requires monitoring and effective tools to strengthen adolescents' resilience, for example, by enhancing coping skills. This study describes the developmental process, feasibility, and acceptance of Grow It!, a multiplayer serious game app for adolescents aged 12-25 years. The app consists of the experience sampling method (ESM) to monitor thoughts, behaviors, and emotions in daily life to enhance self-insight and daily cognitive behavioral therapy-based challenges to promote adaptive coping. Our approach entails an iterative game design process combined with an agile method to develop the smartphone app. The incorporated game features (ie, challenges, chat functionality, and visual representation) in the Grow It! app were co-designed with adolescent end users to increase participant engagement and adherence. The Grow It! app was delivered for Android and iOS in May 2020. Grow It! was offered to adolescents during the COVID-19 crisis between May and December 2020. Participants of the Grow It! COVID-19 study (sample 1: N=685; mean age 16.19, SD 3.11 years; 193/685, 28.2% boys; sample 2: N=1035; mean age 18.78, SD 3.51 years; 193/1035, 18.64% boys) completed 31.5% (13.2/42) to 49.5% (10.4/21) of challenges. Compliance of ESM was suboptimal (35.1/210, 16.7% to 32.5/105, 30.9%). Follow-up questionnaires indicated an overall score of the app of 7.1 out of 10. Moreover, 72.6% (278/383) to 75.6% (487/644) would recommend the app to friends. To our knowledge, Grow It! is the first gamified ESM app that both measures individual differences in emotional dynamics and offers an integrated cognitive behavioral therapy-based intervention. Our findings support the feasibility and acceptance, and therefore applicability, of the Grow It! app in adolescents. Further iterations of this serious game app will focus on the increase of compliance and on providing participants feedback through their personal mood profiles.","Dietvorst, Aukes, Legerstee, Vreeker, Hrehovcsik, Keijsers, Hillegers","https://doi.org/10.2196/29832","20220303","CBT; EMA; adolescents; app development; depression; digital health; ecological momentary assessment; game design; high risk; internalizing problems; mHealth; mobile health; mobile phone; serious game","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-04","",27798,""
"Disparities in Emergency Department Visits for Opioid and Stimulant Overdoses in Florida During COVID-19","Emergency department (ED) visits for drug overdoses increased nationally during COVID-19 despite declines in all-cause ED visits. The study purpose was to compare characteristics of ED visits for opioid and stimulant overdoses before and during COVID-19 in Florida. This study tested for disparities in ED visits for opioid and stimulant overdoses by race/ethnicity, age, and insurance status. The study identified ED visits for opioid and stimulant overdose in Florida during quarters two and three of 2019 and compared them with quarters two and three of 2020. Overall, there was an increase in the number of opioid and stimulant overdoses during COVID-19. Combined with the decline in the number of all-cause ED visits, drug overdoses represented a larger share of ED visits during COVID-19 compared with before COVID-19. The study did not find evidence of disparities by race/ethnicity, as each group experienced similar increases in the likelihood of ED visits involving drug overdoses during COVID-19. Differences emerged according to age and insurance status. ED visits involving those under age 18 were more likely to involve opioid or stimulant overdose, and ED visits among those over age 65 were less likely to involve opioid overdose during COVID-19. ED visits among those with vulnerable insurance status were more likely to involve opioid overdose during COVID-19. Patterns of behavior change during periods of restricted activity due to a pandemic. These changes in behavior change the mix of risks that people face, suggesting the need for a reallocation of population health management resources during pandemics.","Page, Chen, Jacko, Sainfort","https://doi.org/10.1089/pop.2021.0369","20220303","drug use; health disparities; opioid abuse; population health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-04","",27799,""
"Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms associated with protective and risky behaviors for coronavirus disease 2019","Psychiatric disorders increase risk for contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but we know little about relationships between psychiatric symptoms and COVID-19 risky and protective behaviors. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been associated with increased propensity to engage in risky behaviors, but may also be associated with increased COVID-19 protective behaviors due to increased threat sensitivity and social isolation. We examined associations of PTSD symptoms with COVID-19-related protective and risky behaviors using data from a cross-sectional online United States study among 845 US adults in August through September 2020. PTSD symptoms (PTSD Checklist-5), sociodemographics, COVID-19-related experiences and vulnerabilities, and past 30-day engagement in 10 protective and eight risky behaviors for COVID-19 were assessed via self-report. We examined associations between PTSD symptoms and COVID-19 protective and risky behaviors with linear regressions, adjusting for covariates. Probable PTSD and higher PTSD symptom severity were associated with greater engagement in protective behaviors, but also greater engagement in risky behaviors. Associations were only slightly attenuated by adjustment for COVID-19 exposures and perceived likelihood and severity of COVID-19. Associations varied by PTSD clusters: intrusions and arousal were associated with both more protective and more risky behaviors, whereas negative cognitions or mood was associated only with more risky, and avoidance only with more protective, behaviors. Higher PTSD symptoms were associated with engagement in more protective but also more risky behaviors for COVID-19. Mental health should be considered in the design of public health campaigns dedicated to limiting infectious disease spread.

"Junior doctors' mental health and coronavirus disease safety concerns","This article aims to assess whether caring for COVID-19 patients impacted junior doctors' COVID-19-related anxieties, general anxiety and depression, and the relative impact of depression, general anxiety and specific COVID-19 anxiety on work and social functioning during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Recruitment occurred between June and August 2020 in New South Wales, Australia. Demographic information, symptoms of depression (PHQ-9), generalised anxiety (GAD-7), and COVID-19-related anxieties around infections, help-seeking behaviours, and work and social functioning (WSAS) were collected. About one third (n=73, 33%) had cared for a patient with overt or covert COVID-19 in the previous month. However, the extent of COVID-19-related anxiety symptoms was largely unrelated to caring for COVID-19 patients. Instead, the presence of other COVID-19 concerns and gender predicted variations in COVID-19 concerns for one's own safety and the safety of loved ones. COVID-19 anxiety symptoms were largely unrelated to caring for COVID-19 patients, while COVID-19-related anxiety around the safety of family and friends added to impaired functioning in addition to the established impact of depression and general anxiety. Implications for public health: Provided the replicability of these findings, this research highlights the importance of addressing pandemic-related anxieties in junior doctor populations.","Bartholomew, Sanatkar, Counson, Harvey","https://doi.org/10.1111/1753-6405.13213","20220303","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; junior doctors; mental health; work and social functioning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-04","",27801,""
"Impact of first COVID-19 lockdown on paediatric and adult haemophilia patients treated in a French Haemophilia Comprehensive Care Centre","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created an unprecedented global health crisis.

"The symptom burden of Irritable Bowel Syndrome in tertiary care during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic caused unprecedented disruption to healthcare services worldwide with well-documented detrimental effects on mental health. Patients with refractory disorders of gut-brain interaction such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) seen in tertiary care tend to exhibit higher levels of psychological comorbidity, but the impact of the pandemic on IBS symptom severity in tertiary care is unknown. As part of routine clinical care, consecutive tertiary referrals with refractory IBS patients prospectively completed a series of baseline questionnaires including IBS symptom severity score (IBS-SSS), non-colonic symptom score, Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD), and Illness impact scores. The symptom severity questionnaire data were compared for consecutive patients seen in tertiary care 12Ã‚Â months before and after the onset of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. Of 190 consecutive tertiary referrals with IBS, those seen during the pandemic had greater IBS severity (IBS-SSS: 352 vs. 318, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.03), more severe extra-intestinal symptoms (non-colonic score: 269 vs. 225, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.03), sleep difficulties (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.03), helplessness and loss of control (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.02), but similar HAD-Anxiety (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.96) and HAD-Depression (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.84) scores. During the pandemic, unmarried patients (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.03), and keyworkers (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.0038) had greater IBS severity. This study has shown for the first time that patients seen in tertiary care with refractory IBS during the COVID-19 pandemic had a significantly higher symptom burden emphasizing the importance of gut-brain axis in IBS.

"Perceived risk of COVID-19 exposure and poor COVID-19 prognosis impair sleep: The mediating and moderating roles of COVID-19-related anxiety and knowledge","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has been linked to increased levels of stress, depression, and anxiety in many people around the world. Therefore, identifying individuals at risk of psychosocial burden during this unprecedented crisis is essential for developing prevention measures and treatment options for mental health issues. To this aim, we investigated two risk groups: individuals at higher risk of exposure to the virus and individuals at higher risk of poor prognosis if they contract the virus. We conducted a survey (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 4167) with a representative sample of the German population and assessed perceived risk of COVID-19 exposure and poor prognosis if infected, COVID-19-related anxiety, problems with sleep and daytime functioning, as well as self-reported knowledge about the disease. Results showed that perceived risk group membership was linked to increased problems with sleep and daytime functioning via elevated levels of COVID-19-related anxiety. This mediated effect was further moderated by self-reported COVID-19Ã‚Â knowledge, but only for individuals who rated themselves at higher risk of COVID-19 exposure. Thus, knowledge buffered the negative effect of exposure risk on anxiety and ultimately on sleep in this risk group. Reaching individuals at increased risk of exposure with clear information about the disease, how to prevent infection, and treatment options could be an effective strategy to contain anxiety levels and promote good sleep, which is important for general well-being.","Zerbini, Taflinger, Reicherts, Kunz, Sattler","https://doi.org/10.1111/jsr.13569","20220303","COVID-19; COVID-19 anxiety; Germany; knowledge; perceived risk group; sleep; sleep problems","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-04","",27804,""
"Dataset on thermal comfort, perceived stress, and anxiety in university students under confinement due to COVID-19 in a hot and humid region of Mexico","This dataset was compiled to estimate the levels of thermal comfort and mental health in a sample group of university students confined due to the COVID-19 pandemic. By the time research was carried out, these students of a hot and humid region of Mexico, had already spent 200 days on distance learning using online platforms. A total of 324 records were documented with a final sample of 316 valid participants. The total records were collected directly from the students through a web platform (Microsoft forms). This data set can be used to generate correlations between mental health, thermal comfort, and individual characteristics in the study population that will allow to identify the influence of the built environment and local climate on the levels of stress and anxiety that university students experienced under confinement. It can also be used to issue recommendations to improve the quality of built spaces and for the construction of adaptive models of thermal comfort considering mental health as a study variable<i>.</i>","RamÃƒÂ­rez-Dolores, Lugo-RamÃƒÂ­rez, HernÃƒÂ¡ndez-Cortaza, AlcalÃƒÂ¡, Lara-ValdÃƒÂ©s, Andaverde","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2022.107996","20220303","Anxiety; COVID-19; Humidity sensation; Stress perceived; Thermal sensation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-04","",27805,""
"A Cross-Sectional Study on the Cross-Talk of the COVID-19-Related Degree of Loneliness and the Etiological Factors Among the Elderly in Central China","The outbreak of COVID-19 has undoubtedly influenced the normal lifestyle of people worldwide, including the Chinese population. This study attempted to do supplementary research to the current situation of loneliness as well as the related risk factors among the elderly in the province in central Chinese during the COVID-19. We conducted a cross-sectional study in one of the central Chinese provinces (Henan Province) from December 2020 to March 2021 using a multistage sampling method, and 568 elderly people without cognitive impairment were interviewed. The UCLA Loneliness Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Physical Activity Rating Scale (PARS-3), and Quality of Life Questionnaire SF-36 were adopted to collect information. We used univariate and multivariate logistic regressions to analyze the factors resulting in severe loneliness among the elderly with seldom or regular participation in physical exercises. During the epidemic in central China, the elderly suffering from loneliness syndrome accounted for 34.2%, of which 15.5% were severely lonely. Risk factors for severe loneliness were quality of life (OR: 7.129), sleep quality (OR: 3.778), seldom exercise (OR: 4.170), poor economic status (OR: 1.769), and negative attitude toward the prospects for the epidemic control (OR: 4.033). By grouping the participants in terms of physical activity, we found that the quality of life (OR:5.778) was a significant risk factor than sleep quality (OR:2.939) in the seldom exercise group, while the only risk factor in the regular exercise group was the quality of life (OR: 5.021). There was an increase in the degree of loneliness among the elderly during the epidemic, and physical activity played an active role in relieving the severe loneliness of the elderly. Therefore, for the sake of the elderly, regular participation in physical exercises should be encouraged during the duration of the epidemic.","Ju, Qi, Zhang, Cao, Tsai, Liu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.805664","20220303","COVID-19; elderly; loneliness; physical activities; quality of life; sleep quality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-04","",27806,""
"Knowledge and Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic in People With Severe Mental Illness in Bangladesh and Pakistan: A Cross-Sectional Survey","People with severe mental illnesses (SMIs) are likely to face disproportionate challenges during a pandemic. They may not receive or be able to respond to public health messages to prevent infection or to limit its spread. Additionally, they may be more severely affected, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. We conducted a telephone survey (May-June 2020) in a sample of 1,299 people with SMI who had attended national mental health institutes in Bangladesh and Pakistan before the pandemic. We collected information on top worries, socioeconomic impact of the pandemic, knowledge of COVID-19 (symptoms, prevention), and prevention-related practices (social distancing, hygiene). We explored the predictive value of socio-demographic and health-related variables for relative levels of COVID-19 knowledge and practice using regularized logistic regression models. Mass media were the major source of information about COVID-19. Finances, employment, and physical health were the most frequently mentioned concerns. Overall, participants reported good knowledge and following advice. In Bangladesh, being female and higher levels of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) predicted poor and better knowledge, respectively, while in Pakistan being female predicted better knowledge. Receiving information from television predicted better knowledge in both countries. In Bangladesh, being female, accessing information from multiple media sources, and better HRQoL predicted better practice. In Pakistan, poorer knowledge of COVID-19 prevention measures predicted poorer practice. Our paper adds to the literature on people living with SMIs and their knowledge and practices relevant to COVID-19 prevention. Our results emphasize the importance of access to mass and social media for the dissemination of advice and that the likely gendered uptake of both knowledge and practice requires further attention.","Rajan, Paton, Chowdhury, Zavala, Aslam, Huque, Khalid, Murthy, Nizami, Prasad Muliyala, Shiers, Siddiqi, Boehnke","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.785059","20220303","COVID-19; epidemiology; knowledge; practices; severe mental illness (SMI)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-04","",27807,""
"Ontario COVID-19 and Kids Mental Health Study: a study protocol for the longitudinal prospective evaluation of the impact of emergency measures on child and adolescent mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the mental health (MH) of children, adolescents and parents. Whereas youth with MH disorders and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) may be at higher risk for exacerbations in emotional and behavioural distress, children and adolescents without pre-existing MH disorders or NDD may also experience MH deterioration due to increases in stress, changes in health behaviours, loss of activities/school closures or loss of resources. Little is known about the impact of the COVID-19 emergency measures (EMs) on children's MH over the course of the pandemic. Longitudinal study of four well-established, pre-existing cohorts in Ontario (two recruited in clinical settings, two recruited in community settings). Primary outcomes include the impact of EMs on six MH domains: depression, anxiety, irritability, inattention, hyperactivity and obsessive-compulsive behaviours. Risk and protective factors related to youth MH profiles and trajectories will be identified. In addition, the effects of school mitigation strategies, changes in MH services and family factors (ie, parental MH, economic deprivation and family functioning) on children's MH will be examined. Data will be collected via repeated online survey measures selected to ensure reliability and validity for the proposed populations and distributed through the pandemic periods. The study was approved by institutional research ethics boards at participating research sites. Results will be disseminated through a robust knowledge translation partnership with key knowledge users. Materials to inform public awareness will be co-developed with educators, public health, and MH and health service providers. Connections with professional associations and MH advocacy groups will be leveraged to support youth MH policy in relation to EMs. Findings will further be shared through conference presentations, peer-reviewed journals and open-access publications.","Korczak, Cost, LaForge-MacKenzie, Anagnostou, Birken, Charach, Monga, Crosbie","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-057248","20220303","COVID-19; anxiety disorders; child &amp; adolescent psychiatry; depression &amp; mood disorders; mental health; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-04","",27808,""
"Mental health, learning behaviour and perceived fatigue among university students during the COVID-19 outbreak: a cross-sectional multicentric study in the UAE","The rapid shift to online education due to COVID-19 quarantine challenged students' ability to accept pure online learning without negative consequences for their physical, emotional and mental health. Some educational institutions introduced new strategies to reduce the psychosocial burden associated with online learning during home confinement. Thus, the primary aims were to determine the consequences of COVID-19 for the psychological well-being and fatigue levels of higher education students and to explore the effects of a new academic assessment approach in reducing home confinement stress. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among students, from 30 August to 30 September 2020, of 7 disciplines in all 16 higher colleges of technology in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The Mental Well-being and Learning Behaviours Scale and the modified Copenhagen Burnout Inventory were used to evaluate students' psychological well-being and fatigue levels. A Welch t-test and Welch ANOVA were performed to determine the differences in perceived psychological well-being associated with students' characteristics. Second, Kruskal_Wallis and Mann_Whitney were performed to determine the differences in fatigue level based on students' characteristics. One thousand four hundred students participated. The majority were female (78.5%) and aged from 21-25Ã‚Â years (58.1%). Around 14% of respondents were married with children. Nearly 40% were satisfied with the new assessment approach introduced during the COVID pandemic and 45.5% perceived it as having reduced their home confinement stress. The mean psychological distress score of 3.00 (SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.71) indicates a moderate impact of COVID-19 on psychological well-being. Students' psychological distress was positively correlated with fatigue level (0.256, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and negatively correlated with the perceived impact of the new assessment approach on student lifestyle (-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.133, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), physical health (-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.149, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and coping with stress (-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.125, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Male students experienced significantly lower fatigue and better psychological well-being than female students. The study reveals that new assessment approaches which emerged during home confinement reduced students' perception of stress and of impaired lifestyle. However, students still had a considerable burden of psychological distress, requiring further preventive measures to maintain their psychological well-being during future outbreak events. Educational institutions should consider additional strategies to improve students' preparedness for online teaching, which could help maintain their psychological well-being.","Mosleh, Shudifat, Dalky, Almalik, Alnajar","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-022-00758-z","20220303","COVID-19 outbreak; Fatigue level; Home confinement-related stress; Psychological well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-04","",27809,""
"Burnout and well-being of healthcare workers in the post-pandemic period of COVID-19: a perspective from the job demands-resources model","The present study aimed 1) to examine the effects of epidemic-related job stressors, perceived social support and organizational support on the burnout and well-being of Chinese healthcare workers in the period of COVID-19 regular epidemic prevention and control and 2) to investigate the moderating effects of social support and organizational support on the relationship between job stressors and burnout and well-being within the theoretical framework of the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model. A sample of healthcare workers (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3477) from 22 hospitals in Beijing, China participated in the cross-sectional investigation in October 2020 and reported epidemic-related job stressors, perceived social support, organizational support, burnout, anxiety and depression symptoms. 1) Medical doctors, females, people aged from 30 to 50, and those who worked in the second line during the pandemic reported higher scores of psychological symptoms and burnout in the period of regular epidemic prevention and control; 2) Epidemic-related job stressors positively predicted burnout, anxiety, and depression among healthcare workers; 3) Perceived social support and organizational support were negatively related to reported burnout, anxiety and depression symptoms; 4) Social support reduced the adverse effects of epidemic-related job stressors on anxiety and depression but enhanced the association between stressors and burnout; 5) Organizational support mitigated the adverse effects of epidemic-related job stressors on depression. The results shed light on preventing burnout and enhancing the psychological well-being of healthcare workers under epidemic prevention and control measures by reducing epidemic-related job stressors and strengthening personal and organizational support systems.","Zhou, Xu, Wang, Sha, Wang, Zhou, Zhang, Hu, Liu, Tian, Liang, Zhou, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-022-07608-z","20220303","Epidemic-related job stressors; Healthcare workers; Organizational support; Social support; Well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-04","",27810,""

"Psychodrama with persons with dementia on zoom: Proof of concept","COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns created a global public health crisis generating mental health problems including social isolation, stress, and anxiety especially for persons with dementia and their carers. This article reports on the use of digital technology to maintain social connectivity via a virtual group session that focused on the topic of ""what is home."" Participants in this session included 16Ã‚Â day-care center clients representing an immigrant community identified with mild to moderate cognitive impairment. A trained psychodrama therapist conducted the virtual group meeting based on five key techniques: spectrogram, role reversal, doubling, mirroring, and soliloquy. The NVivo software was used for the qualitative analysis of the transcribed video recording to identify key themes based on grounded theory methodology. Zooming from home, clients engaged in significant social interaction. Findings of the NVivo analysis identified the following themes of ""what is home"": Emotions and home, Home is family, Home is community, and Reminiscence (with objects and traditions). Findings suggest that digital interactive technologies, like Zoom, enhance social connectivity thus mitigating the negative impact of social isolation for persons with dementia especially during pandemic lockdowns. Our pilot findings based on virtual group meetings from home demonstrate that participants can express significant emotive capacity and enhanced connectivity with one another despite a diagnosis of mild to moderate dementia. While larger studies are needed to confirm these findings, we suggest that this methodology may be used to support persons with dementia not only in times of pandemics but also as an addition to other community and home care services. Changes in reimbursement policies to include these innovative home services may be helpful in building more resilient communities for the more highly vulnerable populations.","Brown, Cedar, Tziraki","https://doi.org/10.1177/14713012221074484","20220303","COVID-19; day care; dementia; interactive technology; psychodrama; social connectivity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-04","",27812,""
"Increased prevalence and severity of psychiatric illness in hospitalized youth during COVID-19","Previous studies have demonstrated an increase in mental health emergencies among youth seen in ambulatory and emergency room settings during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study investigates rates of mental health-related consultation and markers of illness severity since the start of the pandemic. We evaluated all pediatric patients admitted to a single children's hospital from March 2019 to March 2021 who received psychiatry and/or psychology consults. We report the absolute number of these patients, as well as the proportion of all study site admissions who received such consults. Severity of psychiatric illness was described in terms of LOS, disposition, and use of restraints and psychotropic medications. The number and proportion of pediatric patients receiving psychiatry and/or psychology consults rose during the pandemic. Participants also became proportionally more female and older. The study population had higher odds of requiring restraints and antipsychotics during the pandemic. More pediatric inpatients at the study site have required psychiatric care during the pandemic. The severity of mental illness in this population appears to have worsened based on increased utilization of as-needed psychotropic medications and restraints. These findings highlight the changes experienced by patients and providers during the pandemic and merit further study.","Leith, Brieger, Malas, McCaffery, Monroe, Kullgren, Rappaport","https://doi.org/10.1177/13591045221076889","20220303","COVID-19; Hospital pediatrics; adolescent medicine; consultation-liaison psychiatry; coronavirus","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-04","",27813,""
"Associations of online religious participation during COVID-19 lockdown with subsequent health and well-being among UK adults","In-person religious service attendance has been linked to favorable health and well-being outcomes. However, little research has examined whether online religious participation improves these outcomes, especially when in-person attendance is suspended. Using longitudinal data of 8951 UK adults, this study prospectively examined the association between frequency of online religious participation during the stringent lockdown in the UK (23 March -13 May 2020) and 21 indicators of psychological well-being, social well-being, pro-social/altruistic behaviors, psychological distress, and health behaviors. All analyses adjusted for baseline socio-demographic characteristics, pre-pandemic in-person religious service attendance, and prior values of the outcome variables whenever data were available. Bonferroni correction was used to correct for multiple testing. Individuals with online religious participation of Ã¢â€°Â¥1/week (v. those with no participation at all) during the lockdown had a lower prevalence of thoughts of self-harm in week 20 (odds ratio 0.24; 95% CI 0.09-0.62). Online religious participation of &lt;1/week (v. no participation) was associated with higher life satisfaction (standardized ÃŽÂ² = 0.25; 0.11-0.39) and happiness (standardized ÃŽÂ² = 0.25; 0.08-0.42). However, there was little evidence for the associations between online religious participation and all other outcomes (e.g. depressive symptoms and anxiety). There was evidence that online religious participation during the lockdown was associated with some subsequent health and well-being outcomes. Future studies should examine mechanisms underlying the inconsistent results for online v. in-person religious service attendance and also use data from non-pandemic situations.","Shiba, Cowden, Gonzalez, Ransome, Nakagomi, Chen, Lee, VanderWeele, Fancourt","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291722000551","20220303","COVID-19; United Kingdom; health; longitudinal study; online communication; outcome-wide epidemiology; religion; religious service attendance; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-04","",27814,""
"Why are some social-media contents more popular than others? Opinion and association rules mining applied to virality patterns discovery","Discovering the main features of virality patterns in Twitter is the focus of this research. Five trending topics related to the COVID-19 pandemic were selected for the study, with Spanish as the target language. To carry out the discovery of virality patterns, we applied opinion mining techniques that enable us to structure the information based on the polarity of the messages and the emotions they contain. After transforming the information from an unstructured textual representation to a structured one, data mining techniques were applied, specifically association rules mining. Message patterns with the highest virality (high shares and high likes), and at the same time the most relevant characteristics of the patterns with less impact were extracted. After an exhaustive analysis of the most relevant non-redundant rules, it can be concluded that messages with a high-negative polarity and a very high emotional charge, especially emotions that have intensified with the COVID-19 pandemic, such as fear, sadness, anger and surprise are more likely to go viral in social media. By contrast, messages with little news coverage in the media, few authors, and the absence of surprise are relevant features when it comes to seeing messages with very low dissemination in social media.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.116676","20220701","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-04","",27815,""
