"Psychological impact of COVID-19 Pandemic and associated factors on college students","Objective: To determine the psychological impact of coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic on college students, and to explore factors influencing their anxiety and depression levels. Method(s): The cross-sectional study was conducted from October 2020 to January 2021 at the Jinnah Sindh Medical University, Karachi, and comprised medical students of either gender in the first to third year of the academic programme. Data was collected using a pretested online structured questionnaire comprising demographic information, academic problems, daily life difficulties and the 25-item Aga Khan University Anxiety and Depression Scale. Data was analysed using SPSS22. Result(s): Of the 397 students, 72(18.1%) were males and 325(81.9%) were females. The overall mean age of the sample was 19.9+/-1.2 years. Of the total, 221(55.7%) students were found to be anxious and depressed. Factors related to academic difficulties and daily life issues had significant correlation (p&lt;0.05) with anxiety and depression. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that the need for some form of mental health support was the most significant (p&lt;0.001) predictor of anxiety and depression, followed by family issues (p&lt;0.001) and social media (p&lt;0.001). Anxiety and depression were also significantly associated with fear of family or friend getting coronavirus disease-2019 (p=0.003), lack of attentiveness to study (p=0.040) and felt anxiety when ordering food online (p=0.019). Conclusion(s): With better understanding, academic institutions and healthcare policymakers may take measures and mitigate students' distress during the pandemic.

"Concern over career is the primary reason for poor mental health among students","COVID-19 is the cause of a lot of concern around the world. Apart from the obvious physical distress it has contributed significantly to elevation of mental health issues. Students who mostly have not been vaccinated are doing online classes with severe restriction on their social lives. Survey was done with students from school, college and university to determine their mental health status. Their mental health was evaluated with the DASS-21 questionnaire that was distributed and collected online. The students were found to have become vulnerable to stress, anxiety and depression. Their mental health status was found to be poor with university students being most affected. Upon Correlation studies with relevant questions on online education and consequent change in their mode of studies and interaction with family and friends, it was found that university students' concern over their career led to their poor mental health.

"CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) CRISIS AND SUICIDE IN BANGLADESH: SOME EXPLANATIONS THROUGH DURKHEIM'S SOCIOLOGY OF SUICIDE","Whilst the world is experiencing an unprecedented and devastating public health crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic, scholars have apprehended that economic, social and mental health consequences brought by the pandemic might intensify suicidality amongst people. At this backdrop, this content analysis traces the relationship between suicidality and the COVID-19 pandemic employing Emile Durkheim's classical theoretical postulation of the sociology of suicide in the context of Bangladesh. The analysis is based on case reports identified through online newspaper search spanning from January 01 to May 15, 2020. During this period, 10 Covid-19 induced suicide cases were identified. The analysis of the findings captures the linkages between COVID-19 crisis and suicidal behavior according to Durkheim's four-fold typology of the social causation of suicide. The identified cases were fit into egoistic (2), anomic (5) and fatalistic (3) categories. No case was relevant to the altruistic category. As there is no national suicide prevention strategy in Bangladesh, this analysis highlights several immediate and short prevention strategies. Furthermore, this analysis contributes to our sociological understanding that Durkheim's macro-level theory has the potentials to analyze micro-level/case-based suicide incidents.","Khan, Anisur Rahman, Uddin, Md Helal, Shimul, S.

"The shortfalls of online learning catalyzed by COVID-19: Pre-health studentsâ€™ perspective","Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the pivot to distance learning left many higher education institutions scrambling to find the resources to shift materials online and instructors making significant modifications to their courses to adapt. This study is the critical initial step in explaining any relationships between the responsive move to remote learning and academic performance and stress, anxiety, and depression. An eight-month longitudinal cohort study design with an action research methodology was conducted over four waves from June 2020 to January 2021. Participants had the option to be involved with semi-structured, in-depth interviews via Zoom. The qualitative results from the in-depth themes include: health & wellness, relationships & connectedness, transition home, classroom changes, learning & participation, extra-curriculars, COVID-19, virtual challenges, academic performance, and self-regulation. Thus, through thoughtful and intentional accommodations, instructors and students may create a new digital space for learning to improve upon motivational barriers and retaining content.","Wood, Elizabeth A.; Collins, Sarah L.; Hechavarria, Melanie, Foti, Steven, Hack, George","https://doi.org/10.29333/pr/12095","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Pedagogical Research; 7(3), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-10","",40825,""

"Nationwide restrictions to combat consecutive COVID-19 waves: Lessons learnt from a developing country like Bangladesh","Background: Since the first documentation of COVID-19, four waves have hit Bangladesh. This study provides an insight into the scenario of the country during each wave along with the regulations enforced to combat it and it will help the national policy makers to mitigate the loss during any future wave. Main body: Lockdowns were imposed in many phases but despite all these measures, people were reluctant to follow health guidelines, which worsened the situation. These extended restrictions hampered the countryâ€™s economy, peopleâ€™s mental health, and the academic life of the students. To fight such a situation, alternative steps like stringent area-based lockdowns, imposing immediate restrictions, and ensuring compulsory quarantine for people coming from other countries can be taken. People need to be encouraged to follow health guidelines, wear masks, get vaccinated otherwise restrictions alone will not be enough to assist the country to overcome the loss during pandemic. Short conclusion: The identification of the transmitting path, as well as the conduct of contact tracing, must be constantly monitored. Strict legislation, along with peopleâ€™s spontaneous inclination to obey health norms, can help the country overcome the epidemic and establish a positive outcome.","Chowdhury, Aniqua Tasnim, Chowdhury, Sanjana Fatema, Syed Muktadir Al, Sium, Riyan Al Islam, Reshad, Sabrina Khan, Mim, Md.

"CLINICAL FEATURES OF THE NEW CORONAVIRUS INFECTION IN CHILDREN","Currently it is about impossible to discuss whether children and adolescents carry the infectious process caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus only in a mild and asymptomatic form. Ambiguous conclusions can be drawn from the reviewed publications of a number of recent studies in which children and adolescents with complicated course of the new coronavirus infection were under observation. More and more relevant are reports from scientists around the Globe about somatic symptoms that persist after the new coronavirus infection. The purpose of the study was to summarize and analyze the widely available data on the clinical features of the new coronavirus infection in children and adolescents in Russia and worldwide. The bibliographical research was carried out in the reviewed periodicals' databases as follows: PubMed, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, eLIBRARY, and CyberLeninka. The keywords for the search were as follows: COVID-19, children, clinical features, clinical symptoms, post COVID syndrome, long-term symptoms after SARS-CoV-2, physical and mental health, new coronavirus infection, clinical manifestations, cognitive impairment. The reviewed period of publications screened: 2020 to 2022 (to date). In total 152 sources were analyzed, from which 60 most representative studies were selected, that in its turn provide data on the clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 in children during different periods of the disease, starting with the onset of the disease in different age groups. Children are as vulnerable to the SARS-CoV-2 infection as adults but more frequently suffer from the disease in mild forms. The main clinical manifestations during the acute period of COVID-19 in children are as follows: fever, respiratory symptoms (rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, cough, shortness of breath), gastrointestinal manifestations (nausea/vomiting, diarrhea), signs of sensory impairment (anosmia, ageusia), arthralgia/myalgia, weakness, fatigue. At the same time the new coronavirus infection can rapidly progress in a severe/life-threatening form in some children that would require intensive care and respiratory support. In addition, the aggravated comorbid background in the anamnesis of severe/critical cases has a significant value. The cardiological and neurological pathology has a special prognostic value as well. A number of publications have proven the indisputable fact of long-term COVID-19 symptoms in children. According to a number of studies more than 70% of those who recovered from COVID-19 complain of one or more symptoms after the end of the acute period of the disease;in some cases, these complaints can persist for up to 10 weeks, and even up to 6 to 7 months after the recovery (in a number of cases described). The prospect for the in-depth study of the course and consequences of COVID-19 in childhood will provide an opportunity to obtain a clear view on the most frequent clinical features of the disease, factors predisposing to the development of severe/critical/life-threatening conditions, and would allow to develop the clear-cut treatment and prevention algorithms.

"Clinical and functional features and quality of life in depressive disorders in patients undergoing pulmonary thromboendarterectomy","Aim. To conduct a comparative analysis of clinical and functional parameters and quality of life (QoL) in patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), depending on the presence of a depressive disorder in long-term postoperative period. Material and methods. The study included 182 patients with CTEPH in the long term after surgery. Depending on the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) data, all patients were divided into 2 groups: the 1st group - patients without depressive syndrome in the long-term postoperative period, the 2nd - patients with depressive syndrome. A comparative assessment of the initial clinical and functional characteristics, as well as QoL was carried out using the SF-36 questionnaire in both groups of patients. In patients who had a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a comparative assessment using the Post-COVID-19 Functional Status (PCFS) scale was carried out. Results. Clinically relevant depressive syndrome in patients with CTEPH in the long term after surgery was registered in 25,3% of cases. In the 2nd group of patients, prior myocardial infarction (p=0,02), concomitant chronic cerebrovascular disease (p=0,01), as well as moderate and severe post-COVID-19 functional limitations according to the PCFS scale (p=0,004) were significantly more often recorded compared with the 1st group. In the 2nd group of patients, the level of QoL in almost all parameters was significantly lower in comparison with the 1st group (p&lt;0,05). Decreased QoL (score &lt;40) in the 2nd group concerned numerous parameters, including the physical and mental health components. In the 1st group of patients, reduced QoL was observed only in some physical parameters. Conclusion. The group of patients with CTEPH with depressive syndrome in the long-term postoperative period was characterized by a higher incidence of concomitant chronic cerebrovascular disease and a history of myocardial infarction compared with patients without depressive disorders. In the group of patients with depressive disorders, moderate and severe post-COVID-19 functional limitations according to the PCFS scale were more often observed. Depressive disorders in patients with CTEPH in the long-term postoperative period were accompanied by significantly reduced QoL parameters. Patients experienced the greatest difficulties both during normal daily activities and in professional activities. Copyright Â© 2022, Silicea-Poligraf. All rights reserved.","Kamenskaya, O.

"Historical and Current Insights on Environmental Health and Agricultural Guestworkers","Historically, during times of perceived labor shortages in the U.S. agricultural industry, the federal government has enacted policies to ensure the availability of temporary agricultural guestworkers. The current H-2A Temporary Agricultural Guestworker program has been in place for decades, and its use is expanding rapidly. Yet, policies that guarantee a stream of agricultural workers have often failed to protect the health and safety of those workers while they are in this country. Factors such as preexisting health issues, occupational hazards like pesticide and heat exposure, and conditions related to low socioeconomic status merge and accumulate for agricultural workers to negatively impact their health and well-being. H-2A workers face the same occupational and environmental health issues as all agricultural workers, but characteristics of the H-2A program may alter underlying determinants to make these workers even more vulnerable. The consequences of a lack of protective health measures became evident during the COVID-19 pandemic. Agricultural workers, including H-2A workers, were deemed essential during the pandemic and the H-2A program was expanded to meet critical food security needs of the nation, but there was no corresponding additional protection for workers' health at the federal level. Although some states implemented specific protective health measures for agricultural workers, most did not, and there were multiple reports of COVID-19 outbreaks among worker populations. Activists, advocates, and workers themselves recognized the risks of the situation and, as these groups have historically done with environmental health issues, rallied for reform. This Article explores how past policies concerning the public health of agricultural workers, and especially guestworkers, mirror current policy. It offers a framework with which to contextualize the environmental health of agricultural workers, including the disproportionate impact that COVID-19 has had on this occupational community. It describes the efforts of agricultural workers and their advocates to address the current public health crisis. Finally, it recommends that, at the very least, lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic should be incorporated into future policy reform of the H-2A program.","Flocks, Joan, Espinoza, Maria","https://doi.org/10.15779/Z380Z70X8Q","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Ecology Law Quarterly; 48(4):1015, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-10","",40832,""

"Trichoscopic Overlap of Trichotillomania Superseding Alopecia Areata: A Report of Two Cases","Trichoscopy is a non invasive tool useful for diagnosis of dermatoses on hair bearing skin. Alopecia Areata (AA) is a common non scarring alopecia with varying aetiologies including autoimmune and genetic factors. Trichotillomania (TTM) is a psychocutaneous dermatosis characterised by compulsive hair plucking leading to hair loss at accessible sites. Trichoscopy can be used for diagnosing both these dermatoses at an early stage due to presence of distinct trichoscopic signs. Authors hereby intend to report two cases presenting with a trichoscopic overlap of trichotillomania superseding alopecia areata. First case was of a 27-year-old male presented with patchy hair loss for three months over scalp. On clinical examination, the case appeared to be of AA with involvement of three well-defined patches on the scalp, though trichoscopy suggested an overlap of AA with TTM. On probing patient gave a history of stressors predominantly of unemployment due to Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic but denied the history of compulsive hair pulling, indicating that TTM must have superseded patches AA. The second case was a 20-year-old female presenting with a single patch of hair loss over mid scalp. There was atrophy in the centre and easy pluckability at borders. Trichoscopy yet again suggested an overlap of AA with TTM. The patch of AA was persistent in the patient giving rise to depression and anxiety which had probably provoked hair plucking. TTM and AA are two distinct clinical entities but can be simultaneously present in patients. Trichoscopy can be indeed helpful for diagnosis in such cases. Treatment modalities should therefore address both these conditions in such cases for better outcomes. Copyright Â© 2022 Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

"Psychopathological symptomatology as a mediator between negative emotions and life satisfaction in Peruvian population in the context of COVID-19","Introduction: The objective was to establish an explana-tory model of life satisfaction as a function of negative emotions mediated by the psychopathological severity index, as well as to describe and compare psychopathological symp-tomatology as a function of sociodemographic variables. Methodology: The research design was non-experimental, cross-sectional, descriptive and structural equation modeling. The sample consisted of 1965 Peruvians of both sexes aged 17 to 71 years. The instruments used were the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Abbreviated Scale (DASS 21), Symptom Assessment-45 Questionnaire (SA-45) and Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS). Result(s): The structural regression model shows that negative emotions have a positive effect (R2 = 64%) on the global severity index (GSI) of psychopathological symptomatology and in turn the latter has a negative impact (R2 = 23%) on the life satisfaction of Peruvians. Among the psychopathological symptoms, psychoticism (19.64%), followed by phobic anxiety (19.44%) and depression (19.03%) stand out. In the macroregions, the GSI varied between 12.54% and 19.32%, with the lowest GSI in the northeast-ern macroregion and the highest in the north. Conclusion(s): Significant differences in psychopathological symptomatol-ogy were found according to macroregions, sex, age, having children, having a family member infected or deceased by COVID-19.

"Psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the pediatric population: an implication for clinical practice","The current article briefly reviews the factors that contributed toward risk and resilience experienced by children and families during the pandemic of coronavirus disease-2019 with a focus on the child's behavior and emotional adjustment. The widespread closures of schools for an indefinite period led to a huge slide in academic learning of children at the local and global level, especially from low-income families. Increased time spent indoors, lack of peer interaction and learning remotely on electronic devices led to an exponential increase in time spent using technology and screens, decrease in physical activity, unhealthy eating habits and routines, and poor-quality sleep among children and adolescents during the pandemic. Increase in loneliness was documented in several studies and since loneliness is inextricably linked to mental health outcomes such as increased depression and anxiety these negative emotions are a matter of concern for child health professionals. Several governmental policies and remedial actions were initiated in the education, economic, and social sectors to support the developmental needs of children and pave the way forward. On the positive side, the stay-at-home mandate provided some families a unique opportunity to positively connect, engage in shared family activities, discover new strengths, and develop their interests. The real influence of the pandemic may well extend beyond the infection and profoundly impact children's overall development and quality of life. Effective preventive supports and prioritized targeted measures are therefore needed to ensure the subjective well-being of children during and after the pandemic.","Prahbhjot, Malhi","https://doi.org/10.5005/jp-journals-10028-1552","","Database: CAB Abstracts; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Postgraduate Medicine, Education and Research; 56(1):3-6, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-10","",40837,""
"'The show must go on': Aftermath of Covid-19 on anesthesiology residency programs","COVID-19 has caused tectonic changes in the personal and professional lives of anesthesiologists and, among several aspects, anesthesiology residency and sub-specialty training has also undergone an unforeseen overhaul. We read the articles published on the impact of COVID-19 on training of anesthesiologists and set out to extract and narrate all the significant observations. At the outset, we begin by explaining how this pandemic posed a threat to the safety of the residents and mitigating measures like PPE and barriers that have now become 'the new normal'. Sub-specialties like critical care, cardiac anesthesia, pain and palliative care have also faced difficulty in imparting training due to an initial dearth in elective surgery case load but have adapted innovative measures to overcome that. Initially, conducting thesis and research became difficult due to problems in achieving the desires sample size needed to get significant results, but this pandemic has emerged as a dynamic laboratory where topics like 'psychological impact of COVID-19' and 'development of artificial intelligence models in COVID -19 ICUs' came into the fore. Pattern of examination has also become virtual and webinars showed how knowledge, with the right medium, has the potential of global outreach. As the pandemic took a toll on the mental health of the residents, attention was paid to this previously neglected aspect and ensuring their emotional well-being became a priority to avoid the issue of burn-out. We comment on how what initially was considered a scary problem, actually paved way for growth. It brought attention to safety, innovation, new tools for training, finding solutions within constraints, continuing developing our residents into future leaders who were also trained for mitigating disasters. Changes like online education, research on socio-economic impact, priority to mental health and artificial intelligence are here to stay and by imbibing it, we ensure that 'the show must go on'.

"Resilience and its correlates among medical students in the eastern part of India during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic","BACKGROUND: There is a great deal of psychological pressure on medical students, which results in depression, addiction, and suicide. Resilience plays a significant role in coping with psychological distress. The study aimed to determine the resilience level of medical students in Kolkata and factors related to it. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among undergraduate students of a medical college in the eastern part of India during October 2020. Resilience was assessed using the validated ""Adult Resilience Measure-R."" Data were collected on Google Forms and analyzed using SPSS (version 16.0). Logistic regression analysis was performed to find factors associated with low resilience. RESULTS: The study revealed that one-fourth (25.2%) of the participants had low-level resilience. Nearly half (44.9%) of them perceived their mental health status as having worsened during the lockdown. Students who did not enjoy staying at home during the lockdown and who spent &lt;10 h of their time with their family members had higher odds of low resilience. In multivariable analysis, not enjoying staying at home during the lockdown remained the only significant predictor of low resilience. CONCLUSION: Students should spend more time with their parents and family members and learn coping skills. Appropriate resilience training programs have to be integrated into the medical curriculum to help in coping with future challenges.","Poulomi, Golui, Saptarshi, Roy, Indira, Dey, Jayeeta, Burman, Sembagamuthu, Sembiah","https://doi.org/10.4103/jfcm.jfcm_94_22","","Database: CAB Abstracts; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Family and Community Medicine; 29(3):212-216, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-10","",40839,""
"Sociodemographic Correlates of Coping Styles Among the General Population in Saudi Arabia During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Objective: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the different demographic variables and other social, and health-related factors, and the coping styles used by the general population in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): A cross-sectional study involving 5,514 participants was conducted online over two weeks. An online questionnaire was distributed among attendees of a public awareness cam-paign. The questionnaire consisted of two sections: (1) sociodemographic variables and questions exploring the physical and mental health of the participants, along with COVID-19-related questions, and (2) the brief COPE questionnaire to identify the coping styles used by the participants. Result(s): The most frequently used adaptive styles involved religion, acceptance, and positive reframing. As for the maladaptive styles, self-distraction, venting, and self-blame were the most frequently used. Comparing the means of coping styles, participants older than 60 and female participants more frequently used religion, acceptance, positive reframing, and active coping, while participants younger than 35 and male participants reported more frequent use of instrumental support and humor. Younger participants used all maladaptive coping styles more frequently than older participants;male and female participants appeared to use different mala-daptive coping styles. People with mental health conditions showed less frequent use of adaptive coping styles and more frequent use of maladaptive coping styles. Conclusion(s): The findings of this study show that multiple sociodemographic and health variables such as age, gender, and the presence of mental health conditions may influence the type of coping styles people use during a crisis. These findings could offer a better understanding of how the general public is coping with this unique situation. This may help mental healthcare workers and public health officials provide appropriate support at both individual and general population levels during this pandemic.

"Romantic Relationship Quality and Mental Health in Pregnancy During the Covid-19 Pandemic","Introduction: Social capital is important for good mental health and the quality of close relationships is one key indicator of social capital. Examining the association between relationship quality and mental health may be particularly important during pregnancy as mental health concerns during this period pose significant risk to families. The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to increased mental health problems among pregnant individuals. The resulting lockdown protocols of the pandemic have also disrupted larger social networks and couples spent more time together in the context of ongoing chronic stress, highlighting the particular importance of romantic relationship quality. This study explored longitudinal associations between relationship satisfaction, depression, and anxiety among pregnant individuals during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Pregnant individuals (n = 1842) from the Pregnancy During the Pandemic Study were surveyed monthly (April-July 2020). Depression, anxiety symptoms, and relationship satisfaction were self-reported. Cross-lagged panel models were conducted to examine bidirectional associations between relationship satisfaction and mental health symptoms over time. Results: Relationship satisfaction was significantly correlated with depression and anxiety at all time points. Longitudinally, relationship satisfaction predicted later depression and anxiety symptoms, but depression and anxiety symptoms did not predict later relationship satisfaction. Discussion: This study suggests that poor relationship satisfaction was linked to subsequent elevations in prenatal depressive and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Relationship enhancement interventions during pregnancy may be a means of improving the mental health of pregnant individuals, and interrupting transgenerational transmission, during times of prolonged psychological distress.","Xie, E.

"[Text-mining of children's answers to national web-survey questions on parental status during COVID-19]","ObjectivesÃ£â‚¬â‚¬Behavior at school has been restricted due to infection control during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to clarify children's opinions by examining the structure of their text responses to open-ended web survey questions, as well as how they differed to the psychological and socio-economic status of their parents.MethodÃ£â‚¬â‚¬From September to October 2020, approximately six months after the temporary closure of schools in Japan due to COVID-19, 2,111 respondents (elementary, junior high, and high school students) answered a questionnaire on ""The third wave of CORONA-CODOMO project"" website. The text data of 1,140 students who provided free-text answers to open-ended questions such as, ""what are you concerned about and what do you want to say?"" (comments) and ""how should I get them to understand?"" (proposals) were analyzed. Results were stratified by parental demographics such as age, employment status, the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6), and financial status. The text mining assessed the frequency of word appearances, analyzed characteristic words, and showed a term network (word-relationship diagram).ResultsÃ£â‚¬â‚¬The total number of lines (number of respondents) of comments and proposal texts were 531 and 1,017, respectively, and the average line length (number of characters) was 21.5 and 31.5, respectively. In the dependency relations frequency analysis, the actions of proposals and comments such as ""speaking-listening"", ""event-disappearing"", and ""mask-removing"" appeared. In the word network, words such as ""moving"" and ""speaking"" formed a strong co-occurrence network to ""I"", which had the largest node in proposals, while ""COVID-19"" in the comments strongly co-occurred with ""end+?"" (predicate attribute: question) and ""I+want to disappear"" (predicate attribute: aspirations). According to the parent attributes, in the proposals, the characteristic words (complementary similarity measure) were ""talk"" (35.9) in the employed group, ""talk"" (26.6) in the K6 lower score group, and ""understand+not"" (23.5/17.3, predicate attribute: negation) in the K6 higher score group/bad economic status. In the comments, it was ""COVID-19"" (28.1, 27.5) in the employed group and the high mental health group.ConclusionsÃ£â‚¬â‚¬While children displayed discomfort and fear of COVID-19 when asked about proposals, the children were willing to talk directly, also, they wanted someone to listen to them. The characteristics of the proposals in their answers were ""I don't know"" in both the high mental burden group and the bad economic status group of the parents.","Ohno, Sampei, Hasegawa, Matsukuma, Hangai, Morisaki","https://doi.org/10.11236/jph.21-144","20221109","COVID-19 infection control; children; national survey; socio-economic status; text mining","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-10","",40842,""

"Adapting DIALOG+ in a School Setting-A Tool to Support Well-being and Resilience in Adolescents Living in Postconflict Areas During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Protocol for a Cluster Randomized Exploratory Study","Colombia has a long history of an armed conflict that has severely affected communities with forced internal displacement and violence. Victims of violence and armed conflicts have higher rates of mental health disorders, and children and adolescents are particularly affected. However, the mental health needs of this population are often overlooked, especially in low- and middle-Income countries, where scarcity of resources exacerbates the problem that has been further compounded by the global COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, special attention should be paid to the development of interventions that target this population. Our research aims to adapt an existing patient-centered digital intervention called DIALOG+ from a clinical setting to an educational setting using stakeholders' (teachers' and students') perspectives. We aim to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and estimated effect of implementing this intervention as a tool for the identification and mobilization of personal and social resources to mitigate the impact of social difficulties and to promote mental well-being. We will conduct an exploratory mixed methods study in public schools of postconflict areas in Tolima, Colombia. The study consists of 3 phases: adaptation, exploration, and consolidation of the DIALOG+ tool. The adaptation phase will identify possible changes that the intervention requires on the basis of data from focus groups with teachers and students. The exploration phase will be an exploratory cluster randomized trial with teachers and school counselors to assess the acceptability, feasibility, and estimated effect of DIALOG+ for adolescents in school settings. Adolescents' data about mental health symptoms and wellness will be collected before and after DIALOG+ implementation. During this phase, teachers or counselors who were part of the intervention group will share their opinions through the think-aloud method. Lastly, the consolidation phase will consist of 2 focus groups with teachers and students to discuss their experiences and to understand acceptability. Study recruitment was completed in March 2022, and follow-up is anticipated to last through November 2022. This exploratory study will evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and estimated effect of DIALOG+ for adolescents in postconflict school settings in Colombia. The use of this technology-supported tool aims to support interactions between teachers or counselors and students and to provide an effective student-centered communication guide. This is an innovative approach in both the school and the postconflict contexts that could help improve the mental health and wellness of adolescents in vulnerable zones in Colombia.

"Preexisting Neuropsychiatric Conditions and Associated Risk of Severe COVID-19 Infection and Other Acute Respiratory Infections","Evidence indicates that preexisting neuropsychiatric conditions confer increased risks of severe outcomes from COVID-19 infection. It is unclear how this increased risk compares with risks associated with other severe acute respiratory infections (SARIs). To determine whether preexisting diagnosis of and/or treatment for a neuropsychiatric condition is associated with severe outcomes from COVID-19 infection and other SARIs and whether any observed association is similar between the 2 outcomes. Prepandemic (2015-2020) and contemporary (2020-2021) longitudinal cohorts were derived from the QResearch database of English primary care records. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 99% CIs were estimated in April 2022 using flexible parametric survival models clustered by primary care clinic. This study included a population-based sample, including all adults in the database who had been registered with a primary care clinic for at least 1 year. Analysis of routinely collected primary care electronic medical records was performed. Diagnosis of and/or medication for anxiety, mood, or psychotic disorders and diagnosis of dementia, depression, schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder. COVID-19-related mortality, or hospital or intensive care unit admission; SARI-related mortality, or hospital or intensive care unit admission. The prepandemic cohort comprised 11Ã¢â‚¬Â¯134Ã¢â‚¬Â¯789 adults (223Ã¢â‚¬Â¯569 SARI cases [2.0%]) with a median (IQR) age of 42 (29-58) years, of which 5Ã¢â‚¬Â¯644Ã¢â‚¬Â¯525 (50.7%) were female. The contemporary cohort comprised 8Ã¢â‚¬Â¯388Ã¢â‚¬Â¯956 adults (58Ã¢â‚¬Â¯203 severe COVID-19 cases [0.7%]) with a median (IQR) age of 48 (34-63) years, of which 4Ã¢â‚¬Â¯207Ã¢â‚¬Â¯192 were male (50.2%). Diagnosis and/or treatment for neuropsychiatric conditions other than dementia was associated with an increased likelihood of a severe outcome from SARI (anxiety diagnosis: HR, 1.16; 99% CI, 1.13-1.18; psychotic disorder diagnosis and treatment: HR, 2.56; 99% CI, 2.40-2.72) and COVID-19 (anxiety diagnosis: HR, 1.16; 99% CI, 1.12-1.20; psychotic disorder treatment: HR, 2.37; 99% CI, 2.20-2.55). The effect estimate for severe outcome with dementia was higher for those with COVID-19 than SARI (HR, 2.85; 99% CI, 2.71-3.00 vs HR, 2.13; 99% CI, 2.07-2.19). In this longitudinal cohort study, UK patients with preexisting neuropsychiatric conditions and treatments were associated with similarly increased risks of severe outcome from COVID-19 infection and SARIs, except for dementia.","Ranger, Clift, Patone, Coupland, Hatch, Thomas, Watkinson, Hippisley-Cox","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2022.3614","20221109","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-10","",40850,""
"Loneliness in Elderly Inpatients","Loneliness among the elderly is a widespread phenomenon and is connected to various negative health outcomes. Nevertheless, loneliness among elderly inpatients, especially those with a psychiatric diagnosis, has hardly been examined. Our study assessed loneliness in elderly inpatients, identified predictors, and compared levels of loneliness between inpatients on psychiatric and somatic wards. NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°100 elderly inpatients of a somatic and psychiatric ward were included. Levels of loneliness were assessed, as were potential predictors such as depression, psychological resilience, severity of mental illness, well-being, daily functioning, and psychiatric diagnosis. Analyses of group differences and hierarchical multiple regression analysis were conducted. 37% of all inpatients reported elevated levels of loneliness. Significant predictor variables were self-reported depressive symptoms, well-being, severity of mental illness, being single and living with a caregiver. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis revealed that the full model explained 58% of variance in loneliness. Psychiatric inpatients' loneliness was significantly higher than loneliness in somatic inpatients. When analyzing group differences between inpatients with different main psychiatric diagnoses, highest levels were found in patients with an affective disorder, followed by those treated for organic mental disorder. Since the study took place during the COVID-19 pandemic, potential influence of different measurement points (lockdown vs. no lockdown) were analyzed: Differences in loneliness depending on the phase of the pandemic were non-significant. Elderly inpatients experience high levels of loneliness, especially those with a mental disorder. Interventions to reduce loneliness in this population should address predictors of loneliness, preferably through multiprofessional interventions.","Just, Seethaler, Sarpeah, WaÃƒÅ¸muth, Bermpohl, Brandl, Just","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-022-10006-7","20221109","Covid; Depression; Elderly; Geriatric; Hospitalization; Loneliness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-10","",40851,""
"HBK-15, a Multimodal Compound, Showed an Anxiolytic-Like Effect in Rats","Anxiety is a common mental disorder, and its prevalence has lately increased because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, the available anxiolytics are often ineffective, and most possess addictive potential. Thus, searching for novel compounds is essential. In our previous studies, we selected a multimodal compound, HBK-15, which showed a fast antidepressant-like effect in animal models of depression. HBK-15 demonstrated a high affinity for serotonin 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors and moderate for 5-HT<sub>7</sub>, dopamine D<sub>2</sub>, and ÃŽÂ±<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors. Based on the receptor profile and preliminary studies, we aimed to investigate the anxiolytic potential of HBK-15 using the conditioned-response rat model of anxiety, i.e., the Vogel drinking test. We performed hot plate and free-drinking tests to exclude false positive results in the Vogel test. Using radioligand binding studies, we also investigated the affinity of the compound for theÃ‚Â selected biological targets, which play a role in anxiety. Our experiments revealed that HBK-15 showed an anxiolytic-like effect in rats (5Ã‚Â mg/kg) without influencing the pain threshold or theÃ‚Â amount of water consumed in the free-drinking test. Furthermore, the tested compound did not show a significant affinity for the selected biological targets, which suggests that its anxiolytic-like mechanism of action could be connected with the interaction with other receptors. This study indicates that multimodal compounds with a receptor profile similar to HBK-15 could be an attractive therapeutic option for patients with aÃ‚Â generalized anxiety disorder. However, more studies are required to determine the exact mechanism of action of HBK-15 and its safety profile.","Lustyk, SaÃ…â€šaciak, Jakubczyk, JastrzÃ„â„¢bska-WiÃ„â„¢sek, Partyka, WesoÃ…â€šowska, Marona, Pytka","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11064-022-03802-x","20221109","2-Methoxyphenylpiperazine derivative; 5-HT1A receptor; A rat model of anxiety; Anxiety; Radioligand binding","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-10","",40852,""
"Impact of the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic on the use of mental health services in South Korea: a nationwide, health insurance data-based study","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has profoundly affected the utilization of mental health services. Existing evidence investigating this issue at the nationwide level is lacking, and it is uncertain whether the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the use of psychiatric services differs based on psychiatric diagnosis. Data from the claims database between October 2015 and August 2020 was obtained from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment agency in South Korea. Based on the main diagnostic codes, psychiatric patients were identified and categorized into diagnostic groups (anxiety disorders, bipolar and related disorders, depressive disorders, and schizophrenia spectrum disorders). We calculated the number of psychiatric inpatients and outpatients and the medication adherence of patients for each month. We compared the actual and predicted values of outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic and performed interrupted time-series analyses to test the statistical significance of the impact of the pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of inpatients and admissions to psychiatric hospitals decreased for bipolar and related disorders and depressive disorders. In addition, the number of patients admitted to psychiatric hospitals for schizophrenia spectrum disorders decreased. The number of psychiatric outpatients showed no significant change in all diagnostic groups. Increased medication adherence was observed for depressive, schizophrenia spectrum, and bipolar and related disorders. In the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a trend of a decreasing number of psychiatric inpatients and increasing medication adherence; however, the number of psychiatric outpatients remained unaltered.","Joo, Kim, Jo, Ahn, Choi, Choi, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-022-02382-z","20221109","COVID-19 pandemic; Mental health services; Nationwide study; Psychiatric admission","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-10","",40853,""
"Associations between breastfeeding intention, breastfeeding practices and post-natal depression during the COVID-19 pandemic: A multi-country cross-sectional study","Associations between breastfeeding intention, duration and post-natal depression (PND) have been shown in pre-COVID-19 studies. However, studies during COVID-19 have not examined the associations between breastfeeding intention, breastfeeding practices, and PND in an international sample of post-natal women, taking into consideration COVID-19 related factors. This is the first study to address this gap as both PND and breastfeeding may be affected by COVID-19, and have important long-term effects on women's and infant's health. A cross-sectional internet-based survey was conducted with 3253 post-natal women from five countries: Brazil, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United Kingdom from July to November 2021. The results showed that women who intended to breastfeed during pregnancy had lower odds of having PND than women who did not intend to. Women who had no breastfeeding intention but actually breastfed had greater odds (AOR 1.75) of having PND than women who intended to breastfeed and actually breastfed. While there was no statistical significance in expressed breast milk feeding in multivariable logistic regression models, women who had shorter duration of breastfeeding directly on breast than they planned had greater odds (AOR 1.58) of having PND than those who breastfed longer than they planned even after adjusting for covariates including COVID-19-related variables. These findings suggested the importance of working with women on their breastfeeding intention. Tailored support is required to ensure women's breastfeeding needs are met and at the same time care for maternal mental health during and beyond the pandemic.","Chang, Li, Chien, Lee, Hong, Coca","https://doi.org/10.1111/mcn.13450","20221109","COVID-19; breastfeeding; breastfeeding duration; breastfeeding intention; infant feeding behaviour; post-natal depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-10","",40854,""
"Neural response to social but not monetary reward predicts increases in depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic","The prevalence of depressive symptoms has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially among those with greater pandemic-related stress exposure; however, not all individuals exposed to pandemic stress will develop depression. Determining which individuals are vulnerable to depressive symptoms as a result of this stress could lead to an improved understanding of the etiology of depression. This study sought to determine whether neural sensitivity to monetary and/or social reward prospectively predicts depressive symptoms during periods of high stress. 121 participants attended pre-pandemic laboratory visits where they completed monetary and social reward tasks while electroencephalogram was recorded. Subsequently, from March to August 2020, we sent eight questionnaires probing depressive symptoms and exposure to pandemic-related stressors. Using repeated-measures multilevel models, we evaluated whether neural response to social or monetary reward predicted increases in depressive symptoms across the early course of the pandemic. Furthermore, we examined whether neural response to social or monetary reward moderated the association between pandemic-related episodic stressors and depressive symptoms. Pandemic-related stress exposure was strongly associated with depressive symptoms. Additionally, we found that blunted neural response to social but not monetary reward predicted increased depressive symptoms during the pandemic. However, neither neural response to social nor monetary reward moderated the association between episodic stress exposure and depressive symptoms. Our findings indicate that neural response to social reward may be a useful predictor of depressive symptomatology under times of chronic stress, particularly stress with a social dimension.","Freeman, Panier, Schaffer, Weinberg","https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14206","20221109","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-10","",40855,""
"Stressors and mental health impacts of COVID-19 in dental students: A scoping review","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to mental health hazards to healthcare providers in general and to undergraduate dental students. The present study undertakes a scoping review to identify and discuss the mental health issues and stressors impacting dental students globally during the COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic search following the Joanna Briggs Institute's framework for scoping reviews was conducted on Embase, MEDLINE by Ovid, Web of Science, PsycInfo, CINAHL, and ERIC to identify peer reviewed publications published globally since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 until June 22, 2021. Manual search was also performed on Google scholar. Eligible studies were selected based on the predetermined set of criteria and focused specifically on mental health issues experienced by undergraduate dental students in the context of COVID-19. Fifty-five publications were retained. Fifty-one reported stress, anxiety, or depression experienced by undergraduate dental students during the pandemic. Twenty-five studies employed validated psychometric instruments to explore mental health status among the same students. A total of 28 publications reported that the predominant concern for students was fear of infection, especially during patient interaction. Adapting to virtual learning, clinical skill deficit due to lack of/limited practical training and social isolation were other majorly reported stressors. Many mental health issues and stressors related to the COVID-19 pandemic have been identified. Mitigation of COVID-19-related stressors on dental students' mental health should be a priority across all dental academic institutions. Continued efforts should be made to create a supportive learning environment.","Ramachandran, Shayanfar, Brondani","https://doi.org/10.1002/jdd.13122","20221109","COVID-19; dental education; dental students; mental health; stressors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-10","",40856,""
"Behavioral symptoms, depression symptoms, and medication use in Michigan nursing home residents with dementia during COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted nursing home (NH) care, including visitation restrictions, reduced staffing levels, and changes in routine care. These challenges may have led to increased behavioral symptoms, depression symptoms, and central nervous system (CNS)-active medication use among long-stay NH residents with dementia. We conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional study including Michigan long-stay (Ã¢â€°Â¥100Ã¢â‚¬â€°days) NH residents aged Ã¢â€°Â¥65 with dementia based on Minimum Data Set (MDS) assessments from January 1, 2018 to June 30, 2021. Residents with schizophrenia, Tourette syndrome, or Huntington's disease were excluded. Outcomes were the monthly prevalence of behavioral symptoms (i.e., Agitated Reactive Behavior ScaleÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°1), depression symptoms (i.e., Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ]-9Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°10, reflecting at least moderate depression), and CNS-active medication use (e.g., antipsychotics). Demographic, clinical, and facility characteristics were included. Using an interrupted time series design, we compared outcomes over two periods: Period 1: January 1, 2018-February 28, 2020 (pre-COVID-19) and Period 2: March 1, 2020-June 30, 2021 (during COVID-19). We included 37,427 Michigan long-stay NH residents with dementia. The majority were female, 80Ã¢â‚¬â€°years or older, White, and resided in a for-profit NH facility. The percent of NH residents with moderate depression symptoms increased during COVID-19 compared to pre-COVID-19 (4.0% vs 2.9%, slope change [SC]Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.03, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05).

"A Meta-Analysis of 13 Randomized Trials on Traditional Chinese Medicine as Adjunctive Therapy for COVID-19: Novel Insights into Lianhua Qingwen","The efficacy and safety of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) paired with western medicine in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 remains controversial. This meta-analysis was performed to identify the effects of TCM. Seven electronic databases were reviewed from the inception of these databases to 30 June 2022. A quality assessment of the included studies was performed with the Cochrane Collaboration's tool to provide a score of high, unclear, or low risk of bias. The standard software program (Stata, version 12.0, statistical software) was used for endpoint analyses. A total of 13 RCTs involving 1398 patients conducted in China were included. The cross-sectional data from various studies were plotted, and the results illustrated that the statistically higher rates of total effectiveness (RR, 1.357; 95% CI, 1.259 to 1.464; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), improvement of chest CT (RR, 1.249; 95% CI, 1.143 to 1.356; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), and cough improvement (RR, 1.228; 95% CI, 1.057 to 1.570; <i>P</i> = 0.012) and a lower incidence of conversion to severe cases (RR, 0.408; 95% CI, 0.275 to 0.605; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) were demonstrated in the TCM group than that of the control group. Of note, the subgroup on specific TCM of Lianhua Qingwen (LQ) revealed that the experiment group was associated with a higher rate of total effectiveness (RR, 1.248; 95% CI, 1.136 to 1.371; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) and improvement of chest CT (RR, 1.226; 95% CI, 1.110 to 1.356; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) and a lower rate of conversion to severe cases (RR, 0.469; 95% CI, 0.311 to 0.707; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in fever improvement (RD, 0.110; 95% CI, -0.063 to 0.283; <i>P</i> = 0.213). The findings of this meta-analysis suggest that TCM combined with western medicine is more effective in treating COVID-19 via relieving symptoms, promoting patients' recovery, and cutting the rate of patients developing into severe conditions. However, given the relevant possible biases in our study, adequately powered and better-designed studies with long-term follow-up are required to reach a firmer conclusion.","Lei, Guan, Xin, Yang","https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/4133610","20221110","Humans; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-10","",40858,""
"Preventing burnout and substance use disorder among healthcare professionals through breathing exercises, emotion identification, and writing activities","The introduction of the COVID-19 pandemic has placed additional strain on healthcare workers, inducing immense levels of stress and workplace burnout. Health care professionals are acutely susceptible to COVID-19 exposure, ultimately leading to elevated levels of anxiety and mental illness. For example, dental professionals are at high risk due to their close work with the oral cavity. To provide temporary relief to the stress, some may turn toward substance use, especially if that individual has some form of mental illness. To curb the onset of burnout and its byproduct of substance use disorder, it is crucial to be equipped with proper tools and healthy habits that can counteract extreme levels of stress. In this article, a time-effective, 3-step method is introduced, with each activity proven to lessen burnout symptoms. When followed, an individual can navigate burnout's symptoms through a healthy mind and body approach. Additionally, resources to find resilience-building and mentorship programs are provided. Common substance use support groups and information regarding group meetings and contact information are listed.","Kulchar, Haddad","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xjep.2022.100570","20221109","Addiction; COVID-19 pandemic; Dentist; Depression; Mentorship; Stress; Support group","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-10","",40859,""
"Menstrual Changes after COVID-19 Infection and COVID-19 Vaccination","Several factors such as stress, depression, infection, and vaccination influenced the menstrual cycle in women during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We investigated whether there were changes in the menstrual cycle in women after COVID-19 vaccination or infection and, if so, the nature of the change. This study was designed as a descriptive, cross-sectional study. A face-to-face survey was conducted among menstruating women aged 18-50 years from May 31 to July 31, 2022. Women were inquired about their first three menstrual cycles that occurred after COVID-19 infection or vaccination. Of 241 women with COVID-19 infection, 86 (35.7%) mentioned that they experienced various changes in their menstrual patterns in the first three cycles after infection. Of 537 participants who received various COVID-19 vaccines, 82 (15.1%) stated that they experienced changes in their menstrual patterns after vaccination. The incidence of postvaccination menstrual change was higher in women who received Pfizer-BioNTech and Sinovac (CoronaVac) vaccines. Only 10.9% of women who reported a change in their menstrual pattern after vaccination or infection consulted a physician. COVID-19 infection and vaccination can affect the menstrual cycle in women.

"The Fast and the Furious: The Rapid Implementation of Tele-mental Health Practices Within a Children's Advocacy Center","We work at a large, urban children's advocacy center (CAC) that provides treatment and services to approximately 2000 children and families each year who have experienced child abuse and other forms of trauma. While the complexity and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on both physical and mental health are only beginning to be understood, families with histories of abuse and other traumatic experiences are particularly vulnerable to the negative impacts of isolation due to the extended lockdown. When the COVID-19 pandemic was identified as a public health crisis, the team of providers at the CAC pivoted to meet the newly emerging needs of the children and families served. Tele-mental health practices (TMH) were immediately implemented that required a deep understanding of the imminent safety concerns related to conducting TMH when the client may not feel safe at home. Further, while most of the clients referred for services have experienced child abuse and/or other types of trauma, COVID-19 is its own potentially traumatic event that can further exacerbate an individual's lack of safety and vulnerability to trauma. The current paper provides an overview of the rapid implementation of TMH practices within a large, urban CAC setting. We share the specific tele-mental health practices and implementation strategies that were put into place because of COVID-19 and how they align with the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, as well as recommendations for how agency leadership can better facilitate the implementation of innovative practices in similar settings.","Conradi, Hazen, Covert","https://doi.org/10.1007/s43477-022-00065-0","20221109","ChildrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s advocacy centers; Implementation science; Rapid implementation approaches; Tele-mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-10","",40861,""

"Canadian Healthcare System and Individuals with Severe Mental Disorders During Coronavirus Disease 2019: Challenges and Unmet Needs","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a syndemic of viral infection and mental health adversity. The pandemic has exacerbated inequalities of access to care in vulnerable populations within the Canadian mental healthcare system. Primary care services are first-line health services in Canada, and are necessary to access specialized services. However, as a result of the limited availability of primary health services, and subsequently, specialized providers (eg, psychiatrists), the demand for these services outweigh the supply. Hitherto, timely access to appropriate services has been cited as a common challenge in Canada as a result of limitations as it relates to resources and in-person activities and support services. While there has been an increase in virtual care opportunities, concerns have been raised with respect to the digital divide. Moreover, while individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) and psychosis are at an increased risk for hospitalization and death from COVID-19, testing and vaccination services have not been prioritized for this population. Taken together, increased funding for mental health service delivery should be emphasized especially for individuals with SMI. There should also be a focus on increased collaboration among individuals with lived experience and health care providers to ensure future policies are developed specifically for this population. Addressing the social determinants of health and prioritizing a continuum of care across various stakeholders may lead to strong integration of care both during and after the pandemic.","Lui, McIntyre","https://doi.org/10.1093/schizbullopen/sgac036","20221109","COVID-19; Canada; health systems; healthcare; mood disorders; psychosis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-10","",40863,""
"Challenges and Insights From Treating Psychotic Disorders During COVID-19 Pandemic in Brazil","The COVID-19 pandemic mainly affected the most vulnerable individuals. Among those, patients with schizophrenia especially suffered from unexpected changes in their routines, barriers to treatment, and distress-related events. We conducted a narrative review using all available sources of information to describe the challenges faced by schizophrenia patients and their families in Brazil, including the strategies that have been adopted to tackle them. In addition, we analyzed public data on antipsychotic prescriptions and hospitalizations. It was found that digital prescriptions with extended expiration dates implemented during the pandemic in Brazil allowed patients to maintain their access to antipsychotics. Hospitalizations among patients with schizophrenia, schizotypal, and schizoaffective disorders decreased at the beginning of the pandemic. Nevertheless, in the following months, the admissions returned to a trend similar to the prepandemic period. The systematization of online resources will be one of the main legacies to mental health care, including schizophrenia. We believe one of the main limitations of the policies adopted was the decision to not prioritize COVID-19 vaccination in patients with severe psychiatric disorders, despite preliminary evidence of a higher risk of complications in this group. The coronavirus pandemic is still ongoing and a longer time will be required to have a better perspective of its effects, but we expect this record of challenges and insights about the lessons learned during the pandemic can help healthcare professionals to face similar situations in the future.","Gadelha, Cerqueira, Mari, Ziebold","https://doi.org/10.1093/schizbullopen/sgac061","20221109","antipsychotics; coronavirus outbreak; healthcare delivery; schizophrenia; service use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-10","",40864,""
"How Did the Mental Health Care System in India Respond to COVID 19 Pandemic?","India with a population of 1.3 billion has a unique health care system in its different states. Mental health care varies widely across the country and this became even more apparent after the COVID-19 pandemic set in. This paper examines the various strategies in response to COVID-19 adopted by the Government of India, the health departments of the individual states, and other private players such as on-government organizations and the civil society. The cessation of many services including outpatient and inpatient care and the scarcity of medicines were serious impacts of COVID-19. The prolonged lockdown in many parts of the country impeded access to mental health care services since public transport was unavailable. This led to many relapses in persons with serious mental disorders. The emergence of new cases of psychosis and an increase in suicides were also seen. Tele consultations came to the fore and many helplines were started offering counseling and guidance regarding the availability of mental health care facilities. While these helped the urban dwellers, those in remote and rural areas were unable to use these services effectively. Many mental health wards were used for COVID-19 patients and mental health professionals were deployed for COVID-19 related duty. The severely mentally ill, the homeless mentally ill, and the elderly were especially vulnerable. Based on our experience with COVID-19, we urge a strong call for action, in terms of strengthening the primary care facilities and increasing the manpower resources to deliver mental health care.","Rangaswamy, Grover, Tyagi, Bhan","https://doi.org/10.1093/schizbullopen/sgac043","20221109","COVID-19 responses; India; mental health care; persons with severe mental illnesses","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-10","",40865,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on the Italian Mental Health System: A Narrative Review","Italy has been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, consequently producing a heavy burden on the Italian National Health Service. From February 2020 until the end of the same year, the Italian Mental Health System (MHS), comprising an extensive network of community services, was subjected to a significant decrease in standards of care followed at the beginning of 2021 by a slow return to usual levels of activity. Data reported in the present article highlight how the Italian MHS - as was the case in the majority of countries-was largely unprepared for this emergency, suggesting an impelling need to develop appropriate supplementary national plans with the aim of preventing similar situations from developing in the future. The upheaval caused by the pandemic has highlighted the need to reinforce, both at a local and national level, the organization and standards of care of the Italian MHS in order to protect and support the mental health of patients with severe mental disorders, health workers, and the general population, thus preventing a potential ""pandemic"" of mental disorders.","Carpiniello, Vita","https://doi.org/10.1093/schizbullopen/sgac038","20221109","COVID-19; Italy; mental health system; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-10","",40866,""
"Post-9/11 veterans perceptions of the pandemic: Areas of greatest impact on health and well-being","Assess potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on a subset of Post-9/11Ã¢â‚¬Â¯U.S. Veterans included in a study of post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE). Two measures were added to a structured health interview for Veterans during temporary pandemic research shutdown: a validated health questionnaire [1] previously completed by survey, and a semi-structured instrument developed to assess whether pandemic conditions affected responses to the health questionnaire and identify unique impacts. Interviews were conducted between August 2020 - February 2021. Scaled items were calculated and <i>t</i>-tests used to compare results. Open-ended items were coded using thematic analyses. Veterans identified eight major areas of impact with negative and positive impacts: mental health, family, social, work/employment, access to resources, physical health, finances, and education. The temporary shut-down of a large health study for Post-9/11 Veterans provided an opportunity to devise an instrument to assess COVID-19's impact on health and well-being. The instrument was accepted as of the first Veteran instrument in a pandemic SDOH research repository [2], and is being used in other studies. This study highlights the need to assess and understand interrelated relationships of factors impacting health and well-being, especially as COVID-19 moves from pandemic to endemic with reverberating effects across multiple social determinants of health (SDOH).","Kalvesmaki, Gonzales, George, Nguyen, Pugh","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pecinn.2022.100096","20221109","COVID-19 impact; Qualitative methods; Thematic analysis; Veteran health; Veteran well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-10","",40867,""
"Indirect social contact interventions to reduce mental health-related stigma in low- and middle-income countries: systematic review","Mental health-related stigma and discrimination are a complex and widespread issue with negative effects on numerous aspects of life of people with lived experience of mental health conditions. Research shows that social contact is the best evidence-based intervention to reduce stigma. Within the context of a rapid development of remote technology, and COVID-19-related restrictions for face-to-face contact, the aim of this paper is to categorise, compare and define indirect social contact (ISC) interventions to reduce stigma and discrimination in mental health in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). MEDLINE, Global Health, EMBASE, PsychINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Control Trials (CENTRAL), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) were searched using a strategy including terms related to 'stigma and discrimination', 'intervention', 'indirect social contact', 'mental health' and 'low- and middle-income countries'. Relevant information on ISC interventions was extracted from the included articles, and a quality assessment was conducted. Emerging themes were coded using a thematic synthesis method, and a narrative synthesis was undertaken to present the results. Nine studies were included in the review overall. One study was ineffective; this was not considered for the categorisation of interventions, and it was considered separately for the comparison of interventions. Of the eight effective studies included in synthesis, interventions were categorised by content, combination of stigma-reducing strategies, medium of delivery, delivery agents, target condition and population, as well as by active or passive interaction and follow-up. Most of the interventions used education and ISC. Recovery and personal experience were important content components as all studies included either one or both. Cultural adaptation and local relevance were also important considerations. ISC interventions were effective in overall terms for both the general public and healthcare providers, including medical students. A new definition of ISC interventions in LMICs is proposed. More research and better reporting of intervention details are needed to explore the effectiveness of ISC strategies in LMICs, especially in regions where little relevant research has been conducted.","Makhmud, Thornicroft, Gronholm","https://doi.org/10.1017/S2045796022000622","20221110","Discrimination; mental health; mental illness stigma; systematic reviews; Humans; Developing Countries; COVID-19; Social Stigma; Mental Health; Mental Disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-10","",40868,""
"Pride and adversity among nurses and physicians during the pandemic in two US healthcare systems: a mixed methods analysis","Our aims were to examine themes of the most difficult or distressing events reported by healthcare workers during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in two US health care systems in order to identify common themes and then to relate them to both behavioral theory and measures of anxiety and depression. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of nurses and physicians during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US. An emailed recruitment letter was sent, with about half choosing to supply open-ended responses relevant to thematic analysis. We measured symptoms of anxiety and depression separately, captured demographics, and asked two open-ended questions regarding events that were the most difficult or stressful, and reinforced pride. We reported descriptive statistics and coded thematic categories for their continuum ""pride"" and ""distress"" the factors related to fostering well-being according to the Self-Determination Theory. Themes that emerged from these narratives were congruent with prediction of Self-Determination theory that autonomy-supportive experiences will foster pride, while autonomy-thwarting experiences will cause distress. Those who reported distressful events were more anxious and depressed compared to those who did not. Among those who reported incidences that reinforced pride in the profession, depression was rarer compared to those who did not. These trends were evident after allowing for medical history and other covariates in logistic regressions. Causal claims from our analysis should be made with caution due to the cross-sectional research design. Understanding perceptions of the pandemic by nurses and physicians may help identify and manage sources of distress, and suggest means of mitigating the risk of mental health distress through autonomy-supportive policies.","Burstyn, Holt","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12912-022-01075-x","20221109","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-10","",40869,""
