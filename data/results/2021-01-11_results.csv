"Despair in the Time of covid, A look at suicidal Ingestions reported to the California Poison control System during pandemic","Despite concern that the global pandemic will worsen depression and suicide rates, their remains little data on its actual effect. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicidal ingestions reported to the California Poison Control System (CPCS). Cross sectional comparison of suicidal ingestions reported to the CPCS during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic compared to suicidal ingestions reported during the same period in 2018 and 2019. The CPCS received 19,607 call for suicidal ingestions during the study periods, of which 13,800 were in the pre-COVID era (2018 and 2019) and 5,807 were in the COVID era. The median number (IQR) of suicidal ingestions per month decreased from 2,286 (2,240-2,364) to 1,940 (1,855-2,045) p=0.02. This decrease was consistent and significant across all age groups except those age 70 or older. Ingestions without adverse events decreased by 101 cases/month (95% CI 136.8 - 65, p=0.0003), minor outcomes decreased by 156.6 cases/month (95% CI 226.2 - 87.1, p=0.001), and moderate outcomes decreased by 96 cases/month (95% CI 143.9 - 48.1, p=0.00021). Major outcomes decreased from 793 (4.99%) cases in the pre-COVID era to 315 (4.60%) cases in the COVID era, risk ratio 0.92 (95% CI 0.81 - 1.05). The number of deaths decreased by 3.7 cases/month (95% CI -8.3 - 0.92, p=0.10). Despite concern for worsening suicidality, calls regarding suicidal ingestions to the nation's largest poison control center decreased during the COVID era as compared to the pre-COVID era. This study provides evidence that the pandemic's effects on modern society remain difficult to predict. Further effort is needed to understand how pandemic will effect American's mental health.","Ontiveros, Levine, Cantrell, Thomas, Minns","https://doi.org/10.1111/acem.14209","20210110","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-11","",9224,""
"Coronavirus Infectious Disease Epidemic (COVID-19): where we are, what can be done and hope for","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreads mainly via aerosol (microdroplets) in enclosed environments where temperature and humidity are regulated via air-conditioning (A/C). About 30% of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop COVID-19 disease. Among them, Ã¢Ë†Â¼25% require hospitalization. In medicine &quot;cases&quot; identify those who become ill. During this pandemic &quot;cases&quot; has been used to identify those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, including Ã¢Ë†Â¼70% asymptomatic; this has caused unnecessary anxiety. Individuals &gt;65 and those affected by obesity, diabetes, asthma, immune-depressed cancer patients, etc., are at higher risk of hospitalization and of dying of COVID-19. Healthy individuals younger than 40 very rarely die of COVID-19. Estimates of the COVID-19 mortality-rate vary because the definition of COVID-19-related deaths varies. Belgium has the highest death-rate 154.9/100,000 persons, because it includes anyone who died with symptoms compatible with COVID-19, even those never tested for SARS-CoV-2. The US includes all patients who died with a positive test, whether they died because of, or with, SARS-CoV-2. Countries that include only patients in which COVID-19 was the main cause of death, rather than a co-factor, have lower death-rates. Numerous therapies are being developed and rapid improvements are anticipated. Because of disinformation, only Ã¢Ë†Â¼50% of the US population plans to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. By sharing accurate information, physicians, health professionals and scientists play a key role addressing myths and anxiety, help public health officials enact measures to decrease infections, and provide the best care for those who become sick. We discuss these issues.","Carbone, Lednicky, Xiao, Venditti, Bucci","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtho.2020.12.014","20210110","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-11","",9225,""
"Increased alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic: The effect of mental health and age in a cross-sectional sample of social media users in the US","The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a public health crisis of unprecedented scale. Increased alcohol use has been extensively documented during other crises, particularly among persons with anxiety and depression. Despite COVID-19's differential impact by age; the association of age, mental health and alcohol use during the pandemic have not been studied. This study aimed to examine whether age modified the association of possible anxiety and depression with alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Two online surveys were administered to U.S. adult social media users in March and April 2020. Generalized linear models were conducted in 2020 among 5850 respondents (52.9% female; 21.9% aged 18-39Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years, 47.0% aged 40-59Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years, and 31.0% aged Ã¢â€°Â¥60Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years) to examine if age modified the association of anxiety and depression symptomatology and alcohol use. Overall, 29% of respondents reported increased alcohol use. Adjusted odds ratios of reporting increased alcohol use were 1.41 (95% CIÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.20-1.66) among respondents with anxiety symptoms and 1.64 (95% CIÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.21-2.23) among those with depressive symptoms compared to those without such symptoms. Whereas respondents aged 18-39Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years had the highest probability of reporting increased alcohol use, the probability of older persons (40-59 andÃ¢â‚¬Â¯Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬Â¯60Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years) reporting increased drinking was much greater among those with symptoms of anxiety and depression, compared to those without symptoms. These findings warrant age-differentiated public health messaging on the risks of excessive alcohol use and scale-up of substance use services for middle-aged and older adults with symptoms of depression and anxiety.","Capasso, Jones, Ali, Foreman, Tozan, DiClemente","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106422","20210110","Age; Alcohol use; Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-11","",9226,""
"Perceived social support and prenatal wellbeing; The mediating effects of loneliness and repetitive negative thinking on anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic","Prenatal depression and anxiety are linked to poor maternal and infant outcomes. We need to understand predictors of poor mental health to identify at-risk women, and targets for support. Previous research has demonstrated a relationship between low levels of perceived social support, and depression and anxiety in pregnant women. However, there is a lack of research into the factors that may mediate this relationship. As social distancing measures (e.g., lockdown) are likely to negatively affect women's perceived support in the prenatal period, we investigated the relationship between perceived social support and both anxiety and depression in UK-based pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, we examined two potential mediators that may contribute to psychological symptoms: repetitive negative thinking and loneliness. We administered a battery of online measures to a sample of pregnant women (N=205) between May-June 2020, during the first peak of the pandemic in the UK, when perceived social support was likely to be low. Consistent with predictions, perceived social support was significantly negatively related to depression, anxiety, loneliness and repetitive negative thinking. Furthermore, repetitive negative thinking and loneliness mediated the relationship between perceived social support and both depression and anxiety. Moreover, perceived social support and loneliness were associated with specific types of online behaviours. Taken together, the findings shed light on the processes through which social support may exert its effects on depression and anxiety and highlight potential therapeutic targets for interventions which aim to prevent and treat mood disorders in perinatal cohorts.","Harrison, Moulds, Jones","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wombi.2020.12.014","20210110","Anxiety; Depression; Loneliness; Prenatal; Repetitive negative thinking; Social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-11","",9227,""
"A rapid review of the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of healthcare workers: implications for supporting psychological well-being","Health and social care workers (HSCWs) have carried a heavy burden during the COVID-19 crisis and, in the challenge to control the virus, have directly faced its consequences. Supporting their psychological wellbeing continues, therefore, to be a priority. This rapid review was carried out to establish whether there are any identifiable risk factors for adverse mental health outcomes amongst HSCWs during the COVID-19 crisis. We undertook a rapid review of the literature following guidelines by the WHO and the Cochrane Collaboration's recommendations. We searched across 14 databases, executing the search at two different time points. We included published, observational and experimental studies that reported the psychological effects on HSCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The 24 studies included in this review reported data predominantly from China (18 out of 24 included studies) and most sampled urban hospital staff. Our study indicates that COVID-19 has a considerable impact on the psychological wellbeing of front-line hospital staff. Results suggest that nurses may be at higher risk of adverse mental health outcomes during this pandemic, but no studies compare this group with the primary care workforce. Furthermore, no studies investigated the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on social care staff. Other risk factors identified were underlying organic illness, gender (female), concern about family, fear of infection, lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and close contact with COVID-19. Systemic support, adequate knowledge and resilience were identified as factors protecting against adverse mental health outcomes. The evidence to date suggests that female nurses with close contact with COVID-19 patients may have the most to gain from efforts aimed at supporting psychological well-being. However, inconsistencies in findings and a lack of data collected outside of hospital settings, suggest that we should not exclude any groups when addressing psychological well-being in health and social care workers. Whilst psychological interventions aimed at enhancing resilience in the individual may be of benefit, it is evident that to build a resilient workforce, occupational and environmental factors must be addressed. Further research including social care workers and analysis of wider societal structural factors is recommended.","De Kock, Latham, Leslie, Grindle, Munoz, Ellis, Polson, O'Malley","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-10070-3","20210110","COVID-19; Frontline; Healthcare; Intervention; Mental health; Psychology; Review; Social care; Staff; Workers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-11","",9228,""
"Working conditions and health status of 6,317 front line public health workers across five provinces in China during the COVID-19 epidemic: a cross-sectional study","Public health workers at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) and primary health care institutes (PHIs) were among the main workers who implemented prevention, control, and containment measures. However, their efforts and health status have not been well documented. We aimed to investigate the working conditions and health status of front line public health workers in China during the COVID-19 epidemic. Between 18 February and 1 March 2020, we conducted an online cross-sectional survey of 2,313 CDC workers and 4,004 PHI workers in five provinces across China experiencing different scales of COVID-19 epidemic. We surveyed all participants about their work conditions, roles, burdens, perceptions, mental health, and self-rated health using a self-constructed questionnaire and standardised measurements (i.e., Patient Health Questionnaire and General Anxiety Disorder scale). To examine the independent associations between working conditions and health outcomes, we used multivariate regression models controlling for potential confounders. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and poor self-rated health was 21.3, 19.0, and 9.8%, respectively, among public health workers (27.1, 20.6, and 15.0% among CDC workers and 17.5, 17.9, and 6.8% among PHI workers). The majority (71.6%) made immense efforts in both field and non-field work. Nearly 20.0% have worked all night for more than 3 days, and 45.3% had worked throughout the Chinese New Year holiday. Three risk factors and two protective factors were found to be independently associated with all three health outcomes in our final multivariate models: working all night for &gt;3 days (multivariate odds ratio [ORm]=1.67~1.75, p&lt;0.001), concerns about infection at work (ORm=1.46~1.89, p&lt;0.001), perceived troubles at work (ORm=1.10~1.28, p&lt;0.001), initiating COVID-19 prevention work after January 23 (ORm=0.78~0.82, p=0.002~0.008), and ability to persist for &gt; 1 month at the current work intensity (ORm=0.44~0.55, p&lt;0.001). Chinese public health workers made immense efforts and personal sacrifices to control the COVID-19 epidemic and faced the risk of mental health problems. Efforts are needed to improve the working conditions and health status of public health workers and thus maintain their morale and effectiveness during the fight against COVID-19.","Li, Xu, Zhou, You, Wang, Li, Liang, Li, Ma, Zeng, Cai, Xie, Pan, Hao, Gilmour, Lau, Hao, Xu, Gu","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-10146-0","20210110","COVID-19; China; Front line public health workers; Mental health; Self-rated health; Working conditions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-11","",9229,""

"The Cost and Benefit of Fear Induction Parenting on Childrenâ€™s Health during the COVID-19 Outbreak","Objective. The outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was an unprecedented global public health emergency with a significant psychological toll. This study aimed to understand how specific COVID-19 related stressors contributed to Chinese parentsâ€™ fear induction practices, and how these practices, in turn, contributed to their childrenâ€™s disease prevention practices during the outbreak and depressive symptoms after the outbreak. Method. Parents (N=240, Mage=38.50 years, 75% mothers) with elementary-school-aged children (Mage=9.48 years, 46% girls) in Wenzhou, one of the most impacted cities in China, reported on the presence of confirmed or suspected cases in their communities, their frequencies of consuming COVID-19-related information, fear induction practices, and their childrenâ€™s trait anxiety and disease prevention practices during the outbreak (January 28 to 30, 2020). Child-reported depressive symptoms were collected between March 7 and 11, 2020, during which there were very few remaining cases and no new confirmed cases or deaths. Results. Parentsâ€™ higher frequency of virus-related information consumption but not the presence of community infection was associated with their engagement in more fear induction practices, which was in turn associated with childrenâ€™s greater engagement in prevention practices during the outbreak, but more post-quarantine depressive symptoms. Child trait anxiety exacerbated the association between parent fear induction and child depressive symptoms. Conclusion. Using fear induction parenting may promote childrenâ€™s willingness to cooperate and participate in disease prevention practices during the crisis but at the cost of childrenâ€™s long-term mental health.","Huiguang Ren et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461E8-B3B-B00","20210111","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Middle & Late Childhood; fear induction; child trait anxiety; child depressive symptoms; covid-19; parenting","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-11","",9237,""
"Examining early structural and functional brain alterations in postpartum depression through multimodal neuroimaging","Background: Postpartum depression (PPD) affects approximately 1 in 10 women after childbirth. A thorough understanding of a preexisting vulnerability for PPD will likely aid the early detection and treatment of PPD and help minimize its debilitating effects. Methods: Using a within-sample association, the study aimed to determine whether the brainâ€™s structural and functional alterations predict the onset of depression. To that end, 157 euthymic postpartum women were subjected to a multimodal MRI scan within the first 6 days of childbirth, and were subsequently followed up for 12 weeks. Based on a clinical interview 12 weeks postpartum, participants were classified as mentally healthy or having either PPD or adjustment disorder (AD). Voxel-based morphometry and resting-state functional connectivity comparisons were performed between the three groups. Results: 13.4% of women in our study developed PPD (n=21) and 12.1% (n=19) adjustment disorder (AD). The risk factors for PPD were a psychiatric history and the experience and severity of baby blues and the history of premenstrual syndrome. Despite the different risk profiles, no differences between the PPD, AD and control group were apparent based on the structural and functional neuroimaging data. At 12 weeks postpartum, a significant association was observed between Integrated Local Correlation (LCor) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Score (EPDS). Conclusion: Our findings do not support the notion that the brainâ€™s structural and resting-state functional alterations, if present, can be used as an early biomarker of PPD or AD. However, effects may become apparent if continuous measures of symptom severity are chosen.","Patricia Schnakenberg et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619B-422-712","20210111","PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Clinical Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; resting-state; state characteristics; postpartum depression; trait characteristics; multimodal neuroimaging; structural mri","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-11","",9238,""
