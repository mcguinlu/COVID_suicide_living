"Future dis(order)","The current global order is structured into multiple, fragmented, sometimes overlapping regionalisms  These regionalisms are simultaneously caused by and perpetuate great power competition between the United States and China  The legacy of a past liberal order is still visible in places such as Europe, where the European Union (EU) has developed into a strong and stable actor, even if its influence does not extend to other parts of the world  Between 2020 and 2035, three types of actors left their marks on the increasingly messy state of international affairs: the EU as an example of a successful international organization, individual citizens joining forces in grassroots movements and the two superpowers, the United States and China, competing with each other  Three cross-cutting processes contributed to the contemporary global order: stepping back and taking stock, becoming more inclusive as well as defining priorities and following through on them  Where one of these processes was effectively applied, coordination across different ?worlds? was possible  Where these processes were absent, the global order was marked by chaos  The outlined future is extrapolated from current trends  Once we acknowledge how daunting the challenges for the current global order are, we can move forward to change them","Oidtmann, Raphael; Mokry, Sabine","https://doi.org/10.1177/2336825X20935243","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: New Perspectives;2020.; Publication details: New Perspectives;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-12","",4532,""
"Contextual factors associated with depression among urban refugee and displaced youth in Kampala, Uganda: findings from a cross-sectional study","Advancing mental health among refugee and displaced adolescents and youth is critically important, as chronic psychological stress can have lifelong harmful impacts  These groups experience socio-environmental stressors that can harm mental health  Informed byÂ a social contextual framework, this study explored the prevalence of depression among urban refugee and displaced youth in Kampala, Uganda and associations with symbolic (violence), relational (social support), and material (food and community insecurity) contexts  We implemented a cross-sectional survey with refugee and displaced adolescent girls and young women and adolescent boys and young men aged 16â€“24 living in Kampalaâ€™s informal settlements  We conducted peer-driven recruitment, whereby peer navigators shared study information with their networks and in turn participants were invited to recruit their peers  We conducted gender disaggregated analyses, including stepwise multiple regression to examine factors associated with depression  We then conducted structural equation modeling (SEM) using weighted least squares estimation to examine direct paths from violence, food insecurity, and community insecurity to depression, and indirect effects through social support  Among participants (n = 445), young women (n = 333) reported significantly higher depression symptoms than young men (n = 112), including any symptoms (73 9% vs  49 1%, p &lt; 0 0001), mild to moderate symptoms (60 4% vs  45 5%, p = 0 008), and severe symptoms (13 5% vs 3 6%, p = 0 002)  SEM results among young women indicate that the latent violence factor (lifetime sexual and physical violence) had direct effects on depression and social support, but social support did not mediate the path from violence to depression  The model fit the data well: <U+03C7>2(3) = 9 82, p = 0 020;RMSEA = 0 08, 90% CI [0 03, 0 14], CFI = 0 96)  Among young men, SEM findings indicate that food insecurity had direct effects on social support, and an indirect effect on depression through the mediating role of social support  Fit indices suggest good model fit: <U+03C7>2(3) = 2 09, p = 0 352;RMSEA = 0 02, 90% CI [0 000, 0 19], CFI = 0 99  Findings reveal widespread depression among urban refugee and displaced youth in Kampala, disproportionately impacting young women  Contextual factors, including food insecurity and violence, increase depression risks  Strategies that reduce gender-based violence and food insecurity, and increase social support networks, have the potential to promote mental health among urban refugee and displaced youth","Logie, Carmen H.; Okumu, Moses; Mwima, Simon; Hakiza, Robert; Chemutai, Doreen; Kyambadde, Peter","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13031-020-00289-7","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Conflict and Health;14(1):45-45, 2020.; Publication details: Conflict and Health;14(1):45-45, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-12","",4533,""

"Counteracting Throwaway Culture in Daily Clinical Practice","Since his election in March 2013, Pope Francis has brought significant attention to the concept of ?throwaway culture ? This moral paradigm?which has been defined by Francis in various speeches and the encyclical Laudato si??characterizes a present-day culture in which food, disposable objects, and even human beings themselves are ?discarded as ?unnecessary ?? As Catholic physicians, it is our duty to ensure that we are working to counteract throwaway culture in our daily clinical practice by embracing and exhibiting a culture of encounter  When throwaway culture is discussed within the context of medical practice, it is easy to think of major life and systemic issues including abortion, assistive reproductive technology, physician assisted suicide, and so on  However, rejection of throwaway culture has much broader implications for Catholic physicians  We are called to resist this perverse culture whenever we experience a situation that requires special attention to the respect of human dignity  In this article, we present two common situations encountered in clinical practice in which it is essential to counteract throwaway culture and embrace a culture of encounter: in working with patients who are isolation settings and those who require translation services  Various studies are cited which demonstrate a lack of respect for human dignity that can be seen when working with these patient populations, and recommendations are provided which illustrate how to embrace a culture of encounter in each scenario  The authors conclude that through adoption of a culture of encounter, Catholic physicians as a community can be role models for coworkers, trainees, and students, promoting a culture in which we validate human dignity and ensure the quality and just care of even our most vulnerable patients Summary:Pope Francis had defined a ?throwaway culture? in which ?Human life, the person, are no longer seen as a primary value to be respected and safeguarded ?

"The trouble with naÃ¯ve Keynesianism","Since the Keynesian Revolution of the 1930s, many prominent economists have argued that a useful policy response to economic depression is to boost government spending  But pressure to spend quickly increases the potential for waste and inefficiency: this is ignored or dismissed in the Keynesian literature  For example, a widely cited cost?benefit analysis of stimulus spending does not even acknowledge the possibility of waste, and some Keynesians go so far as to argue that wasteful spending during a crisis can nonetheless be desirable  Here we extend the typical analysis by accounting explicitly for the leading sources of cost including waste, resource costs, and the excess burden of taxation  Our results suggest that stimulus spending that is largely wasteful is unlikely to generate net wealth  A proper response to economic depression must consider the possibility that government waste can render stimulus spending counterproductive","Caporale, Tony; Poitras, Marc","https://doi.org/10.1111/ecaf.12406","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Economic Affairs;40(2):259-276, 2020.; Publication details: Economic Affairs;40(2):259-276, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-12","",4540,""

"The effect of voluntary wheel running on the antioxidant status is dependent on sociability conditions","Voluntary wheel running is widely used as a physical activity (PA) model in rodents, but most studies investigate the beneficial effects of this intervention in socially isolated mice  Social isolation stress (SIS) is associated with vulnerability to oxidative stress and reduced mitochondrial activity  Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of free access to a running wheel for 21Â days on the various markers of the cellular redox/antioxidant status as well as mitochondrial function of mice subjected to SIS or maintained in groups of 3 in the homecage  SIS increased thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) levels in the cerebral cortex, and PA intervention was not able to reverse such alteration  PA reduced TBARS levels in the liver of grouped mice and gastrocnemius of socially isolated mice  PA increased nonprotein thiol (NPSH) levels in the cerebral cortex of grouped mice  Furthermore, socially isolated mice presented lower glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity in the cerebellum and gastrocnemius, and glutathione reductase (GR) activity in the cerebral cortex and liver  By contrast, SIS induced higher GPx activity in the cerebral cortex and heart  PA reduced GPx (cerebral cortex) and GR (cerebral cortex and liver) activities of socially isolated mice  SIS caused higher activity of mitochondrial complexes I and II in the cerebral cortex, and the PA paradigm was not able to alter this effect  Interestingly, the PA produced antidepressant-like effect at both SIS and control groups  In conclusion, the results showed the influence of SIS for the effects of PA on the antioxidant status, but not on the mitochondrial function and emotionality","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pbb.2020.173018","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior;2020.; Publication details: Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-12","",4577,""

"On Collective Self-healing and Traces: How can Swarm Intelligence help us think differently about team adaptation?","Background Health care teams are increasingly forced to navigate complex challenges to achieve their collective aim of delivering high-quality, safe patient care  The teamwork literature has struggled to develop strategies that promote effective adaptive behaviours among health care teams  In part, this challenge stems from the fact that truly collective adaptive behavior requires members of the teams to abandon the human urge to act self-sufficiently  Nature contains striking examples of collective behaviour as seen in social insects, fish and bird colonies  This collective behaviour is known as Swarm Intelligence (SI)  SI remains poorly described in the healthcare team literature and its potential benefits hidden  Objective In this cross-cutting edge paper, I explore the principles of SI as they pertain to systemic or collective adaptation in human teams  In particular, I consider the principles of trace-based communication and collective self-healing and what they might offer to team adaptation researchers in medical education  Results From a SI perspective, a solution to a problem emerges as a result of the collective action of the members of the swarm, not the individual action  This collective action is achieved via 4 principles: direct and indirect communication, awareness, self-determination and collective self-healing  Among those principles, trace-based communication and collective self-healing have been purposefully used by other industries to foster team adaptation  Trace-based communication relies on leaving ?traces? in the environment to drive the behaviour of others  Collective self-healing is the ability of the swarm to cope with failure and adapt to changes by permitting swarm members to be interchangeable  Conclusions While allowing teams to rely on indirect communication and to be interchangeable might create discomfort to our ways of thinking, teams outside healthcare are demonstrating their value to advance human teamwork  SI offers a helpful analogy and a constructive language for thinking about team adaptation","","https://doi.org/10.1111/medu.14358","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Medical Education;n/a(n/a), 2020.; Publication details: Medical Education;n/a(n/a), 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-12","",4580,""

"â€œGenerally, you get 86'ed because you're a liabilityâ€: An application of Integrated Threat Theory to frequently witnessed overdoses and social distancing responses","While rates of opioid overdose deaths in North American have increased exponentially in recent years, most overdoses are not fatal, especially when witnesses are present and can intervene  Previous research has found that some people who use drugs [PWUDs] trained in overdose response might cut social ties with frequent overdosers, leading to more solitary opioid use and risk of death if someone overdoses alone  To examine the phenomenon of social distancing of people who overdose frequently, we used data from fifty-two in-depth qualitative interviews collected in Southern California with PWUDs who had recently witnessed an opioid overdose  Transcripts were reviewed and coded thematically, using the Integrated Threat Theory (ITT) to conceptualize the observed phenomenon  ITT outlines how realistic and symbolic threats are experienced by a group  We found that while some participants acknowledged the role of adulterated street drugs in overdoses, individualized blame was nonetheless imposed  Accusations of careless drug use practices fostered negative stereotyping towards frequent overdosers  This was attributed to the need to summon 911 for rescue, which often resulted in police dispatch  The intergroup relationship between police and PWUDs is precarious as police pose realistic threats onto PWUDs - such as incarceration, eviction, and manslaughter - leading to intragroup anxiety among PWUDs about future overdose events, and labeled frequent overdosers as liabilities  These threats, and inter/intra-group conflict, explained one reason how and why non-fatal overdoses led to social distancing events  People who overdose frequently were also accused of breaking the norm of drug user surreptitiousness;a symbolic threat that endangered the group due to police exposure  Social distancing might dampen exposure to the protective effect of peer-led interventions such as take-home naloxone programs, increasing risk of overdose death  This phenomenon highlights how intergroup dynamics are driving intragroup processes  Suggestions for tailoring public health interventions are discussed","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113190","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Social Science and Medicine;260, 2020.; Publication details: Social Science and Medicine;260, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-12","",4582,""

"What influences practitionersâ€™ readiness to deliver psychological interventions by telephone? A qualitative study of behaviour change using the Theoretical Domains Framework","Contemporary health policy is shifting towards remotely delivered care  A growing need to provide effective and accessible services, with maximal population reach has stimulated demand for flexible and efficient service models  The implementation of evidence-based practice has been slow, leaving many services ill equipped to respond to requests for non-face-to-face delivery  To address this translation gap, and provide empirically derived evidence to support large-scale practice change, our study aimed to explore practitionersâ€™ perspectives of the factors that enhance the delivery of a NICE-recommended psychological intervention, i e  guided self-help by telephone (GSH-T), in routine care  We used the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to analyse our data, identify essential behaviour change processes and encourage the successful implementation of remote working in clinical practice  Thirty-four psychological wellbeing practitioners (PWPs) from the UK NHS Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services were interviewed  Data were first analysed inductively, with codes cross-matched deductively to the TDF  Analysis identified barriers to the delivery, engagement and implementation of GSH-T, within eight domains from the TDF: (i) Deficits in practitioner knowledge, (ii) Sub-optimal practitioner telephone skills, (iii) Practitionersâ€™ lack of beliefs in telephone capabilities and self-confidence, (iv) Practitionersâ€™ negative beliefs about consequences, (v) Negative emotions, (vi) Professional role expectations (vii) Negative social influences, and (viii) Challenges in the environmental context and resources  A degree of interdependence was observed between the TDF domains, such that improvements in one domain were often reported to confer secondary advantages in another  Multiple TDF domains emerge as relevant to improve delivery of GSH-T;and these domains are theoretically and practically interlinked  A multicomponent approach is recommended to facilitate the shift from in-person to telephone-based service delivery models, and prompt behaviour change at practitioner, patient and service levels  At a minimum, the development of practitionersâ€™ telephone skills, an increase in clientsâ€™ awareness of telephone-based treatment, dilution of negative preconceptions about telephone treatment, and robust service level guidance and standards for implementation are required  This is the first study that provides clear direction on how to improve telephone delivery and optimise implementation, aligning with current mental health policy and service improvement","Faija, Cintia L.; Connell, Janice; Welsh, Charlotte; Ardern, Kerry; Hopkin, Elinor; Gellatly, Judith; Rushton, Kelly; Fraser, Claire; Irvine, Annie; Armitage, Christopher J.; Wilson, Paul; Bower, Peter; Lovell, Karina; Bee, Penny","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-02761-3","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: BMC Psychiatry;20(1):371-371, 2020.; Publication details: BMC Psychiatry;20(1):371-371, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-12","",4660,""

"Epidemiology and clinical outcome of COVID-19: A multi-centre cross sectional study from Bangladesh","Objectives: To investigate SARS-CoV-2 associated epidemiology and clinical outcomes in Bangladesh to understand the course of COVID-19 pandemic and suggest prevention measures. Methods: A cross-sectional retrospective study was conducted among 1,021 RT-PCR confirmed but recovered COVID-19 cases from six participating hospitals in Bangladesh. Results: Of the total sample, 111 (10.9%) cases were asymptomatic while the number of symptomatic cases were 910 (89.1%). Higher prevalence of COVID-19 persisted in the male population (75%) and for the 31-40 age group. More than 85% of the samples reported BCG vaccination mark. Common symptoms observed in our study samples were fever (72.4%), cough (55.9%), loss of taste (40.7%) and body ache (40%); whereas for the biochemical parameters, Neutrophil (46.4%), D-dimer (46.1%), Ferritin (37.9%) and SGPT (36.8%) levels were found elevated. Post-COVID complications including pain (31.8%), loss of concentration (24.4%) and anxiety or depression (23.1%) were found significantly prevalent. Conclusion: Our study has shown that adult males aged between 31-40 in Bangladesh are more vulnerable to being infected with COVID-19. With an indication for the rising trend of the asymptomatic cases, deployment of interventions to curb further community spread is necessary to avoid the grave outcomes of COVID-19 in Bangladesh.","Adnan Mannan; H.M.

"The impact of work loss on mental and physical health during the COVID-19 pandemic: Findings from a prospective cohort study","Objective: To determine if losing work during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with mental and physical health. To determine if social interactions and financial resources moderate the relationship between work loss and health. Design: Baseline data from a prospective longitudinal cohort study. Setting: Australia, 27th March to 12th June 2020. Participants: Australians aged 18+ years, employed in a paid job prior to the COVID-19 pandemic who responded to an online or telephone survey. Main Outcome Measures: Kessler-6 score > 18 indicating high psychological distress. Short Form 12 (SF-12) mental health or physical health component score <= 45 indicating poor mental or physical health. Results: 2,603 respondents including groups who had lost their job (N=541), were not working but remained employed (N=613), were working less (N=789) and whose work was unaffected (N=789). Three groups experiencing work loss had greater odds of high psychological distress (AOR=2.22-3.66), poor mental (AOR=1.78-2.27) and physical health (AOR=2.10-2.12) than the unaffected work group. Poor mental health was more common than poor physical health. The odds of high psychological distress (AOR=5.43-8.36), poor mental (AOR=1.92-4.53) and physical health (AOR=1.93-3.90) were increased in those reporting fewer social interactions or less financial resources. Conclusion: Losing work during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with mental and physical health problems, and this relationship is moderated by social interactions and financial resources. Responses that increase financial security and enhance social connections may partially alleviate the health impacts of work loss.","Daniel Griffiths; Luke Sheehan; Caryn Van Vreden; Dennis Petrie; Genevieve Grant; Peter Whiteford; Malcolm Sim; Alex Collie","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.06.20189514","","Database: PREPRINT-MEDRXIV; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-12","",4678,""
"Understanding SARSCOV-2 propagation, impacting factors to derive possible scenarios and simulations","We aimed to analyze factors impacting the Covid-19 epidemic on a macro level, comparing multiple countries across the world and verifying the occurrence at a micro level through cluster analysis. The severity of the epidemic was most strongly related to exposure to ultraviolet light and extrapolated levels of vitamin D and to the health of the population, especially with regards to obesity. We found no county with an obesity level < 8% with a severe epidemic. We also found that countries where the population benefited from sun exposure or vitamin D supplementation and spent time outside fared well. Factors related to increased propagation of the virus included the use of heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), population density, poorly aerated gatherings, relative humidity, timely policies of closing clustering places until aeration was improved, and daily amount of ridership on public transportation, especially subways. Population lockdowns, masks, and blood type did not provide much explanatory power. Contact tracing was not analyzed as very few countries applied it for long enough. The excess mortality observed is within the ranges of severe past influenza epidemics of 2016/2017 or 1999/2000 and lower than older severe influenza epidemics of the 1940s or 1970s. We estimated that COVID mortality death counts in European countries is over estimated when taking into account excess mortality further confirming the important role of comorbidities independently of lockdown policy. A few countries observed an under-mortality despite of some deaths counts attributed to COVID-19. Treatments or vaccines should protect the fraction of the population that is not suffering from severe comorbidities. Our study suggested that prevention measures should be directed to improving aeration systems, enhancing diets and exercise, and ensuring adequate levels of vitamin D. Prevention measures and attention should be paid to anxiety resulting from this episode which may be associated with increases in obesity, addictions, vitamin D deficiency, depression, suicide, and hunger ultimately weakening population resiliency.","Lewis E.

"The impact of COVID-19 on the lives and mental health of Australian adolescents","Objective: There has been significant disruption to the lives and mental health of adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the exact nature of the effects is not known. The purpose of this study was to assess the psychological and lifestyle impact of the pandemic on Australian adolescents, using an online survey, administered during and after the peak of the outbreak (June-July 2020). Method: Self-report surveys were administered online to a sample of 760 Australian adolescents aged 12-18 years old. Surveys assessed worry about contracting COVID-19, behavioral change in response to the pandemic, impact on education, peer and family relationships, lifestyle factors including exercise, technology use and sleep, as well as mental health outcomes including psychological distress, loneliness, health anxiety and wellbeing. Results: Overall, young people expressed significant concern and worry about contracting the virus, and most (>85%) engaged in behaviors to reduce the risk of transmission. Three quarters of the sample reported a worsening of their mental health since the pandemic began, with negative impacts reported by most respondents on learning, friendships and family relationships. More than 40% of young people reported a decrease in exercise and 70% reported an increase in technology use since the outbreak. There were high levels of uncertainty about the future reported by respondents, and their scores on validated measures indicated higher levels of sleep disturbance, psychological distress and health anxiety, and lower levels of wellbeing, relative to normative samples. Reponses on the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale indicated that 48.3% of the sample were experiencing distress consistent with a probable mental illness, which is much higher than pre-pandemic prevalence rates. Effects on mental health were worse among those who reported a previous diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety relative to those without a history of depression and/or anxiety. Conclusion: These results indicate high levels of disruption and psychological distress experienced by adolescents during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Adolescents are already vulnerable to the onset of mental illness at this developmental stage, and the current research underscores the need to find rapid and accessible ways to support adolescent mental health during times of crisis. There is a need for longitudinal research to evaluate the enduring effects of the pandemic on adolescents.","Sophie Li; Joanne Beames; Jill Newby; Kate Maston; Helen Christensen; Aliza Werner-Seidler; Marina Pifano; Teresa Varela; Enio Garcia; Alicia Lawrynowicz; Osvaldo Uez; Irene Pagano; Anastasija Caica; Mikus Gavars; Dmitrijs Perminovs; Jelena Storozenko; Oksana Savicka; Elina Dimina; Uga Dumpis; Janis Klovins; Angel YS Wong; Helen I McDonald; Jonathan Cockburn; Harriet Forbes; John Parry; Frank Hester; Sam Harper; Liam Smeeth; Ian J Douglas; William G Dixon; Stephen JW Evans; Laurie Tomlinson; Ben Goldacre; Sacha Gnjatic; Noam Harpaz; Silvio Danese; Adeeb Rahman; Nikhil A Kumta; Alessio Aghemo; Francesca Petralia; Harm van Bakel; Adolfo Garcia-Sastre; Saurabh Mehandru","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.07.20190124","","Database: PREPRINT-MEDRXIV; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-12","",4680,""
"The impact of COVID-19 restriction measures on loneliness among older adults in Austria","Background: To halt the spread of COVID-19, Austria implemented a 7-week shut-down of public life in March/April 2020 which was followed by a gradual withdrawal of these restriction measures in May/June 2020. We expect that the ensuing reduction in social contacts led to increased loneliness among older adults (60+). Methods: We conducted three analyses to assess the association between COVID-19 public health restriction measures and loneliness: (1) A comparison between pre-pandemic (SHARE: 2013-2017) and pandemic (May 2020) levels of loneliness (UCLA-3 scale), (2) an analysis of the correlation between being affected by COVID-19 restriction measures and loneliness based on cross-sectional survey data from early May 2020, and (3) a longitudinal analysis of weekly changes in loneliness (Corona panel data) from late March to early June 2020. Results: We found (1) loneliness levels to have increased in 2020 in comparison with previous years, (2) an association between the number of restriction measures older adults reported to be affected from and loneliness, and (3) that loneliness was higher during shut-down compared to the subsequent re-opening phase, particularly among those who live alone. Discussion: Our results provide evidence that COVID-19 restriction measures in Austria have indeed resulted in increased levels of loneliness among older adults. However, these effects seem to be short-lived, and thus we do not expect strong negative consequences for older adults mental health downstream. Nonetheless, effects of longer and/or repeated future restriction measures aiming at social distancing should be closely monitored.","Erwin Stolz; Hannes Mayerl; Wolfgang Freidl; Ruth Moir; Louise Kelly; Emma Snary","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.08.20190397","","Database: PREPRINT-MEDRXIV; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-12","",4681,""
"Social capital and psychological distress during Colombian coronavirus disease lockdown","Introduction. This study aims to establish the association between low capital social (CS) with some indicators of psychological distress. Methods. A cross-sectional study was carried out using an online questionnaire that evaluated demographic variables, social capital, coronavirus disease perceived stress, depression risk, insomnia risk, and suicide risk. SC was taken as an independent variable, and symptoms indicating psychological distress was handed as dependent variables. Odds ratios (OR) were established with 95% confidence intervals (CI), using binary logistic regression analysis. Results. A group of 700 adults participated in the survey; they were aged between 18 and 76 years (M = 37, SD = 13). Low SC was associated with depression risk (OR = 2.00, 95%CI 1.34-2.97), elevated suicide risk (OR = 2.62, 95%CI 1.40-4.91) high perceived stress related to coronavirus disease (OR = 2.08, 95%CI 1.15-3.76), and insomnia risk (OR = 2.42, 95%CI 1.69-3.47). Conclusions. Low CS was associated with indicators of psychological distress represented in depression risk, elevated suicide risk, high perceived stress related to coronavirus disease and insomnia risk. SC is a community social resource that could help mitigate the impact of the coronavirus disease quarantine amidst the Colombian population's psychological health. It is necessary to deepen the SC role in psychological well-being during and after the coronavirus disease epidemic.","Carmen Cecilia Caballero-Dominguez; Jeimmy De Luque-Salcedo; Adalberto Campo-Arias; Sebastian Souyris; Sridhar Seshadri; Padmavati Sridhar; Ronald Watkins; Yuqian Yu; Andrea Lisco; Irini Sereti; Helen C.

"Social and electronic media exposure and generalized anxiety disorder among people during COVID-19 outbreak in Bangladesh: A preliminary observation","Classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization, the novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) has spread to Bangladesh since early March of 2020, and people are getting daily updates from the social and electronic media. We aimed at assessing the prevalence of anxiety among Bangladeshi people during the pandemic in connection with social media exposure (SME) and electronic media exposure (EME). For this cross-sectional study, data were collected from 880 participants by a self-administered online-based questionnaire relating personal characteristics, self-rate health (SRH), SME, and EME with anxiety. Findings show that around half of the surveyed population experienced a spike of anxiety (49.1%) during the pandemic, ten times higher than the national anxiety rate in 2019. The participants with an increased SME of over four hours per day experienced a higher level of anxiety than individuals with &lt; = 2 hours exposure to social media. Similarly, the anxiety was higher among people with fair/bad SRH compared to individuals with excellent SRH. It is highly recommended to develop active surveillance and effective monitoring systems to reduce the spread of misinformation from both social and electronic media to improve the state of mental health conditions during the pandemic.","Hossain, Ahammed, Chanda, Jahan, Ela, Islam","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238974","20200911","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-12","",4683,""
"Relationship quality and mental health during COVID-19 lockdown","Catastrophes are known to have an impact on relationships as well as on mental health. This study evaluated differences in several mental health and well-being measures according to relationship quality during the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic and related lockdown measures. A cross-sectional online survey was launched four weeks after lockdown measures were implemented in Austria. Relationship quality was measured with the Quality of Marriage Index (QMI), and mental health measures included quality of life (WHO-QOL BREF psychological domain), well-being (WHO-5), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), stress (PSS-10), and sleep quality (ISI). ANOVAs with Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc tests and Chisquared tests were applied. In all mental health scales, individuals with good relationship quality (n = 543) scored better than individuals with poor relationship quality (n = 190) or without relationship (n = 272). The odds ratios (OR) between the poor and good relationship quality groups were 3.5 for the PHQ-9, 3.4 for the GAD-7, and 2.0 for the ISI. Additionally, individuals without no relationship scored better on all scales than individuals with poor relationship quality (all p-values &lt; .05). Relationship quality was related to mental health during COVID-19. The prevalence of depressive symptoms increased according to relationship quality from 13% up to 35%. Relationship per se was not associated with better mental health, but the quality of the relationship was essential. Compared to no relationship, a good relationship quality was a protective factor whereas a poor relationship quality was a risk factor.","Pieh, O Rourke, Budimir, Probst","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238906","20200911","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-12","",4684,""
"COVID-19 pandemic: Prevalence of Perceived Stress, Anxiety, Depression, and Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms vary among Healthcare and non-Healthcare Workers in Alberta","During pandemic disease episodes, effective containment and mitigation measures may also negatively influence psychological stability. As knowledge about coronavirus disease (COVID-19) rapidly evolves, global implementation of containment and mitigation measures has varied greatly, with impacts to mental wellness. Assessing relevant impacts of COVID-19 on healthcare and non-healthcare workers' mental health needs may help mitigate mental health impacts and secure sustained delivery of healthcare and other essential goods and services. This study assessed the self-reported prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms in healthcare and non-healthcare workers seeking support through Text4Hope, an evidence-based, text message service supporting Alberta residents' mental health, during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online cross-sectional survey gathered demographic (age, gender ethnicity, education, relationship, housing and employment status, employment type, and isolation status) and clinical characteristics using validated tools (self-reported stress, anxiety, depression, and contamination/hand hygiene associated obsessive-compulsive symptoms). Descriptive statistics and Chi-Square analysis were used to compare healthcare to non-healthcare workers' clinical characteristics. Post hoc analysis was conducted on variables with &gt;3 response categories using adjusted residuals. Logistic regression determined associations between worker type and likelihood of self-reported symptoms of moderate or high stress, GAD, and MDD, while controlling for other variables. Overall, 8 267 surveys were submitted by 44 992 Text4Hope subscribers (19.39%); 5 990 were employed (72.5%), 958 (11.6%) were unemployed, 454 (5.5%) were students, 559 (6.8%) were retired, 234 (2.8%) selected &quot;other&quot;, and 72 (0.9%) did not indicate their employment status. Most employed survey respondents were female (86.2%, n= 4 621). Six-week prevalence in the general sample for symptoms of moderate or high stress, anxiety, and depression were 85.6%, 47.0%, and 44.0%, respectively. Self-reported symptoms of moderate or high stress, anxiety and depression symptoms were all statistically significantly higher in non-healthcare than healthcare workers (p&lt;0.001). Non-healthcare workers reported higher obsessive-compulsive symptoms (worry about contamination and compulsive handwashing behavior) after pandemic onset (p&lt;0.001), while healthcare worker symptoms were statistically significantly higher before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (p&lt;0.001). This finding should be interpreted with caution, as it is unclear the extent to which adaptive behavior might be misclassified by validated tools in healthcare workers or during a pandemic. Assessing symptoms of prevalent stress, anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive behaviour in healthcare and non-healthcare workers may enhance our understanding of COVID-19 mental health needs. Research is needed to understand more fully the relationship between worker type, outbreak phase, and mental health changes over time and the utility of validated tools in healthcare workers and pandemics. Findings underscore the importance of anticipating and mitigating mental health effects using integrated implementation strategies and demonstrate the ease of safely and rapidly assessing mental health needs using a text messaging platform during a pandemic.

"Oxytocin as a Potential Adjuvant against COVID-19 Infection","This article summarizes the benefits of Oxytocin (OT) in the attenuation of coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) pathogenesis. The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has become pandemic with 7,323,761 of infected patients and has created health emergency throughout the world. On the basis of clinical study, COVID-19 shows homology with other coronavirus pathogenesis i.e. inflammation, oxidative stress, and hyper-activation of immune system, results cytokine storm and causes acute lung infection (ALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and kidney dysfunction. OT is a peptide of nine amino acid, well known anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and immune-modulator molecule protective against ALI/ARDS, nephrotoxicity, sepsis, and ischemia-reperfusion medical condition. OT is a neuromodulatory, effective for stress, anxiety, social behaviour, and depression, which might be helpful for better output of COVID-19 patients. There is significant data showing OT would be useful for treatment of COVID-19 pathogenesis. Direct application of OT in COVID19 is unclear, but its use in experimental model as well as human has continuously documented its safety, and its use by COVID-19 patients predictably would be highly beneficial.","Thakur, Shrivastava, Shrivastava","https://doi.org/10.2174/1871530320666200910114259","20200911","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; anti-inflammatory; antioxidant.; immunomodulation; oxytocin","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-12","",4689,""
"Social Isolation and Psychological Distress Among Older Adults Related to COVID-19: A Narrative Review of Remotely-Delivered Interventions and Recommendations","The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with several short- and long-term negative impacts on the well-being of older adults. Physical distancing recommendations to reduce transmission of the SARS-CoV2-19 virus increase the risk of social isolation and loneliness, which are associated with negative outcomes including anxiety, depression, cognitive decline, and mortality. Taken together, social isolation and additional psychological impacts of the pandemic (e.g., worry, grief) underscore the importance of intervention efforts to older adults. This narrative review draws upon a wide range of evidence to provide a comprehensive overview of appropriate remotely-delivered interventions for older adults that target loneliness and psychological symptoms. These include interventions delivered by a range of individuals (i.e., community members to mental health professionals), and interventions that vary by implementation (e.g., self-guided therapy, remotely-delivered interventions via telephone or video call). Recommendations to overcome barriers to implementation and delivery are provided, with consideration given to the different living situations.","Gorenko, Moran, Flynn, Dobson, Konnert","https://doi.org/10.1177/0733464820958550","20200911","COVID-19; intervention; mental health; social isolation; technology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-12","",4690,""
"Risk factors for depression and anxiety in healthcare workers deployed during the COVID-19 outbreak in China","This study was conducted to evaluate the status of depression and anxiety of healthcare workers and to explore the risk factors during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. A cross-sectional study was designed using convenience sampling to obtain a sample of healthcare workers. A structured questionnaire was designed to collect the information of the basic characteristics, workload, and the health condition. Burnout, coping style, anxiety, and depression were measured by specific scales. Multiple logistic regression model was performed to explore the risk factors of anxiety or depression. There were 902 questionnaires received between February 9, 2020 and February 11, 2020. The proportion of healthcare workers with symptoms of moderate/severe anxiety and moderate/severe depression were 16.63% and 18.29%, respectively. There were 24.50% healthcare workers experiencing moderate/severe anxiety and depression at the same time. The increased workload, respiratory symptoms, digestive symptoms, having done specific test(s) related to COVID-19, having family member needs to be taken care of, negative coping style, and job burnout were the independent risk factors of anxiety. Furthermore, the increased workload, respiratory symptoms, digestive symptoms, having done specific test(s) related to COVID-19, negative coping style, and job burnout were the independent risk factors of depression. More attention should be paid to the mental health of frontline healthcare workers at the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. Taking steps to reduce the intensity of the work and burnout will be effective to stabilize the mental state of them.","Chen, Liu, Wang, Jin, He, Ma, Zhao, Song, Zhang, Xiang, Yang, Song, Bai, Hou","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-020-01954-1","20200911","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Healthcare workers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-12","",4691,""
"Measures of infection prevention and incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy in Germany, Austria and Switzerland","COVID-19 infection has manifested as aÃ‚Â major threat to both patients and healthcare providers around the world. Radiation oncology institutions (ROI) deliver aÃ‚Â major component of cancer treatment, with protocols that might span over several weeks, with the result of increasing susceptibility to COVID-19 infection and presenting with aÃ‚Â more severe clinical course when compared with the general population. The aim of this manuscript is to investigate the impact of ROI protocols and performance on daily practice in the high-risk cancer patients during this pandemic. We addressed the incidence of positive COVID-19 cases in both patients and health care workers (HCW), in addition to the protective measures adopted in ROIs in Germany, Austria and Switzerland using aÃ‚Â specific questionnaire. The results of the questionnaire showed that aÃ‚Â noteworthy number of ROIs were able to complete treatment in SARS-CoVÃ¢â‚¬â€˜2 positive cancer patients, with only aÃ‚Â short interruption. The ROIs reported aÃ‚Â significant decrease in patient volume that was not impacted by the circumambient disease incidence, the type of ROI or the occurrence of positive cases. Of the ROIs 16.5% also reported infected HCWs. About half of the ROIs (50.5%) adopted aÃ‚Â screening program for patients whereas only 23.3% also screened their HCWs. The range of protective measures included the creation of working groups, instituting home office work and protection with face masks. Regarding the therapeutic options offered, curative procedures were performed with either unchanged or moderately decreased schedules, whereas palliative or benign radiotherapy procedures were more often shortened. Most ROIs postponed or cancelled radiation treatment for benign indications (88.1%). The occurrence of SARS-CoVÃ¢â‚¬â€˜2 infections did not affect the treatment options for curative procedures. Non-university-based ROIs seemed to be more willing to change their treatment options for curative and palliative cases than university-based ROIs. Most ROIs reported aÃ‚Â deep impact of SARS-CoVÃ¢â‚¬â€˜2 infections on their work routine. Modification and prioritization of treatment regimens and the application of protective measures preserved aÃ‚Â well-functioning radiation oncology service and patient care.","Matuschek, Fischer, Combs, Fietkau, Corradini, ZÃƒÂ¤nker, BÃƒÂ¶lke, Djiepmo-Njanang, Tamaskovics, Fischer, Stuschke, PÃƒÂ¶ttgen, FÃƒÂ¶rster, Zwahlen, Papachristofilou, Ganswindt, Pelka, Schneider, Feldt, Jensen, HÃƒÂ¤ussinger, Knoefel, Kindgen-Milles, Pedoto, Grebe, van Griensven, Budach, Haussmann","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00066-020-01681-1","20200911","COVID-19; Oncology; Pandemic; Patient care; Radiation oncoloy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-12","",4692,""

"A rapid review investigating the potential impact of a pandemic on the mental health of young people aged 12-25 years","In March 2020, the WHO officially declared the spread of COVID-19 as a pandemic. Adolescence and early adulthood are peak times for the onset of mental health difficulties. Exposure to a pandemic during this vulnerable developmental period places young people at significant risk of negative psychological experiences. The objective of this research was to summarise existing evidence on the potential impact of a pandemic on the mental health of 12-25-year-olds. A rapid review of the published peer-reviewed literature, published between 1985 and 2020, using PsycINFO (Proquest) and Medline (Proquest) was conducted. Narrative synthesis was used across studies to identify key themes and concepts. This review found 3,359 papers, which was reduced to 12 papers for data extraction. Results regarding the prevalence of psychological difficulties in youth were mixed, with some studies finding this group experience heightened distress during an infectious disease outbreak, and others finding no age differences or higher distress among adults. Gender, coping, self-reported physical health and adoption of precautionary measures appear to play a role in moderating the psychological impact of an infectious disease outbreak. Most studies were conducted after the peak of an epidemic/pandemic or in the recovery period. More longitudinal research with young people, particularly adolescents in the general population, before and during the early stages of an infectious disease outbreak is needed to obtain a clear understanding of how best to support young people during these events.","O'Reilly, Tibbs, Booth, Doyle, McKeague, Moore","https://doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2020.106","20200911","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Epidemic; Infectious Disease Outbreak; Pandemic; Rapid Review; Youth Mental Health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-12","",4695,""

"Recovery from COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome: the potential role of an intensive care unit recovery clinic: a case report","In this case report, we describe the trajectory of recovery of a young, healthy patient diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome. The purpose of this case report is to highlight the potential role of intensive care unit recovery or follow-up clinics for patients surviving acute hospitalization for coronavirus disease 2019. Our patient was a 27-year-old Caucasian woman with a past medical history of asthma transferred from a community hospital to our medical intensive care unit for acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to bilateral pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation (ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fraction of inspired oxygen, 180). On day 2 of her intensive care unit admission, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction confirmed coronavirus disease 2019. Her clinical status gradually improved, and she was extubated on intensive care unit day 5. She had a negative test result for coronavirus disease 2019 twice with repeated reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction before being discharged to home after 10Ã¢â‚¬â€°days in the intensive care unit. Two weeks after intensive care unit discharge, the patient returned to our outpatient intensive care unit recovery clinic. At follow-up, the patient endorsed significant fatigue and exhaustion with difficulty walking, minor issues with sleep disruption, and periods of memory loss. She scored 10/12 on the short performance physical battery, indicating good physical function. She did not have signs of anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder through self-report questionnaires. Clinically, she was considered at low risk of developing post-intensive care syndrome, but she required follow-up services to assist in navigating the healthcare system, addressing remaining symptoms, and promoting return to her pre-coronavirus disease 2019 societal role. We present this case report to suggest that patients surviving coronavirus disease 2019 with subsequent development of acute respiratory distress syndrome will require more intense intensive care unit recovery follow-up. Patients with a higher degree of acute illness who also have pre-existing comorbidities and those of older age who survive mechanical ventilation for coronavirus disease 2019 will require substantial post-intensive care unit care to mitigate and treat post-intensive care syndrome, promote reintegration into the community, and improve quality of life.","Mayer, Sturgill, Kalema, Soper, Seif, Cassity, Hatton Kolpek, Dupont-Versteegden, Montgomery-Yates, Morris","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13256-020-02481-y","20200911","Acute respiratory distress syndrome; COVID-19; Emotional health; Physical function; Post-ICU follow-up","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-12","",4698,""
"Beyond the First Wave: Consequences of COVID-19 on High-Risk Infants and Families","The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is affecting care for high-risk newborns in ways that will likely be sustained beyond the initial pandemic response. These novel challenges present an urgent imperative to understand how COVID-19 impacts parent, family, and infant outcomes.

Medical students estimated COVID-19 to be more serious and disastrous than non-medical students, while they scored lower than non-medical students on the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and less severe anxiety and depression than non-medical students. The students experienced greater impact from the outbreak and a higher rate of anxiety and depression with increased time focusing on the outbreak. The difference in psychological effects between medical and non-medical students was further enlarged when focusing time was prolonged.

COVID-19 advanced rapidly and then spread worldwide. Pregnant women were more susceptible to the COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, it is not clear whether this infection will increase the risk of congenital monstrosity, foetal growth restriction, premature delivery or cause other long-term adverse effects. A descriptive, cross-sectional survey. A total of 331 pregnant women participated in this study. And this research adhered to the STROBE guideline. The psychological questionnaire for emergent events of public health, pregnancy stress scale and security questionnaire were used to collect data. The hypothetical path model was tested using the SPSS version 25.0 software and AMOS version 26.0 software. Fear and depression were the most common psychological responses among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. The hypothesis model of this study fitted the data well, and the results showed that psychological response positively affected pregnancy stress, while security sense negatively affected pregnancy stress; security sense mediated between psychological response and pregnancy stress. Nurses and midwives can help reduce the stress in pregnant women by alleviating their psychological response to the COVID-19 pandemic and by improving their security sense. It is essential for the health staff to build trust with pregnant women and their families, and communicate accurate information to them. Nurses should promptly conduct a psychological response evaluation and psychological guidance for pregnant women to alleviate their fears and hypochondria related to COVID-19.","Zheng, Jiang, Lin, Liu, Lin, Kang, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15460","20200910","COVID-19; pregnancy; pregnancy stress; psychology; security; structural equation model","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-12","",4707,""
"Weight Stigma as a Predictor of Distress and Maladaptive Eating Behaviors During COVID-19: Longitudinal Findings From the EAT Study","Weight stigma is common for people with obesity and harmful to health. Links between obesity and complications from COVID-19 have been identified, but it is unknown whether weight stigma poses adverse health implications during this pandemic. We examined longitudinal associations between prepandemic experiences of weight stigma and eating behaviors, psychological distress, and physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic in a diverse sample of emerging adults. Participants (N = 584, 64% female, mean age = 24.6 Ã‚Â± 2.0 years, mean body mass index [BMI] = 28.2) in the COVID-19 Eating and Activity over Time (C-EAT) study were cohort members of the population-based longitudinal study EAT 2010-2018. Weight stigma reported by participants in 2018 was examined as a predictor of binge eating, eating to cope, physical activity, depressive symptoms, and stress during COVID-19. Data were collected via online surveys during the U.S. outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020. Prepandemic experiences of weight stigma predicted higher levels of depressive symptoms (ÃŽÂ² = 0.15, p &lt; .001), stress (ÃŽÂ² = 0.15, p = .001), eating as a coping strategy (ÃŽÂ² = 0.16, p &lt; .001), and an increased likelihood of binge eating (odds ratio = 2.88, p &lt; .001) among young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic but were unrelated to physical activity. Although associations remained after accounting for demographic characteristics and BMI, the magnitude of longitudinal associations was attenuated after adjusting for prior levels of the outcome variables. Young adults who have experienced weight stigma may have increased vulnerability to distress and maladaptive eating during this pandemic. Public health messaging could be improved to support people of diverse body sizes and reduce the harmful consequences of weight stigma.","Puhl, Lessard, Larson, Eisenberg, Neumark-Stzainer","https://doi.org/10.1093/abm/kaaa077","20200910","COVID-19; Eating; Stigma; Stress; Weight","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-12","",4708,""

Immunosuppression is considered a risk factor for severe COVID-19, but there are only few reports on disease progression in immunocompromised patients. We report the case of a 50-year-old patient with acute COVID-19 pneumonia, who had iatrogenic, clinically relevant bone marrow suppression due to accidental overdose with hydroxyurea, and decreased lung capacity due to a left-sided pneumonectomy 6 months earlier. Symptomatic treatment with oxygen supplementation and pulmonary physical therapy was initiated, and hydroxyurea was discontinued. Over 14 days, the patient's blood counts slowly recovered, and his clinical condition gradually improved, such that supplemental oxygen was no longer necessary and he could be discharged. A gradual increase in neutrophil and lymphocyte counts may be preferable to dampen a potentially detrimental immunological response triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Whether patients with severe COVID-19 benefit from immunosuppressive therapy should be further evaluated.

"Depression and Its Relationship with Coping Strategies and Illness Perceptions during the COVID-19 Lockdown in Greece: A Cross-Sectional Survey of the Population","The COVID-19 epidemic has shown a more benign course in Greece possibly due to the early lockdown measures. Mental health consequences of the lockdown however are unknown. In addition, illness perceptions and relevant strategies to cope with the stress of the epidemic may have played a role in complying with the restrictions. We conducted a survey of the Greek population with the aim to investigate the prevalence of anxiety and depression during the lockdown, the emotional impact of the epidemic, and the effect of coping strategies and illness perceptions in mental health. Adult persons were invited during the peak of the lockdown period through social media. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed with the PHQ-9 and GAD-2 scales, respectively. Coping strategies were assessed with selected items of the Brief COPE questionnaire, while illness beliefs were assessed with items from the revised Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ-R). A total of 3379 individuals took part. A strong emotional impact of the epidemic was more often in women and in those with severe financial difficulties. Levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms were high but similar to past assessments. Participants showed high levels of personal control and used more often positive strategies to cope with the stress of the epidemic. Depressive symptoms were higher in the younger, in students, in those with a stronger emotional impact, in those isolated due to symptoms, and those overexposed to media for COVID-19-related news. Lower levels of depression were seen in those using positive coping strategies and showing high levels of personal and treatment control. The study shows that certain psychological and social determinants were associated with increased depressive symptoms during the lockdown warranting the development of public health guidelines to mitigate the effects of the epidemic to the mental health of the population.","Skapinakis, Bellos, Oikonomou, Dimitriadis, Gkikas, Perdikari, Mavreas","https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/3158954","20200910","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-12","",4711,""

"Trauma-Informed Telehealth in the COVID-19 Era and Beyond","The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) entered the COVID-19 pandemic crisis with an existing and robust telehealth program, but it still faces a fundamental paradigm shift as most routine outpatient in-person care was converted to telehealth visits. Veterans are a highly trauma-exposed population, and VHA has long offered effective telemental health services. Natural disasters and pandemics like COVID-19 are known to be traumatic. Those with preexisting trauma exposure and mental health conditions are often at greater risk than the general population for long-term adverse health sequelae. Application of trauma-informed principles to telehealth care is critical and timely. Trauma-focused care (including telemental health) refers to evidence-based treatment models that directly facilitate recovery from trauma-related conditions like posttraumatic stress disorder. Despite the widespread availability of trauma-focused treatment in VHA, not all veterans chose to engage in it. In contrast, trauma-informed care (TIC) is a global, &quot;universal precautions&quot; approach to providing strengths-based, collaborative quality medical care in any discipline or location. In this article the authors, all primary care and mental health clinicians at VHA, advocate for the application of the 6 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration principles of trauma-informed care to telehealth. Using examples from telehealth research conducted in trauma-exposed patient populations, we illustrate the characteristics of telehealth that are well suited to delivery of trauma-informed care and suggest readily applicable strategies that can be used across disciplines including primary care and medical/surgical specialties. A primary care patient case scenario is included to illustrate how telehealth visits can be trauma-informed. Telehealth expansion has occurred nationally out of necessity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Trauma-informed virtual care has the potential to ensure and even expand continuity of medical care by fostering safe and collaborative interactions between patients and the health care team.","Gerber, Elisseou, Sager, Keith","https://www.google.com/search?q=Trauma-Informed+Telehealth+in+the+COVID-19+Era+and+Beyond.","20200910","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-12","",4713,""
"Psychiatric presentation of patients with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection: a retrospective review of 50 consecutive patients seen by a consultation-liaison psychiatry team","Reports of psychiatric morbidity associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection tend to be limited by geography and patients' clinical status. Representative samples are needed to inform service planning and research. To describe the psychiatric morbidity associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction) in referrals to a consultation-liaison psychiatry service in Qatar. Retrospective review of 50 consecutive referrals. Most patients were male. Median age was 39.5 years. Thirty-one patients were symptomatic (upper respiratory tract symptoms or pneumonia) for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 19 were asymptomatic (no characteristic physical symptoms of COVID-19 infection). Seventeen patients (34%) had a past psychiatric history including eight with bipolar I disorder or psychosis, all of whom relapsed. Thirty patients (60%) had physical comorbidity. The principal psychiatric diagnoses made by the consultation-liaison team were delirium (n = 13), psychosis (n = 9), acute stress reaction (n = 8), anxiety disorder (n = 8), depression (n = 8) and mania (n = 8). Delirium was confined to the COVID-19 symptomatic group (the exception being one asymptomatic patient with concurrent physical illness). The other psychiatric diagnoses spanned the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with COVID. One patient with COVID-19 pneumonia experienced an ischaemic stroke. Approximately half the patients with mania and psychosis had no past psychiatric history. Three patients self-harmed. The commonest psychiatric symptoms were sleep disturbance (70%), anxiety (64%), agitation (50%), depressed mood (42%) and irritability (36%). A wide range of psychiatric morbidity is associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and is seen in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Cases of psychosis and mania represented relapses in people with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and also new onset cases.","Iqbal, Al Abdulla, Albrahim, Latoo, Kumar, Haddad","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2020.85","20200910","COVID-19; aetiology; consultation-liaison psychiatry; delirium; psychosis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-12","",4714,""
"The COVID-19 pandemic and mental well-being of pregnant women in Japan: Need for Economic and Social Policy interventions","This study explores the mental well-being of pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. We collected 1777 responses from pregnant women through an online survey. Using the Japanese version of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), we calculated the percentage of pregnant women above the cut-off (Ã¢â€°Â¥ 13), and the factor scores of anhedonia, anxiety, and depression. Regression analyses were performed to identify factors and socio-economic characteristics correlated with depressive symptoms. The point prevalence of pregnant women with an EPDS score of Ã¢â€°Â¥13 was 17%. The mean scores were 0.73, 3.68, and 1.82 for anhedonia, anxiety, and depression, respectively. The probability of becoming above the cutoff score positively correlated with the cancellation of planned informal support, higher perceived risk for infection of COVID-19, difficulties in household finances, and lack of social support. Moreover, being younger, less wealthy, unemployed, and without a partner showed a significantly higher possibility of having a score above the cutoff. The present study found a high percentage of pregnant women with depressive symptoms. Notably, COVID-19 related variables including perceived risk for the infection, fear of decreasing economic wealth, and social support were significantly associated with depressive symptoms.","Matsushima, Horiguchi","https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2020.334","20200910","COVID-19; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS); Japan; perceived risk; pregnant women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-12","",4715,""
"Responding to the Psychological Needs of Health Workers During Pandemic: Ten Lessons from Humanitarian Work","When a complex emergency (CE) overwhelms infrastructure, the ability of healthcare providers to work efficiently under duress saves lives. Objectives and method: The author uses her experience of providing mental health supports to humanitarian aid workers and the pieces of training conducted for internal medicine practitioners to offer guidance on how to manage severe job-related stresses during the response to COVID-19 pandemic. This work reminds responders about their professional mission and purpose, but its extreme physical and mental demands can take a toll on their well-being and health. In CEs, the sheer volume of work and the emotional over-engagement tend to produce toxic fantasies (e.g., rescuer or helper fantasies), acting upon which threatens integrity of care and increases risks for both patients and providers. Accumulated fatigue and exposure to mass suffering and mortality can change the perceived value of life and increase reckless, risk-taking, and suicidal behaviors. Introducing a self-awareness framework prioritizes the awareness of the available choices and making situation-appropriate and informed decisions about balancing one's own and others' needs. The COVID-19 response has demonstrated that fostering peer supports, changing organizational culture, addressing self-awareness within a training and supervisory context, and strengthening supports for managers are important parts of disaster preparedness. It also revealed that more research is needed to better understand and meet the special psychological needs of healthcare responders.","Cherepanov","https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2020.356","20200910","complex emergency; covid19 response; fantasy; peer support; self-awareness; suicide prevention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-12","",4716,""
"'Standing together - at a distance': Documenting changes in mental-health indicators in Denmark during the COVID-19 pandemic","<i>Aims:</i> There is a need to document the mental-health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated societal lockdowns. We initiated a large mixed-methods data collection, focusing on crisis-specific worries and mental-health indicators during the lockdown in Denmark. <i>Methods:</i> The study incorporated five data sources, including quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews. The surveys included a time series of cross-sectional online questionnaires starting on 20 March 2020, in which 300 (3Ãƒâ€”100) Danish residents were drawn every three days from three population groups: the general population (<i>N</i>=1046), families with children (<i>N</i>=1032) and older people (<i>N</i>=1059). These data were analysed by trend analysis. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 32 people aged 24-83 throughout Denmark to provide context to the survey results and to gain insight into people's experiences of the lockdown. <i>Results:</i> Absolute level of worries, quality of life and social isolation were relatively stable across all population groups during the lockdown, although there was a slight deterioration in older people's overall mental health. Many respondents were worried about their loved ones' health (74-76%) and the potential long-term economic consequences of the pandemic (61-66%). The qualitative interviews documented significant variation in people's experiences, suggesting that the lockdown's effect on everyday life had not been altogether negative. <b><i>Conclusions:</i> People in Denmark seem to have managed the lockdown without alarming changes in their mental health.

"The Severity of Traumatic Stress Associated with COVID-19 Pandemic, Perception of Support, Sense of Security, and Sense of Meaning in Life among Nurses: Research Protocol and Preliminary Results from Poland","The COVID-19 pandemic can not only affect physical health, but also mental health, resulting in sleep problems, depression, and traumatic stress. Our research investigates the level of posttraumatic stress, perceived social support, opinions on positive and negative consequences of the pandemic, sense of security and sense of meaning among nurses in the face of this new and not fully understood global epidemiological phenomenon. For this purpose, computer-assisted web interviews were conducted between May 1 and May 15, 2020. Participating nurses completed the following research tools: The Impact Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), The Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), The Changes in Outlook Questionnaire (CIOQ), The Safety Experience Questionnaire (SEQ) and The Meaning in Life Questionnaire (MLQ). Three hundred and twenty-five nurses of an average age of 39.18 Ã‚Â± 11.16 years and working throughout Poland joined the study. The average overall IES-R score in the study group was 1.78 Ã‚Â± 0.65. Among the dimensions of traumatic stress, the highest score was obtained in the &quot;avoidance&quot; dimension was 1.86 Ã‚Â± 0.73. Amongst participating nurses, the highest support rates were provided by significant others (22.58 Ã‚Â± 5.22). Higher average scores were noted among participants in the subscale measuring positive psychological changes (18.56 Ã‚Â± 4.04). The mean MLQ score was 5.33 Ã‚Â± 0.87. A slightly higher result was observed in the subscale &quot;presence&quot; (5.35 Ã‚Â± 1.14). The results of the research implemented during the period of severe psychological pressure associated with the COVID-19 pandemic provided information on symptoms of traumatic stress in the examined group of nurses. Their sense of security has been lowered and accompanied by an intensified reflection on issues concerning security. However, their current sense of meaning in life remains higher than the tendency to searching for it. The surveyed nurses received individual support mostly from significant others (i.e., other than family and friends). They see positive changes resulting from painful experiences related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which can be characterized by adaptation in the form of post-traumatic growth.","Nowicki, Ã…Å¡lusarska, Tucholska, Naylor, Chrzan-Rodak, Niedorys","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17186491","20200910","COVID-19; changes in outlook; meaning in life; nurses; perceived social support; posttraumatic stress disorder; sense of security","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-12","",4718,""
"Anxiety, depressive symptoms, sleep patterns & associated factors among Bangladeshi wage earners during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study","Introduction: The economic vulnarability imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic induces stress on mental health of wage earnes in Bangladesh which is largely unexplored. This evidence gap was addressed in this study aiming to evaluate the mental health difficulties among Bangladeshi wage earners by assessing the associated factors influencing anxiety, depressive symptoms and sleep patterns. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted through online survey, a total of 707 individual Bangladeshi wage earners were enrolled in between 20 May 2020 and 30 May 2020. The questionnaire had sections on sociodemographic information, COVID-19 related information, & sleep duration; PHQ-9 & GAD-7 scales to assess depressive symptoms & anxiety, respectively. STATA version 14.1 program was used to carry out all the analyses. Results: The study revealed that anxiety and depressive symptoms among wage earners differed by gender, educational status, occupation, total monthly income (p =0.01). Fear of COVID-19 when working outside during the pandemic situation was inextricably linked with anxiety (AOR=2.08; 95% CI:1.42-3.04) and depressive symptoms (AOR=1.51; 95% CI= 1.04-2.20) among wage-earners. Participants who stayed at home for longer duration (>60 days) were more likely to have elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms (p= 0.05). Regarding sleep pattern, longer home stay during COVID-19 pandemic increased duration of sleep (ÃŸ=0.70; 95% CI: 0.30 to 1.10) and respondents who were responsible to financially support their family experienced significantly decreased duration of sleep (ÃŸ= -0.68; 95% CI: -1.18 to -0.20). Conclusions: The results of this study provided novel evidence on psychological difficulties among Bangladeshi wage earners which calls for an in-depth & longitudinal evaluation and immediate low intensity psychosocial interventions.","Mst.

"The association between financial hardship and mental health difficulties among adult wage earners during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh: Findings from a cross-sectional analysis","Background: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created several challenges including the financial burden which may result in mental health conditions. Aim: This study was undertaken to gauge the mental health difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic to gain an insight into wage earnersâ€™ mental health as they are responsible for maintaining the finance of their families in this critical situation. Method: This cross-sectional study was conducted through an online survey, a total of 707 individual Bangladeshi wage earners were enrolled in between 20 May 2020 and 30 May 2020. The questionnaire had sections on sociodemographic information, COVID-19 related questions, PHQ-9 & GAD-7 scales to assess depressive symptoms & anxiety, respectively. STATA version 14.1 program was used to carry out all the analyses. Results: The study revealed that 58.6% and 55.9% of the respondents had moderate to severe anxiety and depressive symptoms, respectively. The total monthly income less than 30,000 BDT (353.73USD) displayed increased odds of suffering from depressive symptoms (OR=4.12; 95% CI: 2.68-6.34) and anxiety (OR=3.31; 95% CI: 2.17-5.03). Participants who didnâ€™t get any salary, had no income source during lockdown, had financial problem, inadequate food supply were more likely to suffer from anxiety and depressive symptoms (p = .01). Perceiving the upcoming financial crisis as a stressor was a potential risk factor for anxiety (OR=1.91; 95% CI:1.32-2.77) and depressive symptoms (OR=1.50; 95% CI:1.04-2.16). Conclusion: Wage-earners in a low resource setting like Bangladesh require mental health attention. Furthermore, financial consideration from the state or their workplace may help them to deal with mental health difficulties during this pandemic.","Mst.
