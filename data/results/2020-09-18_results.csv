"The first 60 years: Honoring Teratology's past, a new perspective on the future","BACKGROUND: This paper updates the history of the Teratology Society, now known as the Society for Birth Defects Research and Prevention (BDRP), for its first 60 years and describes the current strategy to position the Society to continue to advance its multidisciplinary science in the future. Common threads across our history include the positive impact of the Society's approach to sharing multidisciplinary, cutting-edge science and the collegial nature of the annual meetings. AIM: In recent years, we have tackled challenging issues through periodic strategic planning sessions to improve the impact of the Society and its value to our members. MATERIALS & METHODS: Archived and current resources were reviewed for this historical perspective. RESULTS: In 2019, the Society took steps to rebrand itself to clarify our mission to the broader scientific and governmental communities. DISCUSSION: Although our name has changed, the mission remains to understand and prevent birth defects and disorders of developmental and reproductive origin. CONCLUSION: As BDRP, we continue to promote the exchange of research and ideas, provide educational opportunities, influence policy through advocacy, and evolve our communications to better serve our members and to have a greater impact on the health of future generations.","Roberts, Linda G; Lewis, Elise M","https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bdr2.1688","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Birth Defects Res;112(12): 903-913, 2020 Jul 15.; Publication details: Birth Defects Res;112(12): 903-913, 2020 Jul 15.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-18","",4883,""
"Improving access to psychosocial interventions for perinatal depression in low- and middle-income countries: lessons from the field","Over 90% women with perinatal depression in low and middle-income countries do not receive treatment. Scale-up of evidence-based psychosocial interventions is a key challenge. We developed the Thinking Healthy Programme (THP), a psychosocial intervention that can be delivered by non-specialist providers such as community health workers in primary and secondary care settings. Our research showed that three out of 4 women with perinatal depression who received the programme recovered, and there were beneficial effects on infant outcomes. In over a decade since the original research, policy and practice uptake of the programme globally has been promising. We describe factors contributing to this: the programme is relatively inexpensive and culturally transferable; the intervention can be integrated with existing maternal and child health programmes; the programme is amenable to 'task-sharing' via peers, nurses, community health-workers and other frontline workers; cascaded models of training and supervision, and the use of technology for training and delivery provide exciting future avenues for scaled-up implementation. These innovations are relevant to the neglected field of public mental health, especially in the post COVID19 era when rates of anxiety and depression are likely to rise globally.","Rahman, Atif; Waqas, Ahmed; Nisar, Anum; Nazir, Huma; Sikander, Siham; Atif, Najia","https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09540261.2020.1772551","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int Rev Psychiatry;: 1-4, 2020 Jun 09.; Publication details: Int Rev Psychiatry;: 1-4, 2020 Jun 09.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-18","",4884,""

"Immuno-psychiatrie et pandÃ©mie de SARS-CoV-2Â : liens et possibles consÃ©quences; [Immunopsychiatry and SARS-CoV-2Â pandemic: Links and possible consequences]","OBJECTIVE: The SARS-CoV-2 (or COVID-19) pandemic has been propagating since December 2019, inducing a drastic increase in the prevalence of anxious and depressive disorders in the general population. Psychological trauma can partly explain these disorders. However, since psychiatric disorders also have an immuno-inflammatory component, the direct effects of the virus on the host's immune system, with a marked inflammatory response, but also the secondary inflammation to these psychosocial stressors, may cause the apparition or the worsening of psychiatric disorders. We describe here the probable immunopsychiatric consequences of the SARS-CoV-2Â pandemic, to delineate possible screening actions and care that could be planned. METHOD: Data from previous pandemics, and existing data on the psychopathological consequences of the SARS-CoV-2Â pandemic, allowed us to review the possible immunopsychiatric consequences of the SARS-CoV-2Â pandemic, on the gestational environment, with the risk of consecutive neurodevelopmental disorders for the fetus on one hand, on the children and adults directly infected being at increased risks of psychiatric disorders on the other hand. RESULTS: As in previous pandemics, the activation of the immune system due to psychological stress and/or to infection during pregnancy, might lead to an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders for the fetus (schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders). Furthermore, in individuals exposed to psychological trauma and/or infected by the virus, the risk of psychiatric disorders, especially mood disorders, is probably increased. CONCLUSION: In this context, preventive measures and specialized care are necessary. Thus, it is important to propose a close follow-up to the individuals who have been infected by the virus, in order to set up the earliest care possible. Likewise, in pregnant women, screening of mood disorders during the pregnancy or the postpartum period must be facilitated. The follow-up of the babies born during the pandemic must be strengthened to screen and care for possible neurodevelopmental disorders.","Daaboul, J; Tamouza, R; Leboyer, M","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.07.002","","Country: FR; FRANÃ‡A; FRANCE; FRANCIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Encephale;2020 Jul 21.; Publication details: Encephale;2020 Jul 21.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-18","",4920,""
"Mental distress in orthodontic patients during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic","INTRODUCTION: The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak impacts the mental health of patients, health workers, and the public. The level of impact on the mental health of orthodontic patients in treatment is unknown. The objective of the study was to evaluate the mental health of orthodontic patients in China during the early stage of the pandemic. METHODS: AnÂ online survey was conducted on a convenience sample of anonymous participants. The questionnaire, in Chinese (Mandarin), comprised 5 sections. Sections 1-3 included demographic, epidemical, and orthodontic status of the patients. Section 4 assessed mental health-related to orthodontics. Section 5 was the Kessler-10 Mental Distress Scale. A total of 48 orthodontists were invited to distribute the questionnaires to their patients. Descriptive statistics, principal component analysis, K-means cluster analysis, and bivariate logistics regression analysis were performed with significance set at PÂ <0.05. RESULTS: Questionnaires were collected from 558 patients (104 males, 354 females; mean age 24.78Â Â±Â 6.33Â years). The prevalence of mental distress was 38% (174/458). Higher odds ratios were associated with female participants, missed appointments, and Hubei residence. The type of orthodontic appliance was associated with the anxiety of prolonged treatment duration. The manner of communication with patients regarding the postponement of appointments was associated with patients' concerns of prolonged treatment duration. The frequency of contact from dentists was associated with patients' independence. CONCLUSIONS: Over one-third of orthodontic patients experienced mental distress during the pandemic. Multiple factors affected the level of anxiety of orthodontic patients, such as the type of orthodontic appliance, time since last dental visit, manner of communication with the orthodontist, and the localities of the pandemic progression.","Xiong, Xin; Wu, Yange; Fang, Xinyi; Sun, Wei; Ding, Qin; Yi, Yating; Huang, Yanmei; Gong, Jinglei; Liu, Jin; Wang, Jun","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajodo.2020.07.005","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Am J Orthod Dentofacial Orthop;2020 Jul 10.; Publication details: Am J Orthod Dentofacial Orthop;2020 Jul 10.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-18","",4921,""

"Association of Socioeconomic Changes due to the COVID-19 Pandemic With Health Outcomes in Patients With Skin Diseases: Cross-Sectional Survey Study","BACKGROUND: The outbreak of COVID-19 has profoundly influenced people's lifestyles; these impacts have varied across subgroups of people. The pandemic-related impacts on the health outcomes of people with dermatological conditions are unknown. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to study the association of COVID-19 pandemic-related impacts with health-related quality of life in patients with skin diseases. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study among Chinese patients with skin diseases. A self-administered web-based questionnaire was distributed through social media. Demographic and clinical data and pandemic-related impacts (isolation status, income changes, and employment status) were collected. The main outcomes included perceived stress (Visual Analog Scale), symptoms of anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) and depression (9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire), quality of life (Dermatology Life Quality Index), and health utility mapping based on the EQ-5D-3L descriptive system. Multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate the associations. RESULTS: A total of 506 patients with skin diseases completed the survey. The mean age of the patients was 33.5 years (SD 14.0), and 217/506 patients (42.9%) were male. Among the 506 respondents, 128 (25.3%) were quarantined, 102 (20.2%) reported unemployment, and 317 (62.6%) reported decrease or loss of income since the pandemic. The pandemic-related impacts were significantly associated with impaired mental well-being and quality of life with different effects. Unemployment and complete loss of income were associated with the highest risks of adverse outcomes, with increases of 110% to 162% in the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and impaired quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Isolation, income loss, and unemployment are associated with impaired health-related quality of life in patients with skin diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Guo, Yeye; Shen, Minxue; Zhang, Xu; Xiao, Yi; Zhao, Shuang; Yin, Mingzhu; Bu, Wenbo; Wang, Yan; Chen, Xiang; Su, Juan","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/22288","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(9): e22288, 2020 Sep 11.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(9): e22288, 2020 Sep 11.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-18","",4923,""
"Methotrexate inhibits SARS-CoV-2 virus replication ""in vitro""","In early 2020 the new respiratory syndrome COVID-19 (caused by the zoonotic SARS-CoV-2 virus) spread like a pandemic, starting from Wuhan, China, causing a severe economic depression. Despite some advances in drug treatments of medical complications in later stages of the disease, the pandemic's death toll is tragic, since no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment is currently available. By using a systems approach, we identify the host-encoded pathway, which provides ribonucleotides to viral RNA synthesis, as a possible target. We show that methotrexate, an FDA-approved inhibitor of purine biosynthesis, potently inhibits viral RNA replication, viral protein synthesis, and virus release. The effective antiviral methotrexate concentrations are similar to those used for established human therapies using the same drug. Methotrexate should be most effective in patients at the earliest appearance of symptoms to effectively prevent viral replication, diffusion of the infection, and possibly fatal complications.

"Perceptual breakdown during a global pandemic: introducing phenomenological insights for digital mental health purposes","Online therapy sessions and other forms of digital mental health services (DMH) have seen a sharp spike in new users since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Having little access to their social networks and support systems, people have had to turn to digital tools and spaces to cope with their experiences of anxiety and loss. With no clear end to the pandemic in sight, many of us are likely to remain reliant upon DMH for the foreseeable future. As such, it is important to articulate some of the specific ways in which the pandemic is affecting our self and world-relation, such that we can identify how DMH services are best able to accommodate some of the newly emerging needs of their users. In this paper I will identify a specific type of loss brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic and present it as an important concept for DMH. I refer to this loss as loss of perceptual world-familiarity. Loss of perceptual world-familiarity entails a breakdown in the ongoing effortless responsiveness to our perceptual environment that characterizes much of our everyday lives. To cash this out I will turn to insights from the phenomenological tradition. Initially, my project is descriptive. I aim to bring out how loss of perceptual world-familiarity is a distinctive form of loss that is deeply pervasive yet easily overlooked-hence the relevance of explicating it for DMH purposes. But I will also venture into the space of the normative, offering some reasons for seeing perceptual world-familiarity as a component of well-being. I conclude the paper with a discussion of how loss of perceptual world-familiarity affects the therapeutic setting now that most if not all therapeutic interactions have transitioned to online spaces and I explore the potential to augment these spaces with social interaction technologies. Throughout, my discussion aims to do justice to the reality that perceptual world-familiarity is not an evenly distributed phenomenon, that factors like disability, gender and race affect its robustness, and that this ought to be reckoned with when seeking to incorporate the phenomenon into or mitigate it throughÂ DMH services.","van Grunsven, Janna","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10676-020-09554-y","","Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Ethics Inf Technol;: 1-8, 2020 Sep 01.; Publication details: Ethics Inf Technol;: 1-8, 2020 Sep 01.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-18","",4925,""

"The Impact of Psychology Interventions on Changing Mental Health Status and Sleep Quality in University Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Abstract Objective We evaluated the change in mental health and sleep quality of college students at four time periods. Methods Mental health status and sleep quality were using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) questionnaire across four time periods. Psychology interventions were carried out from the third period. Results Students in the third period had higher PSQI total scores [mean (SD), 6.01 (3.27)] than those in the first period [5.60 (3.11)], second period [4.17 (2.10)] and fourth period [4.09 (2.80)]. After adjustment for covariates there was a decline of 1.89 points in the PSQI in the fourth period compared with the highest period. The SCL-90-R scores were highest in the second period [121.19 (47.83)], and were higher than the scores in the first [107.60 (52.21)] and second period [107.79 (27.20)] and lowest in the fourth period [97.82 (17.12)]. The decline in scores was 23.38 points after adjustment for covariates. The prevalence of psychological distress and sleep disturbances respectively decreased from 28.6% to 11.7% and from 10.4% to 2.6% comparing to the highest period. Sleep quality showed a significant positive correlation with mental health status. Conclusions The pattern of change in mental health status was different to that of sleep quality. The implementation of comprehensive psychology intervention may improve mental health and sleep quality. These findings may inform public health policy during the reopening of schools in other regions.","Jing Xiao; Yu Jiang; Yu Zhang; Xinyi Gu; Wenjing Ma; Bo Zhuang; Ziqi Zhou; Lingli Sang; Yitian Luo; Yulong Lian; Jose Schutter; Sarah Connelly; Elena Sheldon; Jamie Hall; Emma Young; Andrew Bentley; Kirsty Challen; Chris Fitzsimmons; Tim Harris; Fiona Lecky; Andrew Lee; Ian Maconochie; Darren Walter","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.01.20186411","","Database: PREPRINT-MEDRXIV; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-18","",4929,""

The non-COVID-19 comparison group consisted of 132 female (mean age: 23.1 years) and 175 male (mean age: 24.8 years) professional footballers. N/A. Anxiety symptoms were measured with the validated Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 and depressive symptoms with the validated Patient Health Questionnaire 9. Both instruments have been widely used in both clinical and research settings among different populations, showing excellent psychometric properties. During the COVID-19 emergency period, the 2-week prevalence of symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder and depression was 18.2% and 21.6%, respectively, among female professional footballers and 15.5% and 12.9%, respectively, among male players. The 2-week prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among professional footballers was significantly higher during the COVID-19 emergency period than before the global pandemic (P &lt; 0.01).

The main exposure was survey completion date (March 10-16, 2020). The outcome was mental distress measured via the 4-item version of the Patient Health Questionnaire.<i>Results.</i> Among states with 50 or more COVID-19 cases as of March 10, each additional day was significantly associated with an 11% increase in the odds of moving up a category of distress (odds ratioÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.11; 95% confidence intervalÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.01, 1.21; <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.02). Perceptions about the likelihood of getting infected, death from the virus, and steps taken to avoid infecting others were associated with increased mental distress in the model that included all states.

"Short- and Potential Long-term Adverse Health Outcomes of COVID-19: A Rapid Review","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in millions of patients infected worldwide and indirectly affecting even more individuals through disruption of daily living. Long-term adverse outcomes have been reported with similar diseases from other coronaviruses, namely Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Emerging evidence suggests that COVID-19 adversely affects different systems in the human body. This review summarizes the current evidence on the short-term adverse health outcomes and assesses the risk of potential long-term adverse outcomes of COVID-19. Major adverse outcomes were found to affect different body systems: immune system (including but not limited to Guillain-BarrÃƒÂ© syndrome and paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome), respiratory system (lung fibrosis and pulmonary thromboembolism), cardiovascular system (cardiomyopathy and coagulopathy), neurological system (sensory dysfunction and stroke), as well as cutaneous manifestations, impaired hepatic and renal function. Mental health in patients with COVID-19 was also found to be adversely affected. The burden of caring for COVID-19 survivors is likely to be huge. Therefore, it is important for policy makers to develop comprehensive strategies in providing resources and capacity in the healthcare system. Future epidemiological studies are needed to further investigate the long-term impact on COVID-19 survivors.","Leung, Chan, Chan, Chan, Chui, Cowling, Gao, Ge, Hung, Ip, Ip, Lau, Lau, Lau, Leung, Li, Luo, Man, Ng, Siu, Wan, Wing, Wong, Wong, Wong","https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2020.1825914","20200917","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; complications; coronavirus infection; health outcomes; long term adverse outcomes; short-term adverse outcomes","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-18","",4933,""
"Preventing COVID-19 Infection in Mental Health Units: Recommendations for Best Practices","Mental health facilities should be equipped to care for patients while preventing spread of COVID-19. Peer-reviewed literature and guidelines for government and health organizations were reviewed to guide best practices. Gunderson's five therapeutic functions of a milieu are used as a conceptual framework. Patients should be screened for infection according to local or national policy prior to admission to an inpatient mental health unit. While interacting with one another in a therapeutic milieu, patients should be encouraged to practice physical distancing and hand hygiene. Clinicians may need to alter therapeutic groups to prevent COVID-19 infection. Additionally, clinicians should monitor patients for emerging symptoms and conduct rapid testing and isolation of patients suspected of COVID-19. Recommendations are made for patients unable to adhere to physical distancing or hand hygiene policies.","Quidley-Rodriguez, de Tantillo","https://doi.org/10.1080/01612840.2020.1820646","20200917","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-18","",4934,""

"The 2019-20 bushfires and COVID-19: The ongoing impact on the mental health of people living in rural and farming communities","It is well established that bushfires and other natural disasters have long term-effects on the mental health of affected individuals and communities (Black Dog Institute, 2020). These effects can last for years as demonstrated following the 2009 Black Saturday fires in Victoria, Australia: one fifth (21.9%) of the highest impacted communities reported mental health symptoms at the five year follow up (Gibbs et al. 2013).","Usher, Ranmuthugala, Maple, Durkin, Douglas, Coffey, Bhullar","https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.12798","20200917","Busfires; Disasters; Mental health; Trauma; Wildfires","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-18","",4936,""
"Digital Contact tracing in the COVID-19 Pandemic: A tool far from reality","Digital contact tracing applications are being developed by governments across the world, to track and trace contacts. With little evidence, citizens are being forced and made to believe that it is an important step in pandemic control. We discuss briefly if contact tracing will be successful in the control of the Corona virus pandemic or is it just a tool governments are using to cover their helplessness.","Hegde, Masthi","https://doi.org/10.1177/2055207620946193","20200917","COVID-19; Contact tracing; corona virus pandemic; digital health; general; privacy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-18","",4937,""
"Contrasting the Perceived Severity of COVID-19 and HIV Infection in an Online Survey of Gay, Bisexual, and Other Men Who Have Sex With Men During the US COVID-19 Epidemic","While there is evidence of variations in the risk perceptions of COVID-19 and that they are linked to both engagement in health-protective behaviors and poor mental health outcomes, there has been a lack of attention to how individuals perceive the risk of COVID-19 relative to other infectious diseases. This paper examines the relative perceptions of the severity of COVID-19 and HIV among a sample of U.S. gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSMs). The &quot;Love and Sex in the Time of COVID-19&quot; survey was conducted online from April 2020 to May 2020. GBMSMs were recruited through paid banner advertisements featured on social networking platforms, resulting in a sample size of 696. The analysis considers differences in responses to two scales: the Perceived Severity of HIV Infection and the Perceived Severity of COVID-19 Infection. Participants perceived greater seriousness for HIV infection (mean 46.67, range 17-65) than for COVID-19 infection (mean 38.81, range 13-62). Some items reflecting more proximal impacts of infection (anxiety, loss of sleep, and impact on employment) were similar for HIV and COVID-19. Those aged over 25 and those who perceived higher prevalence of COVID-19 in the United States or their state were more likely to report COVID-19 as more severe than HIV. There is a need to develop nuanced public health messages for GBMSMs that convey the ongoing simultaneous health threats of both HIV and COVID-19.","Stephenson, Chavanduka, Rosso, Sullivan, Pitter, Hunter, Rogers","https://doi.org/10.1177/1557988320957545","20200917","COVID-19; HIV; gay and bisexual men; health threat","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-18","",4938,""
