"COVID-19-induced anxiety and protective behaviour among nursing students: A survey from western India","Introduction: The COVID-19 Pandemic has caused anxiety and stress among people. Nursing students, being an important link in the delivery of health care services, are always exposed to stressful situations which in turn put a great toll on their mental health. Moreover, the perceived risk of pandemics motivates people to embrace different protective measures so as to reduce any potential threats of an emerging health concern. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the COVID-induced anxiety and protective behaviors among nursing students. Methods: Nursing students studying at 02 nursing institutes of Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India were enrolled for the study. The data were collected using COVID-induced anxiety scale and protective behaviors towards COVID-19 Scale. These scales were converted to online google forms, and the link was circulated among 370 nursing students through emails and WhatsApp. A total of 229 students submitted their responses within stipulated time and were included in the final data analysis. Results: The response rate of the survey was 62%. Evidently, nursing students had a moderate level of anxiety (mean score 31.28 +/- 5.29) due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Overall protective behavior mean score was 56.63 +/- 6.4 which reflects that students were following higher quality of protective behaviors. There is a negative linear correlation between anxiety score and protective behavior score. Conclusion: The nursing students exhibited a moderate level of anxiety, and routing protective behaviors were frequently performed by these students. There is a timely need to plan and implement interventions for nursing students so as to make them self-capable to resolve psychosocial issues, especially during disease outbreaks.","Nebhinani, M.; Parihar, A.; Kumar, A.; Gomathi, A.; Nebhinani, N.; Rani, R.","https://doi.org/10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_747_21","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care; 10(12):4483-4488, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-24","",27426,""
"Comparison of demographic profile and psychological problems related to coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak among the general public (18 years and above) in a Northern State of India: A web-based cross-sectional survey","Background: The psychological impact of the general public during a pandemic is complex and incompletely understood. There is a dearth of studies reporting the psychological problems in the general public during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis in India, including a comparison as per demographic profile. Materials and Methods: An online survey was conducted from April 17, to May 1, 2020 using the principles of the snowball recruiting technique. The psychological problems of the potential study subjects were evaluated using the Hindi version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) scale. There were a total of 1826 responses, out of which 391 were excluded from the analysis. Results: The mean age of the subjects was 41.95 years (Median = 50, SD = 19.05, range: 18-86 years) and around 45% of respondents were with an age range of 18-39 years. The mean and standard deviation of the PHQ-4 was 1.81 (2.34), and the overall prevalence of psychological problems was 30% as per the cutoff of PHQ-4. The estimates of anxiety and depression among study subjects were 11% (158/1435) and 16.1% (232/1435), respectively. Younger age, female gender, unmarried, and rural residential status were significantly associated with increased psychological problems in this setting. Conclusion: The psychological response to the COVID-19 varies with sociodemographic status, and about one-third of the people reported having psychological problems in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in this setting. There is a need to expand the mental health services to each stratum of the society with a focus to provide personalized care as per the sociodemographic profile.","Joseph, J.; Pareek, B.; Grover, S.; Sharma, S.; Varkey, B.

"Depression, Anxiety, and Stress among Indian Youth during the COVID-19 Lockdown-A Cross-Sectional Survey","Purpose: The psychological effects of the unprecedented global emergency due to COVID-19 are a significant concern worldwide. The present study aims to investigate the prevalence of stress, anxiety, and depression among Indian youth during the COVID-19 lockdown. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted online across India during the COVID-19 lockdown. A total of 1641 Indian youth between the ages of 15-24 years across 23 states and 3 union territories were analyzed for their mental health status. Depression, anxiety, and stress (DAS) levels of the Indian youth were measured using DAS scale 21. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB Reference number: DRP/EFP 530/2020: 08/06/2020). Results: Moderate to higher levels of depression and anxiety were observed among 45% and 49% of Indian youth, respectively, during the COVID-19 lockdown. DAS was significantly higher among youth preparing for competitive examinations, those who had an acquaintance infected with COVID-19 and those who perceived COVID-19 as a risky infection (P &lt; 0.01). School-going students showed significantly lower levels of depression and stress compared to college-going students (P &lt; 0.01). Conclusion: The high levels of DAS during the COVID-19 pandemic indicate a significant mental health burden among Indian youth. These findings indicate the need for a multisectoral approach to cope with stresses and to improve psychological well-being among youth during the pandemic.","Vaidya, R.; Kaza, S.

"Stress, mental health, and resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown: Preliminary findings of an online survey in India","Background: The recent COVID-19 pandemic has induced a considerable degree of fear, worry, and concern in the population at large. Drastic changes in daily lives as a result of lockdown may expose individuals to high stress levels, which might make them vulnerable to mental health issues. It is important to identify and understand these difficulties, which can help mental health professionals and policy makers address these issues. Aim: The present study aimed to screen mental health problems and to gain insight into resilience among Indians during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Materials and Methods: The study was cross sectional, using online survey method. Sociodemographic datasheet, a self-designed questionnaire, Patient Health Questionnaire and Brief Resilience Scale were entered into Google Form, and was sent using E-mails and WhatsApp to the personal contacts of the investigators. The link was also posted in social media groups. The participants were requested to complete the survey and then forward the link to their contacts. Inclusion criteria laid for the study included English speaking males and females, 18 years or older, and living in India. A total of 348 individuals filled in the forms, of which 327 were complete and included for analysis. Results: Fifty percent of the participants surveyed had symptoms of common mental disorders. Thirty-three percent had elevated scores needing diagnostic evaluation for somatoform disorder, 33% for generalized anxiety disorder, and 35% for depression. 8% reported developing interpersonal difficulties with family members, 17% reported financial stress, 23.5% were worried about job loss, and 35% found the lockdown very stressful. Elevated scores on patient health questionnaire-somatic, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were associated with financial stressors, worries about job loss, and lockdown stress. Ten percent of the participants indicated a need to talk to psychologist, and 40% were not aware of tele counselling facilities. Higher resilience was associated with lower odds of developing psychiatric symptoms. Conclusion: The results offer preliminary data-based insight into the impact of the lockdown, and are suggestive of increased stress and mental health liabilities. Fostering resilience may be critical to prevent or reduce mental health problems in general population during the pandemic.","Sahithya, B. R.; Kashyap, R. S.; Roopesh, B.

"Mechanism of physical activity in the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes mellitus: A short review","Background: Pre-diabetes (PDM) is a state with impaired glucose tolerance and/or impaired fasting glucose where people are at risk for diabetes. In less than 3 years, PDM gets converted to diabetes. Physical activity (PA) is a boon to PDM and diabetes to gain control over the glycemic variability and insulin secretion, reduction in cardiometabolic risk, and improvement in overall health. Increasing PA helps delay or prevent the conversion of PDM to diabetes mellitus (DM), as well as helps prevent complications of diabetes effectively. Materials and Methods: The aim of the review was to understand the mechanism by which PA can help to prevent and manage DM. Research papers, manuscripts, and review papers on PA and its mechanism of action on prevention and management of diabetes were searched and relevant contents were studied. One hundred and twelve papers were chosen from online sources like Google Scholar, Scopus, PubMed, Sci-Hub, and Library Genesis. Fifty-seven articles were shortlisted and out of them 54 included in this mini-review comprising of meta-analysis, systematic review, and randomized control trials. Fifty-seven articles were excluded due to irrelevant content in the contexts of diabetes and its mechanism. Result: The review resulted in getting a better understanding of the possible mechanisms by which PA works in prevention and management of DM and delaying the onset of diabetes in PDM. In addition to that, the highest known risk factors for diabetes in this current scenario are understood as physical inactivity among youngsters, along with low nutrition high-quality diet, stress, low-quality sleep, and associated fat and glucose metabolism. Conclusion: During pandemics like coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), physically being active also has its role in reducing resistance power and metabolism of fat and glucose, thereby increasing the risk for diabetes. It is always better to keep oneself with some exercise daily to maintain surface immunity high and strong to avoid diseases. This is possible by modification of lifestyle with yoga, exercises, and proper diet. Periodic incorporation of indoor-outdoor activities aiming at cutting short period of inactivity will help prevent and manage diabetes and other metabolic endocrine disorders to a large extent.","Kurian, J.; Nanjundaih, R.

"Prevention of Emotional Disorders and Symptoms Under Health Conditions: A Pilot Study using the Unified Protocol in a Fertility Unit","Emotional Disorders (EDs) are common in women who undergo fertility treatments. The Unified Protocol (UP) is a transdiagnostic intervention that has demonstrated efficacy in preventing EDs under different health conditions. The aim of this pilot study is to: 1) improve emotional dysregulation for the prevention of anxiety and depressive symptoms in women undergoing intrauterine inseminations (IUI);2) assess their acceptability (e.g., satisfaction and adherence rates). Method: Five women undergoing IUI, with no clinical diagnoses, responded to measures of mood (anxiety and depression), affect, quality of life and emotional dysregulation in the pre-and post-assessments, and at the 1-, 3-and 6 month follow-ups. The UP was adapted to be applied during six face-toface group sessions lasting 2 h. The COVID-19 pandemic situation implied changing to an online format to end the program. Results: The results showed that women did not develop EDs, and no statistically significant pre-post and pre-follow-up differences were found for anxiety, depression, quality of life and emotional dysregulation (all p &gt; .050). A tendency towards improvement in the post-assessment evaluation was noted. Satisfaction with the format and UP program was high. Conclusions: It would seem that programs focusing on therapeutic common factors like the UP could have an emotional preventive effect during IUI.","Martinez-Borba, V.; Osma, J.; Crespo-Delgado, E.; Andreu-Pejo, L.; Monferrer-Serrano, A.","https://doi.org/10.6018/analesps.462331","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Anales De Psicologia; 38(1):25-35, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-24","",27431,""

"Nursing leadership in response to the COVID-19 crisis in an Irish independent mental health service","Mental health nurses have been at the forefront of adjusting practice during the COVID-19 pandemic through novel means, including the delivery of technology-mediated interventions, upskilling on infection control and adapting practice to ever-changing national guidelines. The aim of this article is to describe an Irish mental health service's adaption to the global pandemic from the perspective of the nurse leadership involved. A case study approach was used describing the degree of adjustment and collaborative practice in â€˜tackling the spreadâ€™ documented with both staff and service users in mind. The case describes how mental health nurses were central to designing and overseeing the implementation and delivery of numerous initiatives across the service. They were also required to respond quickly and sensitively to service users' needs, while remaining true to the core values of mental health nursing practice. As the backbone of our health service, nurses continue to prove their ability to adapt flexibly, operationalise change at high intensity, provide quality care to service users in a professional and compassionate manner while managing their own safety, fears, personal circumstances and mental health.","Kirwan, Shane, Cunningham, Paddy, Donohue, GrÃ¡inne, Keogh, Brian, Creedon, John","https://doi.org/10.12968/bjmh.2020.0044","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: British Journal of Mental Health Nursing; 10(2):1-8, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-24","",27433,""

"HEMATOBIOCEMICAL AND HISTOPATHOLOGICAL STUDIES ON THE EFFECTS OF RAJ NIRWAN BATI (A NOVEL ALLOVEDIC DRUG) IN WISTAR RATS","Objective: To see the effects of Raj Nirwan Bati (RNB) on the hematobiochemical parameters, coagulation tests, and histopathological changes in the lungs, liver, kidneys and spleen and also to evaluate the immunomodulatory activity of RNBin Wistar rats. Methods: A total of 24 adult albino Wistar rats (of bodyweight 200-250 g) of either sex were divided into 3 groups. In the normal control group (n=8), no drug was administered and in the rest of the groups (A and B), RNB@ 26 mg/kg body weight./day and 260 mg/kg body weight/day respectively were administered orally for a period of 14 d. The blood samples were collected from the jugular vein at zero d (before drug administration) and after the 14th d of drug administration in both groups (A and B). The organ samples (lungs, liver, kidneys, and spleen) were collected after euthanizing the rats using Ketamine anesthesia overdose intraperitoneally (IP) after the 14th d of drug administration. White Blood Cells (WBC), Red Blood Cells (RBC), Hemoglobin (Hb), Hematocrit (HCT), Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV), Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin(MCH), Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration(MCHC), number of platelets, Differential Leucocyte Count(DLC) i.e. the percentage of neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, monocytes and basophils, neutrophil adhesion percentage, Prothrombin test (PT), Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT), fibrinogen, D-dimer, Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH), urea, creatinine, Aspartate Amino Transferase (AST), Alanine amino Transferase (ALT), Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), C-Reactive Protein (CRP) were evaluated and histological examination of organs were done. Results: After statistical analysis, it was found that the decrease in TLC, RBC, Hb, HCT, and LDH in Wistar rats after RNB intervention in Group A as compared to that of before RNB intervention, was found to be statistically significant (P=0.001, P=0.002, P=0.001, P=0.039, and P=0.008). On the other hand, an increase was observed in MCV, Urea, Creatinine and ALT values in the Wistar rats after RNB intervention in Group â€˜Aâ€™ as compared to that of before RNB intervention and this increase in values was statistically significant (P=0.007, P=0.001, P&lt;0.001 and P=0.038). After RNB intervention in Group B, the increase in MCH, fibrinogen concentration, and monocytes percentage, was found to be statistically significant (P=0.004, P=0.033, and P=0.001) as well as the decrease in PT and APTT was statistically significant (P=0.007and P=0.002). After comparing the Mean Hematobiochemical and coagulation test parameters in the rats of Group A and Group B, after RNB intervention, it was observed that the concentration of Urea, Creatinine, APTT, and D-dimer were less in Group B as compared to that of Group A and this difference was statistically significant(P&lt;0.001, P&lt;0.001, P&lt;0.001 and P=0.022). Histologically the findings in the lungs of group B were more distortion of lung architecture, most of the alveoli become collapse and make emphysematous changes, more diffuse inflammatory infiltrate within interalveolar septa and around bronchioles as compared to Group A. In the liver of group B rats, the histological findings were mild to moderate distortion of lobular architecture, healthy hepatocytes with more activation of kupffer cells as well as larger and more aggregates of inflammatory cells as compared to group A. Histological findings of kidneys in group A and group B rats were similar to that of control group rats. Conclusion: The results suggest that the RNB is having an immunomodulatory effect. It might be helpful in the restoration of coagulation factors and can help treat the COVID patients. No harmful effects on the lungs, liver, kidney, and spleen were seen. These findings may act as baseline data for planning further clinical trials in human study subjects to evaluate the effects on various comorbidities.","Singh, A.; Kumar, R.; Kannaujia, S.

"EVALUATION OF AIR QUALITY IN KONYA CITY CENTER AFTER THE NEW CORONA-19 OUTPUT AND WITH ITS CAUTION","As in the changing conditions throughout the world, urbanization in Turkey, energy supply and the use of energy resources create significant effects on a global scale, and as a result, air pollution is an important environmental problem. It is known that the factors that cause air pollution have significant effects on human and environmental health. In order to reduce these effects, improving air quality is important all over the world. Scientists and relevant authorities are working on monitoring the values of pollutants to find solutions to air quality problems, to follow an effective path or to determine a strategy. It is also important to measure air pollutants and monitor the quality, and to determine the causes and sources of pollution. It is very important to spread or model the analysis processes over a wider area. It is possible to reach these parameter limits with the measures to be taken to improve the air quality parameters. In recent years, new stations have been established in addition to 4 air quality measurement stations in the center of Konya, and the daily average data obtained from these are evaluated in this study. It has been observed that some local factors are also effective, as all parameters change depending on seasonal conditions. In general, it is understood from the results of studies that the air quality decreases and the size of pollution increases in cold winter seasons. It is necessary to reduce the pollution values, to control the pollutant rate arising from the activities of industrial enterprises, to reduce the use of fossil fuels, to encourage urban public transportation, to protect nature, and to make legal arrangements in human activities that reduce air quality. The studies to be carried out for this purpose should be started by the relevant authorities in order to reduce the factors causing pollution and to protect the air quality. It should be the duty of humanity to take measures to protect the life of all living things, especially human health.","Dursun, S.","https://doi.org/10.31407/ijees11.401","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Ecosystems and Ecology Science-Ijees; 11(4):671-678, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-24","",27443,""
"Knowledge and Attitude of Medical Students toward Electronic Learning during COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may caused life-threatening situations and provide challenges to medical education, as teachers should lecture safely by the electronic learning. The aim of this study is to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes, and satisfaction of medical students in Iraq about E-learning during COVID-19 pandemic. Subject and Material: A cross-sectional study was conducted among medical students at 20 universities in Iraq using a Google Form containing a 25-question study-questionnaire that includes socioeconomic and demographic information, also information regarding online medical learning and the status of medical education during COVID-19 Knowledge and attitudes related to the epidemic and learning electronic.Results: Most respondents (53.3%) disagreed that E-learning, while 16.4% of the respondents agree about that, the others are having neutral attitude. On the other hand, their attitude about electronic exams was positive in which majority of them (54%) agreeing that E-testing can replace others testing methods. Most respondents conduct that the best way of E-learning is explanatory downloadable videos (46.7%) followed by online classes with discussion (44.5%). Although Iraqi medical students are facing many difficulties as in poor internet web (major complication;57.5%), problems in dealing with the technology devices, poor communication with the teaching staff, insufficient understanding of the scientific material, inappropriate time of lectures and psychological problems like anxiety, E-learning has a list of advantages among Iraqi medical students such as time saving (53.3%), less cost, comfortable, ability to ask questions at any time, about 57.8% of students use E-learning more than 4 hours in day after pandemic. Conclusion:most students had not use E-learning before the COVID-19 pandemic, so there is a difference between time spent on E-learning before and after this pandemic, There is a relatively negative attitude of Iraqi medical students toward E-learning, also the best way of E-learning is explanatory downloadable videos, followed by online classes with discussion, as well as the attitude of medical students about electronic exams was positive agreed that E-testing can replacement the others traditional testing methods and E-learning has many advantages among Iraqi medical students and Several difficulties in same time.","Ramadan, B.; Ramadan","https://doi.org/10.47750/pnr.2021.12.02.007","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Pharmaceutical Negative Results; 12(2):37-42, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-24","",27444,""
"LONG-COVID IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS: VIRUS, MENTAL HEALTH AND PANDEMIC","Long-Covid is a typical condition of adults with a history of probable or confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection in the previous 3 months with symptoms that last over 2 months and are not explained by an alternative diagnosis. Studies in paediatric age are heterogeneous and show a prevalence of long-Covid from 4% to 66%. The most frequent symptoms in children and adolescents are somatic symptoms and this raises the question whether they are not specific symptoms due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, in some cases they are due to the consequences of the pandemic (restrictions, uncertainty and lockdown). The lack of significant differences of the reported symptoms in seropositive and seronegative students suggests that long-Covid-19 might be less common than previously thought and emphasizes the impact of pandemic-associated symptoms as to the well-being and mental health of young adolescents. A targeted approach to functional rehabilitation becomes necessary and should include a psycho-relational evaluation and investigate the presence of a psychiatric comorbidity as well.","Cozzi, G.; Troisi, A.; Iacono, A.; Marchetti, F.","https://doi.org/10.53126/MEB41021","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Medico e Bambino; 41(1):21-25, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-24","",27445,""
"Remote care management for older adult populations with elevated prevalence of depression or anxiety and comorbid chronic medical illness: A systematic review","Background Comorbidity of psychiatric and medical illnesses among older adult populations is highly prevalent and associated with adverse outcomes. Care management is a common form of outpatient support for both psychiatric and medical conditions in which assessment, care planning, and care coordination are provided. Although care management is often remote and delivered by telephone, the evidence supporting this model of care is uncertain. Objective To perform a systematic review of the literature on remote care management programs for older adult populations with elevated prevalence of depression or anxiety and comorbid chronic medical illness. Methods: A systematic review was performed in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. A multi-database search was performed. Articles were included for review if they studied fully remote care management for older adult populations with elevated prevalence of depression or anxiety and chronic medical illness or poor physical health. A narrative synthesis was performed. Results A total of 6 articles representing 6 unique studies met inclusion criteria. The 6 studies included 4 randomized controlled trials, 1 case-matched retrospective cohort study, and 1 pre-post analysis. Two studies focused on specific medical conditions. All interventions were entirely telephonic. Five of 6 studies involved an intervention that was 3 to 6 months in duration. Across the 6 studies, care management demonstrated mixed results in terms of impact on psychiatric outcomes and limited impact on medical outcomes. No studies demonstrated a statistically significant impact on health care utilization or cost. Conclusion Among older adult populations with elevated prevalence of depression or anxiety and comorbid chronic medical illness, remote care management may have favorable impact on psychiatric symptoms, but impact on physical health and health care utilization is uncertain. Future research should focus on identifying effective models and elements of remote care management for this population, with a particular focus on optimizing medical outcomes.","Lim, Christopher T.; Rosenfeld, Lisa C.; Nissen, Nicholas J.; Wang, Philip S.; Patel, Nick C.; Powers, Brian W.; Huang, Hsiang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaclp.2022.02.005","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of the Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-24","",27446,""
"Model projects according to 64 b SGBV in the Corona pandemic: care, structure and coercive measures","Background: Mental health care in Germany is being put to the test by the Corona pandemic, for example through the closure of day hospitals, bans on visits in hospitals, restrictions on community psychiatric services and chains of infection in old-age mental health wards. Model Region: In this context and exemplified in the psychiatric department of Heidenheim General Hospital, the ""regional budget for psychiatry"" as a cross-sectoral model project according to Sec. 64b SGB V (Germany's Code of Social Law) proves to be structurally and financially resilient. The regional budget works as a capitation system in which the provider of psychiatric care (Klinikum Heidenheim) agrees with the health insurance funds on a number of people from a defined catchment area who receive comprehensive inpatient and outpatient psychiatric care. Service description: Flexible treatment settings allow for low bed occupancy, outreach work, greater use of home treatment and more day hospital treatment. These options enable the provision of needs-based care while reducing the risk of infection. Use of coercion: Coercive measures were used less frequently in the model project than in previous years. Yet, during the corona pandemic in 2020 coercion was used more frequently compared to the previous year. Whether this is due to institutional or external factors is still an open question.","Zinkler, M.","https://doi.org/10.1486/rp-2021-02_75","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Recht & Psychiatrie; 39(2):75-79, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-24","",27447,""

"Perceived Stress and Coping Styles of Frontline Health Care Staff During COVID-19 Outbreak - Preliminary Report","Introduction: The COVID-19 outbreak has posed a great threat to public health worldwide. Health care workers fighting against the epidemic on the frontline may be under great physical and psychological distress. That psychological distress was predominantly described as symptoms of tension, depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Effective personal coping methods are notably important to protect against short- and long-term effects of stress. Methods: The study was conducted in three public healthcare units in Poland. The group of 109 people participated in the study, including 42 medical doctors aged 43.12 +/- 12.49 and 67 nurses aged 47.26 +/- 9.58 years. The following questionnaires were used for the research: Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (C ISS), and authors' demographic data questionnaire. Results: Taking into consideration perceived stress, an average score of 16.64 +/- 6.45 points in PSS-10 was obtained. There were results of 55.04 +/- 9.90 points in the task-oriented subscale, 34.23 +/- 10.91 points in the emotion-oriented subscale, and 43.65 +/- 8.46 points in the avoidance-oriented subscale of the CISS. Significant negative correlations between the results obtained in PSS-10 and the results obtained in task-oriented subscale were noted. Additionally, significant positive correlations were observed between results of PSS-10 scale and emotion-oriented subscale. The task-oriented style is a protective factor against high levels of perceived stress. No significant correlations were noted between average age of respondents and perceived stress. Conclusions: The results of this study show relatively moderate levels of perceived stress among health care workers during the first wave of pandemic. The main coping style among health care professionals was task-oriented style. The task-oriented style may play a protective role against the perceived stress.","Badura-Brzoza, K.; Buldak, R.; Debski, P.; Kasperczyk, S.; Wozniak-Grygiel, E.; Konka, A.; Markiel, M.; Brzoza, Z.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Perceived+Stress+and+Coping+Styles+of+Frontline+Health+Care+Staff+During+COVID-19+Outbreak+-+Preliminary+Report","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Israel Journal of Psychiatry and Related Sciences; 58(3):21-27, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-24","",27450,""
"PTSD and Depression in Healthcare Workers in the Italian Epicenter of the COVID-19 Outbreak","Background: Increasing evidence highlights the susceptibility of Healthcare Workers to develop psychopathological sequelae, including Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and depression, in the current COronaVIrus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, but little data have been reported in the acute phase of the pandemic. Objective: To explore Healthcare Workersâ€™ mental health reactions in the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the first European epicenter (Lodi/Codogno, Italy), with particular attention to post-traumatic stress and depressive symptoms and their interplay with other psychological outcomes. Methods: 74 Healthcare Workers employed at the Azienda Socio Sanitaria Territoriale of Lodi (Lombardy, Italy) were recruited and assessed by means of the Impact of Event Scale- Revised, the Professional Quality of Life Scale-5, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 item, the Resilience Scale and the Work and Social Adjustment Scale. Socio-demographic and clinical variables were compared across three subgroups of the sample (No PTSD, PTSD only, PTSD and depression). Results: A total of 31% of subjects endorsed a diagnosis of PTSD and 28.4% reported PTSD comorbid with major depression. Females were more prone to develop post-traumatic stress and depressive symptoms. Subjects with PTSD and depression groups showed high levels of PTSD, depression, burnout and impairment in functioning. Anxiety symptoms were higher in both PTSD and depression and PTSD groups rather than in the No PTSD group. Conclusion: Our results showed high rates of PTSD and depression among Healthcare Workers and their comorbidity overall being associated with worse outcomes. Current findings suggest that interventions to prevent and treat psychological implications among Healthcare Workers facing infectious outbreaks are needed.","Carmassi, Claudia, Pedrinelli, Virginia, Dellâ€™Oste, Valerio, Bertelloni, Carlo Antonio, Grossi, Chiara, Gesi, Camilla, Cerveri, Giancarlo, Dellâ€™Osso, Liliana","https://www.google.com/search?q=PTSD+and+Depression+in+Healthcare+Workers+in+the+Italian+Epicenter+of+the+COVID-19+Outbreak","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Clinical practice and epidemiology in mental health : CP & EMH; 17:242-252, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-24","",27451,""

"The other side of coagulation complications in COVID-19: a case report of two major bleeding events","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still an ongoing pandemic and has already resulted in millions of deaths worldwide. Since it is frequently associated with thrombotic complications, most hospitalised patients receive some form of anticoagulant therapy. Lately, bleeding events in patients with COVID-19 have also been increasingly reported. It is not yet clear whether these are also part of the spectrum of coagulation dysfunction in COVID-19. We report two cases of patients with COVID-19 with a large spontaneous haemorrhage during therapeutic anticoagulant therapy, after a long-term stay in the ICU. We propose several hypotheses for the occurrence of bleeding in COVID-19. Physicians should be aware of this risk, especially when patients are being treated with anticoagulants, because changes in the patientâ€™s condition during the course of the disease could lead to a relative overdose. We advise regular reassessment of anticoagulation dosage in patients with COVID-19.","Karels-Van Den Berg, A.; Rutgers, J.; Endeman, H.; de Jongh, E.; Kruip, M. J. H.

"Depression deterioration of older adults during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in Europe","Rationale Determining who is particularly vulnerable to mental health deterioration during the COVID-19 pandemic is essential when designing and targeting interventions to mitigate the adverse psychological impacts of the outbreak. Older people have appeared to be less exposed to mental health deterioration compared with younger individuals, but most exposed to the risk of severe illness and death from the virus, as well as less equipped to use technologies for coping with lockdown measures. Objective Amongst the old population, we aim at determining how depressive symptoms have changed during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and identifying individual risk factors associated with changes in reporting depression. We are particularly interested in exploring the role of pre-existing mental health problems and evaluating gender differences. Method Data come from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, in particular from the first COVID-19 survey administered in summer 2020. Logistic models are estimated and Average Marginal Effects computed to take the degree of individual unobserved heterogeneity into account comparing point estimates across samples. Multiple Imputation (implemented through Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations) is used to replace missing data. Statistical power of the effect sizes is estimated by a simulation approach. Results Pre-existing mental health problems, a diagnosis of affective/emotional disorders, a recent diagnosis of a major illness, and (only for men) job loss during the first wave of the outbreak are the most important risk factors. Statistical differences between genders emerge, with women experiencing higher levels of depression and greater worsening of mental health than men. Conclusions To identify people at greater risk of depression deterioration during an outbreak it is very important to consider their pre-existing mental and general health, distinguishing severity level. On population level, it is also crucial to evaluate depression disorders separately by gender.","Omar, Paccagnella, Benedetta, Pongiglione","https://www.google.com/search?q=Depression+deterioration+of+older+adults+during+the+first+wave+of+the+COVID-19+outbreak+in+Europe","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Social science & medicine (1982);2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-24","",27455,""

"Temporary employment and suicidal ideation in COVID-19 pandemic in Japan: A cross-sectional nationwide survey","Association between employment contract (temporary vs. permanent) and suicidal ideation (persistent suicidal ideation [i.e., with onset before COVID-19] or newly developed under COVID-19 pandemic) was examined using a nationally representative cross-sectional study in Japan. An Internet survey was conducted from August to September 2020. The participants' inclusion criteria for this study were as follows: (i) 20-65Ã‚Â years old, (ii) employees (excluding self-employed, students, retired, housewives, and unemployed). The associations of suicidal ideation with the employees' factors were analyzed using the multinomial logistic regression model, adjusting for covariates (sex, age, marital status, education, company size, industries, and a history of psychiatric disease). Of total 12Ã‚Â 249 participants, 72.4% were permanent and 27.6% were temporary employees. The prevalence was 8.5% for persistent suicidal ideation and 3.2% for newly developed suicidal ideation in the COVID-19 pandemic. Temporary employment was significantly associated with persistent suicidal ideation (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.36 [95% confidence interval, CI: 1.16-1.59]; PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001), but not associated with newly developed suicidal ideation (aORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.10 [0.85-1.42]; PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .457) after adjusting the covariates. Sensitivity analysis showed temporary employment was significantly associated with persistent suicidal ideation only in women. Newly developed suicidal ideation was significantly higher among participants of a young age, employees in drinking/eating/hotel business industry, and those having a history of psychiatric disease than among the counterparts. Working on a temporary employment contract was associated with persistent suicidal ideation under conditions of COVID-19 outbreaks in Japan. However, the result showed no significant difference in newly developed suicidal ideation.

"The where and when of COVID-19: Using ecological and Twitter-based assessments to examine impacts in a temporal and community context","In March 2020, residents of the Bronx, New York experienced one of the first significant community COVID-19 outbreaks in the United States. Focusing on intensive longitudinal data from 78 Bronx-based older adults, we used a multi-method approach to (1) examine 2019 to early pandemic (February-June 2020) changes in momentary psychological well-being of Einstein Aging Study (EAS) participants and (2) to contextualize these changes with community distress scores collected from public Twitter posts posted in Bronx County. We found increases in mean loneliness from 2019 to 2020; and participants that were higher in neuroticism had greater increases in thought unpleasantness and feeling depressed.

"Association of stigma with mental health and quality of life among Indonesian COVID-19 survivors","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) survivors face societal stigma. The study aims to analyze the association of this stigma with the mental health and quality of life of COVID-19 survivors. In this cross-sectional study, we observed 547 adults who were previously documented as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) positive by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, treated in a hospital or an emergency hospital and proven to be SARS-CoV-2 negative by their latest PCR test. We adopted the Berger HIV Stigma Scale to measure stigma; the World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief Form to measure quality of life; and the Mental Health Inventory-38 to measure mental health. The chi-square and binary logistic regression tests were used to find the correlation between the variables. The multivariate analysis revealed that medium stigma was more likely related to quality of life and mental health than low stigma. Females were less likely to experience stigma related to mental health than men, and respondents who worked as laborers and entrepreneurs were less likely to experience stigma related to mental health than those who worked as civil workers/army personnel/teachers/lecturers. COVID-19 survivors experienced medium stigma in society and lower quality of life and mental health status. We found that quality of life and mental health were affected by stigma, sex, and occupation. COVID-19 survivors are a vulnerable group that is most at risk when they return to their communities. Creating a safe environment and providing respectful care, including addressing complex stigma factors, is vital for developing appropriate interventions.","Wahyuhadi, Efendi, Al Farabi, Harymawan, Ariana, Arifin, Adnani, Levkovich","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0264218","20220223","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-24","",27459,""
"Psychological distress of college students during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objectives To assess levels of psychological distress among a group of US undergraduate college students during the initial phases of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> All undergraduates at Kent State University were surveyed in three randomly selected cohorts on March 18, March 25, and April 1, yielding 3924 valid responses for the weighted dataset (73.8% female, 88.9% White). Distress was assessed using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6). Data were weighted using known population counts. <b>Results:</b> K6 scores averaged 8.19Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.9, with 44.3% in the moderately elevated range and 23.8% above the cutoff for severe psychological distress.<b>Conclusions:</b> A high proportion of undergraduate university students reported elevated psychological distress as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded. K6 scores appeared higher than averages from comparison samples. Targeted surveillance can inform public health in mitigating threats to mental health conferred by pandemics. Colleges and universities should anticipate sharply elevated psychological distress during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hughes, Vander Horst, Gibson, Cleveland, Wawrosch, Hunt, Granot, Woolverton","https://doi.org/10.1080/07448481.2021.1920953","20220223","COVID-19; College students; depression: mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-24","",27460,""
"The role of perceived social support on pregnant women's mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","The present study aimed at investigating which sources of social support best account for pregnant women's levels of psychological distress and mental well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. 274 Italian and Canadian expectant mothers completed an online-based survey including measures of perceived social support (from family, significant other and friends), state anxiety, depressive symptoms, and satisfaction with life. Correlation analyses and amultivariate analysis of covariance were performed to explore how social support from different sources was related to depressive symptoms, state anxiety and satisfaction with life. Different sources of social support contributed to explaining women's psychological distress and mental well-being. Social support both from family and friends was significantly related to women's state anxiety and depressive symptoms. Social support from friends was specifically related to women's satisfaction with life. Our findings endorse the crucial role of perceived social support as a protective factor for pregnant women's mental health. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, our results suggest that support from family seems important in preventing psychological distress, whereas support from friends is also associated with mental well-being. These results may help designing future interventions aimed at improving women's perinatal mental health in life-threatening conditions.","Corno, Villani, de Montigny, Pierce, Bouchard, Molgora","https://doi.org/10.1080/02646838.2022.2042799","20220223","COVID-19; Women; mental health; pandemic; pregnancy; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-24","",27461,""
"Transitioning from In-Person to Telemedicine Within Primary Care Behavioral Health During COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic created significant mental stressors among patients, which had the potential to impede access to primary care behavioral health (PCBH) services through rapid unplanned shifts to telehealth. The authors utilized retrospective administrative data and patient surveys to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and clinical outcomes of Jefferson Health PCBH pre- and post-COVID pandemic onset (Cohort 1 in person-only visits and Cohort 2 telemedicine-only visits). Using a retrospective cohort comparison study, outcomes included number of patients receiving PCBH in both cohorts, frequency of visits, no-show and cancellation rates, change in mean PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores for patients, changes in the levels of depression and anxiety severity using established severity levels, and patient satisfaction with telehealth (Cohort 2 only). Patients in Cohort 2 were significantly more likely to have an anxiety diagnosis, had a smaller average number of visits, and were more likely to have a cancelled appointment. Both cohorts had statistically significant improvements in PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores. In regression analyses, treatment cohort was not a significant predictor of final PHQ-9 or GAD-7 score. More members of Cohort 2 reported severe anxiety at both initial and final measurements. Nearly all Cohort 2 patients agreed or strongly agreed that telehealth made it easier for them to obtain care, that the platform was easy to use, and the visit was effective. Overall, PCBH telehealth services post-COVID-19 onset were feasible, acceptable to patients, and yielded similar clinical improvements to in-person behavioral health visits conducted before the pandemic.","Rene, Cherson, Rannazzisi, Felter, Silverio, Cunningham","https://doi.org/10.1089/pop.2021.0292","20220223","COVID-19; integrated behavioral health; primary care behavioral health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-24","",27462,""
"Coronavirus disease 2019 and radiation oncology-survey on the impact of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic on health care professionals in radiation oncology","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirusÃ‚Â 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has changed the lives of most humans worldwide. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the SARS-CoVÃ¢â‚¬â€˜2 pandemic on health care professionals (HCPs) in radiation oncology facilities. We distributed an online survey to HCPs in radiation oncology (physicians, medical physics experts, radiology assistants/radiation therapists, nurses, and administrative personnel). The survey was completed by 334 participants between May 23 and June 9, 2020. In 66.2% of the cases, HCPs reported aÃ‚Â shortage of protective clothing. The protective measures were regarded as very reasonable by 47.4%, while 0.8% regarded them as not reasonable (rather reasonable: 44.0%; less reasonable 7.8%). 29.0% of the participants had children who needed care. The most frequently used care options were public emergency childcare (36.1%) and private childcare (e.g. relatives/friends). HCPs reported about additional work burden (fully agreed: 27.2%, rather agreed: 34.4%, less agreed: 28.2%, not agreed: 10.2%), and reduced work satisfaction (fully agreed: 11.7%, rather agreed: 29.6%, less agreed: 39.8%, not agreed: 18.9%). 12.9% and 29.0% of the participants were fully or rather mentally strained (less mentally strained: 44.0%, not mentally strained: 14.1%). We must learn from this pandemic how to prepare for further outbreaks and similar conditions. This includes the vast availability of protective clothing and efficient tracing of infection chains among the HCPs, but also secured childcare programs and experienced mental health support are crucial. Further, work satisfaction and appreciation by employers is essential.","Vogel, Kessel, Eitz, Combs","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00066-022-01903-8","20220223","Child care programs; Coronavirus disease 2019; Mental health support; Protective clothing; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirusÃ‚Â 2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-24","",27463,""
"Patient Characteristics Associated With Phone Versus Video Telemedicine Visits for Substance Use Treatment During COVID-19","Although video visits may offer some benefits over the telephone, not all patients may be equipped to access video telemedicine, raising questions surrounding access disparities. The aim of this study is to examine patient characteristics associated with the use of phone versus video-enabled tele-medication for opioid use disorders (MOUD) during COVID-19. This study uses data from a nonurban integrated substance use disorder treatment site in New York to examine patient characteristics associated with the modality of tele-MOUD care. The provider did not offer in-person care. Multivariable regression models were used to assess the association between patient's primary mode of tele-MOUD and patient demographic characteristics. Additional analysis of new patient inductions examined associations between mode of tele-MOUD induction and 30-day follow-up receipt. Of the 4557 tele-MOUD encounters, 76.92% were video and 23.08% were telephone visits. Older patients had significantly higher odds of primarily using telephone (odds ratio [OR]: 0.580; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.045, 1.115). Patients with higher education (OR: -0.791; 95% CI: -1.418, -0.168), recent overdose (OR: -0.40; 95% CI: -0.793, -0.010), and new patients (OR: 0.484; 95% CI: -0.945, 0.023) were significantly less likely to rely on telephone. Of 336 new patient initiations, 31 were conducted by telephone while 305 were conducted through video. The mode of new patient initiation was not associated with a follow-up visit within 30Ã¢â‚¬Å days of initiation. Telemedicine may increase access to MOUD, though certain patients may rely on different forms of telemedicine. Attention must be paid to policies that promote equitable access to both video and telephone tele-MOUD visits.","Chang, Lindenfeld, Thomas, Waldman, Griffin","https://doi.org/10.1097/ADM.0000000000000985","20220223","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-24","",27464,""
"Digitalized Cognitive Behavioral Interventions for Depressive Symptoms During Pregnancy: Systematic Review","Studies have shown a high prevalence of depression during pregnancy, and there is also evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of the most effective psychosocial interventions. Emerging evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) has shown that technology has been successfully harnessed to provide CBT interventions for other populations. However, very few studies have focused on their use during pregnancy. This approach has become increasingly important in many clinical areas due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and our study aimed to expand the knowledge in this particular clinical area. Our systematic review aimed to bring together the available research-based evidence on digitalized CBT interventions for depression symptoms during pregnancy. A systematic review of the Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, and EBSCO Open Dissertations databases was carried out from the earliest available evidence to October 27, 2021. Only RCT studies published in English were considered. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines were followed, and the protocol was registered on the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. The risk of bias was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials. The review identified 7 studies from 5 countries (the United States, China, Australia, Norway, and Sweden) published from 2015 to 2021. The sample sizes ranged from 25 to 1342 participants. The interventions used various technological elements, including text, images, videos, games, interactive features, and peer group discussions. They comprised 2 guided and 5 unguided approaches. Using digitalized CBT interventions for depression during pregnancy showed promising efficacy, with guided intervention showing higher effect sizes (Hedges g=1.21) than the unguided interventions (Hedges g=0.14-0.99). The acceptability of the digitalized CBT interventions was highly encouraging, based on user feedback. Attrition rates were low for the guided intervention (4.5%) but high for the unguided interventions (22.1%-46.5%). A high overall risk of bias was present for 6 of the 7 studies. Our search only identified a small number of digitalized CBT interventions for pregnant women, despite the potential of this approach. These showed promising evidence when it came to efficacy and positive outcomes for depression symptoms, and user feedback was positive. However, the overall risk of bias suggests that the efficacy of the interventions needs to be interpreted with caution. Future studies need to consider how to mitigate these sources of biases. Digitalized CBT interventions can provide prompt, effective, evidence-based interventions for pregnant women. This review increases our understanding of the importance of digitalized interventions during pregnancy, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"The Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Cleft Lip and Palate Service Delivery for New Families in the United Kingdom: Medical and Community Service Provider Perspectives","Professionals in the United Kingdom providing care to new families affected by cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P) had to adapt to ensure families' needs were met during a time of uncertainty due to Covid-19. The aims of this study were to explore the impacts of the pandemic on CL/P care provision for new families from the perspectives of professionals working in medical and community settings along with any personal impact on professionals and their reflections on the future of CL/P care. Semistructured interviews (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°27) were completed about experiences from March 2020 to October 2020 with consultant cleft surgeons (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°15), lead clinical nurse specialists (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°8), and staff working at the Cleft Lip and Palate Association (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°4). Transcripts were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. Three themes were identified: (1) the impact of Covid-19 on the provision of cleft care in the United Kingdom, including working conditions, delays to treatment, and Covid-19 policies; (2) the impact of the pandemic on professionals' mental health, including personal distress and concerns about Covid-19 exposure; and (3) reflections on the future of CL/P care, whereby professionals expressed both hope and concern about the Covid-19 recovery effort. The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has impacted CL/P service delivery for new families significantly, warranting recommendations for cohesive psychological support for families in addition to a safe and resourced recovery effort. Support for professionals is also suggested, following existing evidence-based models for providers' needs that address the difficulties of working throughout challenging times.","McWilliams, Costa, Blighe, Swan, Hotton, Hudson, Stock","https://doi.org/10.1177/10556656221074870","20220223","Covid-19; cleft lip and/or palate; ethics/health policies; psychosocial development; service delivery","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-24","",27467,""
"Describing Changes in Telebehavioral Health Utilization and Services Delivery in Rural School Settings in Pre- and Early Stages of the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency","Receiving treatment for behavioral health disorders remains problematic due to profound provider shortages. Telebehavioral health services are effective for providing quality care, but research literature on these services in schools is limited. Data were collected during Fall 2019 and Spring 2020 semesters on all students receiving telebehavioral health services from 15 school-based telehealth programs across the U.S. From Fall 2019 to Spring 2020, 62 schools providing services during both periods increased the number of students served from 396 to 745, increased the average number of encounters per student from 2.4 to 4.1, increased the percentage of encounters delivered by clinical social workers, mental health counselors, and clinical psychologists (all pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), and increased the use of individual counseling, family counseling, and group counseling (all pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). Schools that initiated the service in Spring 2020 (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°25) averaged 6.5 encounters for the 301 students receiving services, delivered mostly by clinical social workers or professional counselors, using individual counseling. Overall, data indicate programs significantly increased both behavioral services provided to their ongoing schools and increased the number of schools served.

"Coronaphobia: A barrier to ongoing cancer treatment?","Increased stress levels caused by the pandemic might cause delays in cancer treatment. We conducted a survey among cancer patients undergoing treatment to evaluate their psychological wellbeing and treatment adherence during COVID-19 pandemic. Patients receiving active chemotherapy at a private oncology center between January and May 2021 were included. Healthy volunteers were employees of a district health directorate with no history of cancer or chronic disease. Treatment adherence was described as compliant if the prescribed treatment was received within a week and the information was gained from patient charts. Hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) and COVID-19 phobia scale (CP19-S) were administered to participants. 402 participants were included; 193 (48%) were cancer patients. The mean age of the participants was 44 years old and 68% of the participants were female. All participants' CP19-S mean score was 47.9. Patient group had significantly lower CP19-S (p=0.006). Chronic disease and history of a shocking event were the factors associated with CP19-S. All participants reporting hospital anxiety were found to have significantly higher COVID-19 phobia levels (p&lt;0.05). Patients' mean HADS-anxiety score was significantly higher (7.3 vs 6.5, p=0.027). COVID-19 phobia was an independent factor increasing the level of anxiety and depression in both groups. Adherence to treatment was 100%. The pandemic increased levels of anxiety, however, cancer treatment continued to be a priority in patients' lives. Strategies should be developed to support oncology patients cope with the pandemic and increase their courage to avoid treatment delays. This article is protected by copyright.

"Longitudinal trajectories of mental health and loneliness for Australian adolescents with-or-without neurodevelopmental disorders: the impact of COVID-19 school lockdowns","The impact of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic school lockdowns on the mental health problems and feelings of loneliness of adolescents with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) is hypothesized to be greater than that of their non-NDD peers. This two and a half year longitudinal study compared changes in the mental health and loneliness of Western Australian adolescents pre-COVID-19 (November 2018 and April 2019), immediately prior to COVID-19 school lockdowns (March 2020), and post schools reopening (July/August 2020). An age-and-gender matched sample of 476 adolescents with-or-without NDDs completed online assessments for mental health and loneliness. Adolescents with NDDs reported elevated levels of adverse mental health across all four waves of data collection. These young people experienced little change in mental health problems and feelings of loneliness over time, and any increase during school lockdowns returned to, or fell below pre-COVID-19 levels once schools reopened. In comparison, adolescents without NDDs experienced significant increases from a low baseline in depression symptoms, externalizing symptoms, feelings of isolation, and having a positive attitude to being alone, and evidenced a significant decline in positive mental wellbeing. Quality of friendships were unaffected by COVID-19 school lockdowns for all adolescents regardless of NDD status. Of the adolescents with NDDs, those with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder reported a significant increase in positive mental wellbeing following school lockdowns. Adolescents with NDDs emerged relatively unscathed from COVID-19 school lockdowns and the short term impacts associated with these were not maintained over time. These findings should be considered in the context of this study's geographical location and the unpredictability of school lockdowns. Learning to live with school lockdowns into the future may be a critical element for further investigation in the context of interventions.","Houghton, Kyron, Lawrence, Hunter, Hattie, Carroll, Zadow, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.13579","20220223","Coronavirus; adolescents; loneliness; longitudinal; mental health; neurodevelopmental disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-24","",27470,""

"When Eastern Meets Western Medicine to Manage SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 Patient: a Case Report","Psychological and psychosocial issues are one of the prime areas to be focused on in SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. However, those patients' mental, social, and emotional parts are still not being focused on while treating the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. Thus, we integrated both eastern and western medicine to discuss its impact on the mental and psychological issues of the patient. We treated a 52-year-old man who was infected with COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 and had a sign and symptoms of fever, sore throat, running nose, cough, and tiredness. The patient was treated with integrated medicine, where we combined both eastern and western medicine to treat all aspects of health, i.e., physical, mental, emotional, and social. With the intervention we applied, his health was getting better day by day, and on the 16th day, his SARS-CoV-2 came negative. In addition, his mental health was also much better than the initial days of intervention.

"Obsessive compulsive disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic: A brief review of course, psychological assessment and treatment considerations","Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is an impairing mental health condition defined by intense distress in the presence of unwanted, recurrent thoughts, images, or impulses which are accompanied by compulsions and avoidance performed to reduce distress. During the COVID-19 pandemic, OCD has continued to be an impairing mental health condition regardless of symptom dimensionality (e.g., contamination, harm, etc.) with varying reports of the overall clinical course. However, changes in the assessment, treatment, and diagnosis of OCD have occurred to personalize care and be aligned with public health guidelines. Exposure and response prevention and pharmacotherapy remain the treatment of choice, even though the setting in which treatment is conducted may have shifted. Telehealth in particular has been a 'game-changer' for clinicians and patients alike. Given the continued health risk posed by the pandemic, treatment personalization should still be made to ensure safety for both patients and providers while balancing efficacy and patient preferences.","Maye, Wojcik, Candelari, Goodman, Storch","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocrd.2022.100722","20220223","Assessment; COVID-19; Cognitive-behavioral therapy; Exposure and response prevention; Obsessive-compulsive disorder; Treatment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-24","",27474,""
"European university students' mental health during Covid-19: Exploring attitudes towards Covid-19 and governmental response","The effects of Covid-19 have been felt worldwide and one population that are of increasing concern are university students. University students have endured unique and drastic changes to their everyday and academic lives. It is important to understand how university students in different parts of the world have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and how it has affected their mental health? A cross-sectional study was conducted during the first wave of Covid-19, in May 2020 with 2,006 university students from the UK, Italy, Germany and Spain. Participants were recruited online and were asked to complete a series of standardised measures of psychological distress, anxiety, flourishing and wellbeing. Attitudes towards Covid-19 were measured using a new scale. The factor structure and reliability of this new scale was confirmed using this European sample. Results indicated that all university students were suffering from poor mental health, considerably below pre-pandemic norms. There were many geographical differences in the way that university students perceived the Covid19 pandemic, in terms of their fears, anxieties, loneliness and positivity. There were also significant mental health comparisons between students from the UK, Italy, Germany and Spain. Student beliefs that their government had provided effective leadership during the Covid-19 pandemic were strongly related to numerous mental health outcomes. A picture of university students' mental health is provided and discussed. Geographical comparisons are discussed, as are the implications for practice and future directions.

"""Now We're All Family"": Exploring Social and Emotional Development in a Summer Hip Hop Mixtape Camp","Child and adolescent mental health indicators were trending in the wrong direction pre-COVID-19 and have worsened with the exacerbation of life stressors during a pandemic, especially among youth of color and girls (Racine et al. in JAMA Pediatr 175:1142-1150, 2021). Hip Hop integrated group work with adolescents has increased in the literature, with an emphasis on being more culturally responsive and engaging compared to traditional therapeutic approaches. Levy and Travis (J Spec Group Work 45:307-330, 2020) found in their research that while all Hip Hop integrated groups were effective, the semi-structured group had the most significant reduction in symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety, compared to the highly structured and minimally structured groups. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether a Hip Hop integrated intervention, that is multi-modal and interdisciplinary (i.e., blending two distinct models [HHE/CCMC] and facilitated by a social worker and school counselor). could effectively promote positive social and emotional development, across three leadership styles. Three groups of six high school students (total nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°18), identifying predominantly as Latinx and Black, were selected from a high school summer enrichment program. Results suggest social and emotional benefits for youth across all groups, regardless of facilitation style. Benefits included increased confidence, a strong sense of community, experiencing joy, and a willingness to step outside of their comfort zones to collaborate and create something personally meaningful. The setting (summer) and sample (high school students) have implications for programming and policies to best meet the mental health needs of youth year round and during times of instability.","Travis, Levy, Morphew","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10560-022-00821-z","20220223","Empowerment; Hip Hop; Mental health; Prevention; SEL","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-24","",27476,""
"Transient Thermal Characteristics of a Heated Infrared Temperature Sensor for Noncontact Medical Thermometry","In this work, the transient responses of a heated infrared (IR) temperature sensor were investigated to improve the reliability of determined target temperatures obtained from IR-based medical thermometers. A medical-grade IR temperature sensor was heated at the lower edge of the sidewall of the sensor. To reduce the uncertainty due to the conversion factor of the thermal detector, the temperature of the target, which was a thermostatted blackbody source, was determined when the observed target temperature and the temperature of the detector coincided during the heating and cooling of the sensor. When the determined target temperature was compared with the blackbody source temperature, it was found that during heating, due to the produced temperature gradient in the sensor, the observed target temperature showed erroneous depressions, resulting in the determined target temperature being considerably lower than the true target temperature. In contrast, the determined target temperature during cooling of the heated sensor was consistent with the tested blackbody source temperatures within the claimed uncertainty at all heating conditions. Therefore, based on the obtained results, it was concluded that temperature measurements using an IR temperature sensor could be carried out with the least uncertainty by determining the target temperature when the observed target and detector temperatures coincided during cooling of the heated sensor.","Jeong, An, Kim, Joung","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10765-022-02990-6","20220223","COVID-19; Heated thermal detector; Heating location; Heating rate; Infrared temperature sensor; Temperature gradient","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-24","",27477,""
"SPEAKS study: study protocol of a multisite feasibility trial of the Specialist Psychotherapy with Emotion for Anorexia in Kent and Sussex (SPEAKS) intervention for outpatients with anorexia nervosa or otherwise specified feeding and eating disorders, anorexia nervosa type","Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe mental health condition associated with high mortality rates and significantly impaired quality of life. National guidelines outline psychotherapeutic interventions as treatments of choice for adults with AN, but outcomes are limited and therapy drop-out high, resulting in calls for new innovative treatments. The Specialist Psychotherapy with Emotion for Anorexia in Kent and Sussex (SPEAKS) research programme sought to develop the SPEAKS intervention avoiding some difficulties inherent in development of earlier interventions, such unclear hypotheses about change processes. SPEAKS focuses on a core hypothesised maintaining factor (emotional experience) with clear proposed model of change. The current feasibility trial aims to provide an initial test of SPEAKS and inform design of a full randomised controlled trial protocol. This study employs a multisite, single-arm, within-group, mixed-methods design. Up to 60 participants (36 therapy completers) meeting inclusion criteria will be offered the SPEAKS intervention instead of treatment-as-usual (TAU). SPEAKS is a weekly psychotherapy lasting nine to 12 months, provided by trained and experienced eating disorders therapists. All other clinical input remains inline with TAU. Acceptability will be assessed using VAS scales and end of therapy interview. Reach and recruitment, such as recruitment yield, will be monitored. To support sample size estimation and economic estimation, data pertaining to eating disorder-related symptoms will be recorded every 3 months, alongside service usage and intervention-specific measures. Videoed therapy sessions will inform model adherence. Additional analyses coding videoed therapy will test SPEAKS change process hypotheses. Ethical approval has been granted by London-Bromley Research Ethics Committee (NHS Rec Reference: 19/LO/1530).

"Pregnant people's responses to the COVID-19 pandemic: a mixed-methods, descriptive study","Given the extent of the COVID-19 pandemic and uncertainty around the timing of its containment, understanding the experiences and responses of the perinatal population is essential for planning responsive maternity care both during and after the pandemic. The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of pregnant people and their responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify how health care providers can support this population. This was a mixed-methods, descriptive study with cross-sectional and qualitative descriptive components. We conducted the study between Mar. 20 and May 31, 2020, in British Columbia, Canada. Any pregnant person at any gestational age living in BC was eligible to participate. We collected quantitative data using online survey tools, including the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD-7). We collected qualitative data using open-ended questions to explore people's thoughts, feelings and experiences during the pandemic. Participants were recruited using study posters distributed via prenatal care clinics and classes, LifeLabs and social media across the province. We used thematic and descriptive analyses to analyze the data, and we integrated the qualitative and quantitative findings at the interpretation level. The study sample included 96 participants with mean (Ã‚Â± standard deviation) maternal and gestational ages of 32 Ã‚Â± 3.92 years and 22.73 Ã‚Â± 8.93 weeks, respectively. Most (93%; <i>n</i> = 89) identified as female. Of the participants, 54% (<i>n</i> = 50) and 35% (<i>n</i> = 34) reported anxiety and depressive symptoms, as measured by the GAD-7 and EPDS, respectively. Overarching themes that emerged from the qualitative data included uncertainty about birth plans and setting, added burden to existing health and social disparities, perceived or projected lack of support or limited support, concerns about early development, and struggle over managing multiple demands. Perceived maternity care needs included mental health support, maintaining prenatal care, frequent and proactive check-ins to build rapport, and recommendations specific to the pandemic. We found that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the pregnant population has been substantial.

"AdaptedÃ‚Â remoteÃ‚Â cognitive behavioural therapy for comfort eating with a woman with intellectual disabilities: Case report","Diagnostic overshadowing can prevent the treatment of comfort eating in people with intellectual disabilities, and the published literature contains few therapeutic examples. This case study reports a relatively novel, promising, and accessible, remote cognitive behavioural intervention. This case study documents a therapeutic intervention for comfort eating with a client, Sarah, in a National Health Service adult Community Learning Disabilities Service. Sarah is a white, British woman in her late thirties, with a diagnosis of Down syndrome who experienced significant problems with comfort eating and subsequent weight management. Despite dieting and exercising, Sarah was clinically obese and experienced weight related pain and psychological distress. Systemic intervention between Sarah, her mother, and the therapist formulated Sarah's eating difficulties using a cognitive behavioural framework. This hypothesised how comfort-eating met her emotional needs and maintained her health difficulties. Remote cognitive behavioural therapy interventions included collaborative behavioural experiments, coping strategies, and homework tasks. The Maslow Assessment of Needs Scale-Learning Disabilities, Glasgow Depression Scale for people with a Learning Disability, Glasgow Anxiety Scale for people with an Intellectual Disability, qualitative feedback from family, as well as frequency data showed significant improvement. Additionally, the case considers the evidence base, assessment, formulation and intervention, before reflecting on its various strengths and limitations. It reflects on the intersectionality of sexuality and intellectual disabilities, and the desire for romantic attachment, which was additionally complicated by the context of coronavirus and social isolation. The environmental influences on comfort eating regarding this case, and in general, the experiences of people with intellectual disabilities are also considered. The potential clinical impact of this case study includes exemplifying an effective comfort eating therapeutic intervention in an often overlooked client group.","Millar, Greenhill","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40337-022-00537-6","20220223","CBT; Clinical psychology; Comfort eating; Down syndrome; Intellectual disabilities; RemoteÃ‚Â working","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-24","",27480,""
"Effectiveness of an online versus face-to-face psychodynamic counselling intervention for university students before and during the COVID-19 period","The COVID-19 pandemic has increased online counselling interventions, including those aimed at university students. The principal aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the online counselling intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic, also with regards to the effectiveness of the face-to-face intervention. 34 students (Mean ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°23.74; FemaleÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°27) who requested online university counselling during COVID-19 have been compared with 81 (Mean ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°22.8; FemaleÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°60) students who requested university face-to-face counselling before the pandemic. The psychopathological problems were assessed with the Symptom Checklist 90 Revised, attachment styles with the Attachment Style Questionnaire, adverse childhood experiences with Adverse Childhood Experiences Questionnaire, and life satisfaction with the Life Satisfaction Scale. At the pre-intervention phase, psychological distress was similar in both groups with no differences in the General Severity Index of the SCL-90 R, and there were no significant differences for secure/insecure attachment, adverse childhood experiences, and life satisfaction. The online counselling intervention during the pandemic was effective in reducing psychological distress scales as depression (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.008), obsessive-compulsive (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.008), interpersonal sensitivity (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.005), and anxiety (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.011), and in the total scale of the SCL-90 R (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.017). The face-to-face counselling intervention was effective in reducing psychological distress in all subscales and in the total scale of the SCL-90 R (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.000) and in increasing the level of life satisfaction (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.023). Attachment style did not moderate the effectiveness of the online and face-to-face interventions.

"Profiles of positive changes in life outcomes over the COVID-19 pandemic in Chinese adolescents: the role of resilience and mental health consequence","The 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused enormous negative impacts on adolescents' routines, social interaction, interpersonal relationships, psychosocial well-being, and physical health. Nevertheless, theoriesÃ‚Â suggest that individuals also often seek out solutions thatÃ‚Â may facilitate positive changes when they are faced with uncertainty and crisis. However, the existing literature has disproportionately focused on the negative effect of COVID-19 on adolescents, and scant research has examined to what extent and in what aspects adolescents would experience positive changes in times of the pandemic. This pre-registered research aims to bridge said gaps by: (1) exploring different profiles of positive changes in various life outcomes in Chinese adolescents over the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) examining the role of resilience in differentiating different profiles; (3) comparing adolescents' mental health across profiles. Participants were 2,567 adolescents aged 12 to 24 recruited from 32 provinces in mainland China (66.89% females; M<sub>age</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°19.87Ã‚Â years, SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.02). Through an online survey, participants rated how much their lives of different domains had experienced positive changes since the outbreak of the pandemic. They also answered standardized questionnaires that measured their resilience and mental health. Results of latent profile analysis revealed three profiles: limited positive changes (33.3%), partial positive changes (49.5%), and overall strong positive changes (17.2%). Moreover, adolescents with a higher level of resilience were more likely to be categorized into the partial positive changes profile compared to the limited positive changes profile and categorized into the overall strong positive changes profile compared to the other two profiles, after controlling for multiple covariates. Adolescents in the overall strong positive changes profile had better mental health than their counterparts of the other two profiles. Chinese adolescents appear to experience positive changes in various life outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for those with high levels of resilience. Such positive changes have important implications on adolescents' mental health.","Li, Dou, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13034-022-00451-4","20220223","Building effect; COVID-19; Latent profile analysis; Life outcomes; Pandemic; Positive psychology; Positive youth development","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-24","",27482,""
"Tea and tea drinking: China's outstanding contributions to the mankind","Tea trees originated in southwest China 60 million or 70 million years ago. Written records show that Chinese ancestors had begun drinking tea over 3000Ã‚Â years ago. Nowadays, with the aging of populations worldwide and more people suffering from non-communicable diseases or poor health, tea beverages have become an inexpensive and fine complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapy. At present, there are 3 billion people who like to drink tea in the world, but few of them actually understand tea, especially on its development process and the spiritual and cultural connotations. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, CNKI, and other relevant platforms with the key word ""tea"", and reviewed and analyzed tea-related literatures and pictures in the past 40Ã‚Â years about tea's history, culture, customs, experimental studies, and markets. China is the hometown of tea, tea trees, tea drinking, and tea culture. China has the oldest wild and planted tea trees in the world, fossil of a tea leaf from 35,400,000Ã‚Â years ago, and abundant tea-related literatures and art works. Moreover, tea may be the first Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) used by Chinese people in ancient times. Tea drinking has many benefits to our physical health via its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immuno-regulatory, anticancer, cardiovascular-protective, anti-diabetic, and anti-obesity activities. At the moment, COVID-19 is wreaking havoc across the globe and causing severe damages to people's health and lives. Tea has anti-COVID-19 functions via the enhancement of the innate immune response and inhibition of viral growth. Besides, drinking tea can allow people to acquire a peaceful, relaxed, refreshed and cheerful enjoyment, and even longevity. According to the meridian theory of traditional Chinese medicine, different kinds of tea can activate different meridian systems in the human body. At present, black tea (fermented tea) and green tea (non-fermented tea) are the most popular in the world. Black tea accounts for over 90% of all teas sold in western countries. The world's top-grade black teas include Qi Men black in China, Darjeeling and Assam black tea in India, and Uva black tea in Sri Lanka. However, all top ten famous green teas in the world are produced in China, and Xi Hu Long Jing tea is the most famous among all green teas. More than 700 different kinds of components and 27 mineral elements can be found in tea. Tea polyphenols and theaflavin/thearubigins are considered to be the major bioactive components of black tea and green tea, respectively. Overly strong or overheated tea liquid should be avoided when drinking tea. Today, CAM provides an array of treatment modalities for the health promotion in both developed and developing countries all over the world. Tea drinking, a simple herb-based CAM therapy, has become a popular man-made non-alcoholic beverage widely consumed worldwide, and it can improve the growth of economy as well. Tea can improve our physical and mental health and promote the harmonious development of society through its chemical and cultural elements.","Pan, Nie, Tai, Song, Tong, Zhang, Wu, Lin, Zhang, Ye, Zhang, Wang, Zhu, Chu, Yu, Liang","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13020-022-00571-1","20220223","COVID-19; Harmonious society; Human health; Tea; Tea beverage; Tea culture","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-24","",27483,""
"Implementation of initiatives designed to improve healthcare worker health and wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic: comparative case studies from 13 healthcare provider organisations globally","Healthcare workers are at a disproportionate risk of contracting COVID-19. The physical and mental repercussions of such risk have an impact on the wellbeing of healthcare workers around the world. Healthcare workers are the foundation of all well-functioning health systems capable of responding to the ongoing pandemic; initiatives to address and reduce such risk are critical. Since the onset of the pandemic healthcare organizations have embarked on the implementation of a range of initiatives designed to improve healthcare worker health and wellbeing. Through a qualitative collective case study approach where participants responded to a longform survey, the facilitators, and barriers to implementing such initiatives were explored, offering global insights into the challenges faced at the organizational level. 13 healthcare organizations were surveyed across 13 countries. Of these 13 participants, 5 subsequently provided missing information through longform interviews or written clarifications. 13 case studies were received from healthcare provider organizations. Mental health initiatives were the most commonly described health and wellbeing initiatives among respondents. Physical health and health and safety focused initiatives, such as the adaption of workspaces, were also described. Strong institutional level direction, including engaged leadership, and the input, feedback, and engagement of frontline staff were the two main facilitators in implementing initiatives. The most commonÃ‚Â barrier was HCWs' fear of contracting COVID-19 / fear of passing COVID-19 to family members. In organizations who discussed infection prevention and control initiatives, inadequate personal protective equipment and supply chain disruptionÃ‚Â were highlighted by respondents. Common themes emerge globally in exploring the enablers and barriers to implementing initiatives to improve healthcare workers health and wellbeing through the COVID-19 pandemic. Consideration of the themes outlined in the paper by healthcare organizations could help influence the design and deployment of future initiatives ahead of implementation.","O'Brien, Flott, Bray, Shaw, Durkin","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-022-00818-4","20220223","COVID-19; Communicable disease; Global institutions/organizations; Health care planning; Healthcare workers; Human resources for health; Outbreaks; Psychosocial impacts","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-24","",27484,""
"Mental health and life satisfaction among 10-11-year-olds in Wales, before and one year after onset of the COVID-19 pandemic","In many countries, including inÃ‚Â the United Kingdom (UK), COVID-19 social distancing measures placed substantial restrictions on children's lives in 2020 and 2021, including closure of schools and limitations on play. Many children faced milestones such as transition to secondary school having missed several months of face-to-face schooling in the previous academic years. This paper examines change in mental health difficulties, life satisfaction, school connectedness, and feelings about transition to secondary school among 10-11-year-olds in Wales, UK, using data from repeat cross-sectional surveys before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were 4032 10-11-year-old schoolchildren. The first cohort completed a school-based survey in 2019 (prior to introduction of social distancing measures), and the second in 2021 (following full return to school after two rounds of school closure). The percentage of children reporting elevated emotional difficulties rose from 17% in 2019 to 27% in 2021 (Odds RatioÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.65; 95%CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.23 to 2.20). There was no evidence of increased behavioural difficulties (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.04; 95%CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.73 to 1.46). There was a tendency toward declines in life satisfaction in all analyses, but this intersected the null (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.86; 95%CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.70 to 1.07). Children reported a high degree of school connectedness before and after the pandemic, with no evidence of change in ratings of teacher relationships, pupil relationships or pupil involvement in school life. There was no evidence of impacts of the pandemic on children's feelings about the transition to secondary school, with feelings becoming more positive as transition neared. Most findings were robust to a range of sensitivity analyses. Supporting children's emotional recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is a public health priority requiring urgent and effective action at multiple levels of society. Maintaining connectedness to school through the pandemic may have played a role in preventing a steeper increase in child mental health difficulties.","Moore, Anthony, Angel, Hawkins, Morgan, Copeland, Murphy, Van Godwin, Shenderovich","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-12752-6","20220223","COVID-19; Children; Mental health; Survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-24","",27485,""
"Finding the Rainbow in the Deluge: Community Mental Health Perspectives on Psychosocial Impacts of COVID-19 in India","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions in health care services, including mental health services. The impact of the pandemic has been especially severe in low- and middle-income countries, such as India. This Open Forum examines the challenges faced by primary care psychiatry in India and elaborates on how the pandemic has accentuated them. The ""rainbow in the deluge"" model is introduced as a simple model to train in usage of basic coping strategies for mental health issues that arise because of the pandemic and to provide a framework for finding meaning through the pandemic experience.","Ebenezer, Alexander, Mukherjee, Mythri","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202100458","20220223","COVID-19; Community mental health services; Community psychiatry; coping skills","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-24","",27486,""

"The Effect of COVID-19 Endemicity on the Mental Health of Health Workers","Objectives A major surge in COVID-19 cases despite Singapore's high vaccination has strained the health care system in October 2021. Our aim was to assess and compare Healthcare Worker (HCW) mental well-being in 2021 against a previously published cohort inÂ 2020. Design Cross-sectional survey study. Setting and Participants HCWs from 4 public hospitals and a primary health care system over a 4-week duration in 2021 coinciding with a major surge compared with a similar period inÂ 2020. Methods A survey comprising of the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ) was distributed via email. Primary endpoints were the proportion meeting OLBI thresholds for both disengagement and exhaustion and being at risk for both Anxiety and Depression using HADS. Multivariate analysis identified significant predictors among demographic, workplace, and SAQ data. Subgroup analysis of overseas HCWs was performed. Results We surveyed 1475 HCWs. Significantly more HCWs met primary outcomes using OLBI and HADS than in 2020 (84.1% and 39.6% vs 68.2% and 23.3%, respectively; P < .001). Burnout levels were uniformly high. A HADS score =8 in either subscale was significantly associated with meeting burnout thresholds (P < .001). Overseas HCWs (PÂ = .002), South Asian ethnicity (PÂ = .004), preuniversity educational qualifications (PÂ = .026), and longer shift workhours of 8 to <12 (PÂ = .015) and =12 (PÂ = .001) were significantly associated with meeting HADS thresholds. Among overseas HCWs (n=407), seeing family more than a year ago was significantly associated with worse OLBI disengagement scores and a greater proportion meeting HADS thresholds vs seeing them within a year or being local HCWs (47.2% vs 37.2% and 35.6%, respectively; PÂ = .001). Conclusions and Implications HCW mental health has objectively worsened between 2020 and 2021 in the pandemicâ€™s second year. Avoiding prolonged shifts, adopting preventive mental health strategies, improving patient safety, and attention to HCWs of minority ethnicity, from overseas, and with preuniversity education may help.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2022.01.059","20220301","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-24","",27489,""
