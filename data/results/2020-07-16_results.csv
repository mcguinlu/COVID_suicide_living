"COVID-19 and telepsychiatry: Early outpatient experiences and implications for the future","The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically transformed the U S  healthcare landscape  Within psychiatry, a sudden relaxing of insurance and regulatory barriers during the month of March 2020 enabled clinicians practicing in a wide range of settings to quickly adopt virtual care in order to provide critical ongoing mental health supports to both existing and new patients struggling with the pandemic's impact  In this article, we briefly review the extensive literature supporting the effectiveness of telepsychiatry relative to in-person mental health care, and describe how payment and regulatory challenges were the primary barriers preventing more widespread adoption of this treatment modality prior to COVID-19  We then review key changes that were implemented at the federal, state, professional, and insurance levels over a one-month period that helped usher in an unprecedented transformation in psychiatric care delivery, from mostly in-person to mostly virtual  Early quality improvement data regarding virtual visit volumes and clinical insights from our outpatient psychiatry department located within a large, urban, tertiary care academic medical center reflect both the opportunities and challenges of virtual care for patients and providers  Finally, we provide clinical suggestions for optimizing telepsychiatry based on our experience, make a call for advocacy to continue the reduced insurance and regulatory restrictions affecting telepsychiatry even once this public health crisis has passed, and pose research questions that can help guide optimal utilization of telepsychiatry as mainstay or adjunct of outpatient psychiatric treatment now and in the future","Chen, Justin A., Chung, Wei-Jean, Young, Sarah K., Tuttle, Margaret C., Collins, Michelle B., Darghouth, Sarah L., Longley, Regina, Levy, Raymond, Razafsha, Mahdi, Kerner, Jeffrey C., Wozniak, Janet, Huffman, Jeff C.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2020.07.002","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: General Hospital Psychiatry;2020.; Publication details: General Hospital Psychiatry;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-16","",2748,""

METHOD: Participants (NÃ¢<U+0080><U+008A>=Ã¢<U+0080><U+008A>474 employed U.S. individuals) completed an online survey from April 6-12, 2020. Linear regressions were used to examine factors associated with mental health. RESULTS: After accounting for demographic characteristics, health status, other COVID-19 experiences, and anxiety symptoms, greater job insecurity due to COVID-19 was related to greater depressive symptoms. Conversely, after accounting for covariates and depressive symptoms, greater financial concern was related to greater anxiety symptoms. Further, greater job insecurity was indirectly related to greater anxiety symptoms due to greater financial concern. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that employers should aim to reduce job insecurity and financial concern among employees during the COVID-19 pandemic to address the associated mental health consequences.","Wilson, Jenna M; Lee, Jerin; Fitzgerald, Holly N; Oosterhoff, Benjamin; Sevi, Baris; Shook, Natalie J","https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JOM.0000000000001962","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Occup Environ Med;2020 Jul 14.; Publication details: J Occup Environ Med;2020 Jul 14.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-16","",2749,""
"Commentary: An integrated blueprint for digital mental health services amidst COVID-19","In-person traditional approaches to mental health care services are facing difficulties amidst the COVID-19 crisis. Recent social distancing has revamped the attention on non-traditional mental health care delivery to overcome the difficult access to services and fill the void. Tele-health has been established for several decades but has only been able to fill a small gap in services. Mental health mobile and tele-digital health complements are well poised to respond to the upsurge of COVID-19 cases. Screening and tracking with real-time automation and machine learning are useful for both assisting psychological first aid resources and targeting interventions. Of concern is the rigorous evaluation of these new opportunities in terms of quality of interventions, effectiveness and confidentiality. Service delivery could be broadened to include trained unlicensed professionals whom may help health care services in delivering evidence-based strategies. Digital mental health services emerged during the pandemic as complementary ways of assisting community members to adjust to stress and transitioning to new ways of living and working. As part of a hybrid model of care, technologies (mobile and online platforms) require consolidated and consistent guidelines as well as consensus, expert, and position statements on the screening and tracking of mental health (with real-time automation and machine learning) in general populations as well as consideration and initiatives for underserved and vulnerable subpopulations.","Balcombe, De Leo","https://doi.org/10.2196/21718","20200715","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-16","",2750,""

"Living in the midst of fear: Depressive symptomatology among US adults during the COVID-19 pandemic","The current study examines interrelationships between social vulnerability, individual stressors, social and psychological resources, and depressive symptomatology among US adults during the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Using an online survey platform, a poststratified (by age, gender, race, income, and geography), representative sample (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°10,368 adults) is used in the analysis. On average, sample respondents report Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale symptomatology nearly a point higher than the often used cutoff score for clinical caseness (16+); one-third of respondents had CES-D scores higher than 25. Multiple regression results show elevated levels of depressive symptomatology among the socially vulnerable (women, Hispanic, unmarried, not working). Those persons expressing heightened COVID-19 fear and moderate to high levels of food insecurity report more depressive symptoms than persons with less fear and low or no food insecurity. All three of the resource variables (mastery of fate, strength of ties, and optimism) are significant and in the negative direction. In a snapshot, the data provide an important point prevalence assessment of adult depressive symptoms during the current public health crisis. Results highlight the significance of vulnerability and individual stressors in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the analysis affirms the importance of access to social and psychological resources to combat heightened fear and anxiety that persons report during the current pandemic.","Fitzpatrick, Harris, Drawve","https://doi.org/10.1002/da.23080","20200715","COVID-19 pandemic; depression; fear; stressors and resources","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-16","",2753,""
"A health care workers mental health crisis line in the age of COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has brought a health care crisis of unparalleled devastation. A mental health crisis as a second wave has begun to emerge in our front-line health care workers. To address these needs, The Healthcare Worker Mental Health COVID-19 Hotline, based on crisis intervention principles, was developed and launched in 2 weeks. Upon reflection of why this worked, we decided it might be useful to describe what we now recognize as 13-steps which led to our success. The process included the following: (1) anticipate mental health needs; (2) use leadership capable of mobilizing the systems and resources; (3) convene a multidisciplinary team; (4) delegate tasks and set timelines; (5) choose a clinical service model; (6) motivate staff as a workforce of volunteers; (7) develop training and educational materials; (8) develop personal, local, and national resources; (9) develop marketing plans; (10) deliver the training; (11) launch a 24 hr/7days per week Healthcare Worker Mental Health COVID-19 Hotline, and launch follow-up sessions for staff; (12) structure data collection to determine effectiveness and outcomes; and (13) obtain funding (not required). We believe the process we used is specifically useful for others who may want to develop a COVID-19 hotline services for health care workers and generally useful for the development of other mental health services. We hope that this process may serve as a guide for other heath care systems.","Feinstein, Kotara, Jones, Shanor, Nemeroff","https://doi.org/10.1002/da.23073","20200715","COVID-19 mental health response; coping; crisis intervention hotline; health care service; mental health hotline; problem-solving","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-16","",2754,""

"Breath Regulation and yogic Exercise An online Therapy for calm and Happiness (BREATH) for frontline hospital and long-term care home staff managing the COVID-19 pandemic: A structured summary of a study protocol for a feasibility study for a randomised controlled trial","Objective 1: To determine if it is feasible to conduct an RCT of online Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) for frontline hospital and long-term care home staff under the constraints imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic and need for remote trial monitoring. Objective 2: To assess whether online versions of SKY and/or Health Enhancement Program (HEP) result in improvement in self-rated measures of insomnia, anxiety, depression, and resilience. This is an open-label feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT), comparing an online breath based yogic intervention SKY versus an online control mind-body intervention HEP in frontline hospital and long-term care home staff managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants will include frontline hospital and long-term care home staff that are involved in the management of COVID-19 patients in London, Ontario, Canada. Participants will be willing and able to attend via online video conferencing software to participate in the study interventions. Participants must have an adequate understanding of English and be able to sit without physical discomfort for 60 minutes. Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY): The online version of SKY will be delivered by at least one certified Canadian SKY teacher, with at least one back up teacher at all times, under the supervision of Ms. Ronnie Newman, Director of Research and Health Promotion, Art of Living Foundation, USA. The online version of SKY for healthcare workers has a total duration of 3 hours. Phase I will consist of 5 self-paced online modules of 4-10 minutes each to learn the breath control techniques. Participants will be sent an online survey in REDCap requesting that they self-confirm completion of the Phase I modules. In Phase II, 2 interactive online sessions of 1 hour each will be held on consecutive days with a certified SKY teacher, during which participants will learn the fast, medium and slow breaths. For ease of scheduling, multiple time windows will be offered for Phase II. There will be at least one back up teacher at all times. Both Phase I and II will be completed in the first week. Health Enhancement Program (HEP): The active control arm, HEP, will consist of time-matched online self-paced modules for Phase I. Phase II will consist of mindfulness-based meditation sessions delivered by mental health staff. HEP will be an active treatment program that incorporates mind-body interventions. HEP will consist of time-matched online self-paced modules with psychoeducation on healthy active living as well as interactive modules comprising of guided de-stressing exercises including music therapy, mindfulness and progressive muscle relaxation. Weekly follow up sessions will be offered to all recruited participants for 30 minutes each for the subsequent 4 weeks in both study arms. The following feasibility outcomes will be measured at the end of the study: (1) rate of participant recruitment, (2) rate of retention, (3) completeness of data entry, (4) cost of interventions, and (5) unexpected costs. Such measures will be collected on a daily basis through-out the study and tabulated 5 weeks later at the end of the study. Participants will be randomized after they have electronically signed the consent form and the research staff have confirmed eligibility. We will use REDCap to perform randomization in a 1:1 ratio as well as allocation concealment. REDCap is widely used by health researchers worldwide to significantly reduce data entry and study management errors to improve data fidelity. All study participants will be blinded to the study hypotheses so as to prevent any expectation bias. Group allocation will be masked during analysis.

"Modeling Spatiotemporal Pattern of Depressive Symptoms Caused by COVID-19 Using Social Media Data Mining","By 29 May 2020, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 had spread to 188 countries, infecting more than 5.9 million people, and causing 361,249 deaths. Governments issued travel restrictions, gatherings of institutions were cancelled, and citizens were ordered to socially distance themselves in an effort to limit the spread of the virus. Fear of being infected by the virus and panic over job losses and missed education opportunities have increased people's stress levels. Psychological studies using traditional surveys are time-consuming and contain cognitive and sampling biases, and therefore cannot be used to build large datasets for a real-time depression analysis. In this article, we propose a CorExQ9 algorithm that integrates a Correlation Explanation (CorEx) learning algorithm and clinical Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) lexicon to detect COVID-19 related stress symptoms at a spatiotemporal scale in the United States. The proposed algorithm overcomes the common limitations of traditional topic detection models and minimizes the ambiguity that is caused by human interventions in social media data mining. The results show a strong correlation between stress symptoms and the number of increased COVID-19 cases for major U.S. cities such as Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle, New York, and Miami. The results also show that people's risk perception is sensitive to the release of COVID-19 related public news and media messages. Between January and March, fear of infection and unpredictability of the virus caused widespread panic and people began stockpiling supplies, but later in April, concerns shifted as financial worries in western and eastern coastal areas of the U.S. left people uncertain of the long-term effects of COVID-19 on their lives.","Li, Chaudhary, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17144988","20200715","Basilisk algorithm; COVID-19 pandemic; Correlation Explanation (CorEx); Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ); mental health; social media data mining","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-16","",2760,""
"Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Treatment Delays in Patients with ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction","Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and its associated restrictions could affect ischemic times in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of the COVID-19 outbreak on ischemic times in consecutive all-comer STEMI patients. We included consecutive STEMI patients (<i>n</i> = 163, median age: 61 years, 27% women) who were referred to seven tertiary care hospitals across Austria for primary percutaneous coronary intervention between 24 February 2020 (calendar week 9) and 5 April 2020 (calendar week 14). The number of patients, total ischemic times and door-to-balloon times in temporal relation to COVID-19-related restrictions and infection rates were analyzed. While rates of STEMI admissions decreased (calendar week 9/10 (<i>n</i> = 69, 42%); calendar week 11/12 (<i>n</i> = 51, 31%); calendar week 13/14 (<i>n</i> = 43, 26%)), total ischemic times increased from 164 (interquartile range (IQR): 107-281) min (calendar week 9/10) to 237 (IQR: 141-560) min (calendar week 11/12) and to 275 (IQR: 170-590) min (calendar week 13/14) (<i>p</i> = 0.006). Door-to-balloon times were constant (<i>p</i> = 0.60). There was a significant difference in post-interventional Thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow grade 3 in patients treated during calendar week 9/10 (97%), 11/12 (84%) and 13/14 (81%; <i>p</i> = 0.02). Rates of in-hospital death and re-infarction were similar between groups (<i>p</i> = 0.48). Results were comparable when dichotomizing data on 10 March and 16 March 2020, when official restrictions were executed. In this cohort of all-comer STEMI patients, we observed a 1.7-fold increase in ischemic time during the outbreak of COVID-19 in Austria. Patient-related factors likely explain most of this increase. Counteractive steps are needed to prevent further cardiac collateral damage during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Reinstadler, Reindl, Lechner, Holzknecht, Tiller, Roithinger, Frick, Hoppe, Jirak, Berger, Delle-Karth, LaÃƒÅ¸nig, Klug, Bauer, Binder, Metzler","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9072183","20200715","Coronavirus disease 2019; ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction; total ischemic time","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-16","",2761,""
"COVID-19 inpatients with psychiatric disorders: Real-world clinical recommendations from an expert team in consultation-liaison psychiatry","The management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders poses several challenges, especially regarding drug interactions. We report three representative case-scenarios on patients with psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 to provide a practical approach based on the existing literature and the clinical experience of an expert team in consultation-liaison psychiatry. Psychopharmacological ongoing treatments should be prioritized and most doses should be reduced 25-50% of original dose if the patient receives lopinavir/ritonavir, with some exceptions including quetiapine, asenapine, olanzapine, sertraline, lamotrigine, bupropion, and methadone. If the psychopharmacological usual doses are in the low-to-median range levels, a dose change during COVID-19 drugs co-administration is not recommended, but only ECG and clinical monitoring of adverse effects and drug levels if required. Furthermore, when introducing a psychopharmacological drug, dose titration should be progressive, with ECG monitoring if cardiotoxic interactions are present. (A) In agitated delirium, olanzapine is recommended as first-line antipsychotic and quetiapine should be avoided. (B) In severe mental illness (SMI), essential treatments should be maintained. (C) In non-SMI with depressive/anxiety symptoms, psychological support should be provided and symptoms identified and treated. Most recommendations on pharmacological interactions provide only a limited qualitative approach and quantitative recommendations are lacking. Patients with psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 should be managed on a personalized basis considering several clinical criteria and, should not be excluded from receiving COVID-19 treatments. Risks of pharmacological interaction are not absolute and should be contextualized, and most psychopharmacological treatments should include an ECG with special attention to QTc interval.","Anmella, Arbelo, Fico, Murru, Llach, Madero, Gomes-da-Costa, Imaz, LÃƒÂ³pez-Pelayo, Vieta, Pintor","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.149","20200715","COVID-19; Consultation liaison psychiatry; Interactions; Psychiatry; Psychodrug; Psychopharmacology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-16","",2762,""
"Emergency medicine physician burnout and wellness in Canada before COVID19: A national survey","Emergency medicine (EM) is a high-risk specialty for burnout. COVID-19 has had and will continue to have important consequences on wellness and burnout for EM physicians in Canada. Baseline data are crucial to monitor the health of EM physicians in Canada, and evaluate any interventions designed to help during and after COVID-19. To describe the rates of burnout, depression, and suicidality in practicing EM physicians in Canada, just before the COVID-19 pandemic. A modified snowball method was used for survey distribution. Participants completed the Maslach Burnout Inventory - Health Services Tool (MBI-HSS), a screening measure for depression (PHQ-9), and a question regarding if the physician had ever or in the past 12 months contemplated suicide. A total of 384 respondent surveys were included in the final analysis: 86.1% (329/382) met at least one of the criteria for burnout, 58% (217/374) scored minimal to none on the PHQ-9 screening tool for depression, 14.3% (53/371) had contemplated suicide during their staff career in EM, and of those, 5.9% (22/371) had actively considered suicide in the past year. Canadian EM physicians just before the COVID-19 pandemic had an alarming number of respondents meet the threshold for burnout, confirming EM as a high-risk specialty. This important baseline information can be used to monitor the physical and mental risks to EM physicians during and after COVID-19, and evaluate support for mental health and wellness, which is urgently needed now and post pandemic.","Lim, Aarsen, Gray, Rang, Fitzpatrick, Fischer","https://doi.org/10.1017/cem.2020.431","20200715","COVID-19; Emergency medicine; physician wellness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-16","",2763,""
"Multilevel Associations of Daily Skill Use and Effectiveness With Anxiety, Stress, and Depression in a Transdiagnostic Sample Undergoing Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Training","Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is relatively effective at treating disorders of emotion dysregulation. However, given researchersâ€™ focus on group-level differences within disorder-specific treatments, it is unclear which transdiagnostic mechanisms influence these effects. Participants (n=19, Mage=31.8, 68% female, 95% Caucasian) with elevated emotion dysregulation completed daily reports of DBT skill use, perceived effectiveness, anxiety, stress, and depression during a DBT skills training group (1,344 observations). We tested whether within-person skill use was associated with same-day negative affect, predicted next-day changes in negative affect, and was moderated by perceived emotion regulation effectiveness. Participants used more within-person skills on days of greater stress and anxiety, which predicted next-day decreases in stress and anxiety. On days of high, but not low, perceived effectiveness, people used more skills in response to more intense negative affect. The use, and perceived effectiveness, of more skills may be mechanisms by which DBT skills groups promote improved emotional functioning.","Matthew W.
