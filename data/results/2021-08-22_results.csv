"Withania somnifera as a Safer Option to Hydroxychloroquine in the Chemoprophylaxis of COVID-19: Results of Interim Analysis","To study the efficacy and safety of Withania somnifera (WS) in the prophylaxis against COVID-19 in high risk health care workers (HCW) in comparison to hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). To evaluate general physical and mental health benefits of Ashwagandha. A 16 week randomized prospective, open label, parallel efficacy, two arm multi-centre study. The primary efficacy measure is 'failure of prophylaxis' as confirmed COVID-19 by quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) at any time during the study period. This study on 400 participants from three centres is designed to establish non-inferiority for WS to HCQ for prophylaxis against COVID-19 at 80% power and significance PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.025, one sided. The interim analysis was carried out on 160 participants after completion of 8 weeks. Participants in both the arms were well matched at the baseline characteristics. 40 participants in the HCQ group and 26 participants in the WS group reported mild AE. The symptoms of confirmed COVID-19 were found to be 3.7% (95% CI 1.3 to 10.5%) in the HCQ and 1.3% (95% CI 0.02 to 6.7%) in the WS arm amongst the first 160 participants completing 8 weeks. Our intent was to explore a safer option to HCQ. We report that WS was not found inferior to HCQ and its efficacy was within the 15% non-inferiority margin set a-priori. WS as immunomodulator has other clinical benefits including reducing mental stress. Final report of this study is expected by end of August 2021.

"Mothers' and Children's Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown: The Mediating Role of Parenting Stress","The present study, carried out during the first peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, aimed at investigating the mental health of mothers and children during the nationwide lockdown. More specifically, the study investigated children's depression and mothers' individual distress and parenting stress, in comparison with normative samples. The mediating effect of mothers' parenting stress on the relationship between mothers' individual distress and children's depression was also explored. Finally, the study analyzed whether children's biological sex and age moderated the structural paths of the proposed model. A sample of 206 Italian mothers and their children completed an online survey. Mothers were administered self-report questionnaires investigating individual distress and parenting stress; children completed a standardized measure of depression. Mothers' individual distress and parenting stress and children's depression were higher than those recorded for the normative samples. Mothers' parenting stress was found to mediate the association between mothers' individual distress and children's depression. With respect to children, neither biological sex nor age emerged as significant moderators of this association, highlighting that the proposed model was robust and invariant. During the current and future pandemics, public health services should support parents-and particularly mothers-in reducing individual distress and parenting stress, as these are associated with children's depression.","Babore, Trumello, Lombardi, Candelori, Chirumbolo, Cattelino, Baiocco, Bramanti, Viceconti, Pignataro, Morelli","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10578-021-01230-6","20210821","COVID-19; Child depression; Maternal distress; MotherÃ¢â‚¬â€œchild relations; Parenting stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-22","",17291,""
"Child, parent, and family mental health and functioning in Australia during COVID-19: comparison to pre-pandemic data","The COVID-19 pandemic presents significant risks to population mental health. Despite evidence of detrimental effects for adults, there has been limited examination of the impact of COVID-19 on parents and children specifically. We aim to examine patterns of parent and child (0-18Ã‚Â years) mental health, parent substance use, couple conflict, parenting practices, and family functioning during COVID-19, compared to pre-pandemic data, and to identify families most at risk of poor outcomes according to pre-existing demographic and individual factors, and COVID-19 stressors. Participants were Australian mothers (81%) and fathers aged 18Ã‚Â years and over who were parents of a child 0-18Ã‚Â years (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2365). Parents completed an online self-report survey during 'stage three' COVID-19 restrictions in April 2020. Data were compared to pre-pandemic data from four Australian population-based cohorts. Compared to pre-pandemic estimates, during the pandemic period parents reported higher rates of parent depression, anxiety, and stress (Cohen's dÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.26-0.81, all pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), higher parenting irritability (dÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.17-0.46, all pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), lower family positive expressiveness (dÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã‚Â 0.18, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), and higher alcohol consumption (22% vs 12% drinking four or more days per week, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). In multivariable analyses, we consistently found that younger parent age, increased financial deprivation, pre-existing parent and child physical and mental health conditions, COVID-19 psychological and environmental stressors, and housing dissatisfaction were associated with worse parent and child functioning and more strained family relationships. Our data suggest wide-ranging, detrimental family impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic; and support policy actions to assist families with financial supports, leave entitlements, and social housing.","Westrupp, Bennett, Berkowitz, Youssef, Toumbourou, Tucker, Andrews, Evans, Teague, Karantzas, Melvin, Olsson, Macdonald, Greenwood, Mikocka-Walus, Hutchinson, Fuller-Tyszkiewicz, Stokes, Olive, Wood, McGillivray, Sciberras","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-021-01861-z","20210821","COVID-19 pandemic; Child mental health; Couple conflict; Family functioning; Mental health; Parenting","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-22","",17292,""
"The Impact of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and its Lockdown Measures on the Mental and Functional Health of Older Individuals","The effect of the COVID-19 on the physical and mental health of Italian older individuals displaying signs of cognitive deterioration has not been deeply investigated. This longitudinal study examined the impact of COVID-19 lockdown measures on the psychological well-being and motor efficiency of a sample of Italian community-dwellers with and without cognitive decline. Forty-seven participants underwent instrumental gait analysis performed in ecological setting using wearable sensors, and completed a battery of tasks assessing cognitive functioning and psychological well-being, before and after the full lockdown due to the COVID-19 spreading. A series of Multivariate Analyses of Variance (MANOVAs) documented that the superior gait performance of the cognitively healthy participants exhibited before the COVID-19 spread, vanished when they were tested at the end of the lockdown period. Moreover, before the outbreak of the COVID-19, cognitively healthy participants and those with signs of cognitive decline reported similar levels of psychological well-being, whereas, after the lockdown, the former group reported better coping, emotional competencies, and general well-being than the participants displaying signs of cognitive decline. In conclusion, the full COVID-19 outbreak had a significant impact on the mental and motor functioning of older individuals with and without signs of cognitive deterioration living in Italy.","Fastame, Mulas, Putzu, Asoni, Viale, Mameli, Pau","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-021-09943-6","20210821","Aging; COVID-19; Gait analysis; Motor efficiency; Psychological well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-22","",17293,""
"Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 in patients: from path physiology to therapy","Coronavirus is a family of ARN positive single-stranded belonging to the family of Coronaviridae. There are several families of coronavirus that transmit more or less serious diseases. However, the so-called coronavirus-19 (SARS-CoV2) is the one that is currently causing most of the problems; in fact, biological dysfunctions that this virus causes provoke damage in various organs, from the lung to the heart, the kidney, the circulatory system, and even the brain. The neurological manifestations caused by viral infection, as well as the hypercoagulopathy and systemic inflammation, have been reported in several studies. In this review, we update the neurological mechanisms by which coronavirus-19 causes neurological manifestation in patients such as encephalomyelitis, Guillain-BarrÃƒÂ© syndrome, lacunars infarcts, neuropsychiatry disorders such as anxiety and depression, and vascular alterations. This review explains (a) the possible pathways by which coronavirus-19 can induce the different neurological manifestations, (b) the strategies used by the virus to cross the barrier system, (c) how the immune system responds to the infection, and (d) the treatment than can be administered to the COVID-19 patients.","Merino, Macho-GonzÃƒÂ¡lez, Benedi, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-021-05505-7","20210821","COVID-19; Neurological disorders; SARS-CoV-2; Therapies used; Viral mechanisms; Viral traffic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-22","",17294,""
"Emotional adaptation during a crisis: decline in anxiety and depression after the initial weeks of COVID-19 in the United States","Crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic are known to exacerbate depression and anxiety, though their temporal trajectories remain under-investigated. The present study aims to investigate fluctuations in depression and anxiety using the COVID-19 pandemic as a model crisis. A total of 1512 adults living in the United States enrolled in this online study beginning April 2, 2020 and were assessed weekly for 10 weeks (until June 4, 2020). We measured depression and anxiety using the Zung Self-Rating Depression scale and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (state subscale), respectively, along with demographic and COVID-related surveys. Linear mixed-effects models were used to examine factors contributing to longitudinal changes in depression and anxiety. We found that depression and anxiety levels were high in early April, but declined over time. Being female, younger age, lower-income, and previous psychiatric diagnosis correlated with higher overall levels of anxiety and depression; being married additionally correlated with lower overall levels of depression, but not anxiety. Importantly, worsening of COVID-related economic impact and increase in projected pandemic duration exacerbated both depression and anxiety over time. Finally, increasing levels of informedness correlated with decreasing levels of depression, while increased COVID-19 severity (i.e., 7-day change in cases) and social media use were positively associated with anxiety over time. These findings not only provide evidence for overall emotional adaptation during the initial weeks of the pandemic, but also provide insight into overlapping, yet distinct, factors contributing to depression and anxiety throughout the first wave of the pandemic.","Shuster, O'Brien, Luo, Berner, Perl, Heflin, Kulkarni, Chung, Na, Fiore, Gu","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-021-01552-y","20210821","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-22","",17295,""
"Wearing mask hinders emotion recognition, but enhances perception of attractiveness","The current global pandemic situation due to the Covid-19 has implied several consequences at all psychological levels. One of the main differences with respect to the pre-pandemic life in most of countries around the world is the obligation to wear a mask for citizens. This new habit could have several issues for human relationships. The current research aimed to explore the effect of wearing a mask on both emotion recognition and perception of attractiveness. Two hundred and two participants completed a task consisting of 24 face images presented twice, with and without mask. Of them, there were six images for emotion: anger, sadness, fear, and happiness. The results showed that emotion recognition was worse when wearing a face mask except for surprise: happiness, <U+03B7>2Â =Â 0.84; anger, <U+03B7>2Â =Â 0.74; anger, <U+03B7>2Â =Â 52. Moreover, wearing a mask enhanced the perception of attractiveness both in male and female in all emotions except for happiness: sadness, <U+03B7>2Â =Â 0.22; surprise, <U+03B7>2Â =Â 0.05, and anger, <U+03B7>2Â =Â 0.03.

"Predictors of breastfeeding self-efficacy during the covid-19 pandemic","Background Breastfeeding self-efficacy (BSE) is a strong predictor of the duration of breastfeeding. The aim of this study is to determine the predictors of BSE in breastfeeding mothers during the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted with 300 breastfeeding mothers who breastfed during the Covid-19 pandemic. Convenience sampling was used to recruit participants. A battery of online questionnaires measured sociodemographic and obstetric characteristics, breastfeeding self-efficacy, spouse postpartum social support, perceived social support, anxiety and depression, and fear of Covid-19. Data were analyzed using Pearson correlation coefficients, one-way ANOVA, and multivariable linear regression via stepwise method. The significance level in this study was aÂ =Â 0.05. Results The mean BSE score among participants was 58.19Â Â±Â 10.48 (out of 70). Spouse postpartum social support (ÃŸÂ =Â 0.732, pÂ =Â 0.04), intention to breastfeed (ÃŸÂ =Â 0.17, pÂ =Â 0.001), use of formula while breastfeeding (ÃŸÂ =Â -0.09, pÂ <Â 0.001), and depression (ÃŸÂ =Â - 0.11, pÂ <Â 0.001) were significant predictors of BSE. However, fear of Covid-19 was not significantly correlated with BSE (pÂ =Â 0.514). Conclusion The results of the present study showed that fear of Covid-19 was not a significant predictor of BSE, while spouse postpartum social support and having the intention of breastfeeding were positively associated with BSE. Depression and simultaneous use of formula in feeding the infant was negatively associated with BSE during Covid-19. Overall, breastfeeding can be encouraged through counseling to improve receiving spousal support, increasing breastfeeding intent, and reducing depression.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnn.2021.08.012","20210101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-22","",17303,""
