"Mental health of patients with mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown: A questionnaire-based survey weighted for attrition","Importance Individuals with pre-existing mental illness may be particularly vulnerable to the negative impact that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic seems to have on mental health. Most prior studies on this topic are limited by non-random sampling, lacking information on non-respondents, and self-reporting of mental illness. In the present study, we aimed to overcome these limitations via random sampling, acquisition of clinical and sociodemographic data on both respondents and non-respondents, and weighting of results informed by attrition. Objective To assess whether patients with mental illness experienced deterioration in mental health during the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown of Denmark in the Spring of 2020. Design A cross-sectional, questionnaire-based survey coupled with sociodemographic and clinical data from the medical records of all invitees. The latter enabled analysis of attrition and weighting of results. Setting The psychiatric services of the Central Denmark Region. Participants A total of 992 randomly drawn patients diagnosed with mental illness in the psychiatric services of the Central Denmark Region prior to the lockdown responded to the online survey (response rate of 21.6%). Exposure The four-week nationwide lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic (from March 11 to April 15, 2020). Main Outcomes and Measures The online questionnaire included the 18-item Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-18), the five-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5), and 14 questions evaluating worsening or improvement in symptoms during the lockdown using the pre-pandemic period as reference. Perceived reasons for deterioration of mental health were also reported. Results The weighted mean WHO-5 and BSI-18 scores were 38 and 28, respectively. A total of 52% of the respondents reported that their mental health had deteriorated during the lockdown, while 33% reported no change, and 16% reported improvement. The most commonly reported reasons for deterioration were loneliness, disruption of routines, concerns about coronavirus, less frequent contact with family/friends, boredom, and reduced access to psychiatric care. Conclusion and Relevance More than half of the patients with mental illness reported worsening of their mental health during the pandemic lockdown. There should be increased emphasis on ensuring both social and clinical support for individuals with mental illness during pandemics.","Pernille KÃ¸lbÃ¦k; Oskar Hougaard Jefsen; Maria Speed; SÃ¸ren Dinesen Ã˜stergaard","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.13.21253363","20210320","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-21","",12243,""
"The indirect health impacts of COVID19 restrictions: a strong debate informed by weak evidence","Policies to restrict movements and contact between people have been a common response to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in many countries around the world, in varying degrees of stringency. However, there have been concerns on the possible negative effects of these restrictions such as stay-at-home orders and lockdowns. In this analysis we attempt to determine the quantitative evidence of these potential harms, focusing on the few studies that approximate a counterfactual variation in level of restrictions. We find clear adverse impacts of lockdowns on mental health, intimate partner violence and physical activity, as well as a decrease in road traffic injuries, and increase in generalised anxiety. A discussion driven by science (not politics) is needed on what lockdowns can deliver, their limitations and how to optimally deploy them, keeping country specific circumstances in mind, along other public health strategies, in the fight against COVID-19.","Driss Ait Ouakrim; Ameera Katar; Patrick Abraham; Nathan Grills; Tony Blakely","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.16.21253759","20210320","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-21","",12244,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 on Provider Perceptions of Telemental Health","The present study was designed to assess mental health provider attitudes and perceptions of telemental health (TMH) prior to and during the COVID-19 Pandemic, as well as the nature of their TMH utilization. The study aimed to gather information about positive and negative attitudes towards TMH, perceptions and correlates based on the modality of care, and beliefs about the overall effectiveness of TMH as compared to face-to-face care. The current study is part of a larger mixed methods project utilizing a repeated cross-sectional design. An online survey was administered to a sample of 1448 mental health providers and included demographic and professional information, experiences with and perceptions of TMH prior to and during the COVID-19 Pandemic, as well as a brief measure of pandemic-related stress. The COVID-19 Pandemic resulted in an increased use of TMH in the study sample. During COVID-19, providers reported increased agreement with TMH being necessary, important, and effective for care delivery. Providers who primarily used video, compared with telephone, reported that TMH was more useful, satisfying, and effective. While negative attitude towards TMH was predicted only by prior attitudes and belief in TMH effectiveness, positive attitude towards TMH was also predicted by female sex and current level of pandemic related stress. TMH use during the pandemic was predicted by primary use of video platform and previous TMH use. The 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic resulted in increased use of TMH and significantly increased positive perceptions about TMH among mental health providers.","Doran, Lawson","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-021-09899-7","20210320","Attitudes; COVID-19 pandemic; Effectiveness; Provider perceptions; Telemental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-21","",12245,""
"Psychological symptoms among healthcare workers handling COVID-19 patients","Healthcare workers serve as the frontliners against the coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) and this puts them most at risk of infection as they attend to numerous patients with unknown status. This study aimed to examine stress, anxiety, and depression among healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients in Sarawak General Hospital (SGH), Malaysia. This cross-sectional observational study conducted in SGH during the pandemic with an online self-administered questionnaire composed of two parts, the socio-demographic characteristics, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS). A total of 105 healthcare workers responded to this study. A questionnaire in both Bahasa Melayu and English was used. The findings showed that all healthcare workers had mild anxiety, with the majority experiencing mild stress (57.1%), and almost half of the respondents experiencing mild depression (41%). Female subjects had a significant higher mean score in anxiety level and stress level compared to male subjects (10.0Ã‚Â±3.20 vs. 8.6Ã‚Â±2.93, p&lt;0.05; 14.1Ã‚Â±4.76 vs. 10.7Ã‚Â±3.70, p&lt;0.05, respectively). Staff who were transferred from other units to handle COVID-19 cases experienced more psychological symptoms. There were significant correlations between the depression, anxiety and stress levels among the healthcare workers and the number of children they had (r=0.739, p=0.001; r=0.642, p=0.001; r=1, p =0.001 respectively). However, the stress level among the healthcare workers was reversely correlated with their years of working experience (r=-0.199, p=0.042). This study identified some socio-demographic factors associated with increased levels of stress, anxiety and depression among the healthcare workers during pandemic, which may lay ground for future interventions.","Sim, Lau, Zaila, Hazira, Aniqah, Panicker, Hamzah","https://www.google.com/search?q=Psychological+symptoms+among+healthcare+workers+handling+COVID-19+patients.","20210320","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-21","",12246,""
"Association between electrocardiographic features and mortality in COVID-19 patients","Cardiovascular events have been reported in the setting of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). It has been hypothesized that systemic inflammation may aggravate arrhythmias or trigger new-onset conduction abnormalities. However, the specific type and distribution of electrocardiographic disturbances in COVID-19 as well as their influence on mortality remain to be fully characterized. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) were obtained from 186 COVID-19-positive patients at a large tertiary care hospital in Northern Nevada. The following arrhythmias were identified by cardiologists: sinus bradycardia, sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation (A-Fib), atrial flutter, multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT), premature atrial contraction (PAC), premature ventricular contraction (PVC), atrioventricular block (AVB), and right bundle branch block (RBBB). The mean PR interval, QRS duration, and corrected QT interval were documented. Fisher's exact test was used to compare the ECG features of patients who died during the hospitalization with those who survived. The influence of ECG features on mortality was assessed with multivariable logistic regression analysis. A-Fib, atrial flutter, and ST-segment depression were predictive of mortality. In addition, the mean ventricular rate was higher among patients who died as compared to those who survived. The use of therapeutic anticoagulation was associated with reduced odds of death; however, this association did not reach statistical significance. The underlying pathogenesis of COVID-19-associated arrhythmias remains to be established, but we postulate that systemic inflammation and/or hypoxia may induce potentially lethal conduction abnormalities in affected individuals. Longitudinal studies are warranted to evaluate the risk factors, pathogenesis, and management of COVID-19-associated cardiac arrhythmias.","Antwi-Amoabeng, Beutler, Singh, Taha, Ghuman, Hanfy, Manasewitsch, Ulanja, Ghuman, Awad, Gullapalli, Gbadebo","https://doi.org/10.1111/anec.12833","20210320","A-Fib; COVID-19; atrial fibrillation; cardiac arrhythmias; coronavirus disease-19; electrocardiogram","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-21","",12247,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of dialysis patients","Studies have shown increased anxiety, depression, and stress levels among different populations during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of dialysis patients remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the mental health of dialysis patients during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the period preceding the pandemic. Data originate from the ongoing multicentre observational Dutch nOcturnal and hoME dialysis Study To Improve Clinical Outcomes (DOMESTICO). Patients who filled in a health-related quality of life (HRQoL) questionnaire during the pandemic and six to three months prior were included. The mean difference in Mental Component Summary (MCS)Ã‚Â score of the Short Form 12 (SF-12) was analysed with multilevel linear regression. A McNemar test was used to compare presence of mentalÃ‚Â health-related symptoms during and prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 177 patients were included. The mean MCS score prior to COVID-19 was 48.08Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°10.15, and 49.00Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°10.04 during the COVID-19 pandemic. The adjusted mean MCS score was 0.93 point (95% CI -Ã‚Â 0.57 to 2.42) higher during the COVID-19 pandemic than during the period prior to the pandemic. Furthermore, no difference in the presence of the following mentalÃ‚Â health-related symptoms was found during the COVID-19 pandemic: feeling anxious, feeling sad, worrying, feeling nervous, trouble falling asleep, and trouble staying asleep. The mental health of dialysis patients appears to be unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Dialysis patients may be better able to cope with the pandemic, since they have high resilience and are less impacted by social distancing measures.

"A chain mediation model on COVID-19 symptoms and mental health outcomes in Americans, Asians and Europeans","The novel Coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020, impacting the lifestyles, economy, physical and mental health of individuals globally. This study aimed to test the model triggered by physical symptoms resembling COVID-19 infection, in which the need for health information and perceived impact of the pandemic mediated the path sequentially, leading to adverse mental health outcomes. A cross-sectional research design with chain mediation model involving 4612 participants from participating 8 countries selected via a respondent-driven sampling strategy was used. Participants completed online questionnaires on physical symptoms, the need for health information, the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) questionnaire and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). The results showed that Poland and the Philippines were the two countries with the highest levels of anxiety, depression and stress; conversely, Vietnam had the lowest mean scores in these areas. Chain mediation model showed the need for health information, and the perceived impact of the pandemic were sequential mediators between physical symptoms resembling COVID-19 infection (predictor) and consequent mental health status (outcome). Excessive and contradictory health information might increase the perceived impact of the pandemic. Rapid COVID-19 testing should be implemented to minimize the psychological burden associated with physical symptoms, whilst public mental health interventions could target adverse mental outcomes associated with the pandemic.","Wang, Chudzicka-CzupaÃ…â€ša, Tee, NÃƒÂºÃƒÂ±ez, Tripp, Fardin, Habib, Tran, Adamus, Anlacan, GarcÃƒÂ­a, Grabowski, Hussain, Hoang, HetnaÃ…â€š, Le, Ma, Pham, Reyes, Shirazi, Tan, Tee, Xu, Xu, Vu, Zhou, Chan, Kuruchittham, McIntyre, Ho, Ho, Sears","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85943-7","20210320","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-21","",12249,""
"National Health Service interventions in England to improve care to Armed Forces veterans","Armed Forces veterans (AFVs) are first and foremost citizens of the UK and are therefore-like all UK residents-entitled to universal healthcare, free at the point of need. This means that AFVs have nearly all their healthcare needs met by the NHS, which provides access to a full range of generic services. However, since 2013 there has been an Armed Forces team that can also support veterans. This review is an assessment of the work of this group over the last eight years. The health needs of AFVs have been investigated and are not significantly different from those of their demographically matched peers. However, due to their demographics, selection at recruitment and their roles, AFVs compared with the general population are more likely to be male, white and old and have fewer pre-existing or hereditary conditions. However, they do suffer from higher rates of musculoskeletal injury, different patterns of mental health illness and have historically been higher users-and abusers-of alcohol and tobacco. In addition to supporting mainstream services used by AFVs, the NHS in England commissions a bespoke range-specific <i>'Priority'</i> NHS services such as those for mental health or for rehabilitation of veterans using prostheses. New interventions are continuing to be developed to improve AFVs' healthcare and are aligned to the NHS Long Term Plan and the restoration and recovery plans after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bacon, Martin, Swarbrick, Treadgold","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjmilitary-2020-001739","20210320","health policy; health services administration &amp; management; mental health; occupational &amp; industrial medicine; organisation of health services","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-21","",12250,""
"Stressors and coping strategies of migrant workers diagnosed with COVID-19 in Singapore: a qualitative study","The health, psychological and socioeconomic vulnerabilities of low-wage migrant workers have been magnified in the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in high-income receiving countries such as Singapore. We aimed to understand migrant worker concerns and coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic to address these during the crisis and inform on comprehensive support needed after the crisis. In-depth semi-structured interviews were carried out with migrant workers diagnosed with COVID-19. The participants were recruited from a COVID-19 mass quarantine facility in Singapore through a purposive sampling approach. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematic analysis performed to derive themes in their collective experience during the crisis. Three theme categories were derived from 27 interviews: migrant worker concerns during COVID-19, coping during COVID-19 and priorities after COVID-19. Major stressors in the crisis included the inability to continue providing for their families when work is disrupted, their susceptibility to infection in crowded dormitories, the shock of receiving the COVID-19 diagnosis while asymptomatic, as well as the isolating conditions of the quarantine environment. The workers coped by keeping in contact with their families, accessing healthcare, keeping updated with the news and continuing to practise their faith and religion. They looked forward to a return to normalcy after the crisis with keeping healthy and having access to healthcare as new priorities. We identified coping strategies employed by the workers in quarantine, many of which were made possible through the considered design of care and service delivery in mass quarantine facilities in Singapore. These can be adopted in the set-up of other mass quarantine facilities around the world to support the health and mental well-being of those quarantined. Our findings highlight the importance of targeted policy intervention for migrant workers, in areas such as housing and working environments, equitable access to healthcare, and social protection during and after this crisis.","Yee, Peh, Tan, Teo, Tan, Paul, Rangabashyam, Ramalingam, Chow, Tan","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-045949","20210320","COVID-19; mental health; public health; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-21","",12251,""
