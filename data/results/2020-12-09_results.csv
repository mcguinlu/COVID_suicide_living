"Smoking, distress and COVID-19 in England: cross-sectional population surveys from 2016 to 2020","Background: Changes in the prevalence of mental health problems among smokers due to the COVID-19 pandemic in England have important implications for existing health inequalities. This study examined the prevalence of psychological distress among smokers following the onset of the pandemic compared with previous years. Methods: Cross-sectional data were used from a representative survey of smokers (18+) in England (n = 2,927) during four months (April to July) in 2016, 2017 and 2020. Adjusted logistic regressions estimated the associations between past-month psychological distress across two time periods (2016/17 and 2020), and age. Weighted proportions, chi-squared statistics and stratified logistic regression models were used to compare the distributions of minimal, moderate and severe distress, respectively, within socio-demographic and smoking characteristic categories in 2016/17 and 2020. Results: The prevalence of moderate and severe distress among past-year smokers was higher in 2020 (moderate: 28.79%, 95%CI 26.11-31.60; OR=2.08, 95%CI 1.34-3.25; severe: 11.04%, 9.30-13.12; OR=2.16, 1.13-4.07) than in 2016/17 (moderate: 20.66%, 19.02-22.43; severe: 8.23%, 7.16-9.47). While there was no overall evidence of an interaction between time period and age, young (16-24 years) and middle-age groups (45-54 years) may have experienced greater increases in moderate and older age groups (65+ years) in severe distress from 2016/17 to 2020. There were also increases in 2020 of moderate distress among those from more disadvantaged social grades and of both moderate and severe distress among women and those with low cigarette addiction. Conclusions: Between April-July 2016/17 and April-July 2020 in England there were increases in both moderate and severe distress among smokers. The distribution of distress differed between 2016/17 and 2020 and represents a widening of established inequalities, with increases in distress among socio-economically disadvantaged groups, women and diverging age groups.","Loren Kock; Lion Shahab; Jamie Brown; Graham Moore; Marie Horton; Leonie Brose","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.07.20245514","20201209","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-09","",7924,""
"Stress-related emotional and behavioural impact following the first COVID-19 outbreak peak","Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses multiple psychologically-stressful challenges and is associated with increased risk for mental illness. Previous studies have mostly focused on the psychopathological symptoms associated with the outbreak peak. Methods: We examined the behavioural and mental health impact of the pandemic in Israel using an online survey. We collected 12,125 responses from 4,933 adult respondents during six weeks encompassing the end of the first outbreak and the beginning of the second. We used clinically validated instruments (Brief Symptom Inventory 18 (BSI-18), Perceived stress scale (PSS), Brief COPE inventory) to assess anxiety- and depression-related emotional distress, symptoms, and coping strategies, as well as questions designed to specifically assess COVID-19-related concerns. Results: Respondents indicated worrying more about the situation in their country and their close ones contracting the virus, than about their own health and financial situation. The reported distress correlates with the number of new COVID-19 cases and higher emotional burden was associated with being female, younger, unemployed, living in low socioeconomic status localities, encountering more people, and experiencing physiological symptoms. Unexpectedly, older age and having a prior medical condition were associated with reduced emotional distress. Conclusions: Our findings show that inequalities in mental-health burden associated with the COVID-19 pandemic are relevant also following the initial outbreak, and highlight the environmental context and its importance in understanding individual ability to cope with the long-term stressful challenges of the pandemic.","Asaf Benjamin; Yael Kuperman; Noa Eren; Maya Amitai; Hagai Rossman; Smadar Shilo; Tomer Meir; Ayya Keshet; Orit Nuttman-Shwartz; Eran Segal; Alon Chen","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.08.20245787","20201209","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-09","",7925,""
"A Selective Increase in OC Symptoms is Driving Information Seeking and Guideline Adherence During the Covid-19 Pandemic","Background: Increased mental health problems as a reaction to stressful life events, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, are common. Critically, successful adaptation helps reduce such symptoms to baseline, preventing long-term psychiatric disorders. It is thus important to understand whether and which psychiatric symptoms only show transient elevations, and which persist long-term and become chronically heightened. At particular risk for the latter trajectory are disorders with symptoms directly affected by the pandemic, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder. Methods: In this longitudinal large-scale study (N=416), we assessed how obsessive-compulsive (OC), anxiety, and depression symptoms changed throughout the course of the first pandemic wave in a sample of the general UK public. We further examined how these symptoms affected pandemic-related information seeking and adherence to governmental guidelines. Findings: All psychiatric domains were initially elevated, but showed distinct adaptation patterns. Depression scores decreased during the first pandemic wave, however, OC symptoms further increased, even after the end of lockdown. These OC symptoms were directly linked to Covid-related information seeking which gave rise to higher adherence to government guidelines. Interpretation: The rise and persistence of OC symptoms, despite the ease of Covid-19 restrictions, shows that OCD is disproportionally and chronically affected by the pandemic. This is particularly worrying with regards to the long-term impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on public mental health and indicates that patients with OCD may require particular treatment efforts.","Alisa Maria Loosen; Vasilisa Skvortsova; Tobias U.

"Prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh: a cross-sectional study","Objectives: In addition to risking their physical well-being, frontline physicians are enduring significant emotional burden both at work and home during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to investigate the levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms and to identify associated factors among Bangladeshi physicians during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods and design: A cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted between April 21 and May 10, 2020. Outcomes assessed included demographic questions, COVID-19 related questions, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results: The survey was completed by 412 Bangladeshi physicians. The findings revealed that, in terms of standardized HADS cut-off points, the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among physicians was 67.72% and 48.5% respectively. Risk factors for higher rates of anxiety or depressive symptoms were: being female, physicians who had experienced COVID-19 like symptoms during the pandemic, those who had not received incentives, those who used self-funded PPE, not received adequate training, lacking perceived self-efficacy to manage COVID -19 positive patients, greater perceived stress of being infected, fear of getting assaulted/humiliated, being more connected with social media, having lower income levels to support the family, feeling more agitated, less than 2 hours of leisure activity per day and short sleep duration. All these factors were found to be positively associated with anxiety and depression in unadjusted and adjusted statistical models. Conclusions: This study identifies a real concern about the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among Bangladeshi physicians and identifies several associated factors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the vulnerability of the physicians in this extraordinary period whilst they are putting their own lives at risk to help people infected by COVID-19, health authorities should address the psychological needs of medical staff and formulate effective strategies to support vital frontline health workers.","M Tasdik Hasan; Sahadat Hossain; Farhana Safa; Afifa Anjum; Abid Hasan Khan; Kamrun Nahar Koly; Syeda Fatema Alam; Md.

"Why Public Health Framing Matters: An Experimental Study of the Effects of COVID-19 Framing on Prejudice and Xenophobia in the United States","The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a notable increase in the expression of prejudicial and xenophobic attitudes that threaten the wellbeing of minority groups and contribute to the overall public health toll of the virus  However, while there is evidence documenting the growth in discrimination and xenophobia, little is known about how the COVID-19 outbreak is activating the expression of such negative attitudes  The goal of the current paper therefore was to investigate what aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic may be contributing to this rise in expressions of prejudice and xenophobia  More specifically, this study used an experimental design to assess the effects of using stigmatized language to describe the virus as well as the threat to physical health and economic wellbeing posed by the virus on COVID-19 prejudice  Data were collected from a national sample of 1,451 adults residing within the United States  Results from 2 x 2 x 2 between-subjects analyses of covariance demonstrated that emphasizing the connection between China and COVID-19, rather than framing the virus neutrally, increased negative attitudes toward Asian Americans, beliefs that resources should be prioritized for Americans rather than immigrants, and general xenophobia  Emphasizing the severity of the economic impact of the virus also increased beliefs that Asian Americans are a threat to resources and general xenophobia  By contrast, messages which emphasized the serious health risks of COVID-19 did not increase racism or xenophobia  Our findings suggest that specific types of public health messaging related to infectious diseases, especially framing the virus in terms of its country of origin or its likely economic impact, may elicit prejudice and xenophobia  Public health campaigns that emphasize the severity of the virus, however, are not likely to trigger the same negative attitudes  Implications for public health responses to health crises are discussed","Dhanani, Lindsay Y.; Franz, Berkeley","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113572","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Social Science & Medicine;: 113572, 2020.; Publication details: Social Science & Medicine;: 113572, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-09","",7929,""
"Changes in sleep timing and subjective sleep quality during the COVID-19 lockdown in Italy and Belgium: age, gender and working status as modulating factors","Italy and Belgium have been among the first western countries to face the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emergency, imposing a total lockdown over the entire national territories  These limitations have proven effective in slowing down the spread of the infection  However, the benefits obtained in public health have come with huge costs in terms of social, economic, and psychological well-being  In the current study, we aimed at investigating how the period of home confinement affected self-reported sleep characteristics in Italians and Belgians, with special regard to sleep timing and subjective quality  Using an online survey we collected data from 2272 participants, 1622 Italians (Mage=34 1Â±13 6 years, 1171 F), and 650 Belgian (Mage=43 0Â±16 8 years, 509 F)  Participants reported their sleep pattern (e g , bedtime, risetime) and perceived sleep quality during and, retrospectively, before the lockdown  During the lockdown, sleep timing was significantly delayed, time spent in bed increased, and sleep quality was markedly impaired in both Italians and Belgians  The most vulnerable individuals appeared to be women, subjects experiencing a more negative mood, and those perceiving the pandemic situation as highly stressful  However, the two samples differed in the subgroups most affected by the changes, possibly because of the different welfare systems of the two countries  In fact, in the Italian sample sleep quality and timing underwent significant modifications especially in unemployed participants, whereas in the Belgian sample this category was the one who suffered less from the restrictions  Considering that the novel coronavirus has spread across the whole globe, involving countries with different types of health and welfare systems, understanding which policy measures have the most effective protecting role on physical and mental health is of primary importance","Cellini, Nicola, Conte, Francesca, De Rosa, Oreste, Giganti, Fiorenza, Malloggi, Serena, Reyt, Mathilde, Guillemin, Camille, Schmidt, Christina, Muto, Vincenzo, Ficca, Gianluca","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.11.027","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Sleep Medicine;2020.; Publication details: Sleep Medicine;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-09","",7930,""

It is critical to understand the mental and physical health of adolescent athletes during this time. To describe the health of athletes during COVID-19-related school closures and sport cancellations. Cross-sectional study. A national sample recruited via social media. A total of 13Ã¢â‚¬Å 002 US adolescent athletes (age = 16.3 Ã‚Â± 1.2 years, females = 52.9%, males = 47.0%) completed an anonymous online survey. Demographic information collected was sex, grade, sport(s) played, and zip code. Assessments used were the General Anxiety Disorder 7-Item for anxiety, Patient Health Questionnaire 9-Item for depression, the Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale for physical activity, and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 for quality of life. Mental health, physical activity, and health-related quality-of-life variables were compared among sex, grade, sport(s) played, and poverty level using means and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from the survey-weighted analysis of variance. Females reported a higher prevalence of moderate to severe anxiety symptoms (females = 43.7% versus males = 28.2%). The Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale score was highest (best) for grade 9 (mean = 14.5, 95% CI = 14.0, 15.0) and lowest for grade 11 (mean = 10.9, 95% CI = 10.5, 11.3. The prevalence of depression symptoms was highest in team sport (74.1%) and lowest in individual sport (64.9%) participants. The total Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory score was lowest (worst) for athletes from counties with the highest poverty levels (high: mean = 74.5, 95% CI = 73.7, 75.3; middle: mean = 78.9, 95% CI = 78.0, 79.8; and low: mean = 78.3, 95% CI = 77.4, 79.1). The health of US adolescents during the COVID-19-related school closures and sport cancellations varied to differing degrees depending on sex, grade level, type of sport participation, and level of poverty.

"Force Fellow - Mental health and burnout syndrome among postgraduate students in medical and multidisciplinary residencies during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil: Protocol for a prospective cohort study","The COVID-19 pandemic imposes a high degree of physical, psychological and social stress on health professionals, including postgraduate students in medical and multidisciplinary residencies. This stress is associated with the intense fear of occupational exposure to the virus. These professionals are at risk of becoming physically and mentally ill not only due to the infection but also due to prolonged exposure to multidimensional stress and continued work overload. This study aims to evaluate the prevalence of symptoms that indicate mental disorders and burnout syndrome, as well as to determine risk factors for burnout among postgraduate students in medical and multidisciplinary residencies in Brazil during the COVID-19 pandemic. This will be a prospective cohort study with parallel groups. Recruitment will take place from July to August/2020. The sample size will be of, at least, 1.144 participants. The research instruments that will be used are the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Brief Resilient Coping Scale and the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI).Two waves of data collection will occur: the first wave will included data related to sample characterization and psychosocial evaluation; the final wave will occur 12 weeks later and will include an evaluation of the incidence of burnout as well as correlations with the potential predictive factors collected in the first wave. Additionally, data regarding work withdrawal will be collected. The project has data collection in progress. Recruitment started on July 29, 2020. Analysis of the results will begin after the initial inclusion of all participants. By evaluating the prevalence of symptoms suggestive of mental disorders and burnout among postgraduate students of medical and multidisciplinary residencies in Brazil, we aim to understand the impact of dealing with this pandemic and contribute to planning measures that can alleviate this problem.

"Online Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (e-CBT) program tailored to address mental health problems in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic - Protocol","The significant rise of mental health challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic has had crushing effects on the public health sector and economy. In order to meet this overwhelming and growing demand for mental health care, we must employ innovative approaches to significantly expand the capacity of mental healthcare delivery. While it is not feasible to increase the number of mental health care providers or the number of hours they work in the short term, improving their time efficiency may be a viable solution. Virtual and digital delivery of psychotherapy, which is shown to be efficient and clinically effective, might be a good candidate to address this growing demand. The goal of this research protocol is to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of treating mental health issues started or aggravated by the stressors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic using an online, digital and asynchronous model of care. This non-randomized control trial intervention will be delivered through the Online Psychotherapy Tool (OPTT), a secure, cloud-based, digital mental health platform. Participants will be offered a 9-week online cognitive behavioural therapy (e-CBT) program tailored to address mental health problems in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This program will involve weekly self-guided educational material, providing an overview of behavioral skills, and completing related weekly homework. Participants (n = 80) will receive personalized feedback and weekly interaction with a therapist throughout the course of the program. The efficacy of the program will be evaluated using clinically validated symptomology questionnaires completed by participants at baseline, week 5 and post-treatment. Inclusion criteria includes the capacity to consent, a primary diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder and/or major depressive disorder with symptoms that have started or gotten worse during the COVID-19 pandemic, the ability to speak and read English, and having consistent and reliable access to the Internet. Exclusion criteria includes active psychosis, acute mania, severe alcohol or substance use disorder, and/or active suicidal or homicidal ideation. The study received funding in May 2020. Ethics approval was received in June 2020, and the recruitment of participants began in June 2020. Participant recruitment is being conducted via social media, web-based communities, and physician referrals. To date, 58 participants have been recruited (35 in the intervention group and 23 in the control group). Data collection is expected to conclude by the end of 2020, and analyses are expected to be completed by February 2021 with linear regression analysis (for continuous outcomes) and binomial regression analysis (for categorical outcomes) being conducted. If proven feasible, this method of care delivery could increase care capacity by up to four-folds. The findings from this project have the potential to influence clinical practices and policies, and to increase accessibility to care during the COVID-19 pandemic, without sacrificing the quality of care.

"Practice-level variation in telemedicine use in a pediatric primary care network during COVID-19","Telehealth, the delivery of health care through telecommunication technology, has the potential to address multiple health system concerns. Despite this potential, only 15% of pediatric primary care clinicians reported using telemedicine as of 2016, with the majority identifying inadequate payment for these services as the largest barrier. The COVID-19 pandemic led to rapid changes in payment and regulations surrounding telehealth, allowing for integration into primary care pediatrics. Due to limited use of telemedicine in primary care pediatrics prior to COVID-19, much is unknown about the role of telemedicine in pediatric primary care. To address this gap in knowledge, we examined the association between practice-level telemedicine use within a large pediatric primary care network and practice characteristics, telemedicine visit diagnoses, in-person visit volume, child-level variation in telemedicine use and clinician attitudes towards telemedicine. We analyzed electronic health record data from 45 primary care practices and administered a clinician survey to practice clinicians. Practices were stratified into tertiles based on rates of telemedicine use (low, intermediate, high) per 1000 patients per week during a two-week period (4/19-5/2/2020). By practice tertile, we compared (1) practice characteristics, (2) telemedicine visit diagnoses, (3) in-person visit rates to office, urgent care and emergency department, (4) child-level variation in telemedicine use and (5) clinician attitudes towards telemedicine across these practices. Across pediatric primary care practices, telemedicine visit rates ranged from 5 to 23 telemedicine visits per 1000 patients per week. Across all tertiles, the most frequent telemedicine visit diagnoses were mental health (28-36% of visits) and dermatologic (15-28%). Compared to low telemedicine use practices, high telemedicine use practices had fewer in-person office visits (10 vs. 16 visits per 1000 patients per week, P=0.005), but overall more total encounters (in-office and telemedicine: 28 vs. 22 visits per 1000 patients per week, P=0.006). Telemedicine use varied with child age, race and ethnicity, and recent preventive care, but no significant interactions existed between these characteristics and practice-level telemedicine use. Finally, clinician attitudes regarding the usability and impact of telemedicine did not vary significantly across tertiles. Across a network of pediatric practices, we identified significant practice-level variation in telemedicine use, with increased use associated with more varied telemedicine diagnoses, fewer in-person office visits, and increased overall primary care encounter volume. Thus in the context of the pandemic when underutilization of primary care was prevalent, higher practice-level telemedicine use supported pediatric primary care encounter volume closer to usual rates. Child-level telemedicine use differed by child age, race/ethnicity, and recent preventive care, building upon prior concerns about differences in access to telemedicine. However, increased practice-level use of telemedicine services was not associated with reduced nor worsened differences in utilization, suggesting further work is needed to promote equitable access to primary care telemedicine.","Schweiberger, Hoberman, Iagnemma, Schoemer, Squire, Taormina, Wolfson, Ray","https://doi.org/10.2196/24345","20201208","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-09","",7964,""
"Social Media Use and Monitoring for Adolescents With Depression and Implications for the COVID-19 Pandemic: Qualitative Study of Parent and Child Perspectives","Although youth report many positive experiences with social media (SM) use in their daily lives, adolescents with depression are more vulnerable to the risks of SM use than adolescents without depression. Parents protect adolescents with depression from the risks of SM use by monitoring their child's SM activity; however, this comes into conflict with the adolescent's need for autonomy in their web-based communication. The implications of SM use and monitoring for adolescents with depression and their parents are of particular relevance to the COVID-19 pandemic, as rates of SM use have increased in response to physical distancing measures. This study aims to explore parent and child perspectives regarding the use and function of SM in the daily lives of adolescents with depression and parents' perceptions of and experience with monitoring their child's SM use. We conducted qualitative interviews with adolescents with depression (n=23) and one parent of each adolescent (n=23) between July 2013 and September 2014. The adolescents were patients seeking treatment for depression in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Data analysis included dyadic analysis of the adolescents' and parents' perspectives and qualitative descriptions of individual parent interviews to explore their experiences with SM use and monitoring. The construct of parental knowledge and factors hypothesized to contribute to parental knowledge, including adolescent disclosure, parental solicitation, and parental control, were used to guide the codebook and dyadic data analysis. Dyadic analyses showed that parents and their children disagreed on the use and function of SM in the daily lives of adolescents with depression, with adolescents viewing SM as a forum for honest expression of their emotions, whereas parents felt that their children's posts were inconsequential and interfered with the adolescents' lives. Furthermore, parents reported using a wide range of strategies to gain knowledge of their child's SM use to monitor their safety on SM, including direct solicitation and indirect solicitation, such as keeping the child's passwords, asking friends or siblings about their child's SM use, and restricting SM behavior and access to devices. Clinicians should support adolescents with depression and their parents in finding common ground for an effective and acceptable monitoring approach. Resources are provided for clinicians navigating conversations about SM use and monitoring with adolescents with depression and their parents during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Biernesser, Montano, Miller, Radovic","https://doi.org/10.2196/21644","20201208","COVID-19; adolescent; depression; disclosure; parents; qualitative research; social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-09","",7965,""

"Preparing for the Behavioral Health Impact of COVID-19 in Michigan","As a global pandemic, COVID-19 has profoundly disrupted the lives of individuals, families, communities, and nations. This report summarizes the expected impact of COVID-19 on behavioral health, as well as strategies to address mental health needs during the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath. The state of Michigan in the USA is used to illustrate the complexity of the mental health issues and the critical gaps in the behavioral health infrastructure as they pertain to COVID-19. Scoping review was conducted to identify potential mental health needs and issues during the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath. The ramifications of COVID-19 on mental health are extensive, with the potential to negatively impact diverse populations including healthcare providers, children and adolescents, older adults, the LGBTQ community, and individuals with pre-existing mental illness. Suicide rates, alone, are expected to rise for Michiganders due to the economic downturn, isolation and quarantine, increased substance use, insomnia, and increased access to guns associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. This report promotes awareness of a behavioral health crisis due to COVID-19. Increasing access to behavioral health care should minimize COVID-19's negative influence on mental health in Michigan. We propose a three-prong approach to access: awareness, affordability, and technology. Addressing workforce development and fixing gaps in critical behavioral health infrastructure will also be essential. These actions need to be implemented immediately to prepare for the expected &quot;surge&quot; of behavioral health needs in the ensuing months.","Edwards, Janney, Mancuso, Rollings, VanDenToorn, DeYoung, Halstead, Eastburg","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-020-01210-y","20201208","COVID-19; Mental health; SARS; Substance use; Suicide; Telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-09","",7967,""

"Defining the features and duration of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with disease severity and outcome","SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, particularly those preventing viral spike receptor binding domain (RBD) interaction with host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, can neutralize the virus. It is, however, unknown which features of the serological response may affect clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients. We analyzed 983 longitudinal plasma samples from 79 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 175 SARS-CoV-2-infected outpatients and asymptomatic individuals. Within this cohort, 25 patients died of their illness. Higher ratios of IgG antibodies targeting S1 or RBD domains of spike compared to nucleocapsid antigen were seen in outpatients who had mild illness versus severely ill patients. Plasma antibody increases correlated with decreases in viral RNAemia, but antibody responses in acute illness were insufficient to predict inpatient outcomes. Pseudovirus neutralization assays and a scalable ELISA measuring antibodies blocking RBD-ACE2 interaction were well correlated with patient IgG titers to RBD. Outpatient and asymptomatic individuals' SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, including IgG, progressively decreased during observation up to five months post-infection.","RÃƒÂ¶ltgen, Powell, Wirz, Stevens, Hogan, Najeeb, Hunter, Wang, Sahoo, Huang, Yamamoto, Manohar, Manalac, Otrelo-Cardoso, Pham, Rustagi, Rogers, Shah, Blish, Cochran, Jardetzky, Zehnder, Wang, Narasimhan, Gombar, Tibshirani, Nadeau, Kim, Pinsky, Boyd","https://doi.org/10.1126/sciimmunol.abe0240","20201208","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-09","",7969,""

This study presents overall levels of perceived stress and general anxiety symptoms and inequalities across each of these outcomes by gender, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, and household income. We also explore potential explanations for these health issues by analyzing baseline qualitative data. All students, on average, were suffering from perceived stress and anxiety, with especially high levels in April. We also identified inequalities in college student mental well-being, particularly by gender identity and sexual orientation. Women reported worse well-being compared with men; transgender and gender diverse and sexual minority youths reported worse outcomes than their cisgender, heterosexual peers at both time points. Qualitative data illustrate how the COVID-19 pandemic has generated educational, economic, and environmental stressors that are affecting college students' well-being. As colleges and universities think about how to manage and mitigate the infectious disease dimensions of COVID-19 among their student populations, they must also consider who is most at risk for increased stress and anxiety during the pandemic.","Hoyt, Cohen, Dull, Maker Castro, Yazdani","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.10.030","20201208","Adolescents; Anxiety; COVID-19; Health equity; Mental health; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-09","",7970,""
"Burnout among Portuguese healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","During COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers (HCWs) have had high workload and have been exposed to multiple psychosocial stressors. The aim of this study was to evaluate HCWs in terms of the relative contributions of socio-demographic and mental health variables on three burnout dimensions: personal, work-related, and client-related burnout. A cross-sectional study was performed using an online questionnaire spread via social networks. A snowball technique supported by health care institutions and professional organizations was applied. A total of 2008 subjects completed the survey. Gender, parental status, marriage status, and salary reduction were found to be significant factors for personal burnout. Health problems and direct contact with infected people were significantly associated with more susceptibility to high personal and work-related burnout. Frontline working positions were associated with all three dimensions. Higher levels of stress and depression in HCWs were significantly associated with increased levels of all burnout dimensions. Higher levels of satisfaction with life and resilience were significantly associated with lower levels of all burnout dimensions. All three burnout dimensions were associated with a specific set of covariates. Consideration of these three dimensions is important when designing future burnout prevention programs for HCWs.","Duarte, Teixeira, Castro, Marina, Ribeiro, JÃƒÂ¡come, Martins, Ribeiro-Vaz, Pinheiro, Silva, Ricou, Sousa, Alves, Oliveira, Silva, Nunes, SerrÃƒÂ£o","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-09980-z","20201208","Burnout; Stress; COVID-19; Depression; Healthcare workers; Life satisfaction; Resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-09","",7971,""

Trusting on media, health authorities, and cooperation with policy makers, as well as having uncertainty on information about Coronavirus pandemic were also shown to be associated with poor mental health condition (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). The present study revealed that the number of those people with suspected poor mental health in Fars province significantly increased compared to a previous study using the same questionnaire. Furthermore, the participants who had less trust in media and policymakers were more prone to mental health problems. Therefore, it can be concluded that supporting people in these life-threatening pandemic crises is of great importance, so the policy makers and media must present reliable and valid information to people as soon as possible.","Mani, Estedlal, Kamali, Ghaemi, Zarei, Shokrpour, Heydari, Lankarani","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-09928-3","20201208","COVID-19; Iran; Mental health; Trust","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-09","",7972,""
"Socio-economic inequalities in social network, loneliness and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","During the COVID-19 pandemic, a focus on isolation and loneliness is important, especially as social distancing policies (which for some groups involve self-isolation or quarantine) are likely to accentuate these experiences and affect mental health. This study focuses on socio-economic inequalities in social network, loneliness and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Two-hundred and fourteen residents of Wandsworth, a South West London Borough in the United Kingdom completed an online cross-sectional survey on the impact of COVID-19 on mental health. Data were analysed using independent samples <i>t</i>-tests and multiple regression. Middle-aged people reported a less strong social network and more loneliness, anxiety and depression than younger people. People with a long-term health condition reported a less strong social network, more loneliness, more general practitioner (GP) and hospital visits, and poorer mental health than those with no long-term health conditions. People receiving State financial benefits reported less use of public spaces, a less strong social network, more loneliness, more GP and hospital visits and poorer mental health than those not receiving benefits. Greater neighbourhood identification was associated with a stronger social network and better mental health outcomes. Multiple regression analyses showed that, over and above loneliness, perceived personal risk of COVID-19 constitutes an additional precipitant for both depression and anxiety when controlling for other variables. As a novel stressor associated with the pandemic, the situational and involuntary perception of being at risk of COVID-19 may be stimulating anxiety and depressive symptomatology, which will need to be managed effectively as resurgences of the disease are predicted and communicated to the general public under growing mistrust and uncertainty.","Jaspal, Breakwell","https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020976694","20201208","Health inequalities; anxiety; depression; mistrust; neighbourhood identification; perceived risk of COVID","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-09","",7973,""

A total of 615 questionnaires were distributed and collected, and 615 were valid, with an effective recovery rate of 100%. <b>Results:</b> The detection rates of psychological stress and anxiety of medical staff were 13.82% (85/615) and 25.37% (156/615) , respectively. 31-40 years old and working in key departments were risk factors for psychological stress of medical staff (<i>OR</i>=1.779, 2.127) ; Women, frequently washing hands with soap/hand sanitizer/disinfectant were protective factors for psychological stress (<i>OR</i>=0.520, 0.528) . Medical staff working in designated hospitals and key departments were more likely to have anxiety (<i>OR</i>=2.042, 2.702) ; The high fit of the mask to the face and bridge of the nose was a protective factor for the psychological anxiety of medical staff (<i>OR</i>=0.500) . <b>Conclusion:</b> Medical staff show higher stress and anxiety during the epidemic of COVID-19. Psychological intervention should be carried out early, focusing on men, age 31 to 40, medical staff working in designated hospitals and key departments. <b>Ã§â€ºÂ®Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¯Â¼Å¡</b> Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¨Â§Â£Ã¦â€“Â°Ã¥Å¾â€¹Ã¥â€ Â Ã§Å Â¶Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦Â¯â€™Ã¨â€šÂºÃ§â€šÅ½Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¥Å Â¡Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã§Å Â¶Ã¥â€ ÂµÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ¨Â¿â€ºÃ¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¦Â­Â¥Ã¥Â¼â‚¬Ã¥Â±â€¢Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¥Å Â¡Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥Â¹Â²Ã©Â¢â€žÃ£â‚¬ÂÃ§Â¡Â®Ã¤Â¿ÂÃ¥Å’Â»Ã¥Å Â¡Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã¦ÂÂÃ¤Â¾â€ºÃ¥Ââ€šÃ¨â‚¬Æ’Ã¥â€™Å’Ã§Â§â€˜Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã¤Â¾ÂÃ¦ÂÂ®Ã£â‚¬â€š <b>Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â³â€¢Ã¯Â¼Å¡</b> Ã¤ÂºÅ½2020Ã¥Â¹Â´2Ã¦Å“Ë†4Ã¨â€¡Â³16Ã¦â€”Â¥Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã©â€¡â€¡Ã§â€Â¨Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¤Â¾Â¿Ã¦Å Â½Ã¦Â Â·Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â³â€¢Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Âºâ€Ã§â€Â¨Ã£â‚¬Å Ã¦Å â€˜Ã©Æ’Â-Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜-Ã¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¡Â¨Ã£â‚¬â€¹Ã¯Â¼Ë†DASS-21Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã§Å¡â€žÃ£â‚¬Å Ã¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€º-Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¤ÂºÅ¡Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¡Â¨Ã£â‚¬â€¹Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã©â‚¬Å¡Ã¨Â¿â€¡Ã©â€”Â®Ã¥ÂÂ·Ã¦ËœÅ¸Ã¨Â°Æ’Ã¦Å¸Â¥615Ã¥ÂÂÃ¥Å’Â»Ã¥Å Â¡Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã§Å Â¶Ã¥â€ ÂµÃ£â‚¬â€šÃ¥â€¦Â±Ã¥Ââ€˜Ã¦â€Â¾Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¥â€ºÅ¾Ã¦â€Â¶615Ã¤Â»Â½Ã©â€”Â®Ã¥ÂÂ·Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¦â€¢Ë†Ã©â€”Â®Ã¥ÂÂ·615Ã¤Â»Â½Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¦â€¢Ë†Ã¥â€ºÅ¾Ã¦â€Â¶Ã§Å½â€¡100%Ã£â‚¬â€š <b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã¯Â¼Å¡</b> Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¥Å Â¡Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¥â€™Å’Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã§Â»ÂªÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¦Â£â‚¬Ã¥â€¡ÂºÃ§Å½â€¡Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¥Ë†Â«Ã¤Â¸Âº13.82%Ã¯Â¼Ë†85/615Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¥ÂÅ 25.37%Ã¯Â¼Ë†156/615Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã£â‚¬â€š31~40Ã¥Â²ÂÃ¥Â¹Â´Ã©Â¾â€žÃ¦Â®ÂµÃ£â‚¬ÂÃ¥Â·Â¥Ã¤Â½Å“Ã¤ÂºÅ½Ã©â€¡ÂÃ§â€šÂ¹Ã§Â§â€˜Ã¥Â®Â¤Ã¦ËœÂ¯Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¥Å Â¡Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¥ÂÂ±Ã©â„¢Â©Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â Ã¯Â¼Ë†<i>OR</i>=1.779Ã£â‚¬Â2.127Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¯Â¼â€ºÃ¥Â¥Â³Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ§Â»ÂÃ¥Â¸Â¸Ã§â€Â¨Ã¨â€šÂ¥Ã§Å¡â€š/Ã¦Â´â€”Ã¦â€°â€¹Ã¦Â¶Â²/Ã¦Â¶Ë†Ã¦Â¯â€™Ã¦Â¶Â²Ã¦Â´â€”Ã¦â€°â€¹Ã¦ËœÂ¯Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¿ÂÃ¦Å Â¤Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â Ã¯Â¼Ë†<i>OR</i>=0.520Ã£â‚¬Â0.528Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Å’Â»Ã¥Å Â¡Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¥Â·Â¥Ã¤Â½Å“Ã¤ÂºÅ½Ã¥Â®Å¡Ã§â€šÂ¹Ã¦â€¢â€˜Ã¦Â²Â»Ã¥Å’Â»Ã©â„¢Â¢Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ©â€¡ÂÃ§â€šÂ¹Ã§Â§â€˜Ã¥Â®Â¤Ã¦â€ºÂ´Ã¥Â®Â¹Ã¦Ëœâ€œÃ¤ÂºÂ§Ã§â€Å¸Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¯Â¼Ë†<i>OR</i>=2.042Ã£â‚¬Â2.702Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¯Â¼â€ºÃ¥ÂÂ£Ã§Â½Â©Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã©ÂÂ¢Ã©Æ’Â¨Ã¥ÂÅ Ã©Â¼Â»Ã¦Â¢ÂÃ¨Â´Â´Ã¥ÂË†Ã©Â«ËœÃ¦ËœÂ¯Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¥Å Â¡Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¿ÂÃ¦Å Â¤Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â Ã¯Â¼Ë†<i>OR</i>=0.500Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã£â‚¬â€š <b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¨Â®ÂºÃ¯Â¼Å¡</b> Ã¦â€“Â°Ã¥Å¾â€¹Ã¥â€ Â Ã§Å Â¶Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦Â¯â€™Ã¨â€šÂºÃ§â€šÅ½Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã©ËœÂ²Ã¦Å½Â§Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¥Å Â¡Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¨Â¡Â¨Ã§Å½Â°Ã¨Â¾Æ’Ã©Â«ËœÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¥ÂÅ Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¦â€”Â©Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¥Å Â¡Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¨Â¿â€ºÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥Â¹Â²Ã©Â¢â€žÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã©â€¡ÂÃ§â€šÂ¹Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¦Â³Â¨Ã§â€Â·Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã£â‚¬Â31~40Ã¥Â²ÂÃ¥Â¹Â´Ã©Â¾â€žÃ¦Â®ÂµÃ£â‚¬ÂÃ¥Â·Â¥Ã¤Â½Å“Ã¤ÂºÅ½Ã¥Â®Å¡Ã§â€šÂ¹Ã¦â€¢â€˜Ã¦Â²Â»Ã¥Å’Â»Ã©â„¢Â¢Ã¥ÂÅ Ã©â€¡ÂÃ§â€šÂ¹Ã§Â§â€˜Ã¥Â®Â¤Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Å’Â»Ã¥Å Â¡Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ£â‚¬â€š.","Huang, Zhang, He, Ye, Lin, Ou, Li","https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn121094-20200324-00153","20201208","COVID-19; Medical staff; Mental health; Novel coronavirus","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-09","",7974,""
"South Korean Nurses' Experiences with Patient Care at a COVID-19-Designated Hospital: Growth after the Frontline Battle against an Infectious Disease Pandemic","COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that quickly spread worldwide, resulting in a global pandemic. Healthcare professionals coming into close contact with COVID-19 patients experience mental health issues, including stress, depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and burnout. This study aimed to explore the experiences of COVID-19-designated hospital nurses in South Korea who provided care for patients based on their lived experiences. Eighteen nurses working in a COVID-19-designated hospital completed in-depth individual telephone interviews between July and September 2020, and the data were analyzed using Giorgi's phenomenological methodology. The essential structure of the phenomenon was growth after the frontline battle against an infectious disease pandemic. Nine themes were identified: Pushed onto the Battlefield Without Any Preparation, Struggling on the Frontline, Altered Daily Life, Low Morale, Unexpectedly Long War, Ambivalence Toward Patients, Forces that Keep Me Going, Giving Meaning to My Work, and Taking Another Step in One's Growth. The nurses who cared for patients with COVID-19 had both negative and positive experiences, including post-traumatic growth. These findings could be used as basic data for establishing hospital systems and policies to support frontline nurses coping with infectious disease control to increase their adaption and positive experiences.","Lee, Lee","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17239015","20201208","COVID-19; nursing care; occupational stress; pandemics; post-traumatic growth; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-09","",7975,""
"The effect of Tai Chi on the quality of life in the elderly patients recovering from coronavirus disease 2019: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis","coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading fast starting late 2019. As their cardiopulmonary and immune functions gradually decline, elderly people are prone to COVID-19. Tai Chi has a positive impact on heart function, blood pressure, lung function, blood circulation, and so on, and it's suitable for the elderly. Quality of life (QoL)can reflect of individuals' physical and mental health, it can also reflects their ability to participate in society. This systematic review and meta-analysis will summarize the current evidence that Tai Chi improve the QoL in the elderly patients recovering from COVID-19. We will search PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database, Wanfang Database, Clinical Trials and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry. The complete process will include study selection, data extraction, risk of bias assessment and meta-analyses. Endnote X9.3 will be used to manage data screening. The statistical analysis will be completed by Stata/SE 15.1 software. This proposed study will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Tai Chi for the improvement of QoL in elderly COVID-19 patients during the recovery period. The conclusion of this study will provide evidence to prove the safety and effectiveness of Tai Chi on elderly COVID-19 patients during the recovery period. This protocol will not evaluate individual patient information or infringe patient rights and therefore does not require ethical approval.

"A rapid review of the impact of quarantine and restricted environments on children's play and the role of play in children's health","Amidst the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there is uncertainty regarding potential lasting impacts on children's health and educational outcomes. Play, a fundamental part of childhood, may be integral to children's health during crises. We undertook a rapid review of the impact of quarantine, isolation and other restrictive environments on play and whether play mitigates adverse effects of such restrictions. Fifteen peer-reviewed studies were identified, spanning hospitals, juvenile and immigration detention and refugee camps. We found evidence of changes in children's access to play in crises and quarantine. These studies indicated how play might support children enduring isolation but lacked robust investigations of play as an intervention in mitigating impacts of restriction. Studies pertaining to children in isolation due to infectious disease outbreaks were notably absent. It is important that the potential effects of changes to such a crucial aspect of childhood are better understood to support children in this and future crises.","Graber, Byrne, Goodacre, Kirby, Kulkarni, O'Farrelly, Ramchandani","https://doi.org/10.1111/cch.12832","20201208","children; disease outbreak; isolation; mental health; play; restriction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-09","",7977,""
