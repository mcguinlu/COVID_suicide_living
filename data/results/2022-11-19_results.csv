"The CANDID Study: impact of COVID-19 on critical care nurses and organisational outcomes: implications for the delivery of critical care services A questionnaire study before and during the pandemic","Objective To use a model of occupational stress to quantify and explain the impact of working in critical care during the Covid-19 pandemic on critical care nurses and organisational outcomes. Participants Critical care nurses (CCNs) who worked in the UK NHS between January to November 2021 (n=461). Methods A self-reported survey measured the components of the Job-Demand Reward model of occupational stress. Job-demands, job-resources, health impairment (mental health (GHQ-12), burnout (MBI), PTSD symptoms (PCL-5)), work engagement and six organisational outcomes (commitment, job satisfaction, changing jobs, certainty about the future, quality of care, patient safety) were measured. Data were compared to baseline data (n=557) collected between April to October 2018. Regression analyses identified predictors of health impairment, work engagement and organisational outcomes. Findings Compared to 2018, CCNs were at elevated risk of probable psychological distress (GHQ-12, OR 6.03 [95% C.I. 4.75 to 7.95]; burnout emotional exhaustion, OR 4.02 [3.07 to 5.26]; burnout depersonalisation, OR 3.18 [1.99 to 5.07]; burnout accomplishment, OR 1.53 [1.18 to 1.97]). A third of CCNs reported probable PTSD. Job demands predicted psychological distress and job demands increased during the pandemic. Resources reduced the negative impact of job demands on psychological distress, but this moderating effect of resources was not observed at higher levels of demand. CCNs were less engaged in their work. Job and personal resources predicted work engagement and were reduced during the pandemic. All six organisational outcomes were impaired. Lack of resources, especially reduced learning opportunities, lack of focus on staff wellbeing, and reduced focus on quality predicted worse organisational outcomes. Conclusions The NHS needs to prioritise the welfare of CCNs, implement workplace change/planning, and support them to recover from the pandemic. The NHS is struggling to retain CCNs and, unless staff welfare is improved, quality of care and patient safety will likely decline.","Louise McCallum; Janice Rattray; Beth Pollard; Jordan Millar; Alastair Hull; Pam Ramsay; Lisa Salisbury; Teresa Scott; Stephen Cole; Diane Dixon","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.11.16.22282346","20221118","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41188,""
"Did financial interventions offset the impact of financial adversity on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic? A longitudinal analysis of the UCL COVID-19 Social Study","Background It remains unclear whether financial support interventions (e.g., furlough, mortgage freezes, foodbanks, Universal Credit) provide protection against the negative impact of financial adversity on mental health. Methods Data were from adults who took part in the UCL COVID -19 Social Study between 1 April 2020 and 4 April 2022 who had variability over time in depression (N = 27,297) and anxiety symptoms (N = 26,452). Fixed-effects Poisson regressions examined the associations between an index of financial adversity (e.g., job or income loss) with depression and anxiety symptoms and controlled for other adversities and loneliness. Interaction terms between financial adversity and having used i) any, ii) charity based, iii) government based, iv) work based, and v) other forms of financial supports were examined. Results Experiencing financial adversity had a negative impact on mental health. Only charity based support (e.g., foodbanks) consistently attenuated the impact of financial adversity on mental health, whilst work based support exacerbated the impact. Government based support only attenuated the impact of facing limited financial adversity on depression symptoms. Conclusion Findings suggest that most financial interventions are insufficient for alleviating mental health difficulties resulting from financial adversity.","Elise Paul; Daisy Fancourt","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.11.15.22282337","20221118","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41189,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and adolescents: determinants and association with quality of life and mental health - A cross-sectional study","Background The medium-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the wellbeing of children and adolescents remains unclear. More than two years into the pandemic, we aimed to quantify the frequency and determinants of having been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and estimate its impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and mental health. Methods Data was drawn from a population-based cohort of children and adolescents, recruited between December 2021 and June 2022, in Geneva, Switzerland. We measured the impact of the pandemic via the Coronavirus impact scale, which assesses the multidimensional impact of the pandemic at the child and family level through parent's report. A score higher than one standard deviation above the mean was deemed a severe impact. Parents additionally reported about their offspring HRQoL and mental health with validated scales. Determinants of having been severely impacted were assessed with logistic models, as were the associations between having experienced a severe impact and poor HRQoL or mental health. Results Out of 2101 participants aged 2-17, 12.7% had experienced a severe pandemic impact. Having a lasting health condition, a pandemic-related worsening of lifestyle habits or an unfavorable family environment were associated with having been severely impacted by the pandemic. Participants who had experienced a severe pandemic impact were more likely to present poor HRQoL (aOR=3.1; 95%CI: 2.3-4.4) and poor mental health (aOR=3.9; 95%CI: 2.5-6.2). Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic may have persistent consequences on the wellbeing of children and adolescents, especially among those with health and family vulnerabilities.","Viviane Richard; Roxane Dumont; Elsa Lorthe; Andrea J Loizeau; Helene Baysson; Maria-Eugenia Zaballa; Francesco Pennacchio; Remy P Barbe; Klara M Posfay-Barbe; Idris Guessous; Silvia Stringhini","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.11.18.22282491","20221118","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41190,""
"Mindfulness supports emotional resilience in children during the COVID-19 Pandemic","An important aspect of mental health in children is emotional resilience, the capacity to adapt to, and recover from, stressors and emotional challenges. Variation in trait mindfulness, ones disposition to attend to experiences with an open and nonjudgmental attitude, may be an important individual difference in children that supports emotional resilience. In this study, we investigated whether trait mindfulness was related to emotional resilience in response to stressful changes in education and home-life during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. We conducted a correlational study examining self-report data from July 2020 to February 2021, from 163 eight-to-ten-year-old children living in the US. Higher trait mindfulness scores correlated with less stress, anxiety, depression, and negative affect in children, and lower ratings of COVID-19 impact on their lives. Mindfulness moderated the relationship between COVID-19 child impact and negative affect. Children scoring high on mindfulness showed no correlation between rated COVID-19 impact and negative affect, whereas those who scored low on mindfulness showed a positive correlation between child COVID-19 impact and negative affect. Higher levels of trait mindfulness may have helped children to better cope with a wide range of COVID-19 stressors. Future studies should investigate the mechanisms by which trait mindfulness supports emotional resilience in children.","Isaac  N Treves; Cindy Li; Kimberly Wang; Ola Ozernov-Palchik; Halie Olson; John Gabrieli","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.11.18.22282510","20221118","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41191,""
"The prevalence of probable mental health disorders among hospital healthcare workers during COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Abstract Objectives The mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be documented worldwide with systematic reviews playing a pivotal role. Here we present updated findings from our systematic review and meta-analysis on the mental health impacts among hospital healthcare workers during COVID-19. Methods We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Embase and Web Of Science Core Collection between 1st January 2000 to 17th February 2022 for studies using validated methods and reporting on the prevalence of diagnosed or probable mental health disorders in hospital healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. A meta-analysis of proportions and odds ratio was performed using a random effects model. Heterogeneity was investigated using test of subgroup differences and 95% prediction intervals. Results The meta-analysis included 401 studies, representing 458 754 participants across 58 countries. Pooled prevalence of depression was 28.5% (95%CI: 26.3-30.7), anxiety was 28.7% (95%CI: 26.5-31.0), PTSD was 25.5% (95%CI: 22.5-28.5), alcohol and substance use disorder was 25.3% (95%CI: 13.3-39.6) and insomnia was 24.4% (95%CI: 19.4-29.9). Prevalence rates were stratified by physicians, nurses, allied health, support staff and healthcare students, which varied considerably. There were significantly higher odds of probable mental health disorders in women, those working in high-risk units and those providing direct care. Limitations Majority of studies used self-report measures which reflected probable mental health disorders rather than actual diagnosis. Conclusions These updated findings have enhanced our understanding of at-risk groups working in hospitals. Targeted support and research towards these differences in mental health risks are recommended to mitigate any long-term consequences.

"Creating a risk-free hospital environment for patients, healthcare workforce and visitors through technology","Patient healthcare and management has taken leaps and bounds in advancement with the myriad technological innovations available to us now. The COVID-19 pandemic, while initially a setback, proved to be a springboard for the adoption and adaptation of cutting-edge technology that is crucial to our survival as a species. Examples of such are MySejahtera, vaccine production, genomic studies, contact tracing devices, alternative and green modes of transportation, increasing use of contactless food delivery services, and many more. The main challenges to hospital service providers are to integrate digital healthcare technologies into traditional hospital services with the aim to create a transparent and highly efficient healthcare system without walls or barriers. Hospital executives should be planning on how to integrate technology into newly built facilities and retrofit older facilities to enable a seamless integration between all components in healthcare services. As a healthcare administrator, minimization of patient safety-related risks is my foremost priority. While the benefits of health information technology are legion and can be used to enhance patient safety to an unprecedented level, I believe we should proceed with caution to ensure that patient welfare is our utmost priority, whilst also upgrading our services alongside our healthcare technology. The spread of COVID-19 stretched healthcare operational systems to their limits not only in Malaysia, but worldwide as well. Shortages and shortfalls had to be swiftly addressed, and as the director of the main COVID-19 hospital, the speaker has had a wealth of experience optimizing and modernizing response mechanisms. The speaker will share examples of improvements made for crisis response during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, centralized clinical command centers, hospital dashboards, virtual conferences, virtual learning, and many more. The speaker will also share some of the roles that a healthcare leader must focus on to prepare an organization for the adoption and use of future technology as well as readiness of organizational capabilities for long-term success. Technology for healthcare must be balanced by an appropriate level of human clinical expertise for final decision-making to ensure that patients receive high quality and safe care.","Singh, K. K.

"At-risk opioid users in a commercially insured population: Identification and outreach","BACKGROUND: The risk of opioid overdose and death has been increasing since 1999, with recent spikes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Health plans can mitigate the problem by identifying patients at risk for opioid misuse and deploying interventions to reduce unwanted outcomes. Pharmacy claims can detect aberrant opioid use based on multiple prescribers or pharmacies, higher doses, and lengthy durations of use. Medical claim information may improve targeting efficiency. OBJECTIVE(S): To deploy an algorithm using medical and pharmacy claims data to identify and outreach to members of a managed care organization at risk for opioid misuse. METHOD(S): Evidence-based factors for opioid misuse were included in an algorithm to identify cohorts of at-risk members. A retrospective review of 2019 enrollment and claims data identified members 18-64 years with medical and pharmacy benefits and at least one paid prescription opioid claim. The most recent claim served as the index date. Members with cancer or sickle-cell disorder, receiving palliative/hospice care, or nursing home residents were excluded. Diagnoses within 12 months and medication use within 6 months of index date were used to stratify members by risk of opioid misuse into one of three cohorts. Outreach followed for certain cohorts to provide education, referral for care, or care planning. RESULT(S): There were 62,986 adult opioid users with medical and pharmacy benefits. The average age was 43.3 years (+/- 13.0) with 56% female and 2.4% having an opioid-related diagnosis. Common diagnoses included mental health (anxiety 12.4%, mood disorder 8.9%) and pain conditions (low back pain 13.2%, headache 5.5%). Benzodiazepines/z-drugs were used in 15.9%, and 3.6% had received medicationassisted treatment. There were 10.3% (6,486 members) of opioid users who were placed in a cohort with 73% in the highest risk cohort. Outreach for 804 members resulted in 45% (362 members) successfully reached. Support services were declined by 144 (39.8%) while 134 (37%) were already connected to a pain management provider. Some were collaborating with their providers while few expressed interest in a health plan clinician providing ongoing support or care management. CONCLUSION(S): An evidence-based algorithm found 10.3% of members at higher risk of opioid misuse. Interventions reached about half of the targeted members, with most of them declining any assistance. Health plans may engage more participants by expanding to include providers concurrently with patient engagement.","Sera, L.; Lipphardt, S.; Poling, J.; McGovern, S.; Cooke, C.","https://www.google.com/search?q=At-risk+opioid+users+in+a+commercially+insured+population:+Identification+and+outreach","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Managed Care and Specialty Pharmacy; JOUR:S49, 28(10 A-Supplement).","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41194,""
"Current and future digital therapeutics trends from the payer perspective","BACKGROUND: Digital therapeutics (DTx) represent a growing market, accelerated over the last two years by the COVID-19 pandemic. As more DTx emerge, healthcare decision makers (HCDMs) are tasked with navigating a crowded and highly variable market to ensure patients have access to treatment options that can potentially improve outcomes. There is limited evidence evaluating how DTx products are perceived from the payer perspective. OBJECTIVE(S): To assess payer perceptions on the current and future state of DTx global trends and evidence generation needs. METHOD(S): A double-blind web-based survey was fielded from April 2022 to May 2022 to HCDMs to gather insights on existing and anticipated DTx trends. RESULT(S): There were 50 HCDMs who completed the survey. Respondents predicted that DTx will expand to new disease areas outside of mental health, diabetes, and cardiology (70%) and that more prescription DTx products will be covered (56%) over the next 18 months. Considering COVID- 19, respondents were at least somewhat likely to allow virtual assistance (64%) and API transfer (68%) for benefits verification. A MaxDiff trade-off exercise showed from an evidentiary needs perspective, head-to-head comparison studies (81) followed by prospective randomized controlled trials (74) were considered the best evidence options in terms of usefulness for DTx review, and objective clinical effectiveness (81) and total cost of care offset (66) were priorities for health outcomes data. Respondents (78%) noted that evidence demonstrating long-term efficacy and specific disease-state management were absolutely needed to determine coverage for new DTx. 48% considered two years as the best definition of long-term efficacy and most (68%) were at least interested in discussions about piloting a DTx to gather real-world evidence pending more information. CONCLUSION(S): The results indicate that HCDMs expect the market to continue to expand into new therapeutic areas and that more prescription DTx will obtain coverage. Evidence of long-term efficacy demonstrated over at least two years and pilot programs may be instrumental in optimizing DTx HCDM evaluation. Stakeholder alignment across the industry will help shape the future of DTx and facilitate appropriate patient access.","Sauvageau, G.; Bannister, B.; Kilgore, A.; Carpenter, B.; Regan, T.; Hughes, J.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Current+and+future+digital+therapeutics+trends+from+the+payer+perspective","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Managed Care and Specialty Pharmacy; JOUR:S108-S109, 28(10 A-Supplement).","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41195,""
"The use of information and communication technologies affects mental health and quality of life of older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic","Quality of life is a multidimensional concept. The World Health Organization estimates that the quality of life is affected by physical and mental health, social relations, and the physical environment. The purpose of the study was to determine which of these factors have affected the quality of life of older adults living in an institutional environment during the COVID-19 pandemic and how the use of ICT affects the mental health of older adults. Methods: Quantitative method, description method, and comparison method were used. With the questionnaire as a measuring instrument, we collected opinions from 128 older adults living in an institutional environment. Univariate and multivariate statistical methods were used. Results: The regression function was reliable only between the association with mental health and quality of life, so we confirmed one hypothesis. Mental health is the only factor that affects the quality of life. Discussion and conclusion: We find that superior mental health affects the quality of life of older adults living in institutional settings during the COVID-19 pandemic and that ICT has a significant impact on mental health, meaning that greater emphasis should be placed on strengthening the mental health of older people living in institutional environments, especially during the COVID-19 epidemic, when several measures have been taken to contain it. In the future, more attention needs to be paid to equipping homes with ICT and encouraging and helping employees so older adults can use ICT as well.","Nedeljko, Asist Mihael, Bogataj, Prof ddr David, Perovic, Assist Prof dr Barbara Toplak, Kaucic, Assist Prof dr Boris Miha","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+use+of+information+and+communication+technologies+affects+mental+health+and+quality+of+life+of+older+adults+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: IFAC-PapersOnLine; JOUR(10):940-945, 55.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41196,""
"Exploring the Psychological Effects of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Patients with Obesity on the Waiting List for Bariatric Surgery","Background/Introduction: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, hospitals have shortened the number of elective surgeries performed to the advantage of patient safety. Bariatric surgery, which is the utmost operative intervention for longstanding weight loss in obese patients, is one example of such elective procedures that were postponed and delayed during the pandemic. Moreover, it has been noted that the majority of people experienced significant disruptions in their lifestyle management, including physical activity and eating practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective(s): The objectives of this study is to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological wellbeing and self-management practices among patients with obesity on bariatric surgery waiting list at King Abdulaziz Medical City, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Method(s): A web-based survey was sent to all patients on bariatric surgery waiting list. It included questions about demographics, COVID-19, and changes in self-management behaviors and psychological status during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was used to measure the severity of depression. Associations between categorical variables were established by applying the chisquare test, and the means of two groups were equated using an independent t-test and a one-way ANOVA. Result(s): Out of 437 patients identified, 208 participants successfully completed the survey. The mean PHQ-9 total score was 8.29 +/- 6.3. In terms of PHQ-9 categories, the majority had no depression (32.2%, n = 67), followed shortly by mild depression (30.8%, n = 64), and then by moderate depression (19.2%, n = 40), moderately severe depression (12.0%, n = 25), and severe depression (5.8%, n = 12). Changes in psychological status, weight, dietary habits, and physical activity that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic in addition to the employment status were significantly correlated with the PHQ-9 Total Score (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion(s): Findings of this study demonstrated that obesity amidst COVID-19 plays significant influence on the psychological state of patients on the bariatric surgery waiting list, in which low psychological status and poor self-management behaviors were revealed.

"Screening for Depression in Patients With Breast Cancer","Approximately one in eight women will develop breast cancer (BC) in her lifetime, and depression and suicide are higher in this group than in the general population. The necessary COVID-19 pandemic social restrictions resulted in delays in treatment and heightened fears of BC recurrence and disease progression. Young women are particularly vulnerable to depression and face additional challenges compared with older women with BC. Information about the potential gene-drug interaction between tamoxifen (a selective estrogen receptor modulator, which is one of the mainstays of adjunctive hormonal therapy for BC) and some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors is available. Pharmacists should be actively involved in screening patients with BC for depression, informing them about resources that are available, and making referrals to other team members as appropriate.

"Utilization of Telehealth Solutions for Patients with Opioid Use Disorder Using Buprenorphine: A Scoping Review","Objectives: A scoping review was conducted to examine the breadth of evidence related to telehealth innovations being utilized in the treatment of Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) with buprenorphine and its effect on patient outcomes and healthcare delivery. Background(s): With the opioid epidemic worsening from year to year, there is a critical need to connect with this growing population and get them access to life-saving interventions. Buprenorphine is shown to be associated with lower overdose rates and a decrease in opioid-related acute care, but has historically been underutilized in treatment for OUD. Previous studies have determined that geographical barriers and lack of access to DEA-waivered providers are common obstacles towards starting MAT. Telehealth presents itself as a solution to this discrepancy and is becoming more feasible to integrate into clinical practice. Method(s): The authors systematically searched seven databases and websites for peer-reviewed and gray literature related to telehealth solutions for buprenorphine treatment published between 2008 and March 18, 2021. There were 69 articles which met inclusion criteria. Result(s): According to the reviewed literature, incorporation of telehealth technology with Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) for OUD is associated with higher patient satisfaction, comparable rates of retention, and an overall reduction in health care costs. Conclusion(s): Utilization of synchronous videoconferencing has reportedly been effective in increasing access to and usage of buprenorphine by overcoming both geographical and logistical barriers. This has been made possible through the expansion of telehealth technologies and a substantial push towards relaxed federal guidelines, both of which were quickly escalated in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Future research is needed to fully quantify the effect of these factors;however, the results appear promising thus far and should urge policymakers to consider making these temporary policy changes permanent.

"Proportion of Emergency Department Visits for Alcohol Abuse Increased After the Arrival of COVID-19","Objectives: The goal of our study was to determine whether there was a change in the proportion of ED visits for alcohol abuse following the arrival of COVID-19. Background(s): In March of 2020, COVID-19 arrived in the New York Metropolitan area. Total ED visits decreased markedly, likely because of fear of exposure to the virus as well as social isolation mandates. Concerns have been raised regarding the possible adverse effects that COVID-19 may have on increased abuse of alcohol. COVID-19 triggered bouts of anxiety, isolation from peers, and increased family tensions because of job disruptions and quarantining within families. A CDC study showed that despite decreased total ED visits, compared to 2019, the proportion of ED mental health related visits in 2020 increased. The goal of our study was to determine whether there was a change in the proportion of ED visits for alcohol abuse following the arrival of COVID-19. Method(s): Design: Retrospective cohort. Setting(s): EDs of 27 hospitals within 150 miles of New York City. Hospitals were teaching and non-teaching in rural, suburban, and urban areas. Total annual ED volumes ranged from 12,000 to 122,000. Population: Consecutive patients seen by ED physicians. The database contained visits between March 1 and November 30 in 2019 and 2020. Data analysis: We identified patients with alcohol abuse using International Classification of Disease codes, version 10 (ICD-10). We tallied the number of ED visits for ICD-10 codes with at least 100 visits in the database. We calculated the proportion of these visits to total ED visits in 2019 and 2020. We report the relative change in this proportion from 2019 to 2020, along with the 95% CI. Result(s): The database contained 1,161,080 visits in 2019 and 814,252 in 2020. Of these, 15,057 and 12,467 patients had a diagnosis of alcohol abuse in 2019 and 2020, respectively. For patients with alcohol abuse diagnoses in 2019 and 2020 the average ages were 46 and 47 years and females comprised 25% and 23%, respectively. The relative change in the proportion of visits for alcohol abuse from 2019 to 2020 had a statistically significant increase of 18% (95% CI: 15%-21%).

"Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on ED Adult Psychiatric Visits","Objectives: Our goal was to determine whether the proportion of ED visits for specific psychiatric conditions, namely anxiety disorders, depression, self-harm/suicidal thoughts, bipolar disorder, and psychotic disorders, changed after the arrival of COVID-19. Background(s): In March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic reached the New York tri-state area, which, at the time, was one of the regions in the United States (US) that the virus most severely affected. ED visits dramatically declined, likely due to social isolation mandates and fear of exposure to the virus. Quarantining at home, fear of becoming sick, and job disruptions caused the level of stress in the population to increase. In a previous US study, the proportion of ED visits for some psychiatric conditions increased. Method(s): Design: Retrospective cohort. Setting(s): EDs of 28 hospitals within 150 miles of New York City. Hospitals were teaching and non-teaching in rural, suburban and urban areas. Total annual ED volumes were 12,000 to 122,000. Population: Consecutive ED patients = 21 years old from March 1 to November 30 in 2019 and 2020. Data analysis: We tallied the number of patients in 2019 and 2020 with anxiety disorders, depression, selfharm/ suicidal thoughts, bipolar disorder, and psychotic disorders, identified using International Classification of Disease codes (version 10). We calculated the proportion of these visits to total ED visits in 2019 and 2020. We report the changes in these proportions from 2019 to 2020, along with 95% CIs. Result(s): Total ED visits decreased 27%, from 844,017 in 2019 to 618,195 in 2020. In 2019 and 2020 combined, the number of patients were: 13,151 with anxiety disorders, 6884 with depression, 8886 with suicidal ideation/self-harm, 3252 with bipolar disorder, and 7129 with psychotic disorders. The changes [with 95% CIs] in the proportion of visits from 2019 to 2020 were: anxiety disorders -1% [-4,+3%], depression -5% [-10,-1%], self-harm/suicidal thoughts +23% [+18,+29%], bipolar disorder +14% [+6, +22%], and psychotic disorders +23% [+18,+29%]. Conclusion(s): The proportion of adult ED visits for selfharm/ suicidal thoughts, bipolar disorder, and psychotic disorders increased following the arrival of COVID-19, whereas the proportions for anxiety and depression changed minimally. These results are somewhat different from the findings in the previously reported study. Our study highlights the need for continued surveillance of the impact of COVID-19 on mental health.","Eskin, B.; Bauman, C.; Allegra, J.

"Once you CoP, You Can't Stop: Leveraging a Community of Practice (CoP) to Strengthen Leadership Skills and Foster the Open Exchange of Best Practices","BACKGROUND: Communities of Practice (CoPs) can promote communal knowledge management among groups of practitioners with common interests and goals. METHOD(S): San Francisco Department of Public Heath launched the Reserve to Accelerate Disease Response (RADR) to strengthen the Disease Intervention Specialist (DIS) workforce and identify ways to improve disease intervention services. Qualtrics surveys and a focus group with 23 stakeholders were conducted. A weekly DIS supervisor CoP was convened to 1) strengthen DIS supervisors' leadership and management skills 2) share best practices for DIS supervision and training and 3) harness DIS supervisors' expertise in program planning. CoP members included supervisors of DIS working on COVID-19, HIV/STI, TB and communicable disease. RESULT(S): The CoP consisted of 8 staff and met for twelve initial one-hour virtual sessions to address topics of relationship building, change management, program planning, hiring, quality improvement, training, and information technology. Participants indicated unanimously in feedback surveys that time spent in the CoP was valuable and requested more sessions. On average, participants rated their experience 8/10 where 10 is ""exceeds expectations."" The 2022 CoP now includes training specialists from partnering agencies. CONCLUSION(S): The CoP was a successful activity in helping to establish connections across DIS supervisors from multiple disease areas. This new professional community setting encouraged participants to collaborate and share best practices. Several cross-cutting needs were identified. The CoP proved an effective model to transfer best practices and knowledge across DIS and steer the ongoing utilization of new funds to support the workforce.","Cristantiello, J.; Banta, J.; Spindler, H.; Kalra, A.; Cohen, S.; Sachdev, D.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Once+you+CoP,+You+Can't+Stop:+Leveraging+a+Community+of+Practice+(CoP)+to+Strengthen+Leadership+Skills+and+Foster+the+Open+Exchange+of+Best+Practices","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sexually Transmitted Diseases; JOUR:S47-S48, 49(10 Supplement 1).","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41202,""
"The Impact of Face Coverings on Social-Emotional Development and Well-Being of Youth","Kaitlyn Cocuzzo, MS3 and Brianna Cocuzzo, MS4 Â·authors contributed equallyÂ· Nova Southeastern University Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Allopathic Medicine. The COVID-19 pandemic caused global disease and disrupted people's lives. Well intentioned regulations aimed at mitigating the morbidity and mortality of the virus have had unintended consequences. While youth, on average, have milder symptoms of COVID-19, they have disproportionately experienced the impact of COVID-19 mitigation strategies including social distancing and use of face masks. For some of the youngest survivors of the pandemic many of their earliest concepts of human faces are formed in a context where the face is obscured. This limits interactions with their earliest social contacts, which should ultimately shape their social skills and emotional intelligence, impairing development of social communication skills. We hypothesize masks and social distancing are having a negative impact on development and mental health in children. We measured the effects on developmental milestones, emotional recognition, language development, and educational attainment and hypothesized a negative impact on each. We further hypothesized that there would be a negative impact on mental health including increasing cases of newly diagnosed mental health conditions, increasing utilization of mental health services, and poor mother infant bonding. We tested this hypothesis via a systematic literature review. Preliminary results support our hypotheses. We found that the mental health of children suffered due to COVID-19, leading to a crisis of availability of mental health services, children have difficulty recognizing emotions of masked peers, and poor mother infant bonding. The poor infant-parent bonding poses a particular threat to infants with long NICU stays who may spend their first weeks or months seeing only obscured human faces.","Anonymous","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Impact+of+Face+Coverings+on+Social-Emotional+Development+and+Well-Being+of+Youth","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Florida Scientist; JOUR(2):75, 85.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41203,""

"The vagus nerve: current concepts in anaesthesia and ICU management","The vagus nerve (XN) is a major component of the autonomic nervous system. It plays an important role both in the regulation of metabolic homeostasis and in inflammatory modulation. XN tone is dampened in stress conditions (either of inflammatory and/ or infectious origin) and the preservation of parasympathetic function may serve as a biomarker of general health, longevity and vitality. COVID-19 remains a major healthcare issue worldwide. Excessive inflammation and its end organ consequences are key elements in the pathogenesis of COVID-19-induced multiple organ dysfunction, as well as post-COVID-19 syndrome (long COVID). XN stimulation has been hypothesised to control both the SARS-CoV-2 replication and the ensuing inflammation, and could improve the clinical outcomes as an adjunct treatment. Electrical stimulation of the auricular XN (AXNS) is an emerging technology, with few side effects and anaesthetic implications, and is showing promise with respect to the management of gastroparesis, epilepsy, migraine, autoimmune diseases, anxiety and major depressive disorders, obesity, SARS-CoV-2 infection in the intensive care unit (ICU), and long COVID. Continuous vagal tone monitoring in patients with COVID-19 may potentially also be used as a predictive marker of the COVID-19 illness course, and an evaluation of future therapies.

"Factors influencing the burden and stress of parents taking care of a children with disability: systematic review","Aim: The aim of the study was to identify and analyse factors which are related to burden and stress of parents with disabled children. Method(s): The systematic review includes full-text primary research papers, published in English, in the period 2005-2021. Freely accessible as well as licensed databases CINAHL EBSCO, SCOPUS, Wiley Library Online, ProQuest a Web of Science have been used for the search. Result(s): The literature review shows that over a period of fifteen years, numerous studies have been published that address the factors causing stress and burden n parents taking care for children with disabilities. A total of 325 studies have been found. In four studies, a positive effect on the reduction of burden and stress was confirmed. In eight studies, fifteen factors increasing the stress and burden of parents of children with disabilities were identified. Positive factors included using respite care, acquiring a dog, governmental financial support and religion. Negative factors included the child incontinence, single-parent family, child depression, learning disorders, unusual behaviour of the child in public, impaired cognitive ability of the child, Asperger syndrome, female gender, more prestigious and lucrative occupation of parents, low level of support from relatives in taking care of the child, night enuresis, difficult behaviour of the child and high demands on child care, the COVID-19 pandemic, obese child. Conclusion(s): Factors affecting parents can have positive as well as negative influence on the education of the child. Early identification of negative factors that can cause burden and stress on parents of disabled children is very important. The paediatric nurse acts as a link between the parents, the doctor and the child. Therefore, it should be involved not only in nursing care, but also in the early detection and identification of risk factors. Healthcare professionals should help parents in all areas of childcare.

"Overview of virtual psychological interventions in Latin America and Spain before the COVID pandemic Documentary Review","The article presents a documentary review on the interventions of psychology in virtuality, revealing techniques, practices, and novelties in virtual psychological interventions before the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective was to investigate the current state of virtual interventions in psychology before the pandemic. A review of fifty articles was conducted, researched in specialized sources, such as Redalyc, Scielo, Dialnet, E-libro, EBSCO among others;In addition, content analysis and qualitative analysis methodology by categories were conducted. In the articles investigated, it was found that virtual reality (VR) is the most used tool to perform a virtual psychology interruption before the COVID-19 pandemic. Among the psychological problems intervened, before the pandemic, anxiety, depressive, eating, neuropsychological, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders were identified. It was also found that virtual reality is effective and has high acceptability in psychological treatments, which enables virtual psychotherapeutic processes, as an effective experience, requiring, for its optimal functioning, diversity, and dynamism in virtual communication. It was concluded that VR is the most used technique in the treatment of different psychological problems, before the pandemic, especially in anxiety disorders, so it is the most intervened problem.","Arango, F.

"Relationship between Loneliness, Physical Activity, and Depressive Symptoms among Older Adults: A Cross-Sectional Study Conducted during the Fourth Wave of the Covid-19 Pandemic in Turkey","Introduction: This study aims to examine the prevalence of depressive symptoms, its influencing factors, and the relationship between loneliness, physical activity and depressive symptoms among individuals aged 65 years and above during the COVID-19 pandemic. Material(s) and Method(s): This cross-sectional study was conducted on 1093 older adults in Turkey. A Descriptive Data Form, the Loneliness Scale for the Elderly, the Geriatric Depression Scale-15, and the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly were used to collect data. In this study, the presence of depressive symptoms was the dependent variable;sociodemographic and individual characteristics, habits, history of chronic illness and COVID-19, perception of loneliness and physical activity level were independent variables. Result(s): The prevalence of depressive symptoms among older adults was 66.8%. Depressive symptoms were 3.96 times higher among women, 8.06 times higher in urban areas, 2.56 times higher among those who had equal income and expenses, and 2.78 times higher among older adults who had less income than expenses. Depressive symptoms were further 1.98 times higher among those who had chronic diseases and 25.54 times higher among those diagnosed with COVID-19. Additionally, depressive symptoms increased by 23.24 times among those who did not have a hobby, and 1.53 times for each one-point increase in the level of loneliness. No relationship was found between physical activity levels and depressive symptoms. Conclusion(s): The results show that two out of three older adults were depressed. Characteristics such as having had COVID-19, loneliness, and hobbies, were significant influencing factors of depressive symptoms among older adults. There is a need to adopt feasible and protective policies that cater to the needs and control the risk factors of older adults during the pandemic. Copyright Â© 2022, Geriatrics Society.

"Professional motivations and perceptions of senior dental students in the distance education period during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic","PurposeDental students are particularly prone to be affected by the global emergency of Coronavirus-19 (Covid-19) pandemic. The aim of this study was to evaluate the professional motivations and perceptions of senior dental students during the distance education period due to pandemic.Materials and MethodsThe data was collected via an online questionnaire, including questions related to students' professional motivation and perceptions, and views about preventive dentistry. For identifying the distress levels, Turkish version of Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS)-21 was used. Descriptive statistics and marginal homogeneity test were used for statistical analysis.ResultsA total of 114 (83 female, 31 male) students, with the mean age of 23.7 +/- 1.03 participated the study. Statistically significant changes were observed on the students' career plans (p&lt;0.001);fear about getting and transmitting infectious diseases (p&lt;0.001);and satisfaction about their profession (p&lt;0.001) during the Covid-19 pandemic. Motivation loss was determined on the participants.ConclusionThere is an urgent need for revision on dental education in order to ensure the students be competent to provide oral health service that can meet the latest needs and achieve professional self-confidence without deterioration on their professional motivation and perceptions. Crisis-oriented psychological support programs should be provided for students. Some improvements should be structured in terms of preventive dentistry issues, both for dental education and dental health service aspects.","Ozler, C. O.; Atalay, C.; Meral, E.; Tekcicek, M.

"Common model of stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms in pregnant women from seven high-income Western countries at the COVID-19 pandemic onset","Increases in stress, anxiety, and depression among women pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic have been reported internationally. Yet rigorous comparison of the prevalence of maternal mental health problems across countries is lacking. Moreover, whether stress is a common predictor of maternal mental health during the pandemic across countries is unknown. 8148 pregnant women from Germany, Israel, Italy, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States were enrolled in the International COVID-19 Pregnancy Experiences (I-COPE) Study between April 17 and May 31, 2020. Sociodemographic characteristics, pandemic-related stress, pregnancy-specific stress, anxiety, and depression were assessed with well-validated instruments. The magnitude of stress and mood disturbances was compared across countries. A path model predicting clinically significant levels of anxiety and depression from maternal characteristics and stress was tested for all study participants and then examined separately in each country with &gt;200 participants. Countries differed significantly in magnitude of pandemic-related pregnancy stress and pandemic-unrelated pregnancy-specific stress, and in prevalence of clinically significant anxiety and depression levels. A well-fitting common path model for the entire sample indicated that mood and anxiety disturbances were strongly predicted by pandemic-related and pregnancy-specific stress after accounting for maternal characteristics. The model was replicated in individual countries. Although pregnant women in high-income Western countries experienced different levels of stress resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, stress is a strong, common predictor of anxiety and depressive symptoms in these individuals. The common model can be used to inform research and clinical interventions to protect against adverse consequences of prenatal maternal stress, anxiety, and depression for mothers and infants.","Lobel, Preis, Mahaffey, Schaal, Yirmiya, Atzil, Reuveni, Balestrieri, Penengo, Colli, Garzitto, Driul, Ilska, Brandt-Salmeri, KoÃ…â€šodziej-Zaleska, Caparros-Gonzalez, Castro, La Marca-Ghaemmaghami, Meyerhoff","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.115499","20221118","Anxiety; COVID-19 global pandemic; Depression; Maternal stress; Pregnancy; Women's health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41212,""
"Patient and provider perspectives of the implementation of remote consultations for community-dwelling people with mental health conditions: A systematic mixed studies review","Remote, or tele-, consultations became a necessary form of mental healthcare provision during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the prevalence of mental health problems rises, they may have a role in future mental health services. We aimed to review the literature on patient and provider perspectives on factors influencing the implementation of remote consultations for community-dwelling people with mental health conditions. We searched five electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL, and PsycINFO) for empirical research up to July 13th, 2022. Only studies of synchronous, interactive remote consultations conducted via video, phone, or live-messaging between patients and providers were included. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of included studies using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. We integrated qualitative and quantitative data from 39 studies into a single mixed-methods synthesis. We mapped reported factors to the domains of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Acceptability was generally high among participants, despite concerns about the quality of care and the perceived impeded therapeutic relationship.

"Parental Assistance with Emotion Regulation Moderates Link Between COVID-19 Stress and Child Mental Health","The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted children's mental health. All children have not been affected equally, however, and whether parental emotion socialization might buffer or exacerbate the impact of COVID-19 on children's mental health remains an important question. During the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. <i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°200 parents of children ages 0-17 (52.5% female) completed questionnaires related to parental assistance with children's emotion regulation, symptomatology, and exposure to COVID-19-related stress. Parents were 74% Non-Hispanic/Latino/a White, 13% Asian, 4.5% Hispanic/Latino/a, 4% Black/African American, 2.5% Native American, and 1.5% bi/multiracial; 0.5% of participants preferred not to state their race/ethnicity. In a series of linear regression analyses, we examined whether parental assistance with children's execution of emotion regulation strategies - across a variety of prototypically-adaptive and -maladaptive strategies - moderates the association between children's exposure to COVID-19-related stress and symptomatology. Results suggest that parental assistance with the execution of prototypically-adaptive strategies (i.e., acceptance, problem solving, behavioral disengagement) and prototypically-maladaptive strategies (i.e., suppression, rumination) may buffer or exacerbate, respectively, the impact of COVID-19-related stress on youth mental health. Though interpretation of findings is constrained by limitations inherent in collecting data during a pandemic, results highlight the importance of supporting parents - who play a critical role of supporting children - during public health emergencies that affect family life. Interventions designed to improve child wellbeing during the ongoing pandemic may benefit from training parents to assist their children with specific emotion regulation strategies.","Cohodes, McCauley, Preece, Gross, Gee","https://doi.org/10.1080/15374416.2022.2140431","20221118","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41214,""
"Dissociative experiences among Lebanese university students: Association with mental health issues, the economic crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Beirut port explosion","Dissociative experiences are psychological manifestations characterized by a loss of connection and continuity between thoughts, emotions, environment, behavior, and identity. Lebanon has been facing indescribable events in the last few years, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the Beirut explosion, a crushing economic crisis with the highest inflation rate the country has known in over three decades. The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between dissociative experiences and post-traumatic stress symptoms from the economic crisis, the Beirut blast, the COVID-19 pandemic, and other mental health issues in a sample of Lebanese university students. This cross-sectional study enrolled 419 active university students (18-35 years) from all over Lebanon (May and August 2021). The respondents received the online soft copy of a survey by a snowball sampling technique through social media and messaging apps. The questionnaire included sociodemographic data, the Dissociative Experience Scale (DES-II), the PTSD Checklist Specific Version (PCL-S), the Financial Wellbeing Scale, the Beirut Distress Scale, the Lebanese Anxiety Scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire. The two-factor model of the DES fitted best according to CFI, RMSEA and Ãâ€¡2/df values, but modestly according to TLI. The two factors were absorption and amnesia/depersonalization. Higher stress (Beta = 0.95) and more PTSD from the Beirut blast (Beta = 0.29) and from the economic crisis (Beta = 0.23) were significantly associated with more absorption. A personal history of depression (Beta = 6.03), higher stress (Beta = 0.36) and more PTSD from the Beirut blast (Beta = 0.27) and from the COVID-19 pandemic (Beta = 0.16) were significantly associated with more amnesia/depersonalization. Significant rates of dissociative experiences and their sub-manifestations (amnesia/depersonalization and absorption) were found among Lebanese university students, with remarkable co-occurrence of a traumatic/stressful pattern, whether on an individual (history of PTSD) or a collective level (Post-traumatic manifestations from Beirut blast, COVID-19 pandemic and/or economic crisis), or whether correlated to an acute single event or to certain chronic stressors, or even to a personal history of depression. Such findings must raise the attention to serious mental and psychosocial alteration in the Lebanese national identity.","Mhanna, El Zouki, Chahine, Obeid, Hallit","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0277883","20221118","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41215,""
"Labor force participation during COVID-19 and risk of depression: a Danish register study","COVID-19 caused economic insecurity for businesses and their employees. Understanding effects of changes in labor force participation on depression risk during economic recession is fundamental for early diagnosis. The study evaluates if changes in labor force participation are associated with depression risk during COVID-19 in Denmark. A register-based longitudinal study of Danes aged 25-67Ã¢â‚¬â€°years without depression 2 years prior to baseline defined as February 2020. An eight-level categorical variable on stable or changing labor force participation was defined from monthly employment percentage gradients in the Danish Register-based Evaluation and Marginalization Database from February 2020. The cohort was followed until 31 December 2020 for depressions overall and mild-, moderate- and severe depression. Sex-stratified cox regression models with hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were performed accounting for important confounders. In total, 1 619 240 (50.3%) men of mean age 45.6Ã¢â‚¬â€°years and 1 598 587 (49.7%) women of mean age 45.9Ã¢â‚¬â€°years were included. Becoming unemployed implied an increased HR of depression in men (HR 2.02; 95% CI 1.94-2.10) and women (2.19; 2.12-2.26) compared to a steady-state full-time employment. Being outside the labor force or employed part-time implied an elevated HR in men (3.02; 2.82-3.23 and 2.41; 2.35-2.48) and women (3.13; 2.30-3.31 and 2.30; 2.26-2.35), respectively, compared to a steady-state full-time employment.

"Healthcare of pregnant women with diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic: a Southern Brazilian cross-sectional panel data","To evaluate the indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the care of women with pregnancies complicated by gestational or pre-existing diabetes, and their maternal-fetal outcomes. A cross-sectional panel data conducted in a University Hospital in Southern Brazil. Maternal-fetal outcomes and predictors of care from 235 pregnant women with type 1, type 2, or gestational diabetes were evaluated. Two time periods were compared: six months preceding the pandemic, in 2019, and the COVID-19 period from September 2020 to March 2021. Comparisons were performed using analysis of variance, Mann-Whitney U, Fisher's exact and T-tests. Risks were calculated using the Poisson regression with robust estimates. Maternal age was lower (32.1Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 6.8 vs. 34.4Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 6.6, p=0.009) and rates of depression/anxiety were higher (16.5 vs. 7.4%, p=0.046) in the group evaluated during the COVID-19.

"The role of sleep and dreams in long-COVID","Recent investigations show that many people affected by SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) report persistent symptoms 2-3Ã‚Â months from the onset of the infection. Here, we report the Italian findings from the second International COVID-19 Sleep Study survey, aiming to investigate sleep and dream alterations in participants with post-acute symptoms, and identify the best determinants of these alterations among patients with long-COVID. Data from 383 participants who have had COVID-19 were collected through a web-survey (May-November 2021). Descriptive analyses were performed to outline the sociodemographic characteristics of long-COVID (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 270, with at least two long-lasting symptoms) and short-COVID (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 113, with none or one long-lasting symptom) participants. They were then compared concerning sleep and dream measures. We performed multiple linear regressions considering as dependent variables sleep and dream parameters discriminating the long-COVID group. Age, gender, work status, financial burden, COVID-19 severity and the level of care were significantly different between long-COVID and short-COVID subjects. The long-COVID group showed greater sleep alterations (sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, sleep inertia, naps, insomnia, sleep apnea, nightmares) compared with the short-COVID group. We also found that the number of long-COVID symptoms, psychological factors and age were the best explanatory variables of sleep and oneiric alterations. Our findings highlight that sleep alterations are part of the clinical presentation of the long-COVID syndrome. Moreover, psychological status and the number of post-acute symptoms should be considered as state-like variables modulating the sleep problems in long-COVID individuals. Finally, according to previous investigations, oneiric alterations are confirmed as a reliable mental health index.","Scarpelli, De Santis, Alfonsi, Gorgoni, Morin, Espie, Merikanto, Chung, Penzel, Bjorvatn, Dauvilliers, Holzinger, Wing, Partinen, Plazzi, De Gennaro","https://doi.org/10.1111/jsr.13789","20221118","COVID-19; nightmares; oneiric activity; post-acute symptoms; sleep concerns","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41218,""
"Impacts of the New York State COVID-19 Disaster Emergency Orders on prescription dispensing for opioids and medication for opioid use disorder","To examine whether the March 2020 New York State (NYS) SARS-CoV-2 Emergency Orders were associated with an initial surge in opioid dispensing and a longer-term reduction in access to medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Time-series analyses of the dispensing of non-MOUD opioid and MOUD prescriptions using IQVIA's Longitudinal Prescription Claims Database (n=16,087,429) in NYS by week, from 1/1/2018, to 7/31/2020. IQVIA is a multinational company that provides biopharmaceutical development and commercial outsourcing services. NYS Zone Improvement Plan (ZIP) Codes (n=1,218) in which prescriptions were dispensed. For each ZIP Code, for each week, the following dispensing measures were calculated: total weekly morphine milligram equivalents/day (MME/day); total weekly MME/day dispensed via prescriptions for Ã¢â€°Â¤7 days; and the count of MOUD prescriptions dispensed. Differences in dispensing metrics, comparing each week in 2020 with corresponding weeks in 2019, were calculated for each ZIP Code. During the study period, weekly MME/day per ZIP Code of dispensed non-MOUD opioids steadily declined. Compared with the difference in dispensing between 2019 and 2020 during the first week in 2020, there was a significantly larger drop in dispensed weekly total MME/day beginning March 21 2020 and lasting until the week of April 17 (p&lt;0.05 for each week). Mean weekly total MME/day dispensed from March 21 to April 17, 2020 was 17.07% lower (95% confidence interval [CI] 13.97%, 20.17%) than in the 4 weeks before March 21, almost entirely due to a drop in MME/day dispensed for prescriptions of Ã¢â€°Â¤7 days. There was not a discernable drop in MOUD dispensing associated with the period of the Emergency Orders. New York State Emergency Orders in March 2020 to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission and preserve hospital capacity appeared to be associated with a decline in dispensing of opioids not used as MOUD. Access to MOUD appeared to be unaffected by the Orders, likely because of policy initiatives by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.","Suri, Feaster, Balise, Quinn, Nunes, Gilbert, El-Bassel, Rundle","https://doi.org/10.1111/add.16087","20221118","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41219,""
"Long-term social restrictions and lack of work activities during the COVID-19 pandemic: impact on the daily lives of people with intellectual disabilities","Lockdowns due to the Covid-19 pandemic may have had a disproportionate impact on the daily lives of people with intellectual disabilities. Many of them had to deal with limited social contacts for an extended period. This study explores in depth how people with intellectual disabilities in the Netherlands experienced their daily lives, in particular due to lack of access to regular work activities. Eight participants with intellectual disabilities were interviewed. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) was employed in conducting and analysing interviews. Analysis yielded three overarching themes that are conceptually linked. Participants experienced a prolonged lack of social connections that resulted in experiences of social isolation and feelings of loneliness. This led to different kinds of struggles: either internal struggles involving negative thoughts or depressive feelings, or a perceived threat to their autonomous position in society. Meanwhile participants had to sustain their sense of self-worth in the absence of work activities. The findings emphasise the importance of social opportunities through the access to work activities for people with intellectual disabilities. Interventions are suggested to help reverse the increased social inequalities and enhance rehabilitation <i>via</i> work activities for people with intellectual disabilities.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABLITATIONMore awareness may be raised among authorities, employers and the general public about the significant value people with intellectual disabilities attribute to meaningful social connections, in particular through work activities.Also, more awareness may be raised about the potential adverse effects of the loss of work activities and social connections on the quality of life of people with intellectual disabilities.Providing social support to others may help people with intellectual disabilities to construct social valued roles, either in or outside the work situation.Professionals and employers can support people with intellectual disabilities to find opportunities to provide social support to others.It is important to invest in sustainable and innovative post-pandemic community participation initiatives and particularly in accessible post-pandemic employment support, for example by organising paid in-company training placements.It is essential that professionals support people with intellectual disabilities to enhance their sources of resilience and coping strategies, that may have diminished as a result of the pandemic.","Voermans, den Boer, Wilthagen, Embregts","https://doi.org/10.1080/09638288.2022.2147227","20221118","Covid-19; daytime activities; employment; intellectual disabilities; interpretative phenomenological analysis; job loss; meaning of work; social contacts","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41220,""
"The ""Janus-like"" RNA-editing machinery in innate antiviral immunity","Our innate immune systems are evolved to provide the first line of immune defense against microbial infections. A key effector component is the adenosine deaminase acting on the RNA-1 (ADAR-1)/interferon (IFN) pathway of the innate cytoplasmic immunity that mounts rapid responses to many viral pathogens. As an RNA-editing enzyme, ADAR-1 targets viral RNA intermediates in the cytoplasmic compartment to interfere with the infection. However, ADAR-1 may also edit characteristic RNA structures of certain host genes, notably, the 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) receptor 2C (5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R). Dysfunction of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R has been linked to the pathology of several human mental conditions, such as Schizophrenia, anxiety, bipolar disorder, major depression, and the mental illnesses of substance use disorders (SUD). Thus, the ADAR-1-mediated RNA editing may be either beneficial or harmful; these effects need to be tightly modulated to sustain innate antiviral immunity while restricting undesired off-target self-reactivity. In this communication, we discuss ideas and tools to identify the orphan drug candidates, including small molecules and biologics that may serve as effective modulators of the ADAR-1/IFN innate immunity and are thereby promising for use in treating or preventing SUD- and/or viral infection-associated mental illnesses.","Wu, Wang","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Janus-like+RNA-editing+machinery+in+innate+antiviral+immunity.","20221118","5-HT2CR; ADAR-1; COVID-19; RNA editing; SARS-CoV-2; Sudemycin D6; U87; interferon; measles viruses; substance use disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41221,""

Comparatively little is known about possible adverse consequences of these behavioural measures in Germany. This study aimed at investigating potential early adverse effects associated with quarantine and physical distancing at the beginning of the countrywide lockdown in Germany in March 2020. Using a cross-sectional online survey (N = 4,268), adverse consequences attributed to physical distancing, symptoms of psychopathology, and sociodemographic variables were explored in the total sample as well as in high-risk groups (i.e., people with a physical or mental condition). The most frequently reported adverse effects were impairment of spare time activities, job-related impairment, and adverse emotional effects (e.g., worries, sadness). Participants with a mental disorder reported the highest levels of adverse consequences (across all domains) compared to participants with a physical disease or participants without any mental or physical condition. No significant association between the duration of the behavioural protective measures and the severity of adverse mental health effects was observed. Results showed that non-pharmaceutical actions were associated with adverse effects, particularly in people with mental disorders.

"Blended Delivery of Imagery Rescripting for Childhood PTSD: A Case Study During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Despite the growing evidence that trauma-focused treatments can be applied as first-line approaches for individuals with childhood trauma-related PTSD (Ch-PTSD), many therapists are still reluctant to provide trauma-focused treatments as a first-choice intervention for individuals with Ch-PTSD, especially by telehealth. The current manuscript will therefore give an overview of the evidence for the effectiveness of trauma-focused therapies for individuals with Ch-PTSD, the delivery of trauma-focused treatments via telehealth, and a case example on how a specific form of trauma focused therapy: Imagery Rescripting (ImRs) can be applied by telehealth. This article presents a clinical illustration of a blended telehealth trajectory of imagery rescripting (ImRs) Ch-PTSD delivered during the COVID-19 pandemic. The presented case shows that ImRs can be safely and effectively performed by telehealth for ch-PTSD, no stabilization phase was needed and only seven sessions were needed to drastically reduce Ch-PTSD and depressive symptoms, and to increase quality of life. This case report shows the effectiveness of ImRs by telehealth for Ch-PTSD, which gives hope and additional possibilities to reach out to patients with ch-PTDS.

The aim of this study was to cross-culturally validate the theory-based instrument Multidimensional Assessment of COVID-19-Related Fears (MAC-RF) in Croatian and to further examine the scale's validity by exploring its relationship with relevant constructs. A total of 477 participants completed an online survey during a rapid rise in new daily COVID-19 cases in Croatia and while new restrictions were being imposed. MAC-RF had a stronger association with health anxiety, cyberchondria, and anxiety sensitivity compared to depression, attesting to its convergent and divergent validity. However, a 2-factor structure was revealed in this sample: Fear of infection and Fear of using an inadequate strategy in dealing with pandemic. Fear of infection had a stronger association with health anxiety and COVID-19 anxiety and was a better predictor of COVID-19 related protective health behaviors. Fear of choosing an inadequate strategy had a stronger association with cyberchondria, fear of consequences of the epidemic on mental health, as well as financial consequences, and loss of civil liberties. Fear of infection captures negative emotional states due to feared consequences on personal somatic health and the health of loved ones, while Fear of choosing an inadequate strategy in dealing with the pandemic reflects a metacognitive aspect.

"""In the office nine to five, five days a weekÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ those days are gone"": qualitative exploration of diplomatic personnel's experiences of remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic","Many employees had to work remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic. Literature suggests there are both challenges and benefits to remote working and that remote working can have detrimental effects on mental health. This study aimed to explore diplomatic personnel's perceptions and experiences of working from home during the pandemic. Twenty-five employees of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office took part in semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis was carried out to extract recurring themes from the data. Seven main themes emerged from the data: impact of the pandemic on work; relationships with colleagues; benefits of working from home; challenges of working from home; family; moving posts during the pandemic; and perceptions and predictions of post-pandemic work. Participants provided mixed views on how remote working had affected productivity and relationships with colleagues. Benefits of working from home included greater freedom and flexibility; new opportunities; and inclusivity of remote meetings. Challenges included being in different time zones to the countries they were working for; unsuitable home ergonomics; technological issues; and difficulties finding appropriate work-life balance. Those with young children reported difficulties juggling work and childcare. Adjusting to new posts at a time when staff were working remotely appeared particularly challenging. However, most did not want or expect to return to entirely office-based work. They predicted a hybrid model of working in the future, involving both office work and remote work; they stressed the importance of flexibility and suggested there would not be a one-size-fits-all approach to returning to face-to-face work. Remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the ways in which employees work, showing them that they do not have to be in the office to successfully achieve their work goals and leaving many wanting flexibility to make their own decisions about working from home (or not). There are both benefits and challenges to remote working; managers can take steps to reduce some of the challenges by being available to support their employees, organising regular remote meetings and allowing employees autonomy in terms of when and where they work.","Brooks, Hall, Patel, Greenberg","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-022-00970-x","20221118","COVID-19; Diplomatic personnel; Diplomats; Pandemic; Remote working; Working from home","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41226,""
"Anxiety, depression, and social connectedness among the general population of eight countries during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic affected the mental health of the general population through multiple pathways. The aim of this study was to examine anxiety, depression, self-confidence, and social connectedness among the general population of eight countries during the COVID-19 pandemic, their underlying factors, and vulnerable groups. A web-based survey was administered to persons from the general population of China, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Russia, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The survey included the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and items on self-confidence, social connectedness, and socio-demographics. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis and regression analysis. Twenty-three thousand six hundred twenty-two respondents completed the survey. Overall, 42% of the total sample had mild to severe anxiety symptoms and 43% had mild to severe depression symptoms. 14% to 38% reported suboptimal ratings in self-confidence, social participation, contact with family and friends, and feeling connected to others. In the exploratory factor analyses, in most countries, one dominant factor had a high influence on GAD-7, PHQ-9 sum scores and self-confidence with eigenvalue (% variance) above 3.2 (53.9%). One less dominant factor had a high influence on social connectedness scores with eigenvalue (% variance) ranging above 0.8 (12.8%). Being younger, female, having chronic conditions, perceived as risky to COVID-19 infection, andÃ‚Â feeling not very well protected against COVID-19 were significantly associated with the two underlying factors. Anxiety, depression, and problems with self-confidence and social connectedness were highly prevalent in the general population of eight countries during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Changes in depressive and anxiety symptoms during COVID-19 in children from the PROGRESS cohort","We assessed associations between maternal stress, social support, and child resiliency during the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to changes in anxiety and depression symptoms in children in Mexico City. Participants included 464 mother-child pairs from a longitudinal birth cohort in Mexico City. At ages 8-11 (pre-COVID, 2018-2019) and 9-12 (during COVID, May-Nov 2020) years, depressive symptoms were assessed using the child and parent-reported Children's Depressive Inventory. Anxiety symptoms were assessed using the child-reported Revised Manifest Anxiety Scale. Linear regression models were used to estimate associations between maternal stress, social support, and resiliency in relation to changes in depressive and anxiety symptoms. We additionally assessed outcomes using clinically relevant cut-points. Models were adjusted for child age and sex and maternal socioeconomic status and age. Higher continuous maternal stress levels during the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with increases in depressive symptoms (ÃŽÂ²: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.12, 1.31), and higher odds of clinically relevant depressive and anxiety symptoms in the children. Maternal stress during the pandemic may increase mental health symptoms in pre-adolescent children. Additional studies are needed that examine the long-term pandemic-related impacts on mental health throughout the adolescent years. In this longitudinal cohort study of children in Mexico City, we observed that depressive symptoms were higher from before to during the pandemic. Maternal stress surrounding the pandemic may increase mental health symptoms in pre-adolescent children. Child resiliency may help to protect against pandemic-related stressors.","McGuinn, Rivera, Osorio-Valencia, Schnaas, Hernandez-Chavez, DeFelice, Harari, Klein, Wright, TÃƒÂ©llez-Rojo, Wright, Rosa, Tamayo-Ortiz","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-022-02379-z","20221117","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41228,""
"Longitudinal Postvaccine SARS-CoV-2 Immunoglobulin G Titers, Memory B-Cell Responses, and Risk of COVID-19 in Multiple Sclerosis Over 1 Year","Some disease-modifying treatments impair response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines in multiple sclerosis (MS), potentially increasing the risk of breakthrough infections. We aimed to investigate longitudinal SARS-CoV-2 antibody dynamics and memory B cells after 2 and 3 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine doses and their association with the risk of COVID-19 in patients with MS on different treatments over 1 year. Prospective observational cohort study in patients with MS undergoing SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccinations. Antispike (anti-S) immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers were measured by chemiluminescence microparticle immunoassay. Frequencies of spike-specific memory B cells were measured on polyclonal stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and screening of secreted antibodies by ELISA. We recruited 120 patients with MS (58 on anti-CD20 antibodies, 9 on sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators, 15 on cladribine, 24 on teriflunomide (TFL), and 14 untreated) and collected 392 samples up to 10.8 months after 2 vaccine doses. When compared with untreated patients, anti-CD20 antibodies (ÃŽÂ² = -2.07, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and S1P modulators (ÃŽÂ² = -2.02, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) were associated with lower anti-S IgG, while TFL and cladribine were not. Anti-S IgG decreased with months since vaccine (ÃŽÂ² = -0.14, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), independently of treatments. Within anti-CD20 patients, anti-S IgG remained higher in those with greater baseline B-cell counts and were not influenced by postvaccine anti-CD20 infusions. Anti-S IgG increase after a 3rd vaccine was mild on anti-CD20 and S1P modulators. Spike-specific memory B-cell responses were weaker on S1P modulators and anti-CD20 than on TFL and influenced by postvaccine anti-CD20 infusions. The frequency of breakthrough infections was comparable between DMTs, but the risk of COVID-19 was predicted by the last measured anti-S IgG titer before infection (OR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.37-0.86, <i>p</i> = 0.008). Postvaccine anti-S IgG titers decrease over time regardless of MS treatment and are associated with breakthrough COVID-19. Both humoral and specific memory B-cell responses are diminished on S1P modulators. Within anti-CD20-treated patients, B-cell count at first vaccine determines anti-S IgG production, whereas postvaccine anti-CD20 infusions negatively affect spike-specific memory B cells.","Disanto, Galante, Cantu', Sacco, Mele, Eisler, Keller, Bernasconi, Sallusto, Zecca, Gobbi","https://doi.org/10.1212/NXI.0000000000200043","20221117","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41229,""
"Outcomes of Delay of Care After the Onset of COVID-19 for Patients Managing Multiple Chronic Conditions","Many patients delayed health care during COVID-19. We assessed the extent to which patients managing multiple chronic conditions (MCC) delayed care in the first months of the pandemic, reasons for delay, and impact of delay on patient-reported physical and behavioral health (BH) outcomes. As part of a large clinical trial conducted April 2016-June, 2021, primary care patients managing MCC were surveyed about physical and behavioral symptoms and functioning. Surveys administered between September 3, 2020, and March 16, 2021, included questions about the extent of and reasons for any delayed medical and BH care since COVID-19. Multivariable linear regression was used to assess health outcomes as a function of delay of care status. Among patients who delayed medical care, 58% delayed more than once. Among those who delayed behavioral health care, 63% delayed more than once. Participants who delayed multiple times tended to be younger, female, unmarried, and reported food, financial, and housing insecurities and worse health. The primary reasons for delaying care were lack of availability of in-person visits and perceived lack of urgency. Participants who delayed care multiple times had significantly worse outcomes on nearly every measure of physical and mental health, compared with participants who delayed care once or did not delay. Delay of care was substantial. Patients who delayed care multiple times were in poorer health and thus in need of more care. Effective strategies for reengaging patients in deferred care should be identified and implemented on multiple levels. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02868983.

"An Evidence-Based Review of Vitamin D for Common and High-Mortality Conditions","Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin available from food and sun exposure. Vitamin D receptors are present in cells throughout the body and cause it to act like a hormone. Observational studies document the association of low vitamin D levels with multiple health conditions. This article reviews the evidence for vitamin D in prevention and treatment in primary care. We performed a literature review of randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and large prospective trials looking at the role of vitamin D deficiency in the most common conditions seen in primary care and the top 10 causes of mortality since 2010. Vitamin D supplementation in patients with known cardiovascular disease does not reduce risk of stroke or heart attack. Vitamin D supplementation does not seem to have an effect in the treatment of hypertension or in cancer prevention. There is emerging evidence that supplementation reduces COVID-19 severity and risk of mechanical ventilation. Vitamin D at more moderate levels may reduce the risk of falls, but higher doses may cause increased fall risk. There does not seem to be a link between vitamin D supplementation and improved cognition. Vitamin D supplementation may be helpful in patients with major depression. High dose vitamin D may improve pain in people with fibromyalgia. Supplementing patients with prediabetes reduced the risk of progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus. Vitamin D supplementation in addition to standard emollient treatment helped to reduce symptoms in people with atopic dermatitis. Prospective studies of vitamin D supplementation demonstrate variable impact on disease specific and patient-oriented outcomes, suggesting a correlation but not a causal relationship between low vitamin D levels and disease pathogenicity. Future research should determine dosing standards and timing of vitamin D in treatment and prevention.","Michael, Couture, Swedlund, Hampton, Eglash, Schrager","https://doi.org/10.3122/jabfm.2022.220115R1","20221117","Atopic Dermatitis; COVID-19; Cardiovascular Diseases; Child Health; Chronic Pain; Dementia; Depression; Dietary Supplements; Family Medicine; Geriatrics; Hypertension; Meta-Analysis; Obstetrics; Prenatal Care; Primary Health Care; Type 2 Diabetes; Vitamin D","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41231,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on access and use of health services by middle-aged and older Australians","ObjectivesTo examine: the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on access to health services by middle-aged and older Australians; and the use of telehealth services during the COVID-19 pandemic and its ongoing usefulness.MethodsA cross-sectional survey was conducted among participants who completed the COVID-19 supplement in the 45 and Up Study 2020 Survey. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between socio-demographic characteristics and health conditions with missed/delayed access to health services, changes in health outcomes resulting from missed/delayed access, and use of telehealth services.ResultsData for 45Ã¢â‚¬â€°071 participants were analysed (56% female, 72% aged Ã¢â€°Â¥65Ã¢â‚¬â€°years). Almost half (42.2%) reported they had missed/delayed access to health care due to COVID-19; mainly for dental services (26.1%), visits to a general practitioner (GP) (16.3%) and specialists (12.6%). Missed/delayed visits to GPs and specialists were more likely among females, participants from non-English-speaking backgrounds, with disability/illness, living in outer regional/remote areas or with chronic health conditions. People with a disability or high/very high psychological distress were twice as likely to report worse health as a result of missed/delayed care. Half (48.0%) the study participants used telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic and 81.9% indicated telehealth would be useful post-pandemic.ConclusionsThe COVID-19 pandemic impacted access to healthcare services, particularly for people with a disability, and chronic or mental health issues who also reported worse health. This may account for their higher use of telehealth services as an alternate way of accessing health care. Ongoing evaluation of telehealth services for vulnerable groups post-pandemic is required.","Ivancic, Bond, Nassar","https://doi.org/10.1071/AH22183","20221117","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41232,""
"Pexidartinib (PLX3397) through restoring hippocampal synaptic plasticity ameliorates social isolation-induced mood disorders","Social behavior is essential for the well-being and survival of individuals. However, social isolation is a serious public health issue, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, affecting a significant number of people worldwide, and can lead to serious psychological crises. Microglia, innate immune cells in the brain, are strongly implicated in the development of psychiatry. Although many microglial inhibitors have been used to treat depression, there is no literature report on pexidartinib (PLX3397) and social isolation. Herein, we adopted PLX3397 to investigate the role of microglia in the modulation of social isolation. Our results found that social isolation during adolescence caused depressive-like, but not anxiety-like behavior in mice in adulthood, with enhanced expression of the microglial marker Iba1 in the hippocampus. In addition, treatment with PLX3397 reduced the expression of the microglial marker Iba1, decreased the mRNA expression of IL-1ÃŽÂ², increased the mRNA expression of Arg1, elevated the protein levels of DCX and GluR1 and restored the dendritic spine branches and density, ultimately mitigating depressive-like behavior in mice. These findings suggest that inhibition of microglia in the hippocampus could ameliorate mood disorders in mice, providing a new perspective for the treatment of psychiatric disorders such as depression.","Wang, Wang, Deng, Zhang, He, Cao, Cui","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2022.109436","20221117","Microglia; Neuroprotection; Pexidartinib; Social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41233,""
"Social Support and Technology Use and Their Association with Mental and Physical Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic Among Asian Americans: The COMPASS Cross-Sectional Study","The global (COVID-19) pandemic disproportionately affected Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) and revealed significant health disparities with reports of increased discrimination/xenophobia. Among AAPIs, the pandemic exacerbated their social, linguistic, and geographic isolation. Social support may be especially important for AAPI given the salience of collectivism as a cultural value. Another mechanism for support among AAPI was technology use as it is generally widespread among this population, although older adults may not perceive the same benefits. We examined social support and technology use and their relationships to mental and physical health outcomes through the COVID-19 pandemic among AAPIs. Data were drawn from the COVID-19 Effects on the Mental and Physical Health of AAPI Survey Study (COMPASS) for the time period of October 2020 to February 2021. COMPASS was a cross-sectional, multi-lingual national survey conducted online, phone, and in-person to AAPI adults who were 18+ years of age in collaboration with academic and community partners in the U.S. Data were analyzed using multivariable linear regression using the outcome variables of mental and physical health with various predictors such as social support and technology use. We tested for interactions specific to age and ethnicity. Among 4,631 AAPIs (mean age 45.9 years, standard deviation 16.3 years; 63% female), we found that: 1) increased social support was associated with better physical health; 2) total social support was positively associated with better mental health; 3) higher technology use was associated with poorer mental health, and inversely associated with poorer physical health; 4) the association of technology use on mental health was weaker among those with low social support (vs. those with high social support); 5) adults under 60 years old (vs. 60 years old or older) were more negatively affected with social support and mental health; and, 6) Korean Americans appeared to be a high risk group for both poor mental health and physical health with increased technology use. Our paper identified mental and physical health needs along with supportive therapies observed among AAPI during the pandemic. Future research on how social support can be leveraged especially among AAPIs younger than 60, and how various types of technology are being utilized are important to guide the recovery efforts to address both mental and physical disparities across communities as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Park, Meyer, Dougan, Golden, Ta, Nam, Tsoh, Tzuang, Park","https://doi.org/10.2196/35748","20221117","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41234,""

Associations were investigated using multinomial regression. <b>Results:</b> Most students reported self-experienced effects on self-efficacy. Lowered self-efficacy was associated with symptoms of contagion, perceived worsening of mental health and low trust in universities' capacity to successfully manage the lockdown and transition to emergency remote education. Increased self-efficacy was associated with better perceived mental health and high trust in universities. <b>Conclusion:</b> The initial phase of the pandemic was associated with a larger proportion of students reporting self-experienced negative effects on academic self-efficacy.

"Psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada","During major pandemics such as COVID-19, the fear of being infected, uncertain prognoses, and the imposition of restrictions may result in greater odds of emotional and psychological distress. Hence, the present study examines the predictors of psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, and how they differ by gender. Data of 2,756 adults aged 18 years and above from a cross-sectional online survey conducted between July and October 2020 was used for this study. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was carried out. The results were presented as adjusted odds ratio (aOR) with their respective confidence interval (CI). Lower odds of psychological distress were found among males compared to females and among individuals aged 45-64 or 65-84 years compared to those aged 18-44. The odds of psychological distress decreased with a rise in income, with individuals whose annual income was greater than or equal to $100,000 being less likely to experience psychological distress compared to those whose income was less than $20,000. The odds of psychological distress were higher among residents of Ontario compared to residents of Quebec. Similarly, the odds of psychological distress were higher among individuals who reported experiencing COVID-19 symptoms compared to those who did not report any COVID-19 symptoms. The disaggregated results by gender showed that age, province, and self-reported COVID-19 symptoms had significant associations with psychological distress in both males and females, but these effects were more pronounced among females compared to males. In addition, income was negatively associated with psychological distress for both males and females, with this effect being stronger among males. Five exposure variables (gender, age, province, experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, and total annual income in 2019) significantly predicted the likelihood of reporting psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. Clearly, there is an imminent need to provide mental health support services to vulnerable groups. Additionally, interventions and policies aimed at combating psychological distress during pandemics such as COVID-19 should be gender specific.","Pongou, Ahinkorah, Maltais, Mabeu, Agarwal, Yaya","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0277238","20221117","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41236,""
"Lack of robust associations between prepandemic coping strategies and frontolimbic circuitry with depression and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic: A preregistered longitudinal study","The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing stressor that has resulted in the exacerbation of mental health problems worldwide. However, longitudinal studies that identify preexisting behavioral and neurobiological factors associated with mental health outcomes during the pandemic are lacking. Here, we examined associations between prepandemic coping strategy engagement and frontolimbic circuitry with internalizing symptoms during the pandemic. In 85 adults (71.8% female; age 18-30 years), we assessed prototypically adaptive coping strategies (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale), resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging functional connectivity (FC) of frontolimbic circuitry, and depression and anxiety symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory, Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders-Adult, respectively). We conducted general linear models to test preregistered hypotheses that (1) lower coping engagement prepandemic and (2) weaker frontolimbic FC prepandemic would predict elevated symptoms during the pandemic; and (3) coping would interact with FC to predict symptoms during the pandemic. Depression and anxiety symptoms worsened during the pandemic (ps &lt; .001). Prepandemic adaptive coping engagement and frontolimbic FC were not associated with depression or anxiety symptoms during the pandemic (uncorrected ps &gt; .05). Coping interacted with insula-rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) FC (p = .003, pFDR = .014) and with insula-ventral ACC FC (p &lt; .001, pFDR &lt; .001) to predict depression symptoms, but these findings did not survive FDR correction after removal of outliers. Findings from our preregistered study suggest that specific prepandemic factors, particularly adaptive coping and frontolimbic circuitry, are not robustly associated with emotional responses to the pandemic. Additional studies that identify preexisting neurobehavioral factors implicated in mental health outcomes during global health crises are needed.

"Physical Activity Among Adults in Rural Western North Carolina During the COVID-19 Pandemic","During the COVID-19 pandemic, measures implemented to protect community health may have influenced how and where people engaged in physical activity. In rural communities, access to resources, the environment, and socioeconomic status could play a role in how adults are physically active. Our study examined locations where rural residents of a county in western North Carolina engaged in physical activity early in the COVID-19 pandemic, their reasons for being physically active, and their perceptions of benefits and barriers related to engaging in physical activity. Rural adults (N =297) completed an online survey from August 3 through September 15, 2020, describing their physical activity during the summer of 2020. Data were analyzed using nonparametric measures. Survey respondents frequently engaged in physical activity in the home (57.8%), at parks or on trails (45.3%), and around their neighborhood (39.4%). The most common types of physical activities at parks or on trails were walking and hiking (99.5%). Across all locations, the most frequently reported reasons for engaging in physical activity were getting out of the house, maintaining fitness and mental health, and exercising. Our study showed many locations where rural residents were physically active and their reasons for participating in physical activity during the pandemic. Data about perceived benefits of and barriers to physical activity during the pandemic can assist in meeting the current need to increase physical activity levels in rural communities.","Creech, Towner, Battista","https://doi.org/10.5888/pcd19.220112","20221117","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41238,""
"An approach combining bioinformatics and machine learning to identify eight autophagy-related biomarkers and construct molecular mechanisms underlying COVID-19 and major depressive disorders","A lack of objective biomarkers is preventing the screening and diagnosis of COVID-19 combined with major depression disorder (COVID-19-MDD). The purpose of this study was to identify diagnostic biomarkers and gene regulatory mechanisms associated with autophagy; a crucial process significantly involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19-MDD. In this study, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened using GSE98793 from the GEO2R analysis (GEO) database, and intersected with the COVID-19-related gene (CRGs) and autophagy-related genes (ARGs) to obtain common genes involved in. Then, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses of these common genes were performed. Subsequently, the transcription factor (TF)-gene regulatory network and comorbidity network were constructed. In addition, 10 drug candidates were screened using the DSigDB database. To identify diagnostic markers, we used LASSO regression. In total, 13 common genes were screened, which were primarily enriched in lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum membranes, and other endomembrane systems also associated with autophagy. Additionally, these genes were involved in neurological cell signaling and have a functional role in pathways related to vascular endothelial growth factor, tyrosine kinase, autophagy, inflammation, immunity, and carcinogenesis. Tumors and psychiatric disorders were the most highly linked diseases to COVID-19. Finally, ten drug candidates and eight diagnostic markers (STX17, NRG1, RRAGD, XPO1, HERC1, HSP90AB1, EPHB2, and S1PR3) were screened. This is the first study to screen eight diagnostic markers and construct a gene regulatory network for COVID-19-MDD from the perspective of autophagy.

"Using patient-reported outcome measures to assess psychological well-being in a non-representative US general population during the COVID-19 pandemic","The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological well-being will likely be long-lasting. Efforts directed towards monitoring the onset and progression of distress and mental health disorders are needed to identify and prioritize at-risk populations. This study assesses the psychological well-being of the United States (US) general population during the early phase of the COVID-19 COVID-19 pandemic using validated patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). A cross-sectional study design was used. Adults (18Ã‚Â years or older) who could read and write in English were recruited through Prolific in May 2020. Participants completed a REDCap survey including demographic and health-related questions and three PROMs measuring global health (PROMIS-10 Global Health), anxiety [Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7)], and depression [Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)]. A multivariable linear regression was used to identify key factors associated with worse psychological well-being. Mean age of the 2023 participants was 31.92Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°11.57Ã‚Â years (range, 18-82).

"Accessible Care with High Patient Satisfaction: Telemedicine Use in Sickle Cell Disease","<b><i>Background:</i></b> The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated a rapid transition to telemedicine, providing a critical opportunity to study telemedicine satisfaction and usability in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). <b><i>Methods:</i></b> A cross-sectional survey was completed by 99 adult SCD patients who participated in at least one telemedicine visit between March and July 2020. Telemedicine satisfaction and usability were assessed with the Telemedicine Satisfaction Questionnaire (TSQ) and System Usability Scale (SUS), respectively. Preference for video visits was assessed with a 1-10 rating scale, with 10 indicating the highest preference. Measures of anxiety, depression, and patient activation were also assessed. Linear and logistic regressions were performed to evaluate for socioeconomic and psychosocial correlates of telemedicine satisfaction, usability, and preference. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Participants were 72% women, with a mean age of 39 years. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) TSQ was 56 (52-64) out of 70, indicating high satisfaction. The median (IQR) SUS was 72.5 (62.5-82.5) out of 100, indicating above average usability. Participants tended to prefer video visits for regular care (median [IQR] rating of 7 [5-9]) but not for management of acute pain (median [IQR] rating of 4 [2-8]). Neither satisfaction nor usability was associated with age or mental health. Telemedicine usability was positively associated with having private insurance compared with public insurance. Higher scores on both satisfaction and usability were associated with higher patient activation. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Adults with SCD report good usability and high satisfaction with telemedicine, across multiple demographic groups. Therefore, telemedicine has valuable potential to improve access to high-quality care for these patients.","Zhang, Xue, Boorman, Ruvalcaba, David, Lanzkron, Eakin","https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2022.0387","20221117","patient activation; patient satisfaction; sickle cell; telehealth; telemedicine; usability","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41242,""
"""Prison life is very hard and it's made harder if you're isolated"": COVID-19 risk mitigation strategies and the mental health of incarcerated women in California","This study aims to describe the COVID-19 risk mitigation strategies implemented in California prisons and the impact of these policies on the mental health of incarcerated women. The authors conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with ten women who were over the age of 50 and/or had a chronic illness and had been incarcerated in California prisons during the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors also interviewed ten health-care providers working in California jails or prisons during the pandemic. Interviews were analyzed using a grounded theory coding framework and triangulated with fieldnotes from ethnographic observations of medical and legal advocacy efforts during the pandemic. Participants described being locked in their cells for 23 hours per day or more, often for days, weeks or even months at a time in an effort to reduce the spread of COVID-19. For many participants, these lockdowns and the resulting isolation from loved ones both inside and outside of the prison were detrimental to both their physical and mental health. Participants reported that access to mental health care for those in the general population was limited prior to the pandemic, and that COVID-19 risk mitigation strategies, including the cessation of group programs and shift to cell-front mental health services, created further barriers. There has been little qualitative research on the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on incarcerated populations. This paper provides insight into the mental health effects of both the COVID-19 pandemic and COVID-19 risk mitigation strategies for the structurally vulnerable older women incarcerated in California prisons.","James, Riddle, Perez-Aguilar","https://doi.org/10.1108/IJPH-09-2021-0093","20221118","COVID-19; Correctional health care; Elderly prisoners; Mental health; Qualitative research; Women prisoners","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41243,""
"Evaluating the impact of COVID-19 on severity at admission and response to inpatient treatment for adult and adolescent patients with eating disorders","The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with increased hospitalization rates and worsened symptom severity in patients with eating disorders (ED), but most studies focused exclusively on adolescents. Further, research evaluating the impact of COVID-19 on response to inpatient treatment for ED is limited. This study aimed to compare demographic characteristics, symptom severity at admission, and discharge outcomes for adult and adolescent inpatients with EDs admitted before and after onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We expected the post-COVID cohort would report elevated symptomatology and poorer response to treatment compared to the pre-COVID cohort and that this effect would be amplified for adolescents. Patients were consecutively hospitalized adults and adolescents treated in a specialized behavioral integrated inpatient-partial hospitalization program for eating disorders between March 2018 and March 2022 (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 261). The effect of COVID-19 on symptomatology was moderated by age group such that adolescents in the post-COVID cohort, but not adults, reported higher levels of eating disorder and depressive symptoms compared to the pre-COVID cohort. No group differences were observed for discharge outcomes (rate of weight gain, length of stay, or percent target weight). Findings with respect to elevated symptomatology in adolescents but not adults may reflect the particularly negative impact of social isolation on adolescents. Future research is needed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on long-term treatment outcomes including relapse at 1-year, as well as the potential impact of COVID-19 on treatment availability for chronically ill adults or those with public insurance. Patients with eating disorders (ED) admitted to a specialty inpatient program after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic were younger and more likely to be male than those admitted pre-pandemic. Adolescents admitted post-COVID, but not adults, reported elevated ED and depressive symptoms compared to the pre-COVID cohort. Group differences were not observed for treatment response. Future research should evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on relapse risk in EDs.","Schreyer, Vanzhula, Guarda","https://doi.org/10.1002/eat.23855","20221117","COVID-19; adolescent; adult; eating disorders; inpatient treatment; treatment response","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41244,""
"Stakeholder Perspectives on the School Experiences of Students With Traumatic Brain Injury: The Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic on Service Delivery","For students with traumatic brain injury (TBI), the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated challenges they were already experiencing at school. This qualitative study employed focus groups and interviews with students, parents, school, and medical personnel to explore the school experiences of students with TBI. Thematic qualitative analyses were used. Key themes from the analysis include (a) incidence of brain injuries decreased; (b) screen time for students with TBI exacerbated symptoms; (c) COVID protocols at school made it difficult for educators to identify and provide accommodations for students with TBI; (d) COVID protocols at school could inadvertently exacerbate mental health difficulties after a TBI; and (e) COVID-related logistics increased the time between an injury and return to school or return to play. The results from this study suggest that professional development for teachers supporting students with TBI is needed, especially for online learning environments. Additionally, because mental/behavioral health concerns may arise for students with TBI in online learning environments, school health care providers can work with families to assess a student's mental health, making referrals to appropriate supports. There is a significant need for professional development and school-wide infrastructure supportive of students with TBI.","Unruh, Gomez, Slocumb, McCart, Davies, Haarbauer-Krupa, Glang","https://doi.org/10.1111/josh.13280","20221117","COVID-19; TBI; accommodations; concussion; remote learning; school services","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41245,""
"Short-term effect of internet-delivered mindfulness-based stress reduction on mental health, self-efficacy, and body image among women with breast cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic","During the COVID-19 pandemic, an Internet-Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (iMBSR) program was delivered and may be better than an in-person approach. Our study evaluated the effects of iMBSR intervention on mental health, self-efficacy, and body image in women with breast cancer in Taiwan. Sixty-seven women with breast cancer were allocated to a 6-week iMBSR (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°41) program or a waitlist control group (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°26), without heterogeneity between group characteristics.

"Virtual leadership in relation to employees' mental health, job satisfaction and perceptions of isolation: A scoping review","The significant increase of digital collaboration, driven by the current COVID-19 pandemic, is resulting in changes in working conditions and associated changes in the stress-strain perception of employees. Due to the evident leadership influence on employees' health and well-being in traditional work settings, there is a need to investigate leadership in virtual remote work contexts as well. The objective of this scoping review was to assess the extent and type of evidence concerning virtual leadership in relation to employees' mental health, job satisfaction and perceptions of isolation. A search was undertaken in five databases, PubMed, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX and Web of Science, as well as reference lists of included articles on 9th February 2021 and an update on 28th September 2021. The search strategy was limited to English, German and French language, peer reviewed journal articles published from January 2000 onwards. This scoping review was conducted in accordance with the JBI methodology for scoping reviews. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the JBI critical appraisal tools. A narrative synthesis was conducted. Nineteen studies met the eligibility criteria for this review. Overarching review findings suggested a positive link between virtual leadership and well-being, job satisfaction, and a negative link to psychological strain, stress and perceptions of isolation of digitally collaborating employees. By mapping the available evidence on virtual leadership in relation to health and work-related employee outcomes, the review identified many research gaps in terms of content and methodology. Due to limited data, causal relationships were not derived. Future research is needed to examine the complex cause-and-effect relationships of virtual leadership in more detail.","Efimov, Rohwer, Harth, Mache","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.960955","20221118","employee health; leaderÃ¢â‚¬â€œemployee interaction; remote work; virtual collaboration; virtual leadership","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41247,""
"ReStress mindset: An internet-delivered intervention that changes university students' mindset about stress in the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic","The aim of this study is to evaluate ""ReStress Mindset,"" an internet-delivered intervention that combines the Stress Mindset Training Program (SMTP) with Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). To that end, the current study determined whether the pilot study's findings on the intervention's effectiveness on stress mindset and stress response among university students in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, remained for 3 months following the completion of ""ReStress Mindset"" intervention. Twenty-six participants were randomly assigned to an intervention (<i>N</i> = 12) and a control (<i>N</i> = 14) group. Participants in the intervention group attended 5 weekly sessions online, between the second and third waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. All participants completed self-report questionnaires (Stress Mindset Measure, Satisfaction With Life Scale, Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-9, Perceived Stress Scale, Scale of Positive, and Negative Experience) before, at the end of the intervention and 3 months after the completion of the program. The ""ReStress Mindset"" intervention resulted in a statistically significant increase in ""stress-is-enhancing"" mindset (SIEM), life satisfaction, and self-efficacy against stress, as well as a statistically significant decrease in ""stress-is-debilitating"" mindset (SIDM), with these effects lasting 3 months after the program's completion. The findings of this study suggest that university students could benefit from the ""ReStress Mindset"" intervention in order to cultivate and maintain a positive stress mindset and increase their life satisfaction and self-efficacy against stress, even during the COVID-19 pandemic or any other highly stressful period or crisis.","Karampas, Pezirkianidis, Stalikas","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1036564","20221118","Acceptance and Commitment Therapy; internet-delivered interventions; stress; stress mindset; university students; university students stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41248,""
"Work schedule flexibility and teleworking were not good together during COVID-19 when testing their effects on work overload and mental health","The COVID-19 pandemic has driven organizations to implement various flexible work arrangements. Due to a lack of longitudinal studies, there is currently no consensus in specialized literature regarding the consequences of flexible work arrangements on employee mental health, as well any long term potential impacts. Using the Job Demand-Resource Model, this study documents consequences of the implementation of two types of flexible work arrangement: work schedule flexibility and teleworking on employee mental health over time, and the mediating role played by work overload during the accelerated implementation of flexible work arrangements in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a longitudinal design and probabilistic sampling, 209 workers participated in this study, twice answering a flexible work arrangement and mental health questionnaire during the pandemic. Findings of this moderated-mediation suggest that work schedule flexibility generates positive effects on mental health over time due to decreased work overload, but only for employees not working from home. These results offer theoretical and practical implications applicable to organizations considering implementation of flexible work arrangements, particularly with regard to how these flexible practices could support a balance between demand and resources, their impact on work overload, and employee mental health over time.","Yeves, Bargsted, Torres-Ochoa","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.998977","20221118","COVID-19; longitudinal study; mental health; new ways of working; teleworking; work overload; work schedule flexibility; working from home","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41249,""
"Mental health problems of preschool children during the COVID-19 home quarantine: A cross-sectional study in Shanghai, China","As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic spread across Shanghai, China, in late February 2022 and protective measures to mitigate its impact were enacted, this study aimed to estimate how home quarantine affected the mental health of preschool children in Shanghai, China and explore the association between lifestyle factors and mental health during this special period. A cross-sectional online survey of 2,110 preschool students from Shanghai, China, was conducted during May 20-25,2022. Preschooler' mental health (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, SDQ) and daily activities were reported by parents. The sample involved 2,110 children with a mean age of 4.65Ã¢â‚¬â€°years [standard deviation (SD): 0.91, range: 3-6Ã¢â‚¬â€°years]. Boys and children whose mother's education level were college and high school had higher rate of mental health problems. Boys had significantly higher rates of peer problems and prosocial behaviors than girls. The 3-year-old group had significantly higher rates of prosocial behaviors than other groups. As compared to the Shanghai norm and the SDQ results of preschool children in Shanghai in 2019 (SH2019), there were a significant decrease in emotional symptoms score, as well as a significant increase in conduct problems score. Additionally, peer problems score significantly increased compared to SH2019. Decreased time spent on daily sleep was associated with the increased risk for preschoolers' mental health problems. There was an increase in the frequency of emotional and behavioral problems, especially regarding conduct problems and peer problems, in preschool children during the COVID-19 home quarantine in Shanghai, China. Boys, younger preschool children and children whose mother's education level were college and high school may be especially vulnerable to emotional and behavioral problems. It was also found that decreased time spent on sleep may aggravate preschool children's mental health problems. It may be beneficial to differentiate and focus on conducting psychoeducation and implementing psycho-behavioral interventions to solve these issues.","Ma, Jiang, Chu, Zhang, Tian, Chen, Wang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1032244","20221118","COVID-19; emotional and behavioral problems; home quarantine; mental health; preschool children","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41250,""
"Back to live: Returning to in-person engagement with arts and culture in the Liverpool City Region","On July 19th 2021, the UK government lifted the COVID-19 restrictions that had been in place since March 2020, including wearing masks, social distancing, and all other legal requirements. The return to in-person events has been slow and gradual, showing that audiences are still cautious when (and if) they resume engaging in arts and culture. Patterns of audience behavior have also changed, shifting toward local attendance, greater digital and hybrid engagement, and openness to event format changes. As the arts and cultural industry recovers from the pandemic, it is important to adopt an audience-oriented approach and look at the changing patterns of engaging in arts and culture. This study aims to better understand the impact of the pandemic on the patterns of cultural and arts engagement. Eight qualitative interviews were conducted to explore the changes in arts and cultural engagement since the restrictions were lifted, focusing particularly on the audience's experiences of returning to in-person arts and cultural events in the Liverpool City Region (LCR). Using framework analysis, three themes were identified from the data: <i>The new normal: reframing pre-pandemic and pandemic experiences of arts and culture</i>, <i>Re-adjusting to in-person provision</i>, and <i>Moving forward: online and blended provision</i>. The findings show that the pandemic altered the ways that people engage in arts and culture. The ""new normal,"" a blend of pandemic and pre-pandemic experiences, illustrates how the pandemic has highlighted and reconfigured the importance of arts and culture, in terms of personal and cultural identity. Resuming in-person engagement after a long break, participants noted that they were able to feel more like themselves again. Arts and culture were perceived to be beneficial in rebuilding personal resilience and confidence. Engaging in arts and culture, following the isolating experience of the pandemic, has also helped participants feel reconnected to others through their shared experiences. Finally, the findings suggest that online provision remains vital for many, ensuring wider inclusivity, particularly for vulnerable audiences. At the same time, it is important to acknowledge the barriers to online inclusion and the possibility of this resulting in a growing digital divide.","Anisimovich, Chapple, Worsley, Watkins, Billington, Balabanova","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1011766","20221118","COVID-19; arts engagement; cultural industry; digital provision; mental health; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41251,""
"Negative effects of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: The interlinking of maternal attachment representation, coping strategies, parental behavior, and the child's mental health","For more than two years, young families have been confronted with a large number of restrictions and following burdens as a result of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In fact, it became evident, that the current circumstances are particularly stressful for child's mental health. With regard to the child's mental health in times of a pandemic, additional factors within the family, such as maternal attachment representations as well as coping strategies and parental behavior, may play an important role. This study aims to investigate the interplay of maternal attachment representation, coping strategies, parental behavior and child's mental health during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In this longitudinal study, previously collected data regarding maternal attachment representation and newly attained data from the SARS-CoV-2-pandemic-assesment (lack of coping strategies, children's mental health and parental behavior) were combined and analyzed. The data were collected in an online survey since beginning of the pandemic, including <i>NÃ¢â‚¬â€°</i>=Ã¢â‚¬â€°73 mothers. A path model was calculated in form of multiple linear regression. A path model could be confirmed, which indicates that insecure maternal attachment representation predicts lack of coping strategies during the pandemic [<i>b</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.55, 95%-CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°(4.51; 6.55), <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001]. Furthermore, lack of coping strategies predicts harmful parental behavior during the pandemic [<i>b</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.77, 95%-CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°(-1.27; -0.21), <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.007], which in turn predicts children's mental health problems, namely behavioral problems [<i>b</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.08, 95%-CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°(-0.14; -0.01), <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.027]. Presence of short-time work and decrease in income since beginning of the pandemic were used as control variables. This means that since the pandemic mothers with insecure attachment representation have an increased risk of having only a few coping mechanisms available, leading to harmful parental behaviors and ultimately affecting the mental health of their children. In conclusion, the pandemic could potentially have a particularly negative influence on mothers with an insecure attachment type and therefore on their children. Therefore, tailored interventions for families should be offered that both focus on the different types of mental health problems in children and support parents in their coping skills.","Gulde, KÃƒÂ¶hler-Dauner, Mayer, Ziegenhain, Fegert, Buchheim","https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2022.939538","20221118","SARS-CoV-2 pandemic; attachment representation; child's mental health; childhood maltreatment; coping; parental behavior","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41252,""

Perceived stress, coronavirus-related risks, and workplace factors were measured <i>via</i> self-report questionnaires at both time points. We conducted hierarchical linear regression to investigate the predictive factors for high stress. A total of 2,110 participants from seven countries and 4,240 participants from nine countries were enrolled at T1 and T2, respectively. Among them, 612 participated in both surveys. We called this cohort T1 + T2. High stress was reported in 53.8 and 61.6% of participants at T1 and T2, respectively.

The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of COVID-19-related knowledge on mental health, healthcare behaviors, and quality of life among the elderly with NCDs in Northern Thailand. In this cross-sectional study, the participants were 450 elderly people with NCDs, living in the Chiang Rai province, Northern Thailand. Random sampling was applied to select the subjects. Data collection included demographic information, COVID-19-related knowledge, healthcare behaviors, the Suanprung Stress Test-20, the Thai General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) for the assessment of mental health, and the Thai version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF. Almost half of the participants (45.6%) had poor knowledge about COVID-19. More than half of the sample had high stress (52.0%) and a low score in healthcare behaviors (64.9%), while approximately one-third of the participants had mental health problems (34.0%). The overall quality of life during the COVID-19 pandemic was moderate (70.7%). The score of COVID-19-related knowledge was significantly correlated with scores of stress (<i>r</i> = -0.85), mental health (<i>r</i> = -0.74), healthcare behaviors (<i>r</i> = 0.50), and quality of life (<i>r</i> = 0.33). Multiple linear regression found that history of COVID-19 detection and COVID-19-related knowledge were associated with scores of stress and quality of life (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Multiple logistic regression showed that history of COVID-19 detection (OR = 4.48, 95% CI = 1.45-13.84) and COVID-19-related knowledge (OR = 0.23, 95% CI = 0.17-0.31) were associated with mental health problem (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The findings emphasize the importance of COVID-19-related knowledge concerning the improvement of self-care behaviors and quality of life in the elderly population with NCDs during the pandemic, especially due to the high rate of stress and mental health problems documented in our sample. Health education interventions for this vulnerable population should be organized.","Napalai, Seangpraw, Boonyathee, Ong-Artborirak","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.993531","20221118","COVID-19; NCD; behaviors; elderly; mental health; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41255,""
"Health impacts with telework on workers: A scoping review before the COVID-19 pandemic","Telework has dramatically increased due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and the health impacts related to telework have become major concerns. Some studies have shown that telework has both positive and negative impacts. However, during the pandemic, the influence of COVID-19 is too strong to estimate the health effects of telework. Therefore, this scoping review investigated a comprehensive overview of those impacts based on studies conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic. We searched keywords related to telework in five databases: PubMed, Scopus, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane Library, and Ichu-Shi Web. We included articles written in English and Japanese and published from January 2009 to December 2020. One author extracted data, and four authors were paired into two groups. All authors independently conducted the first and second screening and checked the results in pairs. Any disagreements were resolved by reaching a consensus among all authors. All screening and strategies were performed with the consent of all authors. Twenty-nine quantitative studies published in 12 countries were extracted. The outcomes included 10 studies on physical and lifestyle outcomes, 25 studies on stress and mental health outcomes, and 13 studies on quality-of-life and wellbeing outcomes. Telework increased sitting time in one study, and two studies showed improvement in behavior, such as reducing smoking or drinking due to telework. While six studies reported subjective stress levels improved by telework, the results for depression, anxiety, and other disorders varied across those studies, and the social or individual factors further complicated the situation. Telework is potentially associated with a shift to healthier lifestyles but also the potential for inverse correlation to extend sedentary time. Mental stress indicators depend on the social and individual situations, and very few intervention studies on teleworking existed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our review identified a lack of intervention and comparative research on health problems with telework and revealed a need to conduct research with clear comparisons in post-COVID-19 studies. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42021203104, identifier: CRD42021203104.","Furuya, Nakazawa, Fukai, Tatemichi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.981270","20221118","before COVID-19; health impacts; telecommuting; telework; teleworker health; work from home","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41256,""
"How to cushion economic recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic: Fiscal or monetary policies?","The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has brought the global economy to a crisis: how to choose the optimal policy tools to cope with the external impacts has attracted worldwide attention. The research evaluates the effects of China's fiscal and monetary policies in promoting economic recovery by establishing a CGE model. Five representative countermeasures such as exempting value-added tax (VAT) and cutting loan rates are studied. The results indicate that: from the aspect of fiscal policies, increasing investment shows a better effect in boosting economy compared with exempting VAT and increasing medical care expenditures; however, the policy also causes price inflation (+0.45%) and crowding-out of enterprise investment (-0.03%). From the aspect of monetary policies, providing targeted loans to enterprises has a better boosting effect on economy compared with cutting loan rates. In the choice between fiscal or monetary policies, fiscal policies exert better effects (household income, +0.95%) when taking the improvement of residents' welfare as the objective. If taking promoting recovery of enterprises and boosting the economy as objectives, monetary policies are found to be better (GDP, +1.99%). Therefore, fiscal and monetary policies should be guided by different objectives and allowed to work in a synergistic manner.","Wu, Luo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.960655","20221118","COVID-19; computable general equilibrium model; economic recovery; fiscal policy; monetary policy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41257,""
"Social networking use, mental health, and quality of life of Hong Kong adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic","During the COVID-19 pandemic, adolescents' use of social networking sites/apps has surged, and their mental health and quality of life have also been significantly affected by the pandemic and its associated social-protection measures. The present study first examined the prevalence of social networking sites/apps use and social networking addiction, the mental health status, and the health-related quality of life among Hong Kong adolescent students. We further investigated the associations of the youths' daily use of social networking sites/apps and their social networking addiction with their mental health and quality of life during the pandemic. A total of 1,147 students (age = 15.20 Ã‚Â± 0.53 years) recruited from 12 randomly selected local secondary schools in Hong Kong participated in a questionnaire survey in classroom settings between January and June, 2020, right after the COVID-19 outbreak. The questionnaire includes demographic characteristics and scales that measure social networking sites/apps use and social networking addiction, mental health, and quality of life. Approximately 46.4% of the participants reported using social networking sites/apps often or very often, and 7.8% met the criteria for social networking addiction using Bergen's Social Media Addiction Scale. The prevalence of mild to extremely severe depression, anxiety, and stress among the adolescents stood at 39.6, 37.5, 48.8%, respectively, and the participants' physical, social, and school functioning were lower than the norms of healthy adolescents before the pandemic. Participants who used social networking sites/apps but for &lt;3 h per day (excluding students who never used social networking sites/apps) showed significantly fewer problems of depression, anxiety, and stress than did those who spent more than 3 h per day on social networking sites/apps. Social networking addiction was found to be consistently associated with poor mental health and health-related quality of life. This study provides important evidence supporting the potential protective effect of guiding adolescents to use social networking sites/apps appropriately in order to mitigate their negative emotions during contexts such as that of the pandemic; it further points to the need to provide extra support to promote the well-being of young people, especially those in disadvantaged situations (e.g., non-intact family) during and after the pandemic.","Yu, Du","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.1040169","20221118","adolescent; mental health; online social networking; pandemic; quality of life; social networking addiction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41258,""
"Relationship between physical activity levels of Portuguese physical therapists and mental health during a COVID-19 pandemic: Being active is the key","Physical activity is essential for a healthy life and quality of life, representing a fundamental role in individuals' physical and mental health. Concomitantly, the physical therapist, through the promotion of physical activity and exercise, can improve mental health, an essential factor in the current pandemic, triggering anxiety, fear, and depression crisis. To verify physical activity among Portuguese physical therapists and its association with mental health during pandemic times. An online questionnaire was applied through social media to all Portuguese physical therapists between October 21, 2021, and January 14, 2022. It contained general characterization questions of the sample, the IPAQ-SF questionnaire to assess physical activity levels, the Goldberg General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28), which assesses the levels of mental health and the WHO Well-Being Index (WHO-5) to assess the subjective wellbeing. The sample totaled 286 respondents (82% female), with a mean age of 33. Of the total answers, 82% practiced physical activity, 45% had moderate levels of physical activity, and 19% vigorous. Physical therapists in these categories had lower values in the GHQ-28 and higher in the WHO-5. Those with better mental health also showed better subjective wellbeing (<i>r</i> = -0.571, <i>p</i> = 0.000). The data obtained showed that physical therapists mostly have moderate and vigorous levels of physical activity and that physical activity positively influences individuals' mental health and wellbeing, which proved to be a key factor due to the pandemic situation.","Almeida, Grilo, Carolino, TomÃƒÂ¡s","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.986158","20221118","COVID-19; mental health; pandemic; physical activity; physical therapists","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41259,""
"Influence of COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination on the menstrual cycle: A retrospective study in Hungary","Observations of women and clinicians indicated that the prevalence of menstrual cycle problems has escalated during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it was not clear whether the observed menstrual cycle changes were related to vaccination, the disease itself or the COVID-19 pandemic-induced psychological alterations. To systematically analyze this question, we conducted a human online survey in women aged between 18 and 65 in Hungary. The menstrual cycle of 1563 individuals were analyzed in our study in relation to the COVID-19 vaccination, the COVID-19 infection, the pandemic itself and the mental health. We found no association between the COVID-19 vaccination, the vaccine types or the COVID-19 infection and the menstrual cycle changes. We also evaluated the menstrual cycle alterations focusing on three parameters of the menstrual cycle including the cycle length, the menses length and the cycle regularity in three pandemic phases: the pre-peak, the peak and the post-peak period in Hungary. Our finding was that the length of the menstrual cycle did not change in any of the periods. However, the menses length increased, while the regularity of the menstrual cycle decreased significantly during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic when comparing to the pre- and post-peak periods. In addition, we exhibited that the length and the regularity of the menstrual cycle both correlated with the severity of depression during the post-peak period, therefore we concluded that the reported menstrual cycle abnormalities during the peak of COVID-19 in Hungary might be the result of elevated depressive symptoms.","BarabÃƒÂ¡s, Makkai, Farkas, HorvÃƒÂ¡th, Nagy, VÃƒÂ¡radi, Zelena","https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2022.974788","20221118","COVID-19 pandemic; COVID-19 vaccines; SARS-Cov-2 infection; depression; human surveys; menstrual cycle","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41260,""

"Factors associated with depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms among men in a rural area in Vietnam during COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected health and well-being worldwide, and its psychological effects are receiving substantial attention in the scientific literature. Research to date shows that the pandemic has increased prevalences of depression, anxiety, and stress. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of mental health symptoms and identify the associated factors among men in a rural area of Vietnam during the COVID-19 pandemic. During July 15-31, 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of 1,085 men from 18 years old in 11 rural districts in Thanh Hoa province, Vietnam, and assessed their mental health using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale - 21 Items (DASS-21). Outcomes assessed were have a symptom of depression, anxiety, and stress; risk factors measured included age, religion, marital status, education, occupation, and financial status. Multiple linear regression was performed to determine the statistical significance of associations between risk factors and mental health symptoms. Findings showed that the prevalences of having a symptom of depression, anxiety and stress among participants were 6.39, 9.72, and 5.65%, respectively. Regression model showed being younger (95% CI: -0.030; -0.004, <i>p</i> = 0.001), men had high school degree (95% CI: -0.671; -0.074, <i>p</i> = 0.014), men living in nearly poor houshoulds (95% CI: 0.067, 1.905, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and poor housholds (95% CI: 0.608; 2.721, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) had significantly lower depression scores than others. Prevalences of having symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress were much higher than in similar previous research in rural Vietnam, suggesting that mental health problems among men in this setting became more common during the COVID-19 pandemic. Age, religion, level of education and family income status were statistically significant predictors of mental health problems. These findings provide useful insights into the impact of pandemics on mental health.","Hoang, Nguyen","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.987686","20221118","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; men; rural area; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41264,""
"Perspective: Coping with Covid-19: An isolation risk assessment and management guideline for healthcare staff","The mental health consequences of pandemic isolation have been well documented extending from psychological conditions such as anxiety and depression to increased falls risk, medication errors and delirium. Whilst risk factors associated with isolation are known, there remains a gap in the guidance for healthcare staff on how to assess for these risks and develop effective management plans. Using a structured professional judgement (SPJ) approach and the author's recent experience providing consultation and leadership to clinical staff working with at-risk patients during the pandemic, an isolation risk assessment and management guideline was developed. SPJ is an evidenced-based analytical method used to understand and mitigate risk that was primarily developed for the assessment and management of aggression and violence. This paper discusses an evidenced-based process used to develop the guideline and the application of its use from the author's clinical experience.","Edwards, Cowan, Brunero","https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.13093","20221117","COVID-19; assessment; isolation; mental health; risk","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41265,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children with and without affective dysregulation and their families","Analyzing COVID-19-related stress in children with affective dysregulation (AD) seems especially interesting, as these children typically show heightened reactivity to potential stressors and an increased use of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies. Children in out-of-home care often show similar characteristics to those with AD. Since COVID-19 has led to interruptions in psychotherapy for children with mental health problems and to potentially reduced resources to implement treatment strategies in daily life in families or in out-of-home care, these children might show a particularly strong increase in stress levels. In this study, 512 families of children without AD and 269 families of children with AD reported on COVID-19-related stress. The sample comprised screened community, clinical, and out-of-home care samples. Sociodemographic factors, characteristics of child and caregiver before the pandemic, and perceived change in external conditions due to the pandemic were examined as potential risk or protective factors. Interestingly, only small differences emerged between families of children with and without AD or between subsamples: families of children with AD and families in out-of-home care were affected slightly more, but in few domains. Improvements and deteriorations in treatment-related effects balanced each other out. Overall, the most stable and strongest risk factor for COVID-19-related stress was perceived negative change in external conditions-particularly family conditions and leisure options. Additionally, caregiver characteristics emerged as risk factors across most models. Actions to support families during the pandemic should, therefore, facilitate external conditions and focus on caregiver characteristic to reduce familial COVID-19-related stress.

"Neuropsychiatric Aspects of Long COVID: A Comprehensive Review","Although some patients have persistent symptoms or develop new symptoms following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, neuropsychiatric aspects of long COVID are not well known. This review summarizes and provides an update on the neuropsychiatric dimensions of long COVID. Its neuropsychiatric manifestations commonly include fatigue, cognitive impairment, sleep disorders, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. There are no specific tests for long COVID, but some characteristic findings such as hypometabolism on positron emission tomography have been reported. The possible mechanisms of long COVID include inflammation, ischemic effects, direct viral invasion, and social and environmental changes. Some patient characteristics and the severity and complications of acute COVID-19 infection may be associated with an increased risk of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Long COVID may resolve spontaneously or persist, depending on the type of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Although established treatments are lacking, various psychological and pharmacological treatments have been attempted. Vaccination against COVID-19 infection plays a key role in the prevention of long coronavirus disease. With differences among the SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the omicron variant, the aspects of long COVID are likely to change in the future. Further studies clarifying the aspects of long COVID to develop effective treatments are warranted. This article is protected by copyright.

"A Preliminary Study of Stress, Mental Health, and Pain Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic and Odds of Persistent Prescription Opioid Use","The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with increased opioid prescribing. It is not known if perceived COVID-19 related stress is associated with increased odds of long-term opioid use. To determine if greater COVID-19-related stress and worsening pain attributed to the pandemic was associated with LTOT over a 6-month observation period. Longitudinal cohort. Patients (n=477) from two midwestern health care systems, with any acute or chronic non-cancer pain, starting a new period of 30-90-day prescription opioid use, were invited to participate in the Prescription Opioids and Depression Pathways Cohort Study, a longitudinal survey study of pain, opioid use, and mental health outcomes. Baseline and 6-month follow-up assessments were used to measure the association between perceived COVID-19 stressors, the perception that pain was made worse by the pandemic and the odds of persistent opioid use, i.e., remaining a prescription opioid user at 6-month follow-up. Multivariate models controlled for demographics, opioid dose, and change in pain characteristics, mental health measures, and social support. Participants were, on average, 53.9 (Ã‚Â±11.4) years of age, 67.1% White race, and 70.9% female. The most frequently endorsed COVID-19 stressor was ""worry about health of self/others"" (85.7% endorsed) and the least endorsed was ""worsened pain due to pandemic"" (26.2%). After adjusting for all covariates, ""worsened pain due to pandemic"" (OR=2.88; 95%CI: 1.33-6.22), change in pain interference (OR=1.20; 95%CI: 1.04-1.38), and change in vital exhaustion (OR=0.90; 95%CI: 0.82-0.99) remained significantly associated with persistent opioid use. Patients who attribute worsening pain to the COVID-19 pandemic are more likely to be persistent opioid users. Further research is warranted to identify mechanisms underlying this association. Clinicians may consider discussing pain in the context of the pandemic to identify patients at high risk for persistent opioid use.","Scherrer, Miller-Matero, Sullivan, Chrusciel, Salas, Davidson, Zabel, Wilson, Lustman, Ahmedani","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-022-07940-4","20221117","COVID-19; cohort; epidemiology; opioid; pain","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41268,""

Also, the prevalence of depression and anxiety during the pandemic in this group was 46% (95% CI 29-64%; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.00) and 43% (95% CI: 24-63%; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.00), respectively. The prevalence of tremor and sleep problems were higher than those of other symptoms in the studied population. According to the results, there was no significant difference in the risk of COVID-19 infection between Parkinson's patients and healthy people. In other words, the risk of COVID-19 infection was equal in both groups (RRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.00 (CI 95% 0.77-1.30%; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.15)). The results showed mortality and hospitalization rates of the elderly with Parkinson's disease were not significantly different from those of the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and mental disorders increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. So, designing and developing more specific studies, like cohort studies, with large sample size is required for assessing these associations.","Afraie, Moradi, Mohammadzedeh, Azami, Riyahifar, Moradi","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13760-022-02141-6","20221117","COVID-19; Meta-analysis; ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease; Systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41269,""
"The impact of COVID-19 on psychiatric and mental health services in Europe: suffering experienced by professionals","The COVID-19 pandemic has not only impacted intensive care units, but all healthcare services generally. This PsyGipo2C project specifically investigates how psychiatry and mental health professionals have been affected by the reorganizations and constraints imposed, which have reshaped their often already difficult working conditions. Our research combined quantitative and qualitative methods, surveying and interviewing health professionals of all occupations working in psychiatric and mental health services. A questionnaire was completed by 1241 professionals from 10 European countries, and 13 group interviews were conducted across 5 countries. In addition to this, 31 individual interviews were conducted in Belgium and France. Among the questionnaire respondents, 70.2% felt that their workload had increased, particularly due to their tasks being diversified and due to increased complexity in the provision of care. 48.9% felt that finding a work-life balance had become more difficult, and 59.5% felt their health had been affected by the crisis. The impact of the health crisis nevertheless varied across professions: our data provides insight into how the health measures have had a differential impact on professional tasks and roles across the various categories of occupations, obliging professionals to make various adaptations. The distress incurred has been linked not only to these new constraints in their work, but also to the combination of these with other pressures in their personal lives, which has consequently compromised their well-being and their ability to cope with multiple demands. The COVID-19 health crisis has had varying impacts depending on the profession and access to remote work, sometimes leading to conflicts within the teams. The suffering expressed by the professionals was tied to their values and patterns of investment in work. Our research also highlights how these professionals made little use of the psychological supports offered, probably due to a reluctance to acknowledge that their mental health was affected.","Kane, Baumgart, Rusch, Deloyer, Fuenzalida, Kelemen, Krzystanek, Marazziti, Moraitou, Reunanen, Shyhrete, Thome, Verwaest, Fond-Harmant, Denis","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-022-08776-8","20221118","COVID-19; Epidemic; Ethics; Health crisis; Mental health; Occupational health; Pandemic; Professional practices; Psychiatry; SARS-CoV-2; Telepsychiatry; Work-life balance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41270,""
"Suicidal ideation among Canadian adults during the COVID-19 pandemic: the role of psychosocial factors and substance use behaviours","Suicide is one of the most important and increasing public health agenda around the world. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns have been raised about the potential adverse impacts of the pandemic on suicide-related outcomes. The main objective of this study was to examine the association of psychosocial risk factors (mental health illnesses and social isolation) and substance use behaviors (cannabis and alcohol consumption) with suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic among Canadian adults. The study was conducted based on a total of 4005 persons 18Ã‚Â years of age or older, living in Canada's ten provinces. The data used in this study were collected during April 20-28, 2021, by Mental Health Research Canada. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the association of mental health conditions (anxiety, depression, and other mood disorder) before and since COVID-19 outbreaks, social isolation and living arrangement, as well as cannabis and alcohol consumption with suicidal ideation during COVID-19. The results of adjusted logistic regression showed that the odds of suicidal ideation were 1.526 times higher (95% CI:1.082-2.152) among those who reported continued negative impacts of social isolation. The odds of suicidal ideation were also higher for those who were diagnosed as having depression before (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.136, 95% CI: 2.376-4.138) and since the COVID-19 pandemic (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.019, 95% CI:1.929-4.726) and 1.627 times higher (95% CI: 1.225-2.163) for those who were diagnosed as having anxiety before the COVID-19 pandemic. Those who reported having increased and those who were consuming cannabis during the pandemic were 1.970 (95% CI: 1.463-2.653) and 1.509 times (95% CI: 1.158-1.966) more likely to have thought of suicide than non-takers, respectively. Given the significant associations of psychosocial factors (mental health illnesses and social isolation) and cannabis use with suicidal ideation, more attention and support need to be given to adults who had mental health conditions before and since COVID-19, those who were negatively impacted by social isolation, and those are exposed to substance use (cannabis).","Geda, Feng, Peters","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-04353-9","20221118","Anxiety; COVID-19; Cannabis use; Depression; Mood disorder; Social isolation; Suicidal ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41271,""
"School closures and mental health, wellbeing and health behaviours among children and adolescents during the second COVID-19 wave: a systematic review of the literature","to evaluate the impact of school closures, as a measure to contain the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection, on the psychological well-being of students of all levels starting from the 2020-2021 school year. a systematic literature review was conducted according to the PRISMA 2020 Guidelines. The literature search was conducted on 4 different databases: MedLine, Embase, PsycINFO, and L.OVE Platform. Quantitative observational studies published until 10.01.2022 were included. Studies conducted during the first pandemic wave, i.e., during the 2019-2020 school year and/or during the mandatory lockdown or confinement period, were excluded. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed with validated scales. Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment were carried out independently by two authors. children, adolescents, and young people attending all levels of education (including universities) and, for reasons related to COVID-19, having a suspension of ""in presence"" school or attending classes remotely. a. outcomes directly related to mental health: suicides, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations for psychiatric problems; anxiety and depression, emotional difficulties, feelings of loneliness and isolation; b. well-being outcomes: sleep quality, perceived well-being (by child/adolescent/youth or referred by parents); c. health-related behaviours: tobacco smoking, alcohol, drug use. Outcomes related to school/academic performance, physical health, and those related to parents were not considered. after having removed duplicate articles, 2,830 records were retrieved with the bibliographic search. Twelve studies (2 uncontrolled before-after studies and 10 cross sectional surveys) were included, involving a total of 27,787 participants. Three studies involved university students, 2 involved high school students, and the remaining involved a mixed population of students attending primary and middle schools. The studies were conducted between September 2020 and April 2021. The methodological quality was rated as high in five studies and intermediate in the remaining studies. Due to the high heterogeneity of outcome measures and statistical analyses performed among the included studies, it was not possible to conduct a meta-analysis of the results of the considered publications. Nevertheless, the present review showed a clear signal of increase in mental health problems in relation to school closure or virtual instruction. In particular, results suggest evidence of association between school closure and risk of suicidal attempts or thoughts, mental health symptoms such as anxiety, depression, emotional disorders, psychological stress. Sleeping problems, drug and alcohol addiction were poorly studied. despite the limitations of the included studies and possible residual confounding and contamination due to restrictive measures and social isolation implemented during the pandemic, the available evidence confirms the negative impact on students' mental health associated with school closures and distance learning. Given the availability of vaccination also for young children, a long period of school closure should be avoided also in the case of the emergence of new pandemic waves.","Saulle, De Sario, Bena, Capra, Culasso, Davoli, De Lorenzo, Lattke, Marra, Mitrova, Paduano, Rabaglietti, Sartini, Minozzi","https://doi.org/10.19191/EP22.5-6.A542.089","20221118","COVID-19; psychological wellbeing; school closure; systematic review; youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41272,""
"Design, methods, and recruitment outcomes of the Veterans' pain care organizational improvement comparative effectiveness (VOICE) study","The Veterans' Pain Care Organizational Improvement Comparative Effectiveness (VOICE) study is a 12-month pragmatic randomized comparative effectiveness trial conducted at ten United States Veterans Affairs (VA) health care sites. The overall goal was to test interventions to improve pain while reducing opioid use among VA patients with moderate-severe chronic pain despite treatment with long-term opioid therapy (LTOT). Aims were 1) to compare lower-intensity telecare collaborative pain management (TCM) versus higher-intensity integrated pain team management (IPT), and 2) to test the option of switching to buprenorphine (versus no option) in a high-dose subgroup. Recruitment challenges included secular trends in opioid prescribing and the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were recruited over 3.5Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years. Of 6966 potentially eligible patients, 4731 (67.9%) were contacted for telephone eligibility interview; of those contacted, 3398 (71.8%) declined participation, 359 (7.6%) were ineligible, 821 (24.2%) enrolled, and 820 (24.1%) were randomized. The most common reason for declining was satisfaction with pain care (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯731). The most common reason for ineligibility was not having moderate-severe chronic pain (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯110). Compared with the potentially eligible population, randomized participants were slightly younger, more often female, had similar prescribed opioids, and had similar or higher rates of pain and mental health diagnoses. The enrolled patient number was lower than the original target, but sufficient to power planned analyses. In conclusion, the VOICE trial enrolled a diverse sample similar to the population of VA patients receiving LTOT. Results will add substantially to limited existing evidence for interventions to improve pain while reducing opioid use.

"The experiences and perceptions of wellbeing provision among English ambulance services staff: a multi-method qualitative study","NHS ambulance service staff are at risk of poor physical and mental wellbeing because of the likelihood of encountering stressful and traumatic incidents. While reducing sickness absence and improving wellbeing support to ambulance staff is a key NHS priority, few studies have empirically documented a national picture to inform policy and service re-design. The study aimed to understand how ambulance service trusts in England deal with staff health and wellbeing, as well as how the staff perceive and use wellbeing services. To achieve our aim, we undertook semi-structured telephone interviews with health and wellbeing leads and patient-facing ambulance staff, as well as undertaking documentary analysis of ambulance trust policies on wellbeing. The study was conducted both before and during the UK first COVID-19 pandemic wave. The University of Lincoln ethics committee and the Health Research Authority (HRA) granted ethical approval. Overall, we analysed 57 staff wellbeing policy documents across all Trusts. Additionally, we interviewed a Health and Wellbeing Lead in eight Trusts as well as 25 ambulance and control room staff across three Trusts. The study highlighted clear variations between organisational and individual actions to support wellbeing across Trust policies. Wellbeing leads acknowledged real 'tensions' between individual and organisational responsibility for wellbeing. Behaviour changes around diet and exercise were perceived to have a positive effect on the overall mental health of their workforce. Wellbeing leads generally agreed that mental health was given primacy over other wellbeing initiatives. Variable experiences of health and wellbeing support were partly contingent on the levels of management support, impacted by organisational culture and service delivery challenges for staff. Ambulance service work can impact upon physical and mental health, which necessitates effective support for staff mental health and wellbeing. Increasing the knowledge of line managers around the availability of services could improve engagement.","Phung, Sanderson, Pritchard, Bell, Hird, Wankhade, Asghar, Siriwardena","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-022-08729-1","20221118","Ambulance; Emergency medical services; Mental health and wellbeing; Humans; Ambulances; Pandemics; COVID-19; Qualitative Research; Health Services","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41274,""

Both parents completed six valid and reliable questionnaires independently 1-2Ã¢â‚¬â€°days and 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°months after delivery: Beck Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory-II, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, Couple Satisfaction Index and Life Satisfaction Scale-4. Anxiety was more common but couple satisfaction better in both parents during the COVID-19 pandemic than in 2015. Depressive symptoms and perceived stress were similarly low, and life satisfaction was similarly high in both cohorts, indicating ample parental resilience.

"Longitudinal impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health of children in the ABCD study cohort","A large longitudinal study on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in children is limited. This large-scale longitudinal observational study examines the pandemic's effects on children's mental health while considering the effects of parental care styles. The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study is a large-scale, longitudinal multicenter study in the United States. Of the 11,875 children aged 9-12Ã‚Â years in its database, 4702 subjects were selected for this study. The child behavior checklist and parental monitoring questionnaire (PMQ) were used to assess children's mental health and parental support styles, respectively. Data collected before and during the pandemic were compared. Withdrawn/depressed and attention problems significantly worsened during compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001, withdrawn/depressed; 53.4Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.7 to 53.7Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.9, attention problems; 53.4Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.4 to 53.6Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.6). However, the T scores are in the normal range both before and during the crisis. Simple slope analysis found withdrawn/depressed problems and aggressive behavior worsened when the PMQ was 1 SD below the mean, and rule-breaking behavior was improved when the PMQ was 1 SD above the mean. While the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated children's depressive symptoms and attention issues, the effects may be minor. Additionally, parental involvement serve as a protective factor for the child's mental health even during the pandemic.","Hamatani, Hiraoka, Makita, Tomoda, Mizuno","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-22694-z","20221118","Child; Adolescent; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; COVID-19; Longitudinal Studies; Parents","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41276,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on physical and mental functioning in adolescents with disabilities in a sports nongovernmental organization","This study aimed to assess physical and mental health, and health-related quality of life (HRQL) parameters in adolescents with physical disabilities enrolled in a sports nongovernmental organization (NGO) versus adolescents without disabilities during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This cross-sectional study included 30 adolescents with disabilities and 86 adolescents without disabilities who responded to an online questionnaire with sociodemographic data and self-rated healthcare routine information during the COVID-19 quarantine. Validated self-report versions of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 (PedsQL 4.0), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Pediatric Outcome Data Collection Instrument (PODCI) were also applied. The median of emotional [4 (0-10) vs. 5 (0-10), p=0.018] and prosocial [7 (0-10) vs. 9 (3-10), p=0.006] problems was lower in adolescents with disabilities versus adolescents without disabilities.

"Influencing factors of anxiety and depression of discharged COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China","This study is intended to assess the prevalence of depression and anxiety in individuals who had recovered from COVID-19 and been discharged from hospital (RD hereafter) in Wuhan, China, and to explore the factors associated with these mental disorders. Participants of this study were the RD who were infected at the beginning of the outbreak from 13 communities in Jianghan District of Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China by convenience sampling in mid-2021. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire, the Patient Health Questionnaire, the Short Version of COVID-19 Stigma Scale, the Peace of Mind Scale, the Resilience Style Questionnaire, and the Perceived Social Support Questionnaire were used to collect relevant information of the participants. Descriptive analyses, Pearson correlation analysis, and logistic regression analysis were used to describe and analyze the data and to examine the factors associated with the mental health status of this population. In total, we recruited 1601 participants from 3059 COVID-19 patients, and 1541 participants completed the questionnaire survey, with a response rate of 96.25%. Finally, 1297 participants met the inclusion and exclusion criteria in this study, of whom 28.8% and 37.9% reported mild to severe levels of anxiety and depression symptoms. Perceived better mental health status during hospitalization, higher frequency of alcohol use per week, peace of mind, higher education level, and resilience were negatively associated with anxiety, while stigma and history of psychological or emotional counseling before infection was positively associated with anxiety. More severe clinical classification of COVID-19 and stigma (AOR = 1.057, P&lt;0.001) were both positively associated with depression, while perceived better mental health status during hospitalization (AOR = 0.564, P&lt;0.001), higher frequency of alcohol use per week (AOR = 0.462, P = 0.004), peace of mind (AOR = 0.857, P&lt;0.001), and social support (AOR = 0.972, P = 0.034) were negatively associated with depression.

"Economic precarity, loneliness, and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic","The US population faced stressors associated with suicide brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding the relationship between stressors and suicidal ideation in the context of the pandemic may inform policies and programs to prevent suicidality and suicide. We compared suicidal ideation between two cross-sectional, nationally representative surveys of adults in the United States: the 2017-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and the 2020 COVID-19 and Life Stressors Impact on Mental Health and Well-being (CLIMB) study (conducted March 31 to April 13). We estimated the association between stressors and suicidal ideation in bivariable and multivariable Poisson regression models with robust variance to generate unadjusted and adjusted prevalence ratios (PR and aPR). Suicidal ideation increased from 3.4% in the 2017-2018 NHANES to 16.3% in the 2020 CLIMB survey, and from 5.8% to 26.4% among participants in low-income households. In the multivariable model, difficulty paying rent (aPR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.2-2.1) and feeling alone (aPR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.5-2.4) were associated with suicidal ideation but job loss was not (aPR: 0.9, 95% CI: 0.6 to 1.2). Suicidal ideation increased by 12.9 percentage points and was almost 4.8 times higher during the COVID-19 pandemic. Suicidal ideation was more prevalent among people facing difficulty paying rent (31.5%), job loss (24.1%), and loneliness (25.1%), with each stressor associated with suicidal ideation in bivariable models. Difficulty paying rent and loneliness were most associated with suicidal ideation.

"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on depression and anxiety symptoms: Findings from the United Arab Emirates Healthy Future (UAEHFS) cohort study","Significant concerns about mental health were raised during the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigated the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms among the participants of the United Arab Emirates Healthy Future Study (UAEHFS); a national cohort study. We further explored the change in the prevalence of depression symptoms among those with comparable pre-pandemic data. A sample of UAEHFS participants were invited to complete a COVID-19 online questionnaire during the first wave of the pandemic. Depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale (PHQ-8) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale (GAD-7) respectively. Unpaired analyses were done to examine the effect of COVID-19 on depression and anxiety symptoms during the pandemic. Paired analysis was conducted to examine the change in depression symptoms. During the pandemic, we reported a prevalence of 32.8% (95% CI: 27.0, 39.1) for depression and 26.4% (95% CI: 21.0, 32.6) for anxiety symptoms. Younger people reported higher levels of depression (40.4%) and anxiety (34.5%) symptoms. Females reported higher levels of depression (36.5%) and anxiety (32.7%) symptoms. In paired analysis, the prevalence of depression symptoms during the pandemic was 34% (95% CI: 26.5, 42.4) compared to 29.9% (95% CI: 22.7, 38.1) before the pandemic. No statistically significant difference was observed, p-value = 0.440. Adjusted multivariate logistic regression models for PHQ-8 and GAD-7 during the pandemic showed that participants, who were experiencing flu-like symptoms, had higher odds of reporting depression symptoms compared to those without symptoms. Additionally, age was significantly negatively associated with anxiety symptoms. Overall, we found that depression and anxiety symptoms were more prevalent among young people and females. However, we did not find a significant change in the prevalence of depression symptoms among those with comparable pre-pandemic data.

We aimed to identify the important correlates and their effects on the predicted likelihood of wanting to seek help among 2SLGBTQI+ young adults for mental health or substance use concerns during the pandemic. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2020-2021 among 2SLGBTQI+ young adults aged 16-29 living in two Canadian provinces (Ontario and Quebec). Among 1414 participants, 77% (n = 1089) wanted to seek help for their mental health or substance use concerns during the pandemic, out of these, 69.8% (n = 760) reported delay in accessing care. We built a random forest (RF) model to predict the status of wanting to seek help, which achieved moderately high performance with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.85. The top 10 correlates of wanting to seek help were worsening mental health, age, stigma and discrimination, and adverse childhood experiences. The interactions of adequate housing with certain sexual orientations, gender identities and mental health challenges were found to increase the likelihood of wanting to seek help. We built another RF model for predicting risk of delay in accessing care among participants who wanted to seek help (n = 1089). The model identified a similar set of top 10 correlates of delay in accessing care but lacked adequate performance (AUC 0.61). These findings can direct future research and targeted prevention measures to reduce health disparities for 2SLGBTQI+ young adults.","Kundu, Fu, Grace, Logie, Abramovich, Baskerville, Yager, Schwartz, Mitsakakis, Planinac, Chaiton","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0277438","20221118","Female; Young Adult; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Substance-Related Disorders; Machine Learning; Ontario","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41281,""
"Evaluation of depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress response levels of children and adolescents treated with COVID-19","We aimed to evaluate stress level reactions to depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress in paediatric patients' post-COVID-19 infection. A total of two hundred consecutive patients aged 8 to 18Ã‚Â years were prospectively enrolled in the study between March 2020 and June 2021. One hundred patients were diagnosed with a positive COVID-PCR test and had inpatient management. Another hundred patients had positive COVID-PCR results and completed their care and isolation for 14Ã‚Â days at home. We used the child posttraumatic stress reaction index (CPTS-RI), child depression inventory (CDI), and screen for child anxiety-related disorders (SCARED) to evaluate their post-COVID-19 infection mental health state. In the study population, the mean age was 13.4Ã‚Â years, and 50.5% were male. Sixty-seven patients were paediatric, and the rest were adolescents. Based on our scaling system, 10% of patients had depression. Forty-one percent of patients had at least one high subscale of SCARED. Forty-four percent of patients' CPTS-RI was above the normal limit, while 4% had a severe stress reaction level. In the female patient population, SCARED and CPTS-RI were significantly high (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). There was no significant correlation between hospitalization duration and test scores. The CPTS-RI score was significantly higher in the outpatient group than in the other groups (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). The inpatient group had significantly higher social phobia, while the outpatient group had significantly higher school phobia (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01 and pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05, respectively). The present study showed that COVID-19 infection is a significant risk factor for psychopathology in children and adolescents. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚Â COVID-19 causes multiple physical complications in the body along with significant harmful physiologic mental health effects.Ã‚Â After being diagnosed with COVID-19, paediatric and adolescent patients have been engaging in social isolation. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Shutdowns, school closings, minimizing social interaction, and isolating behaviour are some of the measures used to control the pandemic.Ã‚Â For kids to develop into healthy individuals, they need social interaction and a safe environment.

"Indirect contact with nature, lifestyle, and mental health outcomes during mandatory hotel quarantine in Hong Kong","During the pandemic of COVID-19 Hong Kong lead one of the world's longest and most stringent quarantine measures. To examine cross-sectionally (i) the relationship between the duration of mandatory hotel quarantine and mental health outcomes; (ii) whether indirect contact with nature and lifestyle factors (i.e. diet, sleep, exercises, social support, and sense of meaning), mitigated this relationship. A group of 248 participants under 14 or 21-d mandatory hotel quarantine in Hong Kong completed an online questionnaire that included quarantine and lifestyle-related questions, as well as mental health outcome measures. For those under a 21-d quarantine, there was a significant effect of the week of quarantine on the level of depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-4), which peaked in Week 2. Worse quality of sleep, a lower sense of meaning, and a longer set (but not completed) duration of quarantine were predictors of worse mental health outcomes. The positive relationship between the day of quarantine and the level of perceived stress was moderated by the indirect contact with nature. The results shed light on the potential negative impact of prolonged periods of quarantine on mental health outcomes and the possible protective factors.","Hazan, Chan","https://doi.org/10.1080/09638237.2022.2140786","20221116","COVID-19; Hong Kong; exposure to nature; lifestyle medicine; mental health; quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41285,""
"Management of Somatization in COVID-19: A Narrative Review","Somatization refers to the condition in which psychological distress is shown in the form of somatic symptoms such as persistent headache, nausea, gastrointestinal discomfort, etc.Ã‚Â Various predisposing factors, including familial such as high expressed emotion, poor parental care, genetic, biological, and demographic which includes age and gender, cognitive such as learning disabilities, psychiatric such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, social, etc., play an essential role in saturation of the disease. During the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, psychological distress increased in the patients infected with the coronavirus due to some the factors such as social distancing from loved ones, lack of physical exercise, loss of income, loneliness due to quarantine, etc. Therefore, management and treatment of the disorder became essential, especially in coronavirus-infected patients, as it may lead to an increase in complications of the disease. Many studies have been conducted to identify the proper way to manage the condition. Treatments include pharmacological therapy and psychosocial interventions. Pharmacological therapy includes using various antidepressants, hypnotics, and sedatives such as benzodiazepines. For the treatment, mirtazapine is a secure and reliable antidepressant. Another drug, trizolobenzodiazepine adinazolam, was also very useful in treating patients. In some randomized experiments, alprazolam significantly outperformed amitryptiline in reducing the symptoms. Psychosocial interventions include sessions such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, relaxation training, meditation, and psychological interventions such as enhancing multidimensional social help, modifying cognitive assessment, directing positive coping, and inspiring positive emotions.","Wankhade, Anjankar","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.30262","20221117","antidepressants; anxiety; covid-19 pandemic; depression; distress; somatization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41286,""

In this report, we identified a 43-year-old Caribbean man who arrived in the USA with ataxia and ascending bilateral lower extremity weakness after COVID-19 infection. Before arrival, the patient was diagnosed with Guillain-BarrÃƒÂ© syndrome (GBS). He was treated with IV methylprednisolone and a round of IV immunoglobulin (IVIG); however, he showed a minimal response. Upon admission to our ED, he had severe tachypnea and flaccid symmetrical quadriparesis combined with areflexia. Moreover, he had begun to exhibit signs of multiple cranial nerve palsies, including ophthalmoplegia and facial diplegia. Additionally, his laboratory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was grossly normal. Therefore, he was diagnosed with MFS. Furthermore, he developed acute depression and exhibited signs of mania. The patient was treated with IV methylprednisolone and the second round of a five-day course of IVIG, resulting in marked clinical improvement. This case highlights the need for a multidisciplinary care approach in patients with MFS. It also points to the possible benefit of multiple IVIG rounds in MFS patients who do not improve after the first course.","Kara, Wilson, Youssef, Nedd","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.29977","20221117","coronavirus disease; covid-19; guillain-barrÃƒÂ© syndrome; intravenous immune globulin; miller-fisher syndrome","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41287,""

Therefore, our psychiatric liaison team intervened by attending briefing sessions for family members and online patient visits while also conducting sessions to provide information about mental health and relaxation sessions for the hospital's nurses to reduce their burden as much as possible. These efforts provided mental support for the patients' families while also reducing the challenges of and the burden on medical staff.

This study reviews violence, conflict and mental health among HCWs in five countries: Syria, Palestine, Yemen, Afghanistan and Lebanon. Our study reports that HCWs are targeted by violence, bombings, mistreatment and different forms of abuse, including verbal and physical. With the additional burdens of the pandemic including prolonged working hours, limited resources and insufficient humanitarian aid, the healthcare workers fall victim to increased levels of burnout and mental illnesses.

Difficulties that women reported because of COVID-19 restrictions included lack of support from family and friends, fear of COVID-19 exposure, feeling isolated and uncertain, negative impact on perinatal care experience, and hospital restrictions. Having support from partners and families, in-person/virtual support, as well as engaging in self-care and the low prevalence of COVID-19 during the summer of 2020 helped women cope. Women identified challenges and negative impacts due to the COVID-19 pandemic, although no differences in psychosocial outcomes were found.

"Don't say it's over: the perceived epidemic stage, COVID risk perception and preventive behaviour","The risks for people during the epidemic are evolving. For COVID-19 pandemic one important feature was its multiwave pattern, where, within each wave, the pandemic dynamic could be described as the curve. This study aimed to explore how peopleâ€™s perceptions of such a pandemic process associates with the risk perceptions and the preventive behaviour. A sample of 1,343 university students in the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic have assessed the pandemic stage, perceived risks, mental health and trust to different bodies in regard to pandemic. They also reported their involvement in the COVID topic and a wide range of implemented behaviour. The study participants differed in their perception of the pandemic stage despite being in the same environment. The belief that the curve pick is left behind was associated with the less perceived risk and decrease in preventive behaviour implementation, while there was no difference in the perception of risks or behaviour between belief in living the period in the epidemic peak or the beginning of the wave. The lack of COVID involvement, distrust to authorities and official COVID information were associated with the less perceived risk and preventive behaviour. Mental health characteristics were significantly associated with the social preventive behaviours - the higher depression level was the predictor of the decreasing of communication with other people while the anxiety was the predictor of more risky behaviour due to increase in face-to-face communication. Overall the perception that the epidemic wave is on its final stage could be an independent predictor of more risky behaviour. Communication of the epidemic dynamic should be provided with extreme caution.","Yadviga Sinyavskaya et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01DF-786-BA0","20221117","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","",41295,""
