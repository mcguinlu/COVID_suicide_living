"Excess risk and clusters of symptoms after COVID-19 in a large Norwegian cohort","Physical, psychological and cognitive symptoms have been reported as post-acute sequelae for COVID-19 patients but are also common in the general, uninfected population. We aimed to calculate the excess risk and identify patterns of 22 symptoms up to 12 months after COVID-19 infection. We followed more than 70,000 participants in an ongoing cohort study, the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Infected and non-infected cohort participants registered presence of 22 different symptoms in March 2021. One year after the initial infection, 13 of 22 symptoms were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, based on relative risks between infected and uninfected subjects. For instance, 17.4% of SARS-CoV-2 infected cohort participants reported fatigue that persist 12 months after infection, compared to new occurrence of fatigue that had lasted less than 12 months in 3.8% of non-infected subjects (excess risk 13.6%). The adjusted relative risk for fatigue was 4.8 (95 % CI 3.5 to 6.7). Two main underlying factors explained 50% of the variance in the 13 symptoms. Brain fog, poor memory, dizziness, heart palpitations, and fatigue had high loadings on the first factor, while shortness-of breath and cough had high loadings on the second factor. Lack of taste and smell showed low to moderate correlation to other symptoms. Anxiety, depression and mood swings were not strongly related to COVID-19. Our results suggest that there are clusters of symptoms after COVID-19 due to different mechanisms and question whether it is meaningful to describe long COVID as one syndrome.","Ida Henriette Caspersen; Per Magnus; Lill Trogstad","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.10.15.21265038","20211018","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-19","",18911,""
"Impact Of Adaptive Natural Killer Cells, KLRC2 Genotype And Cytomegalovirus Reactivation On Late Mortality In Patients With Severe Covid-19 Lung Disease","ObjectiveCOVID-19 infection results in severe lung disease in a small but significant number of infected patients. The etiopathogenesis in a subset of such patients, who continue to have progressive pulmonary disease following virus clearance remains unexplored.

MethodsWe investigated the role of NKG2C+/NKG2A- adaptive natural killer (ANK) cells, KLRC2 genotype and cytomegalovirus reactivation in 22 such patients.

ResultsThe median duration of virus positivity was 23 days and the median duration of hospitalisation was 48 days. The overall survival at 60 days in this group was 50%. Older age and comorbidities impacted survival negatively. CMV viremia was documented in 11 patients, with a survival of 25% vs 80% in those without viremia with viral load correlating with mortality. ANK cells were markedly depressed in all patients at day 15. However, persistently low ANK cells at 30 days along with an inversely high NKG2C-/NKG2A+ inhibitory NK cells significantly correlated with high CMV viremia as well as mortality, irrespective of KLRC2 genotype. Day 30 ANK cells were significantly lower in KLRC2 deletion group. IFN-gamma and Perforin release were severely compromised in all patients at day +15, with significant improvement in the survivors at day +30, but not in those with adverse outcome.

ConclusionPatients with severe lung disease even after negative SARS-CoV-2 status, with persistently reduced and functionally compromised ANK cells, are more likely to have CMV reactivation and an adverse outcome, independent of KLRC2 genotype.","Sarita Rani Jaiswal; Jaganath Arunachalam; Ashutosh Bhardwaj; Ashraf Saifullah; Rohit Lakhchaura; Mayank Soni; Gitali Bhagwati; Suparno Chakrabarti","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.10.11.21264805","20211014","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-19","",18912,""
"Prevalence of mental health problems and sleep disturbances in nursing students during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis","To identify the prevalence of mental health problems and sleep disturbances among nursing students during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a future professional workforce, nursing students are expected to play a role in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic; however, physical and mental health problems may hinder their willingness to stay in the nursing profession. Evidence of the prevalence of the health problems among nursing students related to COVID-19 may allow educators to manage their students' health problems and make them feel more positive about their future careers. Systematic review and meta-analysis. This study was prospectively registered with PROSPERO. Databases, including CINAHL, Embase, PubMed and Web of Science, were searched for all related journal articles, from database inception to June 29, 2021, published between 2020 and 2021. This review was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines using a PICOS search strategy. A DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model was used to estimate the prevalence and potential heterogeneity among the selected studies using the Cochran Q statistic and I-square test. Publication bias was assessed using the Egger intercept test. Seventeen studies were included in the meta-analysis, representing 13,247 nursing students. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of four health problems and sleep disturbances were identified. The health problem with the highest prevalence in nursing students was depression (52%). Other COVID-19-related health problems were fear (41%), anxiety (32%) and stress (30%) and sleep disturbances (27%). The findings from this study showed that strategies are necessary to manage nursing students' teaching and learning during the COVID-19 pandemic or similar future situations. Our results suggest that preparing modified distance learning might reduce the prevalence of health problems related to the educational process. In addition, providing regular mental health assessments or online mental health services to students may improve their mental health and increase their well-being. Nursing education policies regarding clinical practice remain to be formulated to ensure the achievement of competencies to support future careers while considering the mental readiness and safety of students.","Mulyadi, Tonapa, Luneto, Lin, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nepr.2021.103228","20211015","Mental health problems; Meta-analysis; Nursing students; Prevalence; Sleep disturbances","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-19","",18913,""
"Antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like activities of Rosmarinus officinalis extract in rodent models: Involvement of oxytocinergic system","Oxytocin (OXT), a neuropeptide involved in mammal reproductive and prosocial behaviors, has been reported to interact with various stressor-provoked neurobiological changes, including neuroendocrine, neurotransmitter, and inflammatory processes. In view of disturbances in psychosocial relationships due to social isolation and physical distancing measures amid the COVID-19 pandemic, being one of the triggering factors for the recent rise in depression and anxiety, OXT is a potential candidate for a new antidepressant. In this present study, we have aimed to investigate the effects of oral administration of Rosmarinus officinalis extract (RE), extracted from distillation residue of rosemary essential oil, on central OXT level in the context of other stress biomarkers and neurotransmitter levels in mice models. Tail suspension test (TST) and elevated plus maze test (EPMT) following LPS injection were employed to assess depressive- and anxiety-like behavior in mice, respectively. Pretreatment with RE for seven days significantly improved behavior in TST and EPMT. Whole-genome microarray analysis reveals that RE significantly reversed TST stress-induced alterations in gene expressions related to oxytocinergic and neurotransmitter pathways and inflammatory processes. In both models, RE significantly increased central Oxt and Oxtr expressions, as well as OXT protein levels. RE also significantly attenuated stress-induced changes in serum corticosterone, brain and serum BDNF levels, and brain neurotransmitters levels in both models. Altogether, our study is the first to report antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like activities of RE through modulating oxytocinergic system in mice brain and thus highlights the prospects of RE in the treatment of depressive disorders of psychosocial nature.","Sasaki, Ferdousi, Fukumitsu, Kuwata, Isoda","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2021.112291","20211015","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Global gene expression; Oxytocinergic system; Rosemary","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-19","",18914,""
"Growing racial/ethnic disparities in overdose mortality before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in California","As overdose mortality is spiking during the COVID-19 pandemic, few race/ethnicity-stratified trends are available. This is of particular concern as overdose mortality was increasing most rapidly in Black and Latinx communities prior to the pandemic. We used quarterly, age-standardized overdose mortality rates from California to assess trends by race/ethnicity and drug involved over time. Rates from 2020 Q2-Q4 were compared to expected trends based on ARIMA forecasting models fit using data from 2006 to 2020 Q1. In 2020 Q2-Q4 overdose death rates rose by 49.8% from 2019, exceeding an expected increase of 11.5% (95%CI: 0.5%-22.5%). Rates significantly exceeded forecasted trends for all racial/ethnic groups. Black/African American individuals saw an increase of 52.4% from 2019, compared to 42.6% among their White counterparts. The absolute Black-White overdose mortality gap rose from 0.7 higher per 100,000 for Black individuals in 2018 to 4.8 in 2019, and further increased to 9.9 during the pandemic. Black overdose mortality in California was therefore 34.3% higher than that of White individuals in 2020 Q2-Q4. This reflects growing methamphetamine-, cocaine-, and fentanyl-involved deaths among Black communities. Growing racial disparities in overdose must be understood in the context of the unequal social and economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, during which time Black communities have been subjected to the dual burden of disproportionate COVID-19 deaths and rising overdose mortality. Increased investments are required to ameliorate racial/ethnic disparities in substance use treatment, harm reduction, and the structural drivers of overdose, as part of the COVID-19 response and post-pandemic recovery efforts.","Friedman, Hansen, Bluthenthal, Harawa, Jordan, Beletsky","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106845","20211015","COVID-19 pandemic; Fentanyl; Methamphetamine; Overdose; Racial/ethnic disparities; Substance use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-19","",18915,""
"Demographics Associated With Stress, Severe Mental Distress, and Anxiety Symptoms During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Japan: Nationwide Online Survey","With the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the deterioration of public mental health has become a major global and social problem. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the relationship between the three mental health problems associated with COVID-19-perceived stress, severe mental distress, and anxiety symptoms-and various demographic factors including occupation. A nationwide online questionnaire survey was conducted in Japan from August 4 to 31, 2020. In addition to sociodemographic data, the degree of perceived stress, severe mental distress, and anxiety symptoms associated with COVID-19 were measured. After performing a descriptive statistical analysis, factors related to stress, severe mental distress, and anxiety symptoms were analyzed using logistic regression analysis. A total of 6,547 respondents submitted complete survey responses, among whom 34.9% felt intense stress associated with COVID-19, 17.1% were depressed, and 13.5% had severe anxiety symptoms. The logistic regression analysis showed that, each of the three mental health problems were prevalent in females; non-binary gender; people in their 50s, and 60s and above; respondents who have visited psychiatrists; and those currently in psychiatric care. Severe mental distress and anxiety symptoms were associated with the number of effective lifestyle coping strategies during the lockdown period. Only severe mental distress was prevalent in teenagers and respondents in their 20s, and students tended to suffer from stress and severe mental distress. As for occupation, working in nursing care and welfare, education and research, and medical and health sectors was associated with stress; however, working in these occupations was not associated with severe mental distress and anxiety symptoms. Unemployment was associated with severe mental distress and anxiety symptoms. All three mental health problems were prevalent in part-time workers and those working in entertainment and arts. Gender, age, occupation, history of psychiatric visits, and stress coping mechanisms were associated with mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, but their associations with stress, severe mental distress, and anxiety symptoms differed. In addition, the actual state of mental health varied according to the respondents' occupation. It is necessary to consider the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, not only at the individual level but also at the occupational level.","Midorikawa, Tachikawa, Taguchi, Shiratori, Takahashi, Takahashi, Nemoto, Arai","https://doi.org/10.2196/29970","20211015","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-19","",18916,""
"Perceived social support in the social distancing era: the association between circles of potential support and COVID-19 reactive psychopathology","Stressors related to the COVID-19 pandemic are risk factors for psychopathology, but psychosocial protective factors might play a crucial role in buffering the pathogenic effects of the outbreak. In the current study, we examined the association of inner resources and potential external sources of support for coping with the pandemic and related lockdowns to mental health during the pandemic, while controlling for sociodemographic variables as covariates. We tested the model in a probability-based internet survey of a representative sample of the Israeli adult population (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°812) conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Perceived support in close relationships was negatively associated with the intensity of depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Larger rings of potential support such as perceived belongingness to a community and trust in government were also negatively related to anxiety and depression but were positively associated with the intensity of OCD and PTSD. Findings support the ""tend and befriend"" theory in the social distancing era and highlight the importance of keeping personal relationships alive when facing a mass trauma.","Ferber, Weller, Maor, Feldman, Harel-Fisch, Mikulincer","https://doi.org/10.1080/10615806.2021.1987418","20211015","COVID-19; coping resources; psychopathology; social interactions; tend and befriend","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-19","",18917,""

"Trends in Health Equity Among Children in the United States, 1997-2018","Health equity is crucial to population health. To achieve this aim, extensive monitoring efforts beyond traditional disparities research are required. This analysis assesses trends in health equity for children from 1997 to 2018. Health equity in a given year is calculated using a previously developed measure as the mean weighted departure of individual health from the best achievable level of health. This criterion is defined as the median health of the most socially privileged identifiable group: white, non-Latinx boys in upper-income households. Using more than 20Ã‚Â years of data from the National Health Interview Survey, we apply this methodology to six measures of child health: parent-reported health status, school days missed due to illness or injury in the past year, a strength and difficulties questionnaire score, emotional difficulties, a toddler mental health indicator score, and toddler depression. We separately calculate racial/ethnic and income disparities. Monte Carlo simulation is used to assess whether trends are statistically significant. Health equity among children increased gradually over the past 2 decades, with five of the six measures demonstrating upward trends. Improvements in health equity are stronger among younger children (age 0-3 and 4-7). Unlike previous work examining adults, both types of disparities narrowed over the study period. Progress on health equity requires accountability to an objective metric. This analysis suggests some improvement over the past two decades, although these gains are under threat from potential decreases in government spending on programs affecting children and the COVID-19 pandemic.","Anderson, Zimmerman","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10995-021-03253-w","20211015","Child health; Health equity; Health status disparities; Public health surveillance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-19","",18919,""
"The impact of the UK COVID-19 pandemic on patient-reported health outcomes after stroke: a retrospective sequential comparison","The COVID-19 pandemic and related social isolation measures are likely to have adverse consequences on community healthcare provision and outcome after acute illnesses treated in hospital, including stroke. We aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient-reported health outcomes after hospital admission for acute stroke. This retrospective study included adults with acute stroke admitted to the University College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust Hyperacute Stroke Unit. We included two separate cohorts of consecutively enrolled patients from the same geographical population at two time points: 16th March-16th May 2018 (pre-COVID-19 pandemic); and 16th March-16th May 2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic). Patients in both cohorts completed the validated Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-29 (PROMIS-29 version 2.0) at 30Ã‚Â days after stroke. We included 205 patients who were alive at 30Ã‚Â days (106 admitted before and 99 admitted during the COVID-19 pandemic), of whom 201/205 (98%) provided patient-reported health outcomes. After adjustment for confounding factors, admission with acute stroke during the COVID-19 pandemic was independently associated with increased anxiety (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°28.0, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), fatigue (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°9.3, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), depression (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.5, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.002), sleepÃ‚Â disturbance (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.3, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.018), pain interference (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°10.8, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001); andÃ‚Â reduced physical function (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.2, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and participation in social roles and activities (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.9, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Compared with the pre-pandemic cohort, patients admitted with acute strokeÃ‚Â during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic reported poorer health outcomes at 30 day follow-upÃ‚Â in all domains.

"Income Differences and COVID-19: Impact on Daily Life and Mental Health","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused disproportionate suffering among vulnerable and socioeconomically disadvantaged portions of the population. Low-income and minority populations are likely to experience disparate disease and mental health burdens. Currently, there is little evidence regarding how the experience of the early months of the US COVID-19 outbreak differed by income level, and how that related to mental health symptoms. The present study used data from a national sample of US adults (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5023) who completed measures related to the COVID experience, the COVID-19 Fear Scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8). Multivariable regression was performed to determine whether income level (low: &lt;$45,000 vs high: Ã¢â€°Â¥$75,000) was significantly associated with COVID experience measures, PHQ-8, GAD-7, and COVID fear scores. Among the low-income group, COVID-19 had a significantly greater negative impact on: family income/employment, access to food, access to mental health treatment, and stress and discord in the family.

"The incidence and admission rate for first-episode psychosis in young people before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Melbourne, Australia","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound effect on global mental health, with one-third of infected individuals developing a psychiatric or neurological disorder 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°months after infection. The risk of infection and the associated restrictions introduced to reduce the spread of the virus have also impacted help-seeking behaviours. Therefore, this study aimed to determine whether there was a difference during the COVID-19 pandemic in the treated incidence of psychotic disorders and rates of admission to hospital for psychosis (including involuntary admission). Incident cases of first-episode psychosis in young people, aged 15 to 24, at an early intervention service in Melbourne from an 8-month period before the pandemic were compared with rates during the pandemic. Hospital admission rates for these periods were also compared. Before the pandemic, the annual incidence of first-episode psychosis was 104.5 cases per 100,000 at-risk population, and during the pandemic it was 121.9 (incidence rate ratioÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.14, 95% confidence intervalÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[0.92, 1.42], <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.24). Immediately after the implementation of restrictions, there was a non-significant reduction in the treated incidence (incidence rate ratioÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.80, 95% confidence intervalÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[0.58, 1.09]), which was followed by a significant increase in the treated incidence in later months (incidence rate ratioÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.94, 95% confidence intervalÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[1.52, 2.49]; incidence rate ratioÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.64, 95% confidence intervalÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[1.25, 2.16]). Before the pandemic, 37.3% of young people with first-episode psychosis were admitted to hospital, compared to 61.7% during the pandemic (odds ratioÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.71, 95% confidence intervalÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[1.73, 4.24]).

There was a mild increase, which did not reach statistical significance, in the overall incidence of first-episode psychosis; however, the pattern of presentations changed significantly, with nearly twice as many cases presenting in the later months of the restrictions.

We examined socioeconomic factors associated with low resilience in women, the relationship of low resilience with psychiatric morbidity, and the mediating role of resilience in the relationship between pandemic-related stress and other coincident psychiatric morbidities. Using a quota-based sample from a national panel, we conducted a web-based survey of 3200 US women in April 2020. Weighted, multivariate logistic regression was used to model the odds of pandemic-related stress, and coincident depression and anxiety symptoms among those with and without low resilience. Structural equation modeling was used to evaluate resilience as a mediator of the relationship between pandemic-related stress and other coincident psychiatric morbidities. Risk factors for low resilience included younger age, lower household income, lower education, unemployment, East/Southeast Asian race, unmarried/unpartnered status, and higher number of medical comorbidities. Low resilience was significantly associated with greater odds of depression symptoms (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.78, 95% CI [3.10-4.60]), anxiety symptoms (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.17, 95% CI [3.40-5.11]), and pandemic-related stress (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.86, 95% CI [2.26-3.26]). Resilience acted as a partial mediator in the association between pandemic-related stress and anxiety symptoms (proportion mediatedÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.23) and depression symptoms (proportion mediatedÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.28). In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, low resilience mediated the association between pandemic-related stress and psychiatric morbidity. Strategies proven to enhance resilience, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and addressing socioeconomic factors, may help mitigate mental health outcomes.","Kumar, Lee, Pinkerton, Wroblewski, Lengyel, Tobin","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00737-021-01184-7","20211015","Anxiety disorders; COVID-19; Depression; Mental health; WomenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-19","",18924,""
"Medical students' engagement in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: The influence of psychological factors on readiness to volunteer","<b>Objective:</b> To avert staff shortages during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in spring 2020, the medical faculties of the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU) appealed to their students to volunteer for relief work. In this study, we examine the influence of psychological factors on the students' decisions to respond to this call or not. <b>Methodology:</b> We report on a cross-sectional study based on an online survey among medical students at the TUM and LMU. The survey consisted of a questionnaire containing items on motivation and other factors related to the decision for or against volunteering. Questions were also asked about anxieties regarding COVID-19 and the occurrence of depressive symptoms, as well as about resilience. <b>Results:</b> Responses from 244 participants were analysed. Students' decisions to volunteer revealed both altruistic and introjected motivations. For those students who did not volunteer, time overlaps and workload related to other activities played an important role. Between the two groups, no significant difference was detected in terms of their resilience and COVID-19-related anxieties. However, the non-volunteering students reported a significantly higher prevalence of depressive symptoms. <b>Conclusion:</b> Sense of duty and the desire to help were, according to the students, the most important reasons for volunteering. Depressive symptoms and lack of time made volunteering less likely. Resilience and COVID-19-related anxieties do not seem to have had any influence on the decision to volunteer or not. <b>Zielsetzung:</b> Um PersonalengpÃƒÂ¤ssen im Zusammenhang mit der erste Welle der SARS-CoV-2-Pandemie im FrÃƒÂ¼hjahr 2020 vorzubeugen, forderten die medizinischen FakultÃƒÂ¤ten der TU und der LMU MÃƒÂ¼nchen ihre Studierenden dazu auf, sich fÃƒÂ¼r einen freiwilligen Hilfseinsatz zu melden. Mit der vorliegenden Studie beleuchten wir den Einfluss psychologischer Faktoren hinsichtlich der Entscheidung der Studierenden, diesem Aufruf zu folgen oder dies nicht zu tun. <b>Methodik:</b> Wir berichten eine Querschnittsstudie basierend auf einer Online-Umfrage unter Medizinstudierenden der TUM und der LMU MÃƒÂ¼nchen. Der Fragebogen enthielt Items zur Motivation sowie zu weiteren Rahmenbedingungen, die bzgl. der Entscheidung fÃƒÂ¼r oder gegen einen freiwilligen Hilfseinsatz relevant waren. Zudem wurden Fragen zu Ãƒâ€žngsten bezÃƒÂ¼glich COVID-19, zum Auftreten depressiver Symptome sowie zur Resilienz gestellt.<b>Ergebnisse:</b> Wir konnten die Antworten von 244 Teilnehmenden auswerten. Wichtige motivationale Faktoren bei den Studierenden fÃƒÂ¼r ein Meldung waren altruistische sowie introjizierte motivationale Motive. Bei der Gruppe der Studierenden, die sich nicht fÃƒÂ¼r einen Einsatz gemeldet hatten, spielten vor allem zeitliche ÃƒÅ“berschneidungen und die Auslastung durch andere AktivitÃƒÂ¤ten eine wichtige Rolle. Zwischen diesen beiden Gruppen konnte kein signifikanter Unterschied bezÃƒÂ¼glich ihrer Resilienz und ihren COVID-19 bezogenen Ãƒâ€žngsten nachgewiesen werden. Die Gruppe der Nicht-MelderInnen berichtete jedoch eine signifikant hÃƒÂ¶here PrÃƒÂ¤valenz depressiver Symptome. <b>Schlussfolgerung:</b> PflichtgefÃƒÂ¼hl und der Wunsch zu helfen waren den Angaben der Studierenden zufolge die wichtigsten GrÃƒÂ¼nde, aus denen sie sich fÃƒÂ¼r einen Einsatz gemeldet hatten. Depressive Symptome und mangelnde Zeit haben eine Meldung unwahrscheinlicher gemacht. Resilienz und COVID-19 bezogenen Ãƒâ€žngste scheinen keinen Einfluss auf die Entscheidung fÃƒÂ¼r oder gegen eine Meldung gehabt zu haben.","MÃƒÂ¼hlbauer, Huber, Fischer, Berberat, Gartmeier","https://doi.org/10.3205/zma001506","20211018","SARS-CoV-2; depression; medical students; motivation; volunteering in hospital","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-19","",18925,""
"COVID-19-Associated Pneumomediastinum and Pneumothorax: A Case Series","Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) causes mild to moderate illness in most patients but in some cases a severe illness may manifest. Such patients usually present with hypoxaemic respiratory failure due to acute lung injury caused by a viral infection and host-mediated cytokine storm. The characteristic radiographic findings are ground-glass opacities with consolidation in posterior basal areas of bilateral lungs and rarely pneumothorax (PTX) and pneumomediastinum (PM). The incidence of these findings was notably higher in the second wave of the pandemic in India in 2021 as compared to the first wave in 2020. The etiopathogenesis of this life-threatening condition can be due to Macklin phenomenon post-cytokine-mediated diffuse alveolar injury, patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI), and barotrauma in mechanically ventilated patients. The presence of pneumomediastinumÃ‚Â is associated with higher mortality rates, prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stays making it a poor prognostic marker.

"""What I thought was so important isn't really that important"": international perspectives on making meaning during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic","The global COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the physical and mental health of people everywhere. The aim of the study is to understand how people living in 15 countries around the globe experience an unexpected crisis which threatens their health and that of loved ones, and how they make meaning of this disruption in their narratives. Data were collected through an anonymous online survey during May-September 2020, which was during or just after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, depending on the country. The questionnaire included demographic and three open-ended questions as prompts for stories about experiences during the initial months of the pandemic. The text was analyzed through inductive thematic content analysis and quantified for full sample description, demographic and subsequently international comparisons. The final qualitative dataset included stories from <i>n</i> = 1685 respondents. The sample was 73.6% women and 26.4% men. The mean age of participants was 39.55 years (SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°14.71). The identified four groups of overarching themes were: The presence and absence of others; Rediscovering oneself; The meaning of daily life; Rethinking societal and environmental values. We discuss the prevalence of each theme for the sample as a whole and differences by demographic groups. The most prevalent theme referred to disruptions in interpersonal contacts, made meaningful by the increased appreciation of the value of relationships, present in (45.6%) of stories. It was more prevalent in the stories of women compared to men (Ãâ€¡Ã‚Â²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°24.88, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). The paper provides a detailed overview of the methodology, the main themes identified inductively in the stories and differences according to select demographic variables.

"Activities, Housing Situation and Other Factors Influencing Psychological Strain Experienced During the First COVID-19 Lockdown in Switzerland","<b>Background:</b> The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis and the corresponding first nationwide lockdown from mid-March to 10 May 2020 engendered considerable psychological strain among people in Switzerland. This study analyzes determinants of changes in subjective levels of psychological strain experienced during the lockdown. <b>Methods:</b> An online survey conducted as part of a larger mixed methods study examined the material and emotional aspects of individual reactions to the lockdown from a socio-ecological perspective. Participants (<i>N</i> = 5932) were asked about their personal and employment status, housing features, changes in various activities (e.g., physical activity, watching TV, social media use) and aspects of mental distress and well-being. <b>Results:</b> A substantial share of participants reported to feel depressed (33%) and anxious (43%) more often during the COVID-19 lockdown than before, whereas significantly (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) less persons reported a decrease of these negative feelings (depressed 17%; anxious 14%). Women, single people, students and people who lost their jobs or were temporally unemployed due to the lockdown experienced a particularly strong increase of subjective psychological strain. Important residential factors reducing subjective psychological strain were the general comfort of the housing situation and having a private garden or multiple types of outdoor space. Considering leisure activities, the strongest positive psychological effect resulted from increased physical activities, followed by reading and cooking. However, 45% of the participants reported a decreased frequency of physical activity during the lockdown compared to before, whereas significantly less persons (26%) reported a corresponding increase (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). <b>Conclusion:</b> Consistent with other studies, the results indicate a substantial reduction of subjective psychological well-being of the population during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Switzerland. The psychological burdens which the participants experienced differ depending on personal characteristics and situational factors. Negative psychological and economic consequences and gender inequalities should accordingly be carefully considered and actively prevented when designing COVID-19 measures. Supportive economic and social, cognitive and behavioral psychological interventions need to be designed and implemented to maintain the well-being of residents during lockdown.","Hansmann, Fritz, Pagani, ClÃƒÂ©ment, Binder","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.735293","20211016","COVID-19; employment status; housing; leisure activities; lockdown; social factors; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-19","",18928,""
"Psychological Distress Among Cancer Patients During COVID-19 Pandemic in the World: A Systematic Review","<b>Aim:</b> Patients with malignancies, experience high rates of psychological distress. Fear of Corona-infection combined with the interruptions in some treatment programs might affect the psychological health of cancer patients. This review study was conducted to investigate the psychological distress among cancer patients during COVID-19 pandemic to offer system-adapted individual solutions. <b>Materials and methods:</b> To identify the psychological distress of cancer patients, a comprehensive search was carried out in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. English language and original articles were included in this study. Articles that addressed any psychological distress among cancer patients during COVID-19 pandemic were included. <b>Results:</b> At first 1,410 articles, were included in the study. After removing duplicate articles and reviewing the title and abstract, 55 articles were selected for the review. The findings of this study revealed COVID-19 greatly affects psychological health of cancer patients. Fear of COVID-19, fear of disease progression, disruption of oncology services, cancer stage, and immunocompromised status were the most common causes of psychological distress in oncology patients which can influence patients' decisions about treatment. <b>Conclusion:</b> The COVID-19 related anxiety is an expected reaction to the current situation. Although psychological distress affects many people, it can confuse cancer patients to the point that they refuse to continue treatment for the fear of infection and worsening of their condition. Since the end of this pandemic is unknown, this action can endanger the health and prognosis of this group of patients, so it seems that using psychological interventions and intensive counseling in the current situation is one of the main priorities for cancer patients.","Momenimovahed, Salehiniya, Hadavandsiri, Allahqoli, GÃƒÂ¼nther, Alkatout","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.682154","20211016","COVID-19; anxiety; cancer; depression; distress; fear","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-19","",18929,""

"Coronavirus-related anxiety and fear among South African diagnostic radiographers working in the clinical setting during the pandemic","The current coronavirus pandemic has impacted the healthcare sector significantly. Policies and practices had to be amended to ensure maximum safety for both patients and healthcare professionals, including radiographers. This led to negative impacts on the occupational wellbeing and mental health of radiographers. The aim of this study was to fill the gap in knowledge about coronavirus-related anxiety and fear among diagnostic radiographers across South Africa in order to inform policy and practice so as to mitigate the negative influence the coronavirus pandemic conditions has on the occupational wellbeing of diagnostic radiographers working on the frontline. A quantitative, descriptive research design, using a cross-sectional approach, was employed. Two-hundred and forty-eight (n=248) South African diagnostic radiographers working in the clinical setting during the current coronavirus pandemic were recruited through social media. Data pertaining to their coronavirus-related anxiety and fear were collected through a digital questionnaire comprising three parts: demographics, coronavirus anxiety scale (CAS), and fear of coronavirus-19 scale (FCV-19S). Most of the participants' coronavirus anxiety scale scores are indicative of probable dysfunctional anxiety (69.8%). The participants had higher levels of coronavirus-related fear compared to anxiety. Anxiety levels were dependent on biological sex. For all other demographic variables anxiety and fear levels were independent. Support strategies should be implemented to mitigate the negative impacts of a pandemic such as the coronavirus pandemic on the occupational wellbeing and mental health of diagnostic radiographers.

"Psychological and behavioral responses during the COVID-19 pandemic among individuals with mobility and/or self-care disabilities","The lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic created major obstacles for individuals with disabilities to obtain support in their daily living. This study was to examine the psychological and behavioral responses of US individuals with mobility and/or self-care disabilities during the pandemic. From a nationally representative longitudinal survey (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯6403) administered during the pandemic, individuals were classified at baseline as having no mobility/self-care disability (ADLÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0, nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯4975), mobility or self-care disability (ADLÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1, nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1061), and both mobility and self-care disabilities (ADLÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯2, nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯367). Weighted mean of baseline mental distress scores (PHQ4), psychological risk factors (loneliness, stress, perceived COVID risk), resilience, and coping were compared among these groups. Random effects models were employed to assess the effects of disability and disability-moderated effects of risk factors on mental distress. At baseline, mental distress increased with greater ADL disabilities (Mean[95%CI]Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.88[1.77, 1.98], 2.54[2.29, 2.79], and 3.55[3.01, 4.08] for ADLÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0, 1, and 2, respectively, pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.0001). Loneliness, stress, and perceived risk increased with ADL disabilities, but resilience and social coping decreased with it (p'sÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.0001). In the random-effects models, greater ADL disabilities, higher psychological risks, and use of cannabis and other recreational drugs were associated with greater mental distress. Greater ADL disabilities augmented the detrimental effects of risk factors on mental health, but resilience protected mental health both independently and through a buffering effect on its risk factors across all groups. Individuals with mobility and/or self-care disability tend to have poorer mental health and are differentially more affected by its risk factors. Mental health professionals should address these modifiable factors in interventions.","Na, Yang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dhjo.2021.101216","20211015","ADL; Adversity; COVID-19 pandemic; Disability; Mental health; Mobility; Resilience; Self-care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-19","",18933,""

"Supported online cognitive behavioural therapy for bulimia nervosa: a study protocol of a randomised controlled trial","Despite the availability of effective treatments for bulimia nervosa (BN), a number of barriers to accessibility exist. Examples include access to trained clinicians, the expense of treatment, geographical limitations, and personal limitations such as stigma regarding help seeking. Self-help interventions, delivered via a digital platform, have the potential to overcome treatment gaps by providing patients with standardised, evidence-based treatments that are easily accessible, cost-effective, and require minimal clinician support. Equally, it is important to examine the shortcomings of digital interventions when compared to traditional to face-to-face delivery (e.g., high dropout rates) in order to maximise the therapeutic effectiveness of online, self-help interventions. A three-arm, multisite randomised controlled trial will be conducted in Australia examining the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a newly developed online self-help intervention, Binge Eating eTherapy (BEeT), in a sample of patients with full or sub-threshold BN. The BEeT program consists of 10, multimedia sessions delivering the core components of cognitive behaviour therapy. Eligible participants will be randomised to one of three groups: independent completion of BEeT as a purely self-help program, completion of BEeT alongside clinician support (in the form of weekly telemedicine sessions), or waitlist control. Assessments will take place at baseline, weekly, post-intervention, and three-month follow up. The primary outcome is frequency of objective binge episodes. Secondary outcomes include frequency of other core eating disorder behavioural symptoms and beliefs, psychological distress, and quality of life. Statistical analyses will examine treatment effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability and cost effectiveness. There is limited capacity within the mental health workforce in Australia to meet the demand of people seeking treatment for eating disorders. This imbalance has only worsened following outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research is required into innovative digital modes of treatment delivery with the capacity to service mental health needs in an accessible and affordable manner. Self-help programs may also appeal to individuals who are more reluctant to engage in traditional face-to-face treatment formats. This study will provide rigorous evidence on how to diversify treatment options for individuals with BN, ensuring more people with the illness can access evidence-based treatment.

"Pandemic-related factors predicting physician burnout beyond established organizational factors: cross-sectional results from the COPING survey","The COVID-19 pandemic has increased physician burnout beyond high baseline levels. We aimed to determine whether pandemic-related factors contribute to physician burnout beyond known organizational factors. This was a cross-sectional survey of Canadian physicians using a convenience sample. Eligible participants included any physician currently holding a license to practice in Canada. Responses were gathered from May 13 to 12 June 2020. Risk factors measured included the newly developed Pandemic Experiences and Perceptions Scale (PEPS) subscales, contact with virus, pandemic preparation, and provincial caseload. The primary outcome was the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). The primary outcome was completed by 309 respondents. Latent profile analysis found 107 (34.6%) respondents were burned out. In multivariate analysis, exhaustion was independently associated with PEPS adequacy, risk perception, and worklife subscales (adjusted R<sup>2</sup>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.236, P &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). Cynicism was associated with exhaustion, and PEPS worklife (adjusted R<sup>2</sup>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.543, P &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). Efficacy was associated with cynicism, PEPS worklife, and active cases (adjusted R<sup>2</sup>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.152, P &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). Structural equation modelling showed statistically significant direct paths between PEPS areas of worklife and all MBI subscales. Contact with virus, preparation, and PEPS risk perception added to the prediction of MBI exhaustion. Among a sample of Canadian physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic, adequacy of resources, risk perception, and quality of worklife were associated with burnout indices. To mitigate physician burnout organizations should work to improve working conditions, ensure adequate resources, and foster perceived control of risk of transmission.<b>Trial Registration</b>: NCT04379063.","Bailey, Wong, Bailey, Banfield, Barry, Munro, Kirkland, Leiter","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2021.1990366","20211015","Burnout; COVID-19; occupational health; pandemic; physician mental health; wellness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-19","",18936,""
"A longitudinal study of predictors of serious psychological distress during COVID-19 pandemic","The prevalence of serious psychological distress (SPD) was elevated during the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA, but the relationships of SPD during the pandemic with pre-pandemic SPD, pre-pandemic socioeconomic status, and pandemic-related social stressors remain unexamined. A probability-based sample (N = 1751) of the US population age 20 and over was followed prospectively from February 2019 (T1), with subsequent interviews in May 2020 (T2) and August 2020 (T3). Multinomial logistic regression was used to assess prospective relationships between T1 SPD with experiences of disruption of employment, health care, and childcare at T2. Binary logistic regression was then used to assess relationships of T1 SPD, and socioeconomic status and T2 pandemic-related stressors with T3 SPD. At T1, SPD was associated with age, race/ethnicity, and household income. SPD at T1 predicted disruption of employment (OR 4.5, 95% CI 1.4-3.8) and health care (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.4-7.1) at T2. SPD at T1 (OR 10.2, 95% CI 4.5-23.3), low household income at T1 (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.1-6.4), disruption of employment at T2 (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.4-7.6), and disruption of healthcare at T2 (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.5-7.2) were all significantly associated with elevated risk for SPD at T3. Elevated risk for SPD during the COVID-19 pandemic is related to multiple psychological and social pathways that are likely to interact over the life course. Policies and interventions that target individuals with pre-existing mental health conditions as well as those experiencing persistent unemployment should be high priorities in the mental health response to the pandemic.","Breslau, Roth, Baird, Carman, Collins","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291721004293","20211015","COVID-19; longitudinal study; serious psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-19","",18937,""
"Innovations in suicide assessment and prevention during pandemics","Emerging evidence, based on the synthesis of reports from past infectious disease-related public health emergencies, supports an association between previous pandemics and a heightened risk of suicide or suicide-related behaviours and outcomes. Anxiety associated with pandemic media reporting appears to be one critical contributing factor. Social isolation, loneliness, and the disconnect that can result from public health strategies during global pandemics also appear to increase suicide risk in vulnerable individuals. Innovative suicide risk assessment and prevention strategies are needed to recognise and adapt to the negative impacts of pandemics on population mental health.","Brenna, Links, Tran, Sinyor, Heisel, Hatcher","https://doi.org/10.17061/phrp3132111","20211015","Anxiety; COVID-19; Humans; Loneliness; Mental Health; Pandemics; Public Health; Risk Assessment; SARS-CoV-2; Social Isolation; Suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-19","",18938,""
