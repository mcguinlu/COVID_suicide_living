"Psychological Predictors of Self-reported COVID-19 Outcomes: Results From a Prospective Cohort Study","Previous research has shown that psychological factors, such as stress and social support, are associated with greater susceptibility to viral respiratory illnesses and more severe symptoms. During the COVID-19 pandemic there has been a well-documented deterioration in psychological well-being and increased social isolation. This raises questions as to whether those experiencing psychological adversity during the pandemic are more at risk of contracting and/or experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. To examine the relationship between psychological factors and the risk of COVID-19 self-reported infection and the symptomatic experience of SARS-CoV-2 (indicated by the number and severity of symptoms). As part of a longitudinal prospective observational cohort study, 1,087 adults completed validated measures of psychological well-being during April 2020 and self-reported incidence of COVID-19 infection and symptom experience across the pandemic through to December 2020. Regression models were used to explore these relationships controlling for demographic and occupational factors. Greater psychological distress during the early phase of the pandemic was significantly associated with subsequent self-reported SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as the experience of a greater number and more severe symptoms. COVID-19 infection and symptoms may be more common among those experiencing elevated psychological distress. Further research to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these associations is needed.","Ayling, Jia, Coupland, Chalder, Massey, Broadbent, Vedhara","https://doi.org/10.1093/abm/kaab106","20220103","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Infection; Mental health; Psychoneuroimmunology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24501,""
"The Effects of Perceived Psychological, Educational, and Financial Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Greek University Students' Satisfaction with Life through Mental Health","Background The purpose of this study was to provide an operating mechanism for understanding the effects of COVID-19's on satisfaction with life, subject to students' general mental health Methods. A sample of 1653 Greek speaking university students (72.4% females, 65.3% undergraduate, M age=26.1) completed an online survey including measures for perceived psychological, academic, and financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, general mental health and satisfaction with life. A mediation model was tested to illuminate these relationships by considering students' general mental health as a mediator. Findings demonstrated that there were significant direct effects of perceived COVID-19 impact on participants' financial status on satisfaction with life and indirect effects of perceived COVID-19 impact on participants' financial status and academic performance respectively on satisfaction with life through general mental health. The study's cross-sectional design, self-report data and snowball sampling. The findings add to our understanding of the relationship between perceived COVID-19 impact and life satisfaction among university students, and they shed light on the critical role of general mental health in mediating the relationship. Targeting the factors that influence general mental health can help to mitigate potential problems while also finding ways to improve mental health and well-being.","Kokkinos, Tsouloupas, Voulgaridou","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.12.114","20220103","COVID-19 impact; mediation; mental health; satisfaction with life; university students; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24502,""
"Longitudinal Predictors of Depression, Anxiety, and Alcohol Use Following COVID-19-Related Stress","The COVID-19 pandemic imposed profound effects on health and daily life, with widespread stress exposure and increases in psychiatric symptoms. Despite these challenges, pandemic research provides unique insights into individual differences in emotion and cognition that predict responses to stress, with general implications for understanding stress vulnerability. We examined predictors of responses to COVID-19-related stress in an online sample of 450 emerging adults recruited in May 2020 to complete questionnaires assessing baseline stress and psychiatric symptoms. rumination, cognitive reappraisal use, and intolerance of uncertainty. Stress and symptoms were re-assessed three months later (N = 200). Greater pandemic-related stressful events were associated with increases in symptoms of depression, anxiety, and alcohol use severity. Additionally, individual differences in emotional and cognitive styles emerged as longitudinal predictors of stress responses. Specifically, greater rumination predicted increased depression. Reduced cognitive reappraisal use interacted with stress to predict increases in alcohol use. An unexpected pattern emerged for intolerance of uncertainty, such that stress was associated with increases in depression for those high in intolerance of uncertainty but increases in alcohol use at relatively low levels of intolerance of uncertainty. These results highlight unique vulnerabilities that predict specific outcomes following stress exposure and offer potential prevention targets. This article is protected by copyright.

"Pandemic Lessons: Resilience and Hope","In the United States, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic took a heavy toll on older adults, particularly those residing in long-term care facilities who were reduced to extended periods of isolation from families, friends, and health care providers. The concepts of resilience and hope became extremely relevant in the context of pandemic-related restrictions that exacerbated loneliness across all age groups. A review of evidence indicates that <i>resilience</i> is defined as an on-going, conscious process of adaptation in the face of adversity, whereas <i>hope</i> is defined as a resilience moderator through its process of making sense of a difficult situation. Cognitive-behavioral therapy and life review interventions were found to effectively enhance hope, thus contributing to increased resilience in older adults diagnosed with depression, bereavement, and/or medical conditions. Mental health providers at any level of practice should assess older adults for levels of loneliness, isolation, resilience, and hope and consider interventions to boost resilience and hope.

"Stress and Burnout Among Mental Health Staff During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has deeply altered social and working environments among health care workers. These health care workers are therefore at risk of additional psychosocial strain and ensuing metal health symptoms, which indirectly affects patient care. In this study, we aimed to assess the psychosocial and psychopathological impact of COVID-19 among acute care mental health and addictions staff. This study is a cross-sectional survey and contains a sample size of 60 mental health and addiction acute care workers recruited from within Nova Scotia Health Authority. The survey was constructed using the online survey system, Opinio, and consisted of three sections: demographic variables (gender, age group and profession); the DASS-21 Questionnaire (which provides dimensional measures of stress, anxiety and depression); and the MBI-HSS (MP) Questionnaire (which measures three dimensions of burnout-emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and personal achievement). The majority of participants had at least one pathologic score on the DASS-21 and MBI-HSS (MP) sections (75.5% and 93.5%, respectively). The median severity on the DASS-21 and MBI-HSS (MP) were both moderate, with the younger age group (20-35 years) having more significant burnout scores (p = 0.0494). Simple logistic regression showed a significant relationship between burnout severity and pathologic distress, and simple linear regression showed significant correlation between DASS-21 and MBI-HSS (MP) scores, with a R2 value of 0.4633. More planning, programs, resources and further research are needed to support wellness and recovery of all health care professionals who work at the mental health and addictions acute care unit.","Sadek, MacDonald, Streeter","https://doi.org/10.25011/cim.v44i4.37753","20220103","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24505,""
"Efficacy of 'Foundations', a Digital Mental Health App to Improve Mental Well-Being, during COVID-19: A Proof-of-Principle Randomised Controlled Trial","Against a long-term trend of increasing demand, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a global rise in common mental disorders. Now more than ever, there is an urgent need for scalable, evidence-based interventions to support mental well-being. The aim of this proof-of-principle study was to evaluate the efficacy of a mobile-based app in adults with self-reported symptoms of anxiety and stress in a randomised control trial that took place during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Adults with mild to severe anxiety and moderate to high levels of perceived stress were randomised to either the intervention or control arm. Participants in the intervention arm were given access to the app, Foundations, for the duration of the 4-week study. All participants were required to self-report a range of validated measures of mental well-being (10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience scale [CD-RISC-10]; 7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder scale [GAD-7]; Office of National Statistics Four Subjective Well-being Questions [ONS-4]; World Health Organisation-5 Well-Being Index [WHO-5]) and sleep (Minimal Insomnia Scale [MISS]) at baseline and weeks 2 and 4; and, in addition, on perceived stress weekly (10-item Perceived Stress Score [PSS]). 136 participants completed the study and were included in the final analysis. The intervention group (n=62) showed significant improvements compared to the control group (n=74) on measures of anxiety (GAD-7 score, delta from baseline to week 2 in the intervention group: -1.35 [SD 4.43]; control group: -0.23 [SD 3.24]; t134= 1.71 , P=.04), resilience (CD-RISC score, delta from baseline to week 2 in the intervention group: 1.79 [Ã‚Â± SD 4.08]; control group: -0.31 [Ã‚Â± SD 3.16]; t134 -3.37, P&lt;.001), sleep (MISS score, delta from baseline to week 2 in the intervention group: -1.16 [Ã‚Â± SD 2.67]; control group: -0.26 [Ã‚Â± SD 2.29]; t134= 2.13, P=.01), and mental well-being (WHO-5 score, delta from baseline to week 2 in the intervention group: 1.53 [5.30]; control group: -0.23 [Ã‚Â± SD 4.20]; t134= -2.16, P=.02) within 2 weeks of using Foundations, with further improvements emerging at week 4. Perceived stress was also reduced within the intervention group, although the results did not reach statistical significance relative to the control group (PSS score, delta from baseline to week 2 in the intervention group: -2.94 [Ã‚Â± SD 6.84]; control group: -2.05 [Ã‚Â± SD 5.34]; t134= 0.84, P=.20). This study provides proof-of-principle that the digital mental health app, Foundations, can improve measures of mental well-being, anxiety, resilience, and sleep within 2 weeks of use, with greater effects after 4 weeks. It therefore offers potential as a scalable, cost-effective and accessible solution to enhance mental well-being, even during times of crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Catuara-Solarz, Skorulski, Estella, Avella-Garcia, Shepherd, Stott, Hemmings, Ruiz de Villa, Schulze, Dix","https://doi.org/10.2196/30976","20220103","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24506,""
"Intensive Care Unit-Specific Virtual Reality (ICU-VR) for Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients: A Multicenter, Randomized Controlled Trial","Although psychological sequelae after intensive care unit (ICU) treatment are considered quite intrusive, robustly effective interventions to treat or prevent these long-term sequelae are lacking. Recently, it was demonstrated that intensive care unit-specific virtual reality (ICU-VR) is a feasible and acceptable intervention with potential mental health benefits. However, its effect on mental health and ICU aftercare in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ICU survivors is unknown. To explore the effects of ICU-VR on mental health and on patients' perceived quality of, satisfaction with, and rating of ICU aftercare among COVID-19 ICU survivors. This was a multicenter, randomized controlled trial. Patients were randomized to either the ICU-VR (intervention) or control group. All patients were invited to an ICU post-COVID-19 follow-up clinic three months after hospital discharge, during which patients in the intervention group received ICU-VR. One month and three months later (four and six months after hospital discharge), mental health, quality of life, perceived quality, satisfaction with, and rating of ICU aftercare were scored using questionnaires. Eighty-nine patients (median age: 58 years; 63 [70%] males) were included. The prevalence and severity of psychological distress were limited throughout follow-up, and no differences in psychological distress or quality of life were observed between the groups. ICU-VR improved satisfaction with (median [IQR] score: ICU-VR, 9 out of 10 [8-10], vs. control, 7 out of 10 [7-9], p&lt;0.001) and overall rating of ICU aftercare (9 out of 10 [8-10] vs. 8 out of 10 [7-9], p&lt;0.01) compared to controls. ICU-VR added to the quality of ICU aftercare according to 81% of the patients, and all patients would recommend ICU-VR to other ICU survivors. ICU-VR is a feasible and acceptable innovative method to improve satisfaction with and rating of ICU aftercare and adds to its perceived quality. We observed a low prevalence of psychological distress after COVID-19 ICU treatment, and ICU-VR did not improve psychological recovery or quality of life. Future research is needed to confirm our results in other critical illness survivors to potentially facilitate ICU-VR's widespread availability and application during follow-up.

"The Lived Experience of Older Adults Transferring Between Long-Term Care Facilities During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Long-term care facility (LTCF) residents have been disproportionately affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), from increased mortality and restrictive public health measures. The current study aims to describe the experiences of residents relocating between LTCFs at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Emphasis was placed on residents' sense of home and how the pandemic and ensuing isolation affected their transition. This qualitative study follows the principles of constructivist grounded theory. Seven of 10 residents interviewed had cognitive impairment (mean age = 84 years). Four primary themes were elicited from the interviews focusing on residents' perceptions of their environment and highlights the value placed on privacy and control, the multifaceted feeling of loss during the pandemic, the importance of relationships as a source of comfort and pleasure, and resilience shown by residents in times of hardship. Our study indicates that residents experienced dichotomy and paradox during the pandemic, attempting to strike a balance between isolation and camaraderie, infection risk and mental health, and loss and resilience. The need for familial contact and socialization must be balanced against infection control measures.

"Does cyberchondria predict Internet addiction among students during the COVID-19 pandemic? A web-based survey study","Previous literature has investigated the association of this phenomenon and Internet addiction. Nevertheless, little research has been conducted to elucidate the predictive associations among these concepts among students. This study reported students' cyberchondria and Internet addiction, and it examined whether cyberchondria predicts Internet addiction. During the COVID-19 pandemic, cross-sectional data were collected using a web survey from a convenience snowball sample of 143 students enrolled in e-learning courses at a governmental university. A moderate level of cyberchondria and a mild level of Internet addiction was evident among students. A moderate level of cyberchondria and a mild level of Internet addiction was evident among students. Moderate to high significant correlations were reported among the studied concepts and with the sample's characteristics. Cyberchondria and unavailability of the Internet at school were predictors of Internet addiction. Healthcare providers, including nurses, should provide information that preserves students' mental health during stressful periods such as the COVID-19 pandemic and should offer clear instructions on stress and anxiety management during such times. A longer scale, especially for cyberchondria, is warranted in future research with a random and larger sample. Findings suggest that cyberchondria serves as a predictor of Internet addiction, contrary to findings of previous studies. Various psychosocial interventions should always be initiated to help students prevent or address cyberchondria and Internet addiction.","Mrayyan, Al-Atiyyat, Abu Khait, Al-Rawashdeh, Algunmeeyn, Abunab","https://doi.org/10.1111/nuf.12682","20220103","COVID-19; Internet addiction; correlations; cyberchondria; prediction; students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24509,""
"Stay-at-Home: The Impact of the COVID-19 Lockdown on Household Functioning and ART Adherence for People Living with HIV in Three Sub-districts of Cape Town, South Africa","In March 2020, the South African government imposed a lockdown to control COVID-19 transmission. Lockdown may affect people living with HIV's (PLWH) antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence. Data from a cluster randomised control trial was collected from 152 PLWH in Cape Town sub-districts from October 2019-March 2020 when the lockdown halted collection. Subsequently, 83 PLWH were followed-up in June-July 2020. Random effects models were used to analyse: (1) changes between baseline and follow-up and (2) correlates of adherence during lockdown. At follow-up, there was an increase in the odds of being below the poverty line and the odds of experiencing violence decreased. Measures for well-being, household functioning, stigma and HIV competency improved. Violence, depression, food insecurity, and stigma were associated with poorer ART adherence; higher well-being scores were associated with better adherence. During lockdown, governments need to ensure financial support, access to (mental) health services, and services for those experiencing violence.Clinical Trial Number: Pan African Clinical Trial Registry, PACTR201906476052236. Registered on 24 June 2019. En marzo de 2020, el gobierno sudafricano impuso un confinamiento generalizado para controlar la transmisiÃƒÂ³n del COVID-19. Estas medidas pueden afectar la adherencia a la terapia antirretroviral de las personas con VIH. A partir de un ensayo aleatorio grupal se recopilan datos de 152 personas con VIH en los sub-distritos de Ciudad del Cabo entre octubre de 2019 y marzo de 2020 cuando el confinamiento detuvo la recopilaciÃƒÂ³n. Posteriormente, se realizÃƒÂ³ un seguimiento de 83 pacientes entre junio y julio de 2020. Se utilizaron modelos de efectos aleatorios para analizar: 1) los cambios en las variables entre la lÃƒÂ­nea de base y de seguimiento; 2) covariables de adhesiÃƒÂ³n al tratamiento. En el seguimiento se observa que aumentaron las probabilidades de estar por debajo del umbral de pobreza y disminuyeron las probabilidades de sufrir violencia. Las medidas de bienestar, funcionamiento del hogar, estigma e idoneidad en materia de VIH mejoraron entre la lÃƒÂ­nea base y el seguimiento. Por otro lado, la violencia, la depresiÃƒÂ³n, la inseguridad alimentaria y el estigma se asocian a una menor adherencia al tratamiento antirretroviral, mientras la mejora del bienestar se asocia a una mayor adherencia al tratamiento. De tal manera, se observa que durante situaciones de emergencia que requieran de confinamientos es recomendable que los gobiernos garanticen apoyo financiero, atenciÃƒÂ³n a la salud fÃƒÂ­sica y mental de manera continua, asÃƒÂ­ como servicios especializados hacia quienes sufren violencia.","Campbell, Masquillier, Knight, Delport, Sematlane, Dube, Wouters","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10461-021-03541-0","20220103","ART; Adherence; COVID-19; HIV; Lockdown","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24510,""
"Suicide Risk in Adolescents During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic created high levels of psychological distress and may have increased suicide risk. We used the 4-item Ask Suicide-Screening Questions (ASQ) to assess suicide risk among all patients 12 to 24 years of age at a children's hospital. We compared demographics, encounter type (telehealth or face-to-face [F2F]), and screening results from April to June 2020 (T2) to those from April to June 2019 (T1). Fewer patients were seen at T2 than T1 (17Ã¢â‚¬â€°986 vs 24Ã¢â‚¬â€°863). A greater proportion of visits at T2 were by telehealth (0% vs 43%). The rate of positive suicide screens was higher in T2 than in T1 (12.2% vs 11.1%, adjusted odds ration [aOR], 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-1.35). The odds of a positive screen were greater for older patients (aOR of 1.12 for age in years; 95% CI, 1.10-1.14), female patients (aOR, 2.23; 95% CI, 2.00-2.48), patients with public versus private insurance (aOR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.72-2.07), and lower for Black versus White patients (aOR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.77-0.95). Rates of positive screens were highest among inpatients (20.0%), intermediate for emergency department patients (14.4%), and lowest in outpatient clinics (9.9%) (P &lt; .05). Rates of positive suicide risk screens among adolescents rose in the pandemic's early months with differences related to sociodemographics and visit type.

"Mental health of Brazilian adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic","We aimed to assess the factors associated with frequent sadness and nervousness in Brazilian adolescents, during the Covid-19 pandemic, in 9470 adolescents (aged 12-17 years), interviewed from June 27 to September 17, 2020. Prevalences and prevalence ratios were estimated according to socio-demographic variables and factors related to family, school, friends, and health. Brazilian adolescents often felt sad (32.4%) and nervous (48.7%). Higher prevalences of these feelings were related to: being female; aged 15-17 year; from families with financial difficulties; having learned little or nothing with remote education; missing friends; having few friends; family disagreements; having regular/bad health before the pandemic; and worsened health and sleep during the pandemic. Higher prevalence of nervousness was also found in adolescents who worked before the pandemic and those who reported lack of concentration and not knowing if they had COVID-19. Sadness and nervousness in Brazilian adolescents is high and the need for action by the government, schools, health services, and parents to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on the physical and mental health of adolescents. Special attention must be paid to adolescents with previous health problems and those belonging to the most socially vulnerable population.","Barros, Lima, Malta, Azevedo, Fehlberg, Souza JÃƒÂºnior, Azevedo, Machado, Gomes, Romero, Damacena, Werneck, Silva, Almeida, Szwarcwald","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psycom.2021.100015","20220103","Adolescent; Coronavirus infections; Health surveys; Mental health; Pandemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24512,""
"Resilience of adolescents and teenagers with self-limited and genetic-generalized epilepsy during the COVID-19 pandemic","The study-objective was to determine the emotional impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children with self-limited and genetic-generalized epilepsy.

"The mental health crisis during the COVID-19 pandemic in older adults and the role of physical distancing interventions and social protection measures in 26 European countries","The COVID-19 pandemic and associated policy responses, such as physical distancing interventions, pose risks to mental health that could be mitigated by social support systems. We examine associations between changes in mental health in the population aged 50 years and older in Europe and stringency of pandemic responses and social protection. We analysed data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe: nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯50,278 individuals aged 50 years and older in 26 European countries between June and August 2020. Linear multivariable regression models were used to evaluate potential risk factors for deterioration in self-reported mental health and investigate whether social protection systems mitigate it. Across the European Union, 28.1% (95% CI:27.1-29.2) of participants reported worsening mental health since the beginning of the pandemic, ranging from 16.1% in Slovakia to 54.8% in Portugal. Factors associated with increased risk of deterioration included: being female (12.7 percentage points (ppt), 95%CI:9.2-16.2); experiencing unmet healthcare needs during the pandemic (14.6Ã¢â‚¬Â¯ppt, 95%CI:11.2-18.1); job loss during the pandemic (6.2Ã¢â‚¬Â¯ppt, 95%CI:1.1-11.8); and financial hardship (5.1Ã¢â‚¬Â¯ppt, 95%CI:2.9-7.2). Greater stringency of physical distancing measures in countries was associated with worsening mental health (0.2Ã¢â‚¬Â¯ppt per each one point increase on a stringency index, 95% CI:0.09-0.4); however, country-level pre-pandemic expenditures on various social protection packages was associated with decreased probability of worsening mental health (-1.3Ã¢â‚¬Â¯ppt, 95%CI: 0.3 to -2.3 per Ã¢â€šÂ¬1,000 increase in health care expenditures per capita and, among the unemployed, -3.8Ã¢â‚¬Â¯ppt, 95%CI: 1.6 to -2.4 per Ã¢â€šÂ¬100 increase in unemployment expenditure per capita). The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with substantial mental health deterioration exhibiting social inequalities. Adverse mental health has been exacerbated by policy responses to the pandemic regulating physical distancing, but social protection expenditure might have helped mitigate the impact. Strengthening social protection systems might render the mental health of the population more resilient to the consequences of crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Mendez-Lopez, Stuckler, McKee, Semenza, Lazarus","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.101017","20220103","COVID-19; Containment measures; Europe; Mental health; Older adults; Physical distancing; Social protection; Socioeconomic inequalities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24514,""
"Factors Associated With Dietary Quality During Initial and Later Stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Mexico","<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the global economy and modified lifestyles. The aim of our study was to identify factors associated with dietary quality, and their frequency, in Mexican adults at the initial and later stages of the pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> Two online surveys were conducted between June and July 2020 (<i>n</i> = 3,131) and between November and December 2020 (<i>n</i> = 1,703 including non-participants from 1st round). A diet quality score was estimated using a short instrument to measure the consumption of several healthy/unhealthy food items. Linear regression models were used to identify the association between pandemic related factors and the diet quality score, adjusted by sociodemographic characteristics. The 2nd round was weighted to represent the 1st round. <b>Results:</b> During the 1st and 2nd rounds only ~12% of the sample perceived that their intake of healthy food decreased, relative to before the pandemic; ~20% perceived that their intake of unhealthy foods increased. Diet quality remained similar between the 1st and 2nd round. The following factors were negatively associated with diet quality: Eating food prepared away-from-home; going out to work Ã¢â€°Â¥4 times/week; decreased time for food preparation; decreased interest in eating healthy; eating more due to anxiety, depression, or boredom; food insecurity; and stockpiling junk food. Purchasing food using a mixed modality of both in-store and home delivery was positively associated with diet quality. With the exception of eating more due to anxiety (reported by 47% of participants), all these factors were reported by a minority of participants during the first round (Ã¢â€°Â¤15%). During the 2nd round, there was an increase in the frequency of participants who reported eating food prepared away-from-home, going out to work Ã¢â€°Â¥4 times/week, having less time to prepare food, being more interested in eating healthfully, and a decrease in participants eating more due to anxiety, depression or boredom, or stockpiling junk food. <b>Conclusions:</b> Most participants perceived that their dietary intake improved during both initial and later stages of the pandemic. This might be related to factors associated with higher dietary quality, such as not going out to work, eating homemade food, and online grocery shopping.","Batis, Irizarry, Castellanos-GutiÃƒÂ©rrez, Aburto, RodrÃƒÂ­guez-RamÃƒÂ­rez, Stern, MejÃƒÂ­a, Bonvecchio","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2021.758661","20220103","COVID-19; Mexico; adults; diet quality; lockdown","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24515,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Avoidance of Health Care, Symptom Severity, and Mental Well-Being in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease","The COVID-19 pandemic affected regular health care for patients with chronic diseases. However, the impact of the pandemic on primary care for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) who are enrolled in a structured disease management program (DMP) in Germany is not clear. We investigated whether the pandemic affected primary care and health outcomes of DMP-CAD patients (<i>n</i> = 750) by using a questionnaire assessing patients' utilization of medical care, CAD symptoms, as well as health behavior and mental health since March 2020. We found that out of concern about getting infected with COVID-19, 9.1% of the patients did not consult a medical practitioner despite having CAD symptoms. Perceived own influence on infection risk was lower and anxiety was higher in these patients compared to symptomatic CAD patients who consulted a physician. Among the patients who reported chest pain lasting longer than 30 min, one third did not consult a medical practitioner subsequently. These patients were generally more worried about COVID-19. Patients with at least one worsening CAD symptom (chest pain, dyspnea, perspiration, or nausea without apparent reason) since the pandemic showed more depressive symptoms, higher anxiety scores, and were less likely to consult a doctor despite having CAD symptoms out of fear of infection. Our results provide evidence that the majority of patients received sufficient medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. However, one in ten patients could be considered particularly at risk for medical undersupply and adverse health outcomes. The perceived infection risk with COVID-19 might have facilitated the decision not to consult a medical doctor.","Maehl, Bleckwenn, Riedel-Heller, Mehlhorn, Lippmann, Deutsch, Schrimpf","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.760265","20220103","Disease Management Program (DMP); SARS-CoV-2; angina pectoris; anxiety; coronary heart disease (CHD); depressive symptoms; primary care; treatment-seeking","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24516,""
"Users' Perception of Violence and Conflicts With Professionals in Primary Care Centers Before and During COVID-19 A Qualitative Study","<b>Background:</b> Workplace violence is a social problem of special interest in both intervention and research. Among the sectors that most perceive this type of violence, health care professionals stand out. The most common type of violence for this professional group is the one perpetrated by the users or patients themselves. It has been reported that one out of every four acts of violence in the workplace occurs in the healthcare setting. Within the health sector, the Mental Health, Emergency and Primary Care services have been widely reported as being among the most vulnerable, with Primary Care being the least addressed of the three. Although the available literature is extensive, there are hardly any studies that explore from a qualitative perspective what are the sources of conflict in this sector from the perspective of the users, the most common being to work with professionals. <b>Objective:</b> The aim of this study is to examine those aspects derived from the organization, the professionals or the users of Primary Care that, from the users' point of view, cause violent situations and how they think these could be avoided. <b>Method:</b> The sample consisted of 80 users of the Primary Care services of the Health Service of Murcia. For data collection, a qualitative study was conducted through 10 focus groups and a subsequent thematic analysis of the data. <b>Results:</b> The results have allowed us to identify that, from an organizational point of view, the uncertainty in waiting times, the need to adapt the telematic or telephone appointment to the different types of users, or the management of emergencies in Primary Care are the aspects that cause most conflicts between users and professionals. In this sense, suggested improvements are aimed at providing information in the mobile application updated on the opening hours or maintaining the telephone appointment for those who need or request it, among many others. As for the professionals, users point out that the medical staff is perceived as distant and sometimes does not provide enough information on the health status of users. Another professional group widely addressed in the focus groups was the administrative staff, being described as lacking in communication skills, assertiveness, or empathy. Users recognize the existence of a demanding/aggressive profile among users, who makes instrumental use of violence to achieve privileges over users in general. We have also identified the profile of the user who makes use of Primary Care as a way of socializing or managing conflicts of a socioemotional nature. As proposals for this thematic block, users suggest group therapies, the use of audiovisual material complementary to the information provided by professionals or community interventions in psychoeducation. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study allows to explore conflicts between users and professionals from the Primary Care patients' perspective. Our results are complementary to the available evidence that has used the professional's approach to study the phenomenon of workplace violence. The identification of sources of conflict and the assessment and contribution of users on possible ways of improvement can serve as a basis for the design of prevention and intervention plans to improve the work environment in Primary Care centers.","Pina, LÃƒÂ³pez-Ros, Luna-Maldonado, Luna Ruiz-Caballero, Llor-Esteban, Ruiz-HernÃƒÂ¡ndez, GarcÃƒÂ­a-JimÃƒÂ©nez, Puente-LÃƒÂ³pez, MartÃƒÂ­nez-Jarreta","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.810014","20220103","Primary Care; healthcare workers; qualitative; users; violence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24517,""
"Suicidality and COVID-19: Suicidal ideation, suicidal behaviors and completed suicides amidst the COVID-19 pandemic (Review)","Since the outbreak of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there has been widespread concern that social isolation, financial stress, depression, limited or variable access to health care services and other pandemic-related stressors may contribute to an increase in suicidal behaviors. In patients who have recovered from COVID-19, an increased risk of developing suicidal behaviors may be noted, while post-COVID syndrome comprises another potential risk factor contributing to increased suicidal behaviors. Despite the initial alarming predictions for an increase in suicide rates due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of published studies to date suggest that experienced difficulties and distress do not inevitably translate into an increased number of suicide-related deaths, at least not in the short-term. Nevertheless, the long-term mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have yet to be unfolded and are likely to remain for a long period of time. Suicide prevention and measures aiming at promoting well-being and mitigating the effects of COVID-19 on mental health, particularly among vulnerable groups, should thus be a priority for healthcare professionals and policymakers amidst the evolving COVID-19 pandemic.","Efstathiou, Stefanou, Siafakas, Makris, Tsivgoulis, Zoumpourlis, Spandidos, Smyrnis, Rizos","https://doi.org/10.3892/etm.2021.11030","20220103","COVID-19; COVID-19 survivors; SARS-CoV-2; suicidal behavior; suicidality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24518,""
"Interplay of Nutrition and Psychoneuroendocrineimmune Modulation: Relevance for COVID-19 in BRICS Nations","The consequences of COVID-19 are not limited to physical health deterioration; the impact on neuropsychological well-being is also substantially reported. The inter-regulation of physical health and psychological well-being through the psychoneuroendocrineimmune (PNEI) axis has enduring consequences in susceptibility, treatment outcome as well as recuperation. The pandemic effects are upsetting the lifestyle, social interaction, and financial security; and also pose a threat through perceived fear. These consequences of COVID-19 also influence the PNEI system and wreck the prognosis. The nutritional status of individuals is also reported to have a determinative role in COVID-19 severity and convalescence. In addition to energetic demand, diet also provides precursor substances [amino acids (AAs), vitamins, etc.] for regulators of the PNEI axis such as neurotransmitters (NTs) and immunomodulators. Moreover, exaggerated immune response and recovery phase of COVID-19 demand additional nutrient intake; widening the gap of pre-existing undernourishment. Mushrooms, fresh fruits and vegetables, herbs and spices, and legumes are few of such readily available food ingredients which are rich in protein and also have medicinal benefits. BRICS nations have their influences on global development and are highly impacted by a large number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths. The adequacy and access to healthcare are also low in BRICS nations as compared to the rest of the world. Attempt to combat the COVID-19 pandemic are praiseworthy in BRICS nations. However, large population sizes, high prevalence of undernourishment (PoU), and high incidence of mental health ailments in BRICS nations provide a suitable landscape for jeopardy of COVID-19. Therefore, appraising the interplay of nutrition and PNEI modulation especially in BRICS countries will provide better understanding; and will aid in combat COVID-19. It can be suggested that the monitoring will assist in designing adjunctive interventions through medical nutrition therapy and psychopsychiatric management.","Mehta, Kumar Ratre, Sharma, Soni, Tiwari, Singh, Dwivedi, Chandra, Prajapati, Shukla, Vishvakarma","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.769884","20220103","BRICS; COVID-19; immunity; neuropsychology; nutrition","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24519,""
"Psychological Distress Among Occupational Health Professionals During Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic in Spain: Description and Effect of Work Engagement and Work Environment","The impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the mental health of hospital health professionals has been widely described, but few studies have focused on occupational health professionals. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess psychological distress (PD) of occupational health workers and its relationship with their work engagement (WE) and work environment characteristics. A cross-sectional survey was conducted. A sample of 499 nurses and physicians participated in the study. Variables included demographic data, work environment characteristics, work engagement Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES-9) and psychological distress General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). The Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detection method was performed for data analysis. Data collection took place <i>via</i> the internet between April 23 and June 24, 2020. A total of 65.53% of the participants had PD, and the total mean score of the UWES-9 scale was 34.80 (SD = 10.69). Workload, conflicts, stressful situations, and less job satisfaction were significantly related to a higher percentage of PD (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Participants with low engagement showed higher levels of PD (76.7%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The dedication was revealed as the most significant dimension. Interventions aimed at promoting resilience and coping strategies are suggested. WE should be fostered as a preventive measure against PD among occupational health workers. By protecting workers, occupational health departments have a shared responsibility with public health in containing the pandemic. Therefore, it is essential to prevent the psychological impact that this responsibility may have on occupational health workers by implementing prevention measures.","Ruiz-Frutos, Ortega-Moreno, Soriano-TarÃƒÂ­n, Romero-MartÃƒÂ­n, Allande-CussÃƒÂ³, Cabanillas-Moruno, GÃƒÂ³mez-Salgado","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.765169","20220103","COVID-19; healthcare professionals; nursing; occupational health; occupational medicine; psychological distress; work engagement","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24520,""
"Emotional Intelligence and Academic Self-Efficacy in Relation to the Psychological Well-Being of University Students During COVID-19 in Venezuela","Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, educational centers and universities in Venezuela have closed their physical plants and are migrating to emergency remote education to continue with academic programs. This empirical study aimed to analyze the predictive capacity of academic self-efficacy and emotional intelligence skills on each of the dimensions of psychological well-being. We employed a cross-sectional predictive design. The sample comprised 277 university students, of which 252 were female (91.00%). Their ages ranged from 18 to 45 years, with a mean of 20.35 (<i>SD</i> = 2.29). Non-probabilistic chance sampling was used. For data collection, we used an anonymous online form, contacted students by mail, and invited them to participate in the study. Questionnaires were available between 217 and 227 days of decreed quarantine in Venezuela. The results indicated average levels of academic self-efficacy (Me = 4; IQR = 2), emotional intelligence: clarity (Me = 27; IQR = 10), attention (Me = 25; IQR = 10) y repair (Me = 25; IQR = 12), and psychological well-being (Me = 35; IQR = 5). We found differences according to sex and age, specifically in emotional regulation (<i>z</i> = 3.73, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, <i>d</i> = 0.438) and in bonds of psychological well-being (<i>z</i> = 2.51, <i>p</i> = 0.012, <i>d</i> = 0.276) favoring men (Me = 33, IQR = 9; Me = 8, IQR = 1), respectively. Regarding age, statistically significant differences were found in the group of students older than 21 years with higher perception of psychological well-being (<i>z</i> = 3.69, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, <i>d</i> = 0.43) and in each of its dimensions. Emotional intelligence and academic self-efficacy were found to be significant predictors of psychological well-being and its dimensions, specifically on control (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup>-Cox = 0.25, <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup>-Nagelkerke = 0.34, 69.90% of total correct classification), links (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup>-Cox = 0.09, <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup>-Nagelkerke = 0.12, 65.07% of total correct classification), projects (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup>-Cox = 0.32, <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup>-Nagelkerke = 0.46, 78.40% of total correct classification), acceptance (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup>-Cox = 0.17, <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup>-Nagelkerke = 0.23, 68.28% of total correct classification), and total well-being (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup>-Cox = 0.52, <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup>-Nagelkerke = 0.71, 87.16% of total correct classification).

"Understanding Mental Burden and Factors Associated With Study Worries Among Undergraduate Medical Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is affecting many areas of life and has led to major changes in undergraduate medical education. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, high mental burden of medical students has frequently been reported in the literature. Additional pandemic-specific stressors could exacerbate this situation. This study aimed to assess mental health outcomes among medical students during the first semester after the COVID-19 outbreak and perception of the students on how the learning environment has changed. In May 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional survey among undergraduate medical students at a large medical school in Germany. The survey included validated mental health instruments (Distress Thermometer, Patient Health Questionnaire 4) and self-developed items to examine the perception of the study situation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Open-ended questions were analyzed by conventional content analyses. The response rate was 59.2% (914/1,545). Overall, 61.9% of the students reported distress levels above the cutoff. Year 1 students reported significantly higher levels of distress, anxiety and depression than students during their second to fourth year of studies. 48.3% of the students indicated a decrease in their study motivation since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic with significant differences between study years. The binary logistic regression model showed that male gender, being in study year 2, higher distress scores and higher symptoms of depression were significantly associated with a higher likelihood for experiencing serious worries. In the open-ended questions on current concerns related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their studies, students most frequently reported concerns about missing relevant practical learning experience, difficulties with self-regulated learning and self motivation as well as study-related worries. Year 4 students reported significantly more worries about the lack of practical training than students from study years 1 to 3. Analysis of gender differences showed that female students reported more frequently diverse worries. In contrast, female students shared more frequently helpful strategies in all the categories compared to male students. Our findings suggest that medical students experience significant levels of distress and mental burden during the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the need for ongoing psychological and educational support for medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic and after.","Guse, Heinen, Mohr, Bergelt","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.734264","20220103","COVID-19; learning environment; medical education; mental health; undergraduate medical students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24522,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on Mental Health of Chinese Residents in Its Initial Stage","This study aims to investigate the effect of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the Chinese public's mental health during its early stage. We collected the data through an online questionnaire survey. Specifically, we adopted the impact of event scale-revised (IES-R) and state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) to assess symptomatic responses to exposure to traumatic life events and public anxiety, respectively, in the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Then, we evaluated the differences in the scores among various socio-demographic groups using Kruskal-Wakkis H tests and <i>t</i>-tests and analyzed the IES-R, state anxiety (SA) score, and trait anxiety (TA) score using the Pearson correlation analysis. Finally, we conducted a path analysis to determine the mediating role of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms (measured by the IES-R) in the relationship between TA and SA. The results show that the average of the SA and TA scores were 48.0Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°10.4 and 38.0Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°8.2, respectively; the respondents who suffered from mild, moderate, and severe psychological impacts because of the health crisis accounted for 21.9, 5.2, and 13.1%, respectively; farmers have the highest IES-R score than others; people with the highest income have the lowest SA level; a significant positive correlation existed between the IES-R and STAI scores; and TA produces both direct and indirect (through the IES-R) effects on SA. Overall, the general Chinese public exhibited much higher anxiety levels than normal in the early days of the pandemic outbreak.

"The Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown on Eating, Body Image, and Social Media Habits Among Women With and Without Symptoms of Orthorexia Nervosa","The COVID-19 pandemic is negatively impacting people's mental health worldwide. The current study examined the effects of COVID-19 lockdown on adult women's eating, body image, and social media habits. Furthermore, we compared individuals with and without signs of orthorexia nervosa, a proposed eating disorder. Participants were 143 women, aged 17-73 years (<i>M</i> = 25.85, <i>SD</i> = 8.12), recruited during a COVID-19 lockdown in Canada from May-June 2020. Participants completed self-report questionnaires on their eating, body image, and social media habits during the pandemic. The Eating Habits Questionnaire (EHQ) assessed symptoms of orthorexia nervosa. Compared to the period prior to lockdown, women with higher total orthorexia nervosa scores reported eating a lot more than usual, feeling greater pressure to diet and lose weight, thinking about food more often than usual, experiencing greater weight gain, and perceiving more pressure from social media specifically to lose weight and to exercise, compared to their healthy counterparts. We examined associations between individual EHQ subscales and perceived changes to eating and weight. Women who scored high on EHQ-Problems reported seeing more weight loss content on their social media than those who reported fewer orthorexia nervosa symptoms. Conversely, those who scored low on EHQ-Feelings reported feeling a lot less pressure to lose weight, somewhat less or a lot less pressure to lose weight or to exercise from social media specifically, and trended toward less laxative use during lockdown, compared to those who scored higher on orthorexia nervosa. And those who scored low on EHQ-Knowledge reported feeling somewhat less or a lot less pressure to lose weight than those who reported more orthorexia nervosa symptoms. Together, the findings suggest that women with symptoms of orthorexia nervosa are experiencing an exacerbation of disordered eating thoughts and behaviors during COVID-19, and that social media may be a contributing factor.","Gobin, Mills, McComb","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.716998","20220103","COVID-19; body image; eating; orthorexia nervosa; social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24524,""

"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Well-Being A Nationwide Online Survey Covering Three Pandemic Waves in Poland","The COVID-19 pandemic has a significant impact on human life. This study aims to assess the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms, and the assessment of the quality of life in different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic based on an online nationwide survey. The study was based on a voluntary, anonymous, and authors' own questionnaire. The first section assesses sociodemographic status. Then, standardized psychometric tools were used such as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7), and the Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life (MANSA). The study was conducted in three stages corresponding to the waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland. The survey involved 5,790 respondents; 2,457, 1,626, and 1,707 for the first, second, and third pandemic wave, respectively. It was found that anxiety and depressive symptoms increased as the pandemic progressed. There was no significant effect on the subjective quality-of-life assessment. Moreover, there was a gradual decrease in anxiety about being infected with COVID-19 as well as reduced adherence to the Minister of Health's recommendations. As the COVID-19 pandemic progressed, depressive and anxiety symptoms increased among Poles. Women, singles, and people with prior psychiatric treatment are more likely to develop the aforementioned symptoms.","Babicki, Kowalski, BogudziÃ…â€žska, Mastalerz-Migas","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.804123","20220103","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; mental health; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24527,""
"The Psychological Impact of COVID-19 on Healthcare Workers in Saudi Arabia: A Year Later Into the Pandemic","<b>Objective:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic poses unprecedented challenges to healthcare workers worldwide. This study sought to estimate the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among healthcare workers in Saudi Arabia, and to identify the factors associated with these psychological disorders. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted from January 21 to March 2, 2021. Physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and other healthcare workers from different parts of Saudi Arabia were recruited through snowball sampling. Psychological outcomes were measured using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Pearson's chi-square test was used to explore the bivariate association between diverse characteristics and each outcome. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. <b>Results:</b> A total of 501 healthcare workers completed the survey, of whom 60% were female and nearly half were pharmacists. The majority (76.25%) of respondents reported that a family member, friend, or colleague had contracted COVID-19, and more than one-third (36%) knew someone who died due to COVID-19. Overall, the estimated prevalence rates of depression, anxiety, and stress were 54.69, 60.88, and 41.92%, respectively. The multivariate analysis revealed that healthcare workers with chronic diseases, nurses, and healthcare workers from the southern region were more likely to suffer from depression and stress. Further, individuals with positive COVID-19 test results showed a greater proportion of depressive symptoms compared to others. In addition, knowing someone who died due to COVID-19 and having a chronic illness were predisposing factors for anxiety. <b>Conclusion:</b> After more than a year, the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress remains substantial among healthcare workers in Saudi Arabia. The findings can help guide efforts to mitigate the psychological impact of the pandemic.","Almalki, Alzahrani, Alshehri, Alharbi, Alkhudaydi, Alshahrani, Alzaidi, Algarni, Alsaab, Alatawi, Althobaiti, Bamaga, Alhifany","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.797545","20220103","COVID-19; Saudi Arabia (KSA); anxiety; depression; health care workers (HCW); mental health; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24528,""
"More Depressive Symptoms, Alcohol and Drug Consumption: Increase in Mental Health Symptoms Among University Students After One Year of the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Background:</b> As the majority of studies examining mental health during the pandemic are cross-sectional, little is known about the changes in mental health during the pandemic, especially in university students. Most studies indicate a worsening of mental health conditions. This study aimed to evaluate the mental health status of German university students during the third wave of the pandemic in 2021 and to compare the results to a sample of a congruent cross-sectional study from 2020. <b>Methods:</b> Two cross-sectional and anonymous online surveys among university students were conducted (first survey: July-August 2020, <i>N</i> = 3,382; second survey: March-April 2021, <i>N</i> = 5,642). Mental health status was assessed with standardized measures (depressive symptoms, alcohol and drug consumption, and eating disorder symptoms), and social and emotional aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic were assessed. In addition to descriptive statistics and group comparisons of the two survey samples from 2020 and 2021, respectively, risk and protective factors related to mental health were analyzed. <b>Results:</b> There were significant differences in severities of depressive symptoms and alcohol and drug consumption between the two online surveys from 2020 and 2021. Findings suggest an increase in the severity of depressive symptoms as well as alcohol and drug consumption. Significantly more respondents reported suicidal ideation in the survey from 2021. Lower self-efficacy, less social support and lower resilience as well as higher perceived stress and more loneliness were reported by the participants of the survey from 2021 compared to 2020. Regarding factors predicting mental health symptoms, being female was a positive predictor for hazardous alcohol use and anorexia nervosa in comparison to men. Further, younger age, being diverse, higher perceived stress and loneliness were positive predictors for all mental health outcomes. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study reveals an increase in severities of depressive symptoms, including suicidal ideation, drug and alcohol consumption among students. Being diverse, younger age, higher perceived stress and loneliness were mutual risk factors for higher depressive and eating disorder symptoms as well as alcohol consumption. Universities and health care policy should recognize and address mental health issues of young adults during ongoing times of crisis and invest in easy-to-access interventions.","Dogan-Sander, Kohls, Baldofski, Rummel-Kluge","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.790974","20220103","COVID-19; alcohol consumption; depressive symptoms; mental health; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24529,""
"Use of Transcutaneous Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation as an Adjuvant Therapy for the Depressive Symptoms of COVID-19: A Literature Review","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) comprises more than just severe acute respiratory syndrome. It also interacts with the cardiovascular, nervous, renal, and immune systems at multiple levels, increasing morbidity in patients with underlying cardiometabolic conditions and inducing myocardial injury or dysfunction. Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), which is derived from auricular acupuncture, has become a popular therapy that is increasingly accessible to the general public in modern China. Here, we begin by outlining the historical background of taVNS, and then describe important links between dysfunction in proinflammatory cytokine release and related multiorgan damage in COVID-19. Furthermore, we emphasize the important relationships between proinflammatory cytokines and depressive symptoms. Finally, we discuss how taVNS improves immune function via the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway and modulates brain circuits via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, making taVNS an important treatment for depressive symptoms on post-COVID-19 sequelae. Our review suggests that the link between anti-inflammatory processes and brain circuits could be a potential target for treating COVID-19-related multiorgan damage, as well as depressive symptoms using taVNS.","Guo, SÃƒÂ¶rÃƒÂ¶s, Zhang, Yang, Liao, Liu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.765106","20220103","COVID-19; brain circuits; depression; epidemic; transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24530,""
"Worsened Financial Situation During the COVID-19 Pandemic Was Associated With Depressive Symptomatology Among University Students in Germany: Results of the COVID-19 International Student Well-Being Study","<b>Background:</b> Previous findings suggest that university students are at an elevated risk to experience financial hardship and to suffer from depressive symptoms. This vulnerability may have substantially increased during the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic which might have affected students' socio-economic situation but possibly also their mental well-being. We examined whether the financial situation changed during the COVID-19 pandemic among German university students, and whether changes were associated with mental well-being. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a cross-sectional online survey in May and July 2020 at five German universities. Participants were asked, if they had sufficient financial resources to cover monthly expenses before and during the pandemic. The answer options were dichotomized into worsened and no change/better financial situation compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the CES-D 8 scale. For examining associations between sociodemographic, study-related, and financial factors and ""worsened financial situation,"" we ran a generalized linear mixed model. To assess associations between depressive symptoms and worsened financial situation, we performed a linear mixed model. <b>Results:</b> We included 7,199 participants in the analyses (69% female, 30% male, 1% diverse, mean age: 24 years, standard deviation: 4.7). Overall, 25% of the participants reported to have a worsened financial situation at the time of the survey than in the time before COVID-19. Factors associated with a worsened financial situation were migration background, parents not being academics, not being able to borrow money, and payment of tuition fee by student and loan [odds ratios (OR) ranging from 1.20 to 2.35]. Factors associated with lower odds were: being single, living with others, studying a health-related field, being enrolled in a doctoral/Ph.D. or state exam program, and publicly funded tuition/tuition paid with a scholarship (OR ranging from 0.42 to 0.80). A worsened financial situation was associated with 1.02 points more on the CES-D 8 scale (95% CI: 0.80-1.24). <b>Conclusion:</b> Our results suggest that the pandemic put a number of students under financial strain with detrimental consequences for their mental well-being. Renewed attention must be paid to this vulnerable group to prevent the potentially damaging effects on their mental health.","Negash, Kartschmit, Mikolajczyk, Watzke, Matos Fialho, Pischke, Busse, Helmer, Stock, Zeeb, Wendt, Niephaus, Schmidt-Pokrzywniak","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.743158","20220103","COVID-19 pandemic; depressive symptoms; financial situation; mental health; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24531,""
"What Family Circumstances, During COVID-19, Impact on Parental Mental Health in an Inner City Community in London?","The introduction of lockdown due to a public health emergency in March 2020 marked the beginning of substantial changes to daily life for all families with young children. Here we report the experience of families from London Borough of Tower Hamlets with high rates of poverty and ethnic and linguistic diversity. This inner city community, like communities worldwide, has experienced a reduction or closure in access to education, support services, and in some cases, a change in or loss of income, job, and food security. Using quantitative survey items (<i>N</i> = 992), we examined what differences in family circumstances, for mothers and fathers of young children aged 0-5 living in Tower Hamlets, during March 2020 to November 2020, were associated with their mental health status. We measure parental mental health using symptoms of depression (self-report: Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale: PHQ-8), symptoms of anxiety levels (self-report: General Anxiety Disorder: GAD-7), and perceptions of direct loneliness. We find parental mental health difficulties are associated with low material assets (financial security, food security, and children having access to outside space), familial assets (parents time for themselves and parent status: lone vs. cohabiting), and community assets (receiving support from friends and family outside the household). South Asian parents and fathers across ethnicities were significantly more likely to experience mental health difficulties, once all other predictors were accounted for. These contributing factors should be considered for future pandemics, where restrictions on people's lives are put in place, and speak to the importance of reducing financial insecurity and food insecurity as a means of improving the mental health of parents.","Whitaker, Cameron, Hauari, Hollingworth, O'Brien","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.725823","20220103","child mental health; financial insecurity; food poverty; inner city; mental health; poverty","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24532,""
"How is the life without unicorns? A within-individual study on the relationship between uncertainty and mental health indicators: The moderating role of neuroticism","The pandemic crisis of COVID-19 led to higher levels of uncertainty for individuals. Mental health has been outlined as a major key research priority to support and inform interventions. This study aimed to examine whether uncertainty influenced negative affect which in turn, resulted in worst levels of mental health, during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, and test if neuroticism moderated the negative effect of uncertainty on mental health, via negative affect. To capture changes in daily uncertainty, negative affect and mental health, a daily design was adopted to test our model. We collected data through five consecutive days (<i>N</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 320), in the early ""lockdown"" stage of the pandemic. The multilevel results showed a significant mediation effect from daily uncertainty to daily mental health via daily negative affect. In addition, neuroticism moderated the mediated relationship, in such a way that the relationship between daily uncertainty on daily mental health, via daily negative affect was strengthened when neuroticism was higher. In sum, living without unicorns, or see the world though a black lens, is a factor that enhances the blackness of uncertainty.","JunÃƒÂ§a-Silva, Silva","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.111462","20220103","Diary study; Mental health; Negative affect; Neuroticism; Uncertainty","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24533,""
"Mental health assessment of Spanish frontline healthcare workers during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic","The Covid-19 pandemic continues challenging health systems globally, exposing healthcare workers to constant physical and psychological stressors. To date, several studies have already shown the catastrophic impact on the mental health of medical personnel during the early period of the pandemic. Nevertheless, literature evidences the dearth of works that evaluate the effect over time, understanding the pandemic as a sustained extreme stressor. The present study examines the effect of the pandemic on the mental health of Covid-19 frontline healthcare workers at six months follow-up. A total of 141 frontline healthcare workers from two tertiary hospitals were recruited between July and November 2020. Healthcare workers were evaluated psychologically at baseline and six months follow-up (January to May 2021) using psychometric tests for the assessment of acute stress (VASS, PSS-10, PCL-5), anxiety (STAI) and depression (PHQ-2) RESULTS: Overall, there was a general worsening of the mental health between the two psychological assessments, especially regarding depression and predisposition to perceiving the situations as a threat. Nurses and nurse aides showed poorer mental health while physicians improved over time. Reduced working hours and higher physical exercise resulted in better mental health among healthcare workers. Women and nursing staff were the most affected by psychological distress at baseline and six months follow-up. Reduced working hours, adequate resting periods, physical exercise, and efficient intervention strategies are of utmost importance in preventing, controlling, and reducing psychological distress among healthcare workers when coping with critical scenarios such as the current pandemic.","SangrÃƒÂ , Ribeiro, Esteban-SepÃƒÂºlveda, PagÃƒÂ¨s, Barbeito, Llobet, Moya-Prats, PÃƒÂ©rez, Mir","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medcli.2021.11.007","20220103","Acute stress symptoms; Ansiedad; Anxiety symptoms; DepresiÃƒÂ³n; Depression symptoms; EstrÃƒÂ©s agudo; EstrÃƒÂ©s postraumÃƒÂ¡tico; Healthcare workers; Pandemia SARS-CoV-2; Personal sanitario; Posttraumatic stress disorder; SARS-CoV-2 pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24534,""

"Structural and psychosocial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV care and treatment outcomes among female sex workers in the Dominican Republic","The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated socio-economic disruptions has disproportionally affected marginalized populations including people living with HIV (PLHIV). Little is known about how the pandemic has impacted populations experiencing multiple forms of stigma, discrimination and violence such as female sex workers (FSW) living with HIV. We conducted a cross-sectional survey between August and December 2020 among 187 FSW living with HIV in the Dominican Republic (DR) to examine the impact of COVID-19. Using multivariable logistic regression, we examined associations between COVID-19-related financial concerns, mental health, substance use and partner abuse on engagement in HIV care and ART adherence. We conducted mediation analysis to assess whether mental health challenges mediated the impact of partner abuse or substance use on HIV outcomes. Most participants reported no income (72%) or a substantial decline in income (25%) since the COVID-19 pandemic. Approximately one third (34%) reported COVID-19 had an impact on their HIV care and treatment. Greater COVID-19 financial concerns (aOR=1.14, 95% CI: 1.02-1.27), mental health challenges (aOR=1.38, 95% CI: 1.06-1.79) and partner emotional abuse (aOR=2.62, 95% CI: 1.01-6.79) were associated with higher odds of negatively impacted HIV care, respectively. The relationship between increased emotional partner abuse and negatively impacted HIV care was mediated by greater COVID-19-related mental health challenges. FSW living with HIV in the DR have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Informing the future of integrated digital and clinical mental health care: a synthesis of the outcomes from Project Synergy","Globally, there are fundamental shortcomings in mental health care systems, including restricted access, siloed services, interventions that are poorly matched to service users' needs, underutilisation of personal outcome monitoring to track progress, exclusion of family and carers, and suboptimal experiences of care. Health information technologies (HITs) hold great potential to improve these aspects that underpin enhanced quality of mental health care. Project Synergy aimed to co-design, implement, and evaluate novel HITs, as exemplified by the InnoWell Platform, to work with standard health care organisations. The goals were to deliver improved outcomes for specific populations under focus and support organisations to enact significant system-level reforms. Participating health care organisations included: Open Arms - Veterans &amp; Families Counselling (in Sydney and Lismore, New South Wales (NSW)); NSW North Coast headspace centres for youth (Port Macquarie, Coffs Harbour, Grafton, Lismore, Tweed Heads); The Butterfly Foundation's National Helpline for eating disorders; Kildare Road Medical Centre for enhanced primary-care, and Connect to Wellbeing North Coast NSW (administered by Neami National) for population-based intake and assessment. Service users, families and carers, health professionals and administrators of services across Australia were actively engaged in configuration of the InnoWell Platform to meet service needs, identify barriers to and facilitators of quality mental health care, and highlight potentially the best points in the service pathway to integrate the InnoWell Platform. The locally configured InnoWell Platform was then implemented within the respective services. A mixed methods approach, including surveys, semi-structured interviews, and workshops, was used to evaluate the impact of the InnoWell Platform. A participatory systems modelling approach involving co-design with local stakeholders was also undertaken to simulate the likely impact of the platform in combination with other services being considered for implementation within the North Coast Primary Health Network to explore resulting impacts on mental health outcomes, including suicide prevention. Despite overwhelming support for integrating digital health solutions into mental health service settings, and promising impacts of the platform simulated under idealised implementation conditions, our results emphasized that successful implementation is dependent on health professional and service readiness for change, leadership at the local service level, the appropriateness and responsiveness of the technology for the target end users, and, critically, funding models being available to support implementation. The key places of interoperability of digital solutions and a willingness to use technology to coordinate health care system use were also highlighted. Whilst the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in widespread acceptance of very basic digital health solutions, Project Synergy highlights the critical need to support equity of access to HITs, provide funding for digital infrastructure and digital mental health care, and, to promote actively the use of technology-enabled, coordinated systems of care.","LaMonica, Iorfino, Lee, Piper, Occhipinti, Davenport, Cross, Milton, Ospina-Pinillos, Whittle, Rowe, Dowling, Stewart, Ottavio, Hockey, Cheng, Burns, Scott, Hickie","https://doi.org/10.2196/33060","20220102","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24537,""

"Potential role of Drug Repositioning Strategy (DRS) for management of tauopathy","Tauopathy is a term that has been used to represent a pathological condition in which hyperphosphorylated tau protein aggregates in neurons and glia which results in neurodegeneration, synapse loss and dysfunction and cognitive impairments. Recently, drug repositioning strategy (DRS) becomes a promising field and an alternative approach to advancing new treatments from actually developed and FDA approved drugs for an indication other than the indication it was originally intended for. This paradigm provides an advantage because the safety of the candidate compound has already been established, which abolishes the need for further preclinical safety testing and thus substantially reduces the time and cost involved in progressing of clinical trials. In the present review, we focused on correlation between tauopathy and common diseases as type 2 diabetes mellitus and the global virus COVID-19 and how tau pathology can aggravate development of these diseases in addition to how these diseases can be a risk factor for development of tauopathy. Moreover, correlation between COVID-19 and type 2 diabetes mellitus was also discussed. Therefore, repositioning of a drug in the daily clinical practice of patients to manage or prevent two or more diseases at the same time with lower side effects and drug-drug interactions is a promising idea. This review concluded the results of pre-clinical and clinical studies applied on antidiabetics, COVID-19 medications, antihypertensives, antidepressants and cholesterol lowering drugs for possible drug repositioning for management of tauopathy.","Zaki, Elsherbiny, Salama, Azab","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2021.120267","20220102","Aging; COVID-19; Cholesterol; Depression; Diabetes; Drug repositioning; Hypertension; Tauopathy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24539,""
"Impairment of aversive episodic memories during pandemic: The impact of emotional context on COVID-19 memory processes","The threatening context of the COVID-19 pandemic provided a unique setting to study the effects of negative psychological symptoms on memory processes. Episodic memory is an essential function of the human being related to the ability to store and remember experiences and anticipate possible events in the future. Studying this function in this context is crucial to understand what effects the pandemic will have on the formation of episodic memories. To study this, the formation of episodic memories was evaluated by free recall, recognition, and episode order tasks for an aversive and neutral content. The results indicated that aversive episodic memory is impaired both in the free recall task and in the recognition task. Even the beneficial effect that emotional memory usually has for the episodic order was undermined as there were no differences between the neutral and aversive condition. The present work adds to the evidence that indicates that the level of activation does not modify memory processes in a linear way, which also depends on the type of recall and the characteristics of the content to be encoded.","Candela SofÃƒÂ­a, MatÃƒÂ­as, BenÃƒÂ­tez Facundo, Luis Ignacio, Jingyi, Cecilia","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nlm.2021.107575","20220101","Anxiety; Consolidation; Depression; Encoding","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24540,""
"Connecting during COVID: The application of teleservices in two integrated perinatal settings","Integrated perinatal behavioral healthcare provides opportunities to support women and their babies as part of their primary care medical home. The COVID-19 pandemic required significant changes to be made to medical practices to enhance safety and reduce risk, particularly for vulnerable populations, including pregnant women. Previously established modes of mental health service delivery in the HEART program, an integrated behavioral health program embedded in a primary care clinic for adolescent mothers and their babies, and the PROMISE Clinic, an integrated obstetric behavioral health program that serves pregnant women, quickly pivoted to telehealth services because of the pandemic. HEART serves a racially and ethnically diverse patient population, with over 85% of patients publicly insured. The PROMISE Clinic serves a socioeconomically, racially, and ethnically diverse patient population. Behavioral health clinicians implemented a variety of technology-based services including telephone interventions and support, virtual visits using iPads during medical visits, and video visits that patients accessed from their homes. In HEART, behavioral health visits continued at pre-COVID rates during telehealth adaptations. In the PROMISE clinic, the number of perinatal women seen doubled, the total number of patient contacts tripled, and the missed appointment rate significantly decreased during COVID. In the PROMISE clinic, significantly more White and Hispanic perinatal women were seen during COVID and telehealth adaptations, while significantly fewer Black perinatal women were seen during this period. Further research is indicated to examine patient attitudes towards telehealth services, barriers to treatment for Black women, and outcome data.","Ehmer, Scott, Smith, Ashby","https://doi.org/10.1002/imhj.21958","20220101","integrated behavioral health; perinatal mental health; telehealth services","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24541,""
"Taking care of the caregivers: The moderating role of reflective supervision in the relationship between COVID-19 stress and the mental and professional well-being of the IECMH workforce","The present study examined the relationships between COVID-related stress, mental health and professional burnout in the infant and early child mental health (IECMH) workforce and examined reflective supervision and consultation (RSC) as a potential protective factor in the context of COVID-related stress. Participants included 123 adults (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 121 female, modal age range 30-39 years) in the TN IECMH workforce (mean years of experienceÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 13.6 years) surveyed in June/July 2020. Sector representation was quite varied (home visiting, childcare, child welfare, early intervention). Results indicated the majority (63%) of the sample was caring for someone else (e.g., child or elderly person) while working at home, 46% of the sample had depression symptoms (18% in the moderate-severe range), and 75% of the sample had anxiety symptoms (33% in the moderate-severe range). Higher COVID stress was associated with higher internalizing symptoms and burnout levels and this relationship was mediated by self-care behaviors such that the more COVID stress one reported, the fewer self-care behaviors they engaged in, and the higher the risk for internalizing and burnout. Finally, the pathway from COVID stress to self-care behaviors was moderated by RSC. IECMH professionals who received less than 1 year (or no experience) of RSC showed a significant decrease in self-care behaviors during times of low, average and high levels of COVID stress compared to those who received 1 year or more of RSC. Implications for both policy and practice will be discussed.","Morelen, Najm, Wolff, Daniel","https://doi.org/10.1002/imhj.21956","20220101","COVID-19; burnout; infant and early childhood mental health; reflective supervision and consultation; self-care; stress; workforce","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24542,""
"Nurses' Experiences of Psychiatric Care in Acute Care Units with an Open Door Policy","Social distancing and the recent lock down due to COVID-19 has increased the feeling of disconnection, isolation, and suffering in vulnerable individuals and has brought forward questions regarding open acute care psychiatric units that cannot be answered by the literature. In Greece, there is no available research on how open ward environments are perceived and experienced by mental health professionals. The aim of the present study was to illuminate nurses' experiences of working in a public psychiatric hospital which traditionally operates with open doors. Eleven nursing care providers were interviewed, and thematic analysis was employed to explore their experiences of working in locked psychiatric acute care units. Participants described nursing care in units with an open door policy as ""acceptance,"" ""availability of staff,"" ""real respect for the person,"" ""ensuring patients' rights,"" ""listening to the person,"" and ""negotiation and not imposition."" Trust in therapeutic relationships was perceived as greatly dependent on the trust being given to patients indirectly by the open door policy. Being trusted enhanced patients' self-determination and self-confidence leading to their empowerment. Containment of an acute mental health crisis took place through medication and meaningful discussions with patients and significant others rather than locking the door of the unit. Overall, meaningful care led to professional emancipation, but compassion fatigue narratives emphasized the need for continuous education, support and clinical supervision as necessary support for mental health nurses in a system of mental health provision often reduced to the point of crisis.","Missouridou, Xiarhou, Fradelos, Mangoulia, Kasidi, Kritsiotakis, Stefanou, Liapis, Dimitriadis, Segredou, Dafogianni, Evagelou","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-78771-4_15","20220103","Acute psychiatric care; Greece; Mental health nursing; Open door policy; Open wards; Qualitative","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24543,""

"The mediating role of resilience in the effects of physical exercise on college students' negative emotions during the COVID-19 epidemic","Due to its suddenness and unpredictability, COVID-19 caused strife and effects on public mental health, resulting in a surge of negative emotions. The study explores the relationship between physical exercise and negative emotions in home-based college students during the COVID-19 epidemic, as well as the mediating role of resilience, thus providing a new basis for understanding the role of physical exercise in improving negative emotions in college students; A total of 1214 college students were investigated with the Physical Exercise Questionnaire, Negative Emotion Scale and Resilience Scale; Both physical exercise and resilience were significantly negatively correlated with negative emotions in college students (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.25, -Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.33, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), and there was a significant positive correlation between physical exercise and resilience (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.47, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001).

"'We weren't checked in on, nobody spoke to us': an exploratory qualitative analysis of two focus groups on the concerns of ethnic minority NHS staff during COVID-19","To gain exploratory insights into the multifaceted, lived experience impact of COVID-19 on a small sample of ethnic minority healthcare staff to cocreate a module of questions for follow-up online surveys on the well-being of healthcare staff during the pandemic. A cross-sectional design using two online focus groups among ethnic minority healthcare workers who worked in care or supportive roles in a hospital, community health or primary care setting for at least 12 months. Thirteen healthcare workers (11 female) aged 26-62 years from diverse ethnic minority backgrounds, 11 working in clinical roles. Five primary thematic domains emerged: (1) <i>viral vulnerability</i>, centring around perceived individual risk and vulnerability perceptions; (2) <i>risk assessment</i>, comprising pressures to comply, perception of a tick-box exercise and issues with risk and resource stratification; (3) <i>interpersonal relations in the workplace</i>, highlighting deficient consultation of ethnic minority staff, cultural insensitivity, need for support and collegiate judgement; (4) <i>lived experience of racial inequality</i>, consisting of job insecurity and the exacerbation of systemic racism and its emotional burden; (5) <i>community attitudes</i>, including public prejudice and judgement, and patient appreciation. Our novel study has shown ethnic minority National Health Service (NHS) staff have experienced COVID-19 in a complex, multidimensional manner. Future research with a larger sample should further examine the complexity of these experiences and should enumerate the extent to which these varied thematic experiences are shared among ethnic minority NHS workers so that more empathetic and supportive management and related occupational practices can be instituted.","Jesuthasan, Powell, Burmester, Nicholls","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-053396","20220103","COVID-19; health &amp; safety; mental health; occupational &amp; industrial medicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24546,""
"Pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic: an exploration of patients' lived experiences","Infectious outbreaks are known to cause fear and panic. Exploration of pregnant individuals' psychosocial condition using a qualitative lens during an infectious outbreak is limited. In this study we explore pregnant individuals' lived experiences as well as their psychological and behavioural responses during COVID-19 with the goal of providing useful strategies from the patient's perspective to enable health care providers to help pregnant patients navigate this and future pandemics. Pregnant individuals between 20-weeks gestation and 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°months postpartum who received maternity care from an urban academic interprofessional teaching unit in Toronto, Canada were invited to participate. Semi-structured 60Ã¢â‚¬â€°min interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and analyzed using descriptive thematic analysis. Interview questions probed psychological responses to the pandemic, behavioural and lifestyle changes, strategies to mitigate distress while pregnant during COVID-19 and advice for other patients and the healthcare team. There were 12 participants, mean age 35Ã¢â‚¬â€°years (range 30-43Ã¢â‚¬â€°years), all 1 to 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°months postpartum. Six main themes emerged: 1) Childbearing-related challenges to everyday life; 2) Increased worry, uncertainty and fear; 3) Pervasive sense of loss; 4) Challenges accessing care; 5) Strategies for coping with pandemic stress; 6) Reflections and advice to other pregnant people and health care professionals. Pregnant individuals described lack of social support due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions and a profound sense of loss of what they thought their pregnancy and postpartum period should have been. Advice to healthcare providers included providing mental health support, clear and up to date communication as well as more postpartum and breastfeeding support. These participants described experiencing psychosocial distress during their pregnancies and postpartum. In a stressful situation such as a global pandemic, health care providers need to play a pivotal role to ensure pregnant individuals feel supported and receive consistent care throughout the pregnancy and postpartum period. The health care provider should ensure that mental health concerns are addressed and provide postpartum and breastfeeding support. Without addressing this need for support, parental mental health, relationships, parent-infant bonding, and infant development may be negatively impacted.","Kolker, Biringer, Bytautas, Blumenfeld, Kukan, Carroll","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-021-04337-9","20220103","COVID-19; Mental health; Pregnancy; Psychosocial behavior; Support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24547,""
"Mental Health of Siblings of Children with Rare Congenital Surgical Diseases during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Ã¢â‚¬Æ’The COVID-19 pandemic has affected every aspect of our society, particularly vulnerable groups, such as families with children suffering from rare diseases. However, the psychosocial influences of COVID-19 on the healthy siblings of children with rare diseases have not been investigated yet. Thus, the study aimed to evaluate the mental health of healthy siblings of children with rare congenital surgical diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Siblings of children with rare congenital surgical diseases were investigated cross-sectionally between April 2020 and April 2021. Data on mental health were collected using the parent-version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Out of 104 families, 81 (77.88%) participated in the survey. Healthy siblings presented with comparable levels of emotional and behavioral difficulties compared with population norms before the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared with studies that surveyed child and adolescent mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, parents of siblings in this study reported a significantly lower impairment rate. Psychosocial and disease-specific risk factors of the respective outcomes in healthy siblings were identified through regression analysis models. Ã¢â‚¬Æ’In general, health-care professionals should be aware of the possibility of siblings' mental health being at risk. Therefore, screening for psychosocial deficits may be essential in preventing psychiatric disorders in this population, especially during pandemics.

"Telehealth outreach programming in the Pacific island of Guam: Providing access to dementia care support services during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to heightened levels of isolation and loneliness for millions of individuals and families worldwide, resulting in adverse health and mental health outcomes. Persons with dementia and their family caregivers are particularly vulnerable due to the deleterious impact of social isolation on both dementia symptoms and caregiver burden. One of the greatest challenges for dementia patients has been accessing dementia care services during COVID-19 lockdowns. In the Pacific island of Guam, the pandemic quickly led to the closure of senior centers, adult day care centers, family caregiver support programs, and other social services for older adults and their families in March 2020. As a result, persons with dementia suddenly found themselves isolated at home and dependent upon family members to provide round-the-clock care. This presentation will describe the development of an innovative telehealth outreach program that was launched in Guam in the summer of 2020, three months after the first COVID-19 case had appeared on the island. The program was designed to provide improved access to social support and specialized community services for persons with dementia and their family caregivers. There are four components: (1) virtual family caregiver support groups where participants can share the stresses and challenges of caring for a loved one with dementia with others who are going through similar experiences; (2) virtual presentation and consultation sessions led by dementia care specialists from the community providing easy access to dementia care information and services; (3) 24/7 family caregiver support networks through mobile messaging apps to mitigate social isolation and ensure the availability of support in times of crisis; and (4) telehealth family counseling for persons with dementia and their family members employing narrative approaches that embrace the oral storytelling traditions of Pacific island cultures. The community response has been strong with approximately 50-60 family caregivers and persons with dementia participating in the program monthly. Project outcomes suggest that telehealth outreach services represent an effective and sustainable approach to connecting persons living with dementia and their family caregivers to community resources during times of isolation.","Twaddle, Hattori-Uchima, Orallo, Gutierrez","https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.050134","20211231","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24550,""
"Effectiveness of home-based telerehabilitation in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease: A randomised controlled study","The COVID-19 pandemic has made it necessity that rehabilitation services are provided remotely to patients. These process required a transformation in healthcare. The aim of this study was investigate the effectiveness of the home-based online supervised exercise program in Alzheimer's disease (AD). To our knowledge, this is the first study to report the results of real-time supervised physical exercise telerehabilitation program in AD. Eighteen subjects with early-middle stage of AD were randomised into 2 group as telerehabilitation group (TG; mean age: 77.7 Ã‚Â± 5.29 years; 7 Female, 3 Male) and control group (CG; mean age: 78.5 Ã‚Â± 7.07 years; 5 Female, 3 Male). Our primary outcome was Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), seconder outcomes were Timed Up&amp;Go (TUG), One-leg Balance Test (OLBT), Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form (GDS). The 6-week motor-cognitive dual-task exercise training was performed online and under the supervision of physiotherapist through videoconference. No physical or cognitive intervention was applied to the control group for 6 weeks. Subjects were assessed before and after the treatment. In statistical analysis, the change in the outcome scores was calculated (Ã¢Ë†â€  = last measurement-first measurement), the difference between the groups was performed with the Mann Whitney-U Test in SPSS 22.0. Trial's protocol is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov under number NCT04606251. There was a significant difference between TG and CG in favor of TG in MMSE, TUG, FIM and GDS (p&lt;0,05); There was no significant difference between groups in OLBT (p&gt;0,05). Statistical results have been showed in Table 1. No safety problem was observed during the treatment. All subjects were completed the study, there was a high adherence to treatment.

"Latin American Older people and neuropsychiatric symptoms: a mini-systematic review of effects of COVID-19 Pandemic","Ending December 2019, the world had to face to COVID-19. Latin America and the Caribbean suffered the effects where the contiguous and the number of deaths has been significant. Studies indicate that older adults with some degree of cognitive impairment are at greater risk of worsening their cognitive status and mental health, for this reason it's exposed that social isolation and loneliness has harmful effects on the health of this population. This mini-review inquires on the effects of COVID-19 due to social isolation on neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in Latin American older adults with and without dementia. A search was carried out in PubMed, SCOPUS, and ScienceDirect identifying all articles published up to July 31, 2021 using the keywords ""social isolation"", ""lockdown"", ""quarantine"", ""COVID-19"",, ""neuropsychiatric symptoms "", ""neurobehavioral"", ""dementia"","" mild cognitive impairment "","" Older People "", ""aging"", ""elderly"". Two independent reviewers screened and selected appropriate articles and a third researcher helped resolve disagreements. The selected articles met the following criteria: written in English, Spanish or Portuguese, original article; focused on elderly subjects, articles that provided information on the NPS effects in Latin American populations during the COVID-19 pandemic. The review was based on the PRISMA Statement and used the SIGN criteria. From 61 articles recovered from electronic databases (PubMed, Science Direct and Scopus) 10 of them were chosen for this review. The majority of the articles reported in a general way a negative impact on the mental health of the population in Latin America. They referred to a significant increase in the anxiety and depression symptoms. The majority of the articles were studies developed in Brazil, Argentina and Chile. The COVID-19 has shown a negative impact on the mental health of older adults.

"Type and frequency of social contacts associated with low mood before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in older adults: I-CONECT project","Social isolation is a risk factor for dementia, but the underlying mechanism is not well understood. It is possible that lack of social contacts negatively affects emotional well-being, which leads to cognitive decline. To shed light on this potential mediation mechanism, we examined changes in type and frequency of social contacts and their effects on mood using data collected before and during the COVID-19 pandemic among socially isolated older adults aged 75 and older. The data come from an ongoing randomized controlled trial, the Internet-Based Conversational Engagement Clinical Trial (I-CONECT, ClinicalTirals.gov: NCT02871921). One hundred forty-six participants (age=81.0Ã‚Â±4.5, 71.9% women) who were in the trial both before and during the pandemic and whose data were available as of November of 2020 were included in the current analysis. Weekly health questionnaires administered on all participants regardless of treatment assignments were collected before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Low mood (""Blueness"") was self-reported as feeling downhearted or blue for three or more days in the past week (YES/NO). Social contacts were self-reported by amount of time they had interacted, with whom (family; friends; others), and via which modalities (in-person; phone/video call; text/email). A total of 4,774 weeks of survey data were analyzed (3,047 before COVID 19). The weekly average time spent in-person, on phone/video call, and via text/email were 282, 113, and 44 minutes, respectively. During the COVID-19 pandemic, participants on average spent 82 minutes less in total social contact per week (in-person: reduced 123 minutes, video/call: increased 28 minutes, text/email: increased 13 minutes per week). Generalized estimating equation model revealed that in-person family contact was associated with less blueness regardless of the pandemic (OR=0.91, p=0.04). There was a COVID*text/email time with friends interaction (OR=0.68, p=0.03), suggesting that during the COVID-19 pandemic, an increase of 1 hour of texting/emailing with friends per week was associated with 32% decrease in experiencing blueness three or more days per week. In-person family time is beneficial for mental health. While in-person contacts become less frequent during the COVID-19 pandemic, increased text/email time with friends becomes an alternative to maintain mental health for socially isolated older adults.","Wu, Mattek, Fleming, Scavone, Wild, Kaye, Dodge","https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.052385","20211231","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24553,""

"COVID-19-related adaptations to the implementation and evaluation of a clinic-based intervention designed to improve opioid safety","The United States faces an opioid crisis with an unprecedented and increasing death rate from opioid overdose. Successfully reducing the rates of opioid use disorder (OUD) and overdose will require the engagement of frontline clinicians to prescribe opioids more safely and to build their capacity to treat patients with OUD using evidence-based approaches. The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant challenges for patients, clinicians and health systems and has been associated with increasing risks of overdoses and deaths. Herein, we review a multidisciplinary project designed to implement and evaluate clinic-based interventions in Oregon, USA, to improve pain management, opioid prescribing and treatment of OUD. The intervention, called Improving PaIn aNd OPiOId MaNagemenT in Primary Care (PINPOINT), combines practice facilitation, academic detailing and education through the Oregon ECHO Network. Implementation of PINPOINT has occurred across the Oregon Rural Practice-based Research Network and has involved 49 clinic sites to date. To evaluate the impact of the intervention, the research team created the Provider Results of Opioid Management and Prescribing Training (PROMPT), a dataset that links information from the state prescription drug monitoring program, all-payer claims database, emergency medical services, vital records and substance use disorder treatment system. The PROMPT dataset will allow evaluation of the impact of the intervention at both the clinician and clinic levels. Due to the constraints of the COVID-19 pandemic, elements of both implementation and evaluation required significant adaptations to continue to meet the original project goals.","Morgan, Hendricks, El Ibrahimi, Hallvik, Hatch, Dickinson, Wright, Fischer","https://doi.org/10.7573/dic.2021-7-5","20220101","academic detailing; all-payer claims database; opioid safety; practice facilitation; prescription drug monitoring programs","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24555,""
"A Systematic Review of Telemedicine for Older Adults With Dementia During COVID-19: An Alternative to In-person Health Services?","<b>Introduction:</b> Older adults with dementia have been significantly at more risk for not receiving the care needed and for developing further mental health problems during COVID-19. Although the rise in telemedicine adoption in the healthcare system has made it possible for patients to connect with their healthcare providers virtually, little is known about its use and effects among older adults with dementia and their mental health. <b>Objective:</b> This systematic review aimed to explore the use, accessibility, and feasibility of telemedicine in older adults with dementia, as well as examine the potential mental health impacts of these technologies, through reviewing evidence from studies conducted during COVID-19. <b>Methods:</b> PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched with the following keywords: (COVID<sup>*</sup> OR SARS-CoV-2 OR Coronavirus) AND (""mental health"" OR Depression OR Stress) AND (Dementia OR Multi-Infarct Dementia OR Vascular Dementia OR Frontotemporal Dementia) AND (elder OR Aging OR Aging OR Aged) AND (Telemedicine OR ""Remote Consultation"" OR telehealth OR technology). <b>Results:</b> A total of 7 articles from Asia, Europe, and the United States were included in this review. Throughout the studies cognitive and mental health assessments (e.g., MoCA, FAST, etc.) were performed. Despite the barriers, telemedicine was noted as a feasible approach to assist individuals with dementia in connecting with their service providers and family while reducing complications related to travel (e.g., difficulty moving, traffic, distance). <b>Conclusions:</b> Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, finding alternative ways to provide services to older adults with dementia through technology may continue to become more necessary as time goes on.","Elbaz, Cinalioglu, Sekhon, Gruber, Rigas, Bodenstein, Naghi, Lavin, Greenway, Vahia, Rej, Sekhon","https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.761965","20220101","COVID-19; dementia; mental health; older adults; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24556,""

The aims of this study were: (a) to analyze treatment dropout rates in patients with GD throughout two periods: during and after the lockdown and (b) to assess clinical features that could represent vulnerability factors for treatment dropout. <b>Methods:</b> The sample consisted of <i>n</i>=86 adults, mostly men (<i>n</i>=79, 91.9%) and with a mean age of 45years old (<i>SD</i>=16.85). Patients were diagnosed with GD according to DSM-5 criteria and were undergoing therapy at a Behavioral Addiction Unit when confinement started. Clinical data were collected through a semi-structured interview and protocolized psychometric assessment. A brief telephone survey related to COVID-19 concerns was also administered at the beginning of the lockdown. Dropout data were evaluated at two moments throughout a nine-month observational period (T1: during the lockdown, and T2: after the lockdown). <b>Results:</b> The risk of dropout during the complete observational period was <i>R</i>=32/86=0.372 (37.2%), the Incidence Density Rate (<i>IDR</i>) ratio T2/T1 being equal to 0.052/0.033=1.60 (<i>p</i>=0.252). Shorter treatment duration (<i>p</i>=0.007), lower anxiety (<i>p</i>=0.025), depressive symptoms (<i>p</i>=0.045) and lower use of adaptive coping strategies (<i>p</i>=0.046) characterized patients who abandoned treatment during the lockdown. Briefer duration of treatment (<i>p</i>=0.001) and higher employment concerns (<i>p</i>=0.044) were highlighted in the individuals who dropped out after the lockdown. Treatment duration was a predictor of dropout in both periods (<i>p</i>=0.005 and <i>p</i>&lt;0.001, respectively). <b>Conclusion:</b> The present results suggest an impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on treatment dropout among patients with GD during and after the lockdown, being treatment duration a predictor of dropout. Assessing vulnerability features in GD may help clinicians identify high-risk individuals and enhance prevention and treatment approaches in future similar situations.","Baenas, Etxandi, Codina, Granero, FernÃƒÂ¡ndez-Aranda, GÃƒÂ³mez-PeÃƒÂ±a, Moragas, Rivas, Potenza, HÃƒÂ¥kansson, Del Pino-GutiÃƒÂ©rrez, Mora-Maltas, Valenciano-Mendoza, MenchÃƒÂ³n, JimÃƒÂ©nez-Murcia","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.761802","20220101","COVID-19; confinement; coping; dropout; gambling disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24557,""
"Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Healthcare Professionals in Tunisia: Risk and Protective Factors","<b>Background:</b> Our study aimed to evaluate the magnitude of different psychological outcomes among Tunisian healthcare professionals (HCPs) during the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and to identify the associated factors. <b>Methods:</b> Healthcare professionals completed a cross-sectional questionnaire during a 3-week period in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Tunisia. The survey collected demographic information, factors that may interfere with the psychological outcomes, behavioral changes, and mental health measures. Mental health was assessed using three scales: the Seven-Item Insomnia Severity Index, the Two-Item Patient Health Questionnaire, and the Two-Item Generalized Anxiety Disorder instrument. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to identify factors associated with psychological outcomes. <b>Results:</b> A total of 503 HCPs successfully completed the survey, and 493 agreed to enroll in the study: 411 (83.4%) physicians, 323 (64.2%) women, and 271 (55%) with a second-line work position. A significant proportion of HCPs had anxiety (35.7%), depression (35.1%), and insomnia (23.7%). Women, those with a psychiatric history, and those using public transportation had higher proportions for overall symptoms compared with other groups, for example, depression in 44.9% of female participants vs. 18.2% of male participants (<i>p</i> = 0.00). Those with a previous medical history and nurses had more anxiety and insomnia compared with other groups, for example, anxiety in 45.1% of nurses, 36.1% of interns/residents, and 27.5% of attending physicians (<i>p</i> = 0.04). Multivariable logistic regression showed that female gender was a risk factor for all psychological outcomes, whereas psychiatric history was a risk factor for both anxiety and insomnia [odds ratio (OR) = 2.86, 95% CI 1.78-4.60, <i>p</i> = 0.00 for insomnia]. Using protective equipment was associated with a lower risk for depression (OR = 0.41, 95% CI 0.27-0.62, <i>p</i> = 0.00) and anxiety. Physical activity was also protective against depression and anxiety (OR = 0.41, 95% CI 0.25-0.67, <i>p</i> = 0.00). <b>Conclusion:</b> Psychological symptoms are usually overlooked or dismissed by HCPs, although the COVID-19 pandemic played a major role in exacerbating this burden. Prompt psychological support should be endorsed and simple measures, such as physical activity and ensuring the availability of personal protective equipment, are paramount to improve mental health outcomes and the quality of care provided to patients.","Hammami, Jellazi, Mahjoub, Fedhila, Ouali","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.754047","20220101","COVID-19 pandemic; healthcare professionals; mental health; protective factors; psychological symptoms; risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24558,""
"Public Emotional and Coping Responses to the COVID-19 Infodemic: A Review and Recommendations","Since its onset in early 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has adversely affected not only the physical but also the mental health of people worldwide. Healthcare professionals and laypersons have sought to learn more about this novel and highly transmissible disease to better understand its etiology, treatment, and prevention. However, information overload and misinformation related to COVID-19 have elicited considerable public anxiety and created additional health threats. Collectively, these problems have been recognized by the World Health Organization as an ""infodemic."" This review provides an overview of the global challenges posed by the COVID-19 infodemic, and used the psychological entropy model as a guiding framework to explicate the potential causes of the infodemic and identify potential solutions to mitigate impacts on public health. We first examine the role of anxiety in information processing and then delineate the adverse impacts of the infodemic. Finally, we propose strategies to combat the infodemic at the public, community, and individual levels.","Ying, Cheng","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.755938","20220101","anxiety; coronavirus; eHealth; fake news; false information; health literacy; misinformation; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24559,""
"Impact of the Texas-Wide Premedical Mentoring Program during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the usual processes and support systems related to applying to medical school in the United States. The Texas-Wide Premedical Mentoring Program (TPMP) was established to pair medical student mentors in Texas with medical school applicants attending Texas colleges and universities. Our objective was to demonstrate the effect of the TPMP on application preparedness and self-reported mental health outcomes of program participants. A survey was developed to understand the program's impact on both mentees and mentors. Participants were sent a survey link 3 months after the TPMP launch. In total, 313 participants, comprising 62% premedical student mentees and 38% medical student mentors, completed the survey. Mentees reported a significantly positive effect of the program on anxiety, uncertainty of acceptance, connection to medicine, and making the road to medical school seem less impossible. After participation, mentees felt less alone and reported a positive impact on their perception of the application process. The TPMP positively impacted the mental wellness of both mentees and mentors, and about 80% of mentors felt more fulfilled despite not participating in clinical duties in light of suspensions. In conclusion, program participation was associated with decreasing application knowledge gaps, easing anxiety, and providing alliance for mentees. The TPMP had a similarly positive influence on the mental wellness of mentees and mentors as well as contributed to medical student mentors' sense of fulfillment.","Alexander, Sheu, Villagran, Guerrini, Storch","https://doi.org/10.1080/08998280.2021.1980357","20220101","Applications; coronavirus; mental health; mentorship; students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24560,""
"COVID-19 experiences predicting high anxiety and depression among a sample of BRCA1/BRCA2-positive women in the US","During the COVID-19 pandemic, breast and ovarian cancer survivors experienced more anxiety and depression than before the pandemic. Studies have not investigated the similarities of this trend among BRCA1/2-positive women who are considered high risk for these cancers. The current study examines the impact of COVID-19 experiences on anxiety and depression in a sample of BRCA1/2-positive women in the U.S. 211 BRCA1/2-positive women from medically underserved backgrounds completed an online survey. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using multivariable logistic regression for associations between COVID-19 experiences and self-reported anxiety and depression stratified by demographic factors. Overall, women who reported COVID-19 stigma or discrimination (aOR, 5.14, 95% CI [1.55, 17.0]) experienced significantly more depressive symptoms than women who did not report this experience. Racial/ethnic minority women caring for someone at home during COVID-19 were 3.70 times more likely (95% CI [1.01, 13.5]) to report high anxiety while non-Hispanic white women were less likely (aOR, 0.34, 95% CI [0.09, 1.30], p interactionÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.011). To date, this is the first study to analyze anxiety and depression considering several COVID-19 predictors among BRCA1/2-positive women.

"COVID-19 distress, negative parenting, and child behavioral problems: The moderating role of parent adverse childhood experiences","Heightened familial stress and distress during the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to increased negative parenting practices, particularly for parents with substantial adverse childhood experiences (ACES). To determine whether families' COVID-19-related distress is associated with young children's emotional/behavioral functioning via negative parenting, and whether these relationships vary based on parents' ACEs. Participants were 267 parents of children ages 1.5-5Ã‚Â years recruited from five primary care sites across the United States. Participants completed internet questionnaires including measures of demographics, parent ACES, negative parenting, parent mental health, and COVID-19 distress. We used regression analyses to test a moderated mediation model in which the relationship between COVID-19 distress and child emotional/behavioral problems is mediated by negative parenting, and both the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 distress on child emotional/behavioral problems is moderated by parents' ACEs. Negative parenting significantly mediated the relationship between COVID-19 distress and child emotional/behavioral problems (indirect effect ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.07). Parents' ACEs moderated the associations between COVID-19 distress and both negative parenting and child emotional/behavioral problems, such that each relationship was stronger in the context of higher parental ACEs. The model accounted for 42% of the variance in child emotional/behavioral problems. Findings have implications for managing risk and promoting well-being in young children during periods of significant stress and routine disruption. This study advances understanding of factors influencing negative outcomes in children during the pandemic's acute phase and may have implications for the development of targeted interventions to improve families' adjustment in the future.","Hails, Petts, Hostutler, Simoni, Greene, Snider, Riley","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2021.105450","20211231","Adverse childhood experiences; COVID-19; Child emotional and behavioral problems; Family stress; Parenting","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24562,""
"Smoking Behavior Changes during COVID-19 among Korean Adults","In this study, we investigated the changes in smoking behavior during the COVID-19 outbreak in Korea in 2020. We also examined the influence of general characteristics and mental health problems due to COVID-19 on changes in smoking behavior. We collected data from August to October 2020 from adults aged 19 years and older from the Korea Community Health Survey (N=229,269). Among current smokers (N=39,534), 11.0% reported an increase in smoking, and 12.8% reported a decrease in smoking. Overall, 33.3% reported perceived stress and 3.7% reported depression. Participants reported COVID-related anxiety about infecting family (83.0%), economic damage (76.3%), blame or harm from others (66.5%), infection (60.6%), and death (31.3%). Lower education level, living alone, and poor subjective health status were associated with increased smoking. Being a woman and being of older age were associated with decreased smoking. Stress, depression, and anxiety about economic damage due to COVID-19 were more likely to result in increased smoking. Anxiety related to death due to COVID-19 was more likely to result in decreased smoking. These findings provide insight into the changes in smoking behavior caused by COVID-19.","Han, Kim","https://doi.org/10.5993/AJHB.45.6.7","20211231","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24563,""
"State containment measures, living arrangements, and mental health of US older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic","Early in the coronavirus pandemic, U.S. states implemented several different types of containment measures to slow the disease's spread. Early evidence indicates containment measures were associated with changes in individuals' mental health. This study explores the associations between U.S. state containment measures and older adults' mental health and importantly, whether the associations vary by living arrangement and gender. The study analyzed national sample of adults aged 50 or older from 12 waves (April-July 2020) of the U.S. Household Pulse Survey (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°394,934). State fixed-effects models linked four state containment measures (stay-at-home order, restaurant closure, bar closure, and movie theater closure) to levels of depression and anxiety across different types of living arrangements, net of controls. Men and women were analyzed separately. Stay-at-home order and restaurant and bar closure, but not movie theater closure, were associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety in older adults. Living arrangements moderated the associations for women but not men. For women, compared to living alone, living with a spouse or intergenerational family was associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression during stay-at-home order and restaurant closure. The associations between containment measures and mental health vary by type of living arrangement and were gendered, likely because household situations create different demands and supports that men and woman experience differently. Although containment measures are necessary to protect public health, paying attention to these underlying dynamics can inform policymakers' efforts to implement policies that balance harms and benefits for older adults.","Chen","https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2021.2021142","20211231","Business closure; U.S. state policy; gender differences; psychological well-being; stay-at-home order","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24564,""
"Transition to telemedicine and its impact on missed appointments in community-based clinics","The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act led to the rapid implementation of telemedicine across health care office settings. Whether this transition to telemedicine has any impact on missed appointments is yet to be determined. This study examined the relationship between telemedicine usage and missed appointments during the COVID-19 pandemic. This retrospective study used appointment-level data from 55 Federally Qualified Health Centre clinics in Texas between March and November 2020. To account for the nested data structure of repeated appointments within each patient, a mixed-effects multivariable logistic regression model was used to examine associations between telemedicine use and missed appointments, adjusting for patient sociodemographic characteristics, geographic classification, past medical history, and clinic characteristics. The independent variable was having a telemedicine appointment, defined as an audiovisual consultation started and finalized via a telemedicine platform. The outcome of interest was having a missed appointment (yes/no) after a scheduled and confirmed medical appointment. Results from this initial model were stratified by appointment type (in-person vs. telemedicine). The analytic sample included 278,171 appointments for 85,413 unique patients. The overall missed appointment rate was 18%, and 25% of all appointments were telemedicine appointments. Compared to in-person visits, telemedicine visits were less likely to result in a missed appointment (OR = 0.87, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). Compared to Whites, Asians were less likely to have a missed appointment (OR = 0.82, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) while African Americans, Hispanics, and American Indians were all significantly more likely to have missed appointments (OR = 1.61, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001; OR = 1.19, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01; OR = 1.22, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01, respectively). Those accessing mental health services (OR = 1.57 for in-person and 0.78 for telemedicine) and living in metropolitan areas (OR = 1.15 for in-person and 0.82 for telemedicine) were more likely to miss in-person appointments but less likely to miss telemedicine appointments. Patients with frequent medical visits or those living with chronic diseases were more likely to miss in-person appointments but less likely to miss telemedicine appointments. Telemedicine is strongly associated with fewer missed appointments. Although our findings suggest a residual lag in minority populations, specific patient populations, including those with frequent prior visits or chronic conditions, those seeking mental health services, and those living in metropolitan areas were less likely to miss telemedicine appointments than in-person visits. These findings highlight how telemedicine can enable effective and accessible care by reducing missed healthcare appointments.KEY MESSAGESTelemedicine was associated with 13% lower odds of missed appointments.Patients with frequent medical visits or those living with chronic diseases were less likely to miss telemedicine appointments but more likely to miss in-person appointments.Patients seeking mental health services were less likely to miss telemedicine appointments but more likely to miss in-person appointments.Similarly, those living in metropolitan areas were less likely to miss telemedicine appointments but more likely to miss in-person appointments.","Adepoju, Chae, Liaw, Angelocci, Millard, Matuk-Villazon","https://doi.org/10.1080/07853890.2021.2019826","20211231","COVID-19; access to health care; federally qualified health centres; missed appointments; patient no-shows; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24565,""
"Changes in the body mass of adult residents of rural and urban areas in the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic vs their mental, physical and sexual health","A change in the body mass may be one of the health consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, and may affect the health condition measured in many dimensions. The paper aims at assessment of the level and determinants of the body mass changes and stress level in the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the interrelation of these two factors. Data were collected in June 2020, as a cross-sectional on-line survey. The representative sample of 2,535 Poles aged 18-65 was analysed. The main outcome is the Cohen's stress index PSS-4. Among thirteen independent variables, five were related to the change observed during the pandemic (including the body mass change and satisfaction with sexual life). Increase of the body mass within the period of the pandemic was declared by 33.9% of the respondents, including 36.1% in urban and 30.9% in rural areas (p=0.026). The average increase of body mass was 5.11 kg. The increase of body mass was related to the existing overweight and obesity, occurrence of chronic diseases, episodes of physical and mental crisis, and decrease of interest in sexual activity. The average index of stress in the initial months of the pandemic was 6.38Ã‚Â±2.94. Multivariate regression analysis showed eight independent predictors of stress in the whole group, seven in towns and five in rural areas. The significance of the relationship with the body mass increase was proved only among residents of rural areas. The initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic were reflected, to a different extent, among residents of urban and rural areas. Body mass change and sexual health indicators remained significant predictors of stress level, even after analyses were corrected for other covariates.","BiaÃ…â€šorudzki, Izdebski","https://doi.org/10.26444/aaem/143561","20220103","COVID-19; body mass change; mental health; place of residence; sexual health; social conditions; stress; Adult; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Pandemics; Rural Population; SARS-CoV-2; Sexual Health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-04","",24566,""
