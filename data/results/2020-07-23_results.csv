"Educating Heads, Hands, and Hearts in the COVID-19 Classroom","As campuses across the country and around the world are shut down in response to COVID-19, professors contributed to the monumental task of shifting the vast majority of course content to online delivery  Transitioning students from face-to-face to online instruction-often after returning to their family homes-represents a twofold traumatic event  First, our students are dealing with culture shock-the feeling of disorientation experienced when someone is suddenly subjected to an unfamiliar culture, way or life, or set of attitudes  Second, our students are dealing with grief, including the five stages of denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance  Online is not face to face  And,socially isolated at a family home is not ''college life ''  It is important that professors recognize these facts and adapt our teaching accordingly","Oerther, Daniel B.; Peters, Catherine A.","https://doi.org/10.1089/ees.2020.0161","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Environmental Engineering Science;37(5):303, 2020.; Publication details: Environmental Engineering Science;37(5):303, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-23","",3307,""

"HIV and SARS-CoV-2: Intersecting Epidemics with Many Unknowns","As of July 2020, approximately 6 months into the pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), whether people living with HIV (PLWH) are disproportionately affected remains an unanswered question  Thus far, risk of COVID-19 in people with and without HIV appears similar but data are sometimes contradictory  Some uncertainty is due to the recency of the emergence of COVID-19 and sparsity of data;some is due to imprecision about what it means for HIV to be a ""risk factor"" for COVID-19  Forthcoming studies on the risk of COVID-19 to PLWH should differentiate between 1) the unadjusted, excess burden of disease among PLWH to inform surveillance efforts;and 2) any excess risk of COVID-19 among PLWH due to biological effects of HIV, independent of comorbidities that confound rather than mediate this effect  PLWH bear a disproportionate burden of alcohol, other drug use, mental health disorders, and other structural vulnerabilities, which may increase their risk of COVID-19  In addition to any direct effects of COVID-19 on the health of PLWH, we need to understand how physical distancing restrictions impact secondary health outcomes, and the need for, accessibility of, and impact of alternative modalities of providing ongoing medical, mental health, and substance use treatment that comply with physical distancing restrictions (e g , telemedicine)","Lesko, C.

"Burnout and its influencing factors between frontline nurses and nurses from other wards during the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease -COVID-19- in Iran","Objective. To assess burnout level during an outbreak of COVID-19 and to identify influencing factors between frontline nurses and nurses from other wards. Methods. This cross-sectional study makes comparison between two groups of nurses including frontline (exposure group) and other nurses working in usual wards (non-exposure group) in Torbat Heydariyeh city, Iran. Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI), Job stress questionnaire (JSQ), and questionnaires of hospital resources, family support, and measuring the fear of COVID-19 were used as research instruments. Results. The scores of job stress and burnout in the exposure group with COVID-19 infection were significantly higher than in the non-exposure group (p=0.006 and p=0.002, respectively). Although, in univariate linear regression, employment status (p=0.047), experience in taking care of patient confirmed or suspected with COVID-19 infection (p=0.006), hospital resources (p=0.047), and job stress (p<0.001) were considered as significant risk factors for COVID-19-related burnout. In multivariate regression analysis, job stress (p=0.031, ÃŸ=0.308) was considered as an only factor that has a significant relationship with COVID-19-related burnout. Conclusion. The burnout level in frontline nurses was higher than other nurses, the most important influencing factor was the job stress. Regarding to negative effects of burnout on both physical and mental health nurses, it is suggested that a strong strategy be considered to reduce nurses' burnout to be able to control ongoing and future outbreaks successfully.; Objetivo.

"The impact of COVID-19 on the cancer care of adolescents and young adults and their well-being: Results from an online survey conducted in the early stages of the pandemic","Because of the global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), oncology departments across the world have rapidly adapted their cancer care protocols to balance the risk of delaying cancer treatments and the risk of COVID-19 exposure. COVID-19 and associated changes may have an impact on the psychosocial functioning of patients with cancer and survivors. This study was designed to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on young people living with and beyond cancer. In this cross-sectional study, 177 individuals, aged 18 to 39 years, were surveyed about the impact of COVID-19 on their cancer care and psychological well-being. Participants also reported their information needs with respect to COVID-19. Responses were summarized with a content analysis approach. This was the first study to examine the psychological functioning of young patients and survivors during the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. A third of the respondents reported increased levels of psychological distress, and as many as 60% reported feeling more anxious than they did before COVID-19. More than half also wanted more information tailored to them as young patients with cancer. The COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly evolving and changing the landscape of cancer care. Young people living with cancer are a unique population and might be more vulnerable during this time in comparison with their healthy peers. There is a need to screen for psychological distress and attend to young people whose cancer care has been delayed. As the lockdown begins to ease, the guidelines about cancer care should be updated according to this population's needs.","KoÃ…Â¡ir, Loades, Wild, Wiedemann, Krajnc, RoÃ…Â¡kar, Bowes","https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.33098","20200722","adolescent cancer; anxiety; coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); depression; information needs; survey; young adult cancer","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-23","",3322,""
"Medication treatment for opioid use disorder and community pharmacy: Expanding care during a national epidemic and global pandemic","Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), such as methadone and buprenorphine, are effective strategies for treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) and reducing overdose risk. MOUD treatment rates continue to be low across the US, and currently, some evidence suggests access to evidence-based treatment is becoming increasingly difficult for those with OUD as a result of the 2019 novel corona virus (COVID-19). A major underutilized source to address these serious challenges in the US is community pharmacy given the specialized training of pharmacists, high levels of consumer trust, and general availability for accessing these service settings. Canadian, Australian, and European pharmacists have made important contributions to the treatment and care of those with OUD over the past decades. Unfortunately, US pharmacists are not permitted to prescribe MOUD and are only currently allowed to dispense methadone for the treatment of pain, not OUD. US policymakers, regulators, and practitioners must work to facilitate this advancement of community pharmacy-based through research, education, practice, and industry. Advancing community pharmacy-based MOUD for leading clinical management of OUD and dispensation of treatment medications will afford the US a critical innovation for addressing the opioid epidemic, fallout from COVID-19, and getting individuals the care they need.","Cochran, Bruneau, Cox, Gordon","https://doi.org/10.1080/08897077.2020.1787300","20200723","COVID-19; Community pharmacy; Medication for opioid use disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-23","",3323,""

"What Does Adolescent Substance Use Look Like During the COVID-19 Pandemic? Examining Changes in Frequency, Social Contexts, and Pandemic-Related Predictors","The overarching goal of this study was to provide key information on how adolescents' substance use has changed since the corona virus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic, in addition to key contexts and correlates of substance use during social distancing. Canadian adolescents (nÃ‚Â = 1,054, M<sub>age</sub>Ã‚Â = 16.68, standard deviationÃ‚Â = .78) completed an online survey, in which they reported on their frequency of alcohol use, binge drinking, cannabis use, and vaping in the 3Ã‚Â weeks before and directly after social distancing practices had taken effect. For most substances, the percentage of users decreased; however, the frequency of both alcohol and cannabis use increased. Although the greatest percentage of adolescents was engaging in solitary substance use (49.3%), many were still using substances with peers via technology (31.6%) and, shockingly, even face to face (23.6%). Concerns for how social distancing would affect peer reputation was a significant predictor of face-to-face substance use with friends among adolescents with low self-reported popularity, and a significant predictor of solitary substance use among average and high popularity teens. Finally, adjustment predictors, including depression and fear of the infectivity of COVID-19, predicted using solitary substance use during the pandemic. Our results provide preliminary evidence that adolescent substance use, including that which occurs face to face with peers, thereby putting adolescents at risk for contracting COVID-19, may be of particular concern during the pandemic. Further, solitary adolescent substance use during the pandemic, which is associated with poorer mental health and coping, may also be a notable concern worthy of further investigation.","Dumas, Ellis, Litt","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.06.018","20200722","Adolescent; Alcohol; COVID-19; Cannabis; Substance use; Vaping","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-23","",3325,""
"High depression and anxiety in people with Alzheimer's disease living in retirement homes during the covid-19 crisis","To cope with Covid-19 and limits its spread among residents, retirement homes have prohibited physical contact between residents and families and friend and, in some cases, even between residents or between residents and caregivers. We investigated the effects of measures against Covid-19 on the mental health of participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) who live in retirement homes in France. We instructed on-site caregivers to assess depression and anxiety in participants with mild AD who live in retirement homes. Fifty-eight participants consented to participate in the study. The participants rated their depression and anxiety during and before the Covid-19 crisis. Participants reported higher depression (pÂ =Â .005) and anxiety (pÂ =Â .004) during than before the Covid-19 crisis. These increases can be attributed to the isolation of the residents and/or to the drastic changes in their daily life and care they receive. While, in their effort to prevent infections, retirement homes are forced to physically separate residents from the outside world and to drastically reduce residentsâ€™ activities, these decisions are likely to come at a cost to residents with AD and their mental health.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113294","20200901","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-23","",3326,""

During the peak of a local outbreak in Hong Kong in Spring 2020, 761 participants completed questionnaires on self-compassion, perceived threats, as well as perceived benefits and psychological distress. Controlling for demographic variables, negative indicators of self-compassion (aka self-coldness) was found to intensify the impacts of threats on psychological distress. The positive indicators of self-compassion also moderated the link between threats and perceived benefits, such that perceived benefits tend to be less related to threats in participants with higher self-compassion. Our findings highlight the impacts of both positive and negative indicators of self-compassion on the adjustment to such unprecedented challenges, and point to the possibility of enhancing peopleâ€™s resilience through fostering self-compassion and alleviating self-coldness.","Bobo Hi Po Lau et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4624E-7BA-829","20200723","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; mental health; self-coldness; self-compassion; depression; covid-19; anxiety; hong kong","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-23","",3327,""
