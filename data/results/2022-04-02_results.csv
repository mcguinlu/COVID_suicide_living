"Internet and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from the UK","With the COVID-19 pandemic, the Internet has become a key player in the daily lives of most people. We investigate the relationship between mental health and internet use frequency and purpose six months after the first lockdown in the UK, September 2020. Using data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study on the 12-item General Health Questionnaire and the Internet use module, and controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and personality traits, we find that older individuals (aged 59 or above) have a lower internet use frequency (twice a day or less). Younger women use the Internet for social purposes more than men do, while younger men use the Internet for leisure-and-learning purposes more than women and older men do. Both high frequency internet use and use for social purposes appear to be a protective factor for social dysfunction. Interestingly, high internet use is a protective factor for social dysfunction among younger women, but a risk factor for psychological distress among younger men. Finally, while leisure-and-learning purpose is a protective factor for social dysfunction among younger women, it is a risk factor for social dysfunction among younger men.","Climent Quintana-Domeque; Jingya Zeng; Xiaohui Zhang","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.04.01.22273299","20220401","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29324,""
"Long-term psychological consequences of long Covid: a propensity score matching analysis comparing trajectories of depression and anxiety symptoms before and after contracting long Covid vs short Covid","Background: There is a growing global awareness of the psychological consequences of long Covid, supported by emerging empirical evidence. However, the mergence and long-term trajectories of psychological symptoms following the infection are still unclear. Aims: To examine when psychological symptoms first emerge following the infection with SARS-CoV-2, and the long-term trajectories of psychological symptoms comparing long and short Covid groups. Methods: We analysed longitudinal data from the UCL Covid-19 Social Study (March 2020-November 2021). We included data from adults living in England who reported contracting SARS-CoV-2 by November 2021 (N=3,115). Of these, 15.9% reported having had long Covid (N=495). They were matched to participants who had short Covid using propensity score matching on a variety of demographic, socioeconomic and health covariates (N=962, n=13,325) and data were further analysed using growth curve modelling. Results: Depressive and anxiety symptoms increased immediately following the onset of infection in both long and short Covid groups. But the long Covid group had substantially greater initial increases in depressive symptoms and heightened levels over 22 months follow-up. Initial increases in anxiety were not significantly different between groups, but only the short Covid group experienced an improvement in anxiety over follow-up, leading to widening differences between groups. Conclusions: The findings shed light on the psychobiological pathways involved in the development of psychological symptoms relating to long Covid. The results highlight the need for monitoring of mental health and provision of adequate support to be interwoven with diagnosis and treatment of the physical consequences of long Covid.","Daisy Fancourt; Andrew Steptoe; Feifei Bu","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.04.01.22273305","20220401","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29325,""
"Characterizing discourses about COVID-19 vaccines on Twitter: a topic modeling and sentiment analysis approach","Background Methods Results Conclusions Evidence-based health communication is crucial for facilitating vaccine-related knowledge and addressing vaccine hesitancy. To that end, it is important to understand the discourses about COVID-19 vaccination and attend to the publicsâ€™ emotions underlying those discourses.We collect tweets related to COVID-19 vaccines from March 2020 to March 2021. In total, 304,292 tweets from 134,015 users are collected. We conduct a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) modeling analysis and a sentiment analysis to analyze the discourse themes and sentiments.This study identifies seven themes of COVID-19 vaccine-related discourses. Vaccine advocacy (24.82%) is the most widely discussed topic about COVID-19 vaccines, followed by vaccine hesitancy (22.29%), vaccine rollout (12.99%), vaccine facts (12.61%), recognition for healthcare workers (12.47%), vaccine side effects (10.07%), and vaccine policies (4.75%). Trust is the most salient emotion associated with COVID-19 vaccine discourses, followed by anticipation, fear, joy, sadness, anger, surprise, and disgust. Among the seven topics, vaccine advocacy tweets are most likely to receive likes and comments, and vaccine fact tweets are most likely to receive retweets.When talking about vaccines, publicsâ€™ emotions are dominated by trust and anticipation, yet mixed with fear and sadness. Although tweets about vaccine hesitancy are prevalent on Twitter, those messages receive fewer likes and comments than vaccine advocacy messages. Over time, tweets about vaccine advocacy and vaccine facts become more dominant whereas tweets about vaccine hesitancy become less dominant among COVID-19 vaccine discourses, suggesting that publics become more confident about COVID-19 vaccines as they obtain more information.

"Distance learning challenges and prospects during Covid-19 in the context of adolescent education","The purpose of the study is to identify the challenges and prospects of distance education for adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic. The main research method was the survey. Teenagers, parents and teachers were interviewed (330 people). One of the leaders of the study was a representative of the Technical Institute of NEFU in Neryungri. The results of the study made it possible to identify and analyze the main inconveniences of distance learning that young people suffered from. The following difficulties were identified: different teaching approaches (48.2%), lack of technical devices (7.6%), an increase in the number of homework assignments (86%).

"Finding a way through the fog: school staff experiences of the Covid-19 pandemic","This exploratory study reports on interviews carried out with 19 staff in UK schools during the early phase of the global Covid-19 pandemic. The focus of this qualitative study was to consider the impact of the pandemic on participantsâ€™ mental health and wellbeing, and to identify buffering mechanisms which may have mitigated against adverse effects. Participants were employed in a range of role types (including leaders, teachers and teaching assistants) in different educational settings (primary, secondary and alternative provision), and in different regions of the United Kingdom. A process of thematic analysis identified five key themes from the data set: change and adaptation;loss;impact on wellbeing;risk and protective factors;and opportunities to reflect. Data indicate that staff resilience during this time can be understood as emerging from a nuanced and complex interaction of internal and external factors, and thus conceptualised within a socio-ecological framework.

"Religious/Spiritual Struggles and Suicidal Ideation in the COVID-19 Era: Does the Belief in Divine Control and Religious Attendance Matter?","As a result of the upheaval to all facets of social life, the potential for higher suicide rates in the aftermath of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is of great concern. Using nationally representative data from the U.S., we assess whether religious/spiritual struggles are associated with a higher risk of suicidal ideation. We also focus on two aspects of religiosity that may modify the relationship between R/S struggles and suicidal ideation: beliefs in divine control and religious attendance. Results from regression analyses suggest that greater R/S struggles were associated with higher suicidal ideation, adjusting for psychological distress, economic hardship due to the pandemic, and several key demographic characteristics. Perceptions of divine control, but not religious attendance, were protective against higher suicidal ideation for people experiencing R/S struggles. While the longer term effects to well-being of the COVID-19 pandemic are only beginning to emerge, this study suggests that there are already significant and meaningful associations between greater R/S struggles and suicidal ideation. Given the protective role of beliefs in divine control for individuals in the throes of R/S struggles, it may be profitable to incorporate theistically based approaches to counseling and mental health care for religious believers who express uncertainty or doubt about their faith.","Upenieks, L.","https://doi.org/10.1037/rel0000467","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychology of Religion and Spirituality;: 14, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29329,""
"Gravitating Toward the Arts During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on our lives with individuals experiencing a wide range of emotions. While much attention has been placed on promoting physical health to control the coronavirus, far less attention has been placed on promoting mental health and well-being. There are well-known reports of individuals gravitating toward the arts during times of extreme stress: art is made in prisons;novels are written secretly in police states. In this study we examined whether individuals turned to the arts to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, how everyday artistic activities helped them regulate their emotions, and whether certain personality traits predicted the use of these strategies. We administered a survey to 486 participants (M-age = 35.7;SDage = 12.3;Range(age) = 18 to 79), asking them about the frequency of artistic activities they engaged in, the artistic activity they felt was the most helpful for coping with the pandemic, and how they used that activity to regulate their emotions. Four findings emerged: (a) participants reported engaging in artistic activities more often during than before the pandemic;(b) listening to music was the most helpful activity, followed by reading, and then the visual arts;(c) artistic activities regulated emotions most commonly by providing a means of escape;and (d) the personality trait of openness to experience predicted use of the approach and self-development emotion regulation strategies. These findings demonstrate that we gravitated toward the arts during the COVID-19 pandemic and that we did so because these activities provided a form of escape.","Drake, J.

"Examining cliniciansâ€™ concerns delivering telemental health interventions directly to autistic individuals during COVID-19","Background The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the adoption of telemental health (TMH). Pre-pandemic, clinicians had voiced many TMH concerns, but these had not been investigated with respect to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) even with it being known that there are distinct ASD-associated challenges for in-person mental health interventions. Method A convenience sample of (nÂ =Â 55) clinicians completed an online survey regarding their perspectives of adopting TMH interventions in ASD, with closed- and open-answered questions. Quantitative and qualitative data were analysed descriptively/inferentially and via Content Analysis, respectively. Results Multiple clinicians endorsed each TMH challenges/barrier previously identified as concerns in the non-ASD literature. However, overall levels of concern over challenges/barriers were low, and challenges were more likely to be predicted than experienced and considered to be case/presentation specific. Challenges that were considered ASD-specific included the exacerbation of those associated with in-person delivery in ASD, alongside difficulties with trust and appropriate remote social behaviour. On average, clinicians indicated a preference for 50% TMH interventions post-pandemic. Cliniciansâ€™ perceived technological competence and extent of professional experience with ASD were not significantly associated with levels of concern, nor number of experienced challenges, with TMH interventions in ASD. Conclusion In support of the existing TMH literature, challenges/barriers were more likely to be predicted than experienced and were considered to be case/presentation-specific, though this may be more variable in ASD owing to the well-established marked heterogeneity in this population. Remote provision of interventions exacerbated in-person ASD-associated challenges, as predicted, but clinician-level factors appeared not to impact TMH perceptions.","Adams, Lucy, Adamo, Nicoletta, Hollocks, Matthew J.; Valmaggia, Lucia, Brewster, Aylana, Watson, Jennifer, Krisson, Maisie, Simonoff, Emily","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rasd.2022.101956","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders; 94:101956, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29331,""
"Temporal Associations Between Insomnia and Depression Symptoms in Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic: a Cross-Lagged Path Modelling Analysis","It is well recognised that there is an intimate relationship between sleep and depression, with poor quality or short duration sleep associated with greater symptoms of depression. However, it is not clear from the current evidence base what the temporal relationship is between symptoms of insomnia and depression. Further, it is also unclear how the COVID-19 pandemic may impact on such relationships. In this study we have examined the longitudinal relationships between symptoms of depression and insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic at two points separated by one year (April/May 2020 and March/April 2021) in a sample of 1,032 Irish adults using a cross-lagged paths model. We report that there is a bidirectional relationship across time between depression and insomnia symptoms (ÃŸ=-.115 between Insomnia symptoms and subsequent depression symptoms and ÃŸ=-.163 between depression symptoms and subsequent insomnia symptoms;scales scored in opposite directions), and that these relationships persist when COVID-19 anxiety, age and sex are introduced into the model. Our analyses suggest that during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic that insomnia symptoms predicted depression symptoms one year later, and conversely that depression symptoms predicted subsequent insomnia symptoms.","Raman, Sudha, Hyland, Philip, Coogan, Andrew N.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114533","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatry Research;: 114533, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29332,""
"The use of dietary supplements for mental health among the Saudi population: A cross-sectional survey","Introduction Despite limited evidence about the efficacy and safety of dietary supplements (DSs) for improving mental health, people with or without mental disorders often tend to use them, especially during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Previous studies focused on DS use for maintaining or improving overall health;Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prevalence of DSs for mental health among the SA population and to determine the factors that affect their use. Although several studies have focused on describing the prevalence of DS use for general nutritional benefits, few studies have assessed the prevalence of DS use for improving mental health. Therefore, the objective of this study was to explore the prevalence of DS use for mental health disorders and determine the factors influencing the use of DSs for mental health. Methods This cross-sectional study was based on an online survey of Saudi Arabian participants between July and August 2021 with an anonymous, self-completed questionnaire distributed using convenience sampling. The questionnaire included queries related to demographic information, DS use assessment, and mental health evaluation using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7), questionnaire, and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Results In total, 443 participants from various regions of Saudi Arabia completed the questionnaire. The prevalence of DS use in the Saudi population was 44%. Vitamin D (28%) and melatonin (20%) were the most commonly reported DSs used for mental health. The odds of DS use were three times higher in responders with previous mental health diagnoses (OR: 2.972;95% CI: 1.602â€“5.515). Furthermore, the chances of using DSs almost doubled in patients with sub-threshold and moderate to severe insomnia (OR: 1.930;95% CI: 1.191â€“3.126 and OR: 2.485;95% CI: 1.247â€“4.954, respectively). Conclusion Responders diagnosed by a specialist with psychiatric disorders or current insomnia had a higher chance of using DSs. Thus, healthcare providers must provide evidence-based information regarding DSs for mental health improvement and encourage the public to consult healthcare professionals before self-medicating for mental health problems.","Alateeq, Deemah, Alsubaie, Maha A.; Alsafi, Faridah A.; Hisham Alsulaiman, Sultanah, Korayem, Ghazwa B.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsps.2022.03.017","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Saudi Pharmaceutical Journal;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29333,""
"Adverse effects of prenatal dexamethasone exposure on fetal development","Dexamethasone has been widely used in clinical practice to promote fetal lung maturity and reduce neonatal respiratory distress syndrome and perinatal mortality. Nevertheless, its administration is a double-edged sword, as a large number of studies have shown that there are obvious disadvantages in pregnant women and fetal development. In this review, we comprehensively retrospect the latest literature on the toxicological effects and mechanisms of dexamethasone on fetal development, in an attempt to provide a valuable basis for further studies and clinical trials in the future. Overall, prenatal dexamethasone exposure could lead to some adverse consequences on fetal organ systems through intrauterine programming based on the results of current animal and human researches. Potential sequelae include osteoarthritis, hypertension, fatty liver, glomerulosclerosis, depression, diabetes and infertility, some of which can pass on to the next generation. It must be noted that the evidence in humans is preliminary and limited by the small sample size. More studies in large-scale populations are needed to confirm if it raises the risk of sequelae in humans. In addition, we strongly support the application of dexamethasone as a pharmaceutical therapy in pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 before a better therapy is developed. However, the adverse side effects that may arise also cannot be ignored.","Wang, Jingwen, Chen, Fei, Zhu, Shiheng, Li, Xinya, Shi, Wenhao, Dai, Zhiqing, Hao, Lanting, Wang, Xinyi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jri.2022.103619","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Reproductive Immunology;: 103619, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29334,""

"â€œCommunity engagement via restorative justice to build equity-oriented crisis standards of careâ€","The COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) Pandemic has revealed multiple structural inequities within the United States (US), with high social vulnerability index communities shouldering the brunt of death and disability of this pandemic. BIPOC/Latinx people have undergone hospitalizations and death at magnitudes greater than White people in the US. The untold second casualties are health care workers that are suffering from increased risk of infection, death, and mental health crisis. Many health care workers are abandoning the profession all together. Although Crisis Standards of Care (CSC) mean to guide the ethical allocation of scare resources, they frequently use scoring systems that are inherently biased. This raises concern for the application of equity in CSC. Data examining the impact of these protocols on health equity is scarce. Structural maltreatment in healthcare and inequities have led to cumulative harms, physiologic weathering and structural adversities for residents of the US. We propose the use of Restorative Justice (RJ) practices to develop CSC rooted in inclusion and equity. The RJ framework utilizes capacity building, circle process, and conferences to convene groups in a respectful environment for dialogue, healing, accountability,Â and action plan creation. AÂ phased, non-faith-based facilitated RJ approach for CSC development (or revision) that fosters ethically equitable resource distribution, authentic community engagement, and accountability is shared. This opportunity for local, inclusive decision making and problem solving will both reflect the needs and give agency to community members while supporting theÂ dismantling of structural racism and oppressive, exclusive policies. The authors are asking legislative and health system policy makers to adopt Restorative Justice practices for Crisis Standards of Care development. The US cannot afford to have additional reductions in inhabitant lifespan or the talent pool within healthcare.","Long, Ruby, Cleveland Manchanda, Emily C.; Dekker, Annette M.; Kraynov, Liliya, Willson, Susan, Flores, Pedro, Samuels, Elizabeth A.; Rhodes, Karin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnma.2022.02.010","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of the National Medical Association;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29336,""
"Psychometric Validation of the Adolescent Opioid Safety and Learning (AOSL) Scale Using Confirmatory Factor Analysis: A Nationally Representative Sample",": Background The opioid overdose epidemic has worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent data revealed a 28.5% increase in drug-related overdose deaths from 2019 to 2020. Adolescents often misuse family members and friendsâ€™ prescription opioid medications. Furthermore, adolescents may not possess the knowledge or understanding to safely manage opioid medications. There is a need for a validated scale to effectively measure adolescentsâ€™ opioid misuse knowledge, attitudes, and interest in learning about prescription opioid safety. Objective The purpose of this study was to validate the Adolescent Opioid Safety and Learning (AOSL) scale with a nationally representative sample of adolescents and confirm the factor structure of the scale using confirmatory factor analysis. Methods Adolescent participants (aged 13-18) completed the 16-item AOSL scale in Qualtrics from November to December 2020. A total of 774 responses were analyzed. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed to determine the fit of the data to the four-factor model proposed by a prior exploratory factor analysis of the AOSL scale. Fit was assessed using the chi-square test, comparative fit index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), and root mean-squared error of approximation (RMSEA). Results Participants were 50% male and 62% white non-Hispanic. The CFI was 0.984, TLI was 0.980, and RMSEA was 0.048 (95% CI: 0.041 to 0.054, p-value that RMSEA = 0.05 = 0.712). The chi-square test results were X2 = 268.752 on 98 degrees of freedom (p &lt; 0.001). Cronbachâ€™s alpha, a measure of internal consistency, was high within each factor. CFA indicated good fit of the current studyâ€™s data to the four-factor model. Conclusion We found the AOSL scale measures adolescentsâ€™ knowledge of opioid misuse, knowledge of opioid harm, interest in learning about prescription opioids, and likelihood to practice misuse behaviors. This scale can help researchers understand adolescent perceptions and opinions about opioid safety.","Abraham, Olufunmilola, Rosenberger, Claire A.; Birstler, Jen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.japh.2022.03.017","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of the American Pharmacists Association;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29337,""

"Mental health status of medical staff in Xinjiang Province of China based on the normalisation of COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control","Introduction The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has burdened and threatened the psychological health of people around the world, especially those of front-line medical staff. This study aimed to explore the mental-health status and its associated factors amongst the medical workforce of Xinjiang province under the normalisation of the COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control. Methods A total of 408 medical staff were recruited from February 20 to March 10, 2021. Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) scale, Social support Scale, and Simplified Coping-Style Questionnaire were applied to assess their mental-health status and stress-coping tendency. Descriptive analyses, welch's T-test, chi-square test, and binary logistic regression were used to analyse the data. Results The prevalence of mental-health problems was 20.25% (80/395) amongst the surveyed medical staff, and their total symptom mean score (1.31Â Â±Â 0.40) was lower than that of the general population (1.44Â Â±Â 0.43). Logistic regression analysis revealed that nurse, individual with poor health condition, those who lived with their elderly parents at home, those receiving less social support, and those with a negative stress-coping style were more likely to show psychological problems. Conclusion More attention should be paid to the mental state of the medical workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic. The government and professional institutes should facilitate social supportive activities and essential counselling services to help strengthen the psychological resilience of medical staff. Additionally, it is necessary for health administration committee and hospitals to make COVID-19 prevention practice guides and risk communication principles for improving the mental health of the front-line medical staff.","Wu, Qiong, Li, Dao, Yan, Min, Li, Yihua","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2022.102928","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction;: 102928, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29339,""
"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on the Mental Health of School-Going Adolescents: Insights from Dhaka City, Bangladesh","The pandemic has affected every walk of life, and mental health is no exception. Bangladesh has been operating under a resource crisis, and this crisis has incurred and is incurring a governance priority dilemma. Unending vacations of the educational institutions are taxing our students' mental serenity, and among those, adolescents are more vulnerable. Unending leaves of the educational institutions are taxing our students' mental peace, and among those, adolescents are more susceptible. Across the globe, a good number of studies have been performed, and Bangladesh is no exception. However, adolescents have received less attention in those studies, and this paper fills the gap. This explorative study opted for a qualitative method that covered data collection like in-depth interviews among 60 respondents. This study aims to simultaneously unveil the causes of mental dissonance among adolescents and the impact of infection prevention measures (e.g., lockdown) on adolescents' mental health in the capital city of Bangladesh. This study also recommends a possible way out of this crisis. The study revealed that prolonged school closure, fear of the disease, disruption in education, excessive use of digital devices, and the culture of ignoring adolescents' mental health are responsible for pausing detrimental effects on adolescents' mental health. Adolescents suffered from mental health issues like stress, anxiety, depression, and sleeping disorders during the lockdown.","Sifat, Ridwan Islam, Ruponty, Maisaa Mehzabin, Rahim Shuvo, Md Kawser, Chowdhury, Mehjabin, Suha, Shidratul Moontaha","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e09223","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Heliyon;: e09223, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29340,""
"The effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on the mental health of students and teaching staff","In the past decade, mental health is embedded in the concept of health and teachersâ€™ mental health has become the focus of surveys. In this study we examined the mental health of special educator-students compared to their lecturers and inspectors at the University Semmelweis Peto AndrÃ¡s Faculty. We used the validated Hungarian language Mental Health Test (MHT) to assess the mental health. The MHT is linked to the concept of physical and mental wellbeing, it is ability-based approach, and examines 5 areas: wellbeing, savoring, creative-executive efficiency self-regulation resilience. Altogether 237 questionnaires had been returned that were suitable for evaluation (19 lecturers, 16 instructors and 202 students). Studentsâ€™ mean values are lower than the instructorsâ€™ and lecturersâ€™ mean values, and students presented significant lower scores in three scales: self-regulation, creative-executive efficiency, and resilience subscales. In the wellbeing scale we found significant correlation with the existence of the separate room to learn/work during the home-office. These results point to the need for the university to pay attention to the mental health of students, who will be able to consciously monitor their mental health, and who are able to provide effective support to their students.","Sipeki, I.; Vissi, T.; TÃºri, I.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e09185","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Heliyon;: e09185, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29341,""
"Impacts of changes in environmental exposures and health behaviours due to the COVID-19 pandemic on cardiovascular and mental health: A comparison of Barcelona, Vienna, and Stockholm","Responses to COVID-19 altered environmental exposures and health behaviours associated with non-communicable diseases. We aimed to (1) quantify changes in nitrogen dioxide (NO2), noise, physical activity, and greenspace visits associated with COVID-19 policies in the spring of 2020 in Barcelona (Spain), Vienna (Austria), and Stockholm (Sweden), and (2) estimated the number of additional and prevented diagnoses of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, depression, and anxiety based on these changes. We calculated differences in NO2, noise, physical activity, and greenspace visits between pre-pandemic (baseline) and pandemic (counterfactual) levels. With two counterfactual scenarios, we distinguished between Acute Period (March 15th â€“ April 26th, 2020) and Deconfinement Period (May 2nd â€“ June 30th, 2020) assuming counterfactual scenarios were extended for 12 months. Relative risks for each exposure difference were estimated with exposure-risk functions. In the Acute Period, reductions in NO2 (range of change from -16.9Â Âµg/m3 to -1.1Â Âµg/m3), noise (from -5 dB(A) to -2 dB(A)), physical activity (from -659Â MET*min/wk to -183Â MET*min/wk) and greenspace visits (from -20.2Â h/m to 1.1Â h/m) were largest in Barcelona and smallest in Stockholm. In the Deconfinement Period, NO2 (from -13.9Â Âµg/m3 to -3.1Â Âµg/m3), noise (from -3 dB(A) to -1 dB(A)), and physical activity levels (from -524Â MET*min/wk to -83Â MET*min/wk) remained below pre-pandemic levels in all cities. Greatest impacts were caused by physical activity reductions. If physical activity levels in Barcelona remained at Acute Period levels, increases in annual diagnoses for MI (mean: 572 (95% CI: 224, 943)), stroke (585 (6, 1156)), depression (7903 (5202, 10,936)), and anxiety (16,677 (926, 27,002)) would be anticipated. To decrease cardiovascular and mental health impacts, reductions in NO2 and noise from the first COVID-19 surge should be sustained, but without reducing physical activity. Focusing on citiesâ€™ connectivity that promotes active transportation and reduces motor vehicle use assists in achieving this goal.","Koch, Sarah, Khomenko, Sasha, Cirach, Marta, Ubalde-Lopez, MÃ²nica, Baclet, Sacha, Daher, Carolyn, Hidalgo, Laura, LÃµhmus, Mare, Rizzuto, Debora, Rumpler, Romain, Susilo, Yusak, Venkataraman, Siddharth, Wegener, Sandra, Wellenius, Gregory A.; Woodcock, James, Nieuwenhuijsen, Mark","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2022.119124","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Environmental Pollution;: 119124, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29342,""
"Wellness of hospitalists and hospital medicine advanced practice providers during the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020â€“2021","Background The early phase of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had a negative impact on the wellness of hospitalists and hospital medicine advanced practice providers (APPs). However, the burden of the pandemic has evolved and the change in hospitalist and hospital medicine APP wellness is unknown. Objective To evaluate the longitudinal trend in wellness of hospitalists and hospital medicine APPs during the COVID-19 pandemic and guide wellness interventions. Design, Setting and Participants Between May 4, 2020, and June 6, 2021, we administered three surveys to Internal Medicine hospitalists (physicians) and hospital medicine APPs (nurse practitioners and physician assistants) at 16 Mayo Clinic hospitals in four U.S. states. Measurements We evaluated the association of hospitalist and hospital medicine APP characteristics with PROMIS? measures of global wellbeing-mental health, global wellbeing-social activities and relationships, anxiety, social isolation, and emotional support, using logistic and linear regression models. Results The response rates were 52.2% (n=154/295;May 2020), 37.1% (n=111/299;October 2020) and 35.5% (n=114/321;May 2021). In mixed models that included hospitalist and hospital medicine APP characteristics and survey period, APPs, compared with physicians, had lower odds of top global wellbeing-social activities and relationships (adjusted odds ratio 0.42 [0.22?0.82];p = .01), whereas survey period showed no association. The survey period showed an independent association with higher anxiety (May 2020 vs. others) and higher social isolation (October 2020 vs. others), whereas profession showed no association. Concern about contracting COVID-19 at work was significantly associated with lower odds of top global wellbeing-mental health and global wellbeing-social activities and relationships, and with higher anxiety and social isolation. Hospitalist and hospital medicine APP characteristics showed no association with levels of emotional support. Conclusions In this longitudinal assessment of hospitalists and hospital medicine APPs, concern about contracting COVID-19 at work remained a determinant of wellness. The trend for global wellbeing, anxiety, and social isolation may guide wellness interventions.","Dugani, Sagar B.; Fischer, Karen M.; Schroeder, Darrell R.; Geyer, Holly L.; Maniaci, Michael J.; Croghan, Ivana T.; Kashani, Daniel, Burton, M.

"Student Thriving Before and During the Covid-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study of Professional Students in Clinical Laboratory Science, Occupational Therapy, and Therapeutic Recreation","The Covid-19 pandemic changed students educational experience in dramatic ways, especially in regards to the switch to total online learning and lack of in-person interactions with classmates and faculty. In addition, the crisis in healthcare affected students clinical experience placements. Mental health issues were exacerbated. Despite these changes and challenges it is difficult to hypothesize how it impacted student s thriving. This article expands upon the authors previous research by exploring thriving levels during the semester before the pandemic and the three subsequent semesters. Students in Clinical Laboratory Science, Occupational Therapy and Therapeutic Recreation programs participated in an online survey using the Thriving Quotient (Schreiner, 2010) and open-ended questions to collect quantitativequalitative data. Results showed that difficulties juggling demands decreased;challenges of online learning subsided and became a support to thriving and loneliness was experienced across all four semesters.

"The Relationship between Exercise and Mental Health Outcomes during the COVID-19 Pandemic: From the Perspective of Hope","The unexpected outbreak of COVID-19 triggered fear and anxiety in the general population. Exercise was one of the most widely promoted methods to improve body function when socially restricted. This study aims to examine the role of exercise in relieving stressful mental health outcomes (anxiety and depressive symptoms) during the COVID-19 pandemic and explore the underlying mechanism from the perspective of hope, using a combination of goal-directed planning (pathways) and motivation (agency). A cross-sectional online survey recruiting 2390 Chinese participants was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. A series of questions and scales, including the self-designed exercise questionnaire, the Adult Dispositional Hope Scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, were used to measure exercise, hope, anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms, respectively. A structural equation model was constructed to test the hypothesis that exercise benefits mental health outcomes through the mediating role of hope. Our results showed that exercise relieved stressful mental health outcomes via three paths: one direct path (&beta;= &minus;0.077, 95% CI = (&minus;0.138, &minus;0.017), p &lt; 0.01), one indirect path through hope of pathways thinking (&beta;= &minus;0.046, 95% CI = (&minus;0.064, &minus;0.027), p &lt; 0.001) and another indirect path through hope of agency thinking (&beta;= &minus;0.060, 95% CI = (&minus;0.081, &minus;0.039), p &lt; 0.001).

"Changes in Health-Related Behaviours and Mental Health in a UK Public Sample during the First Set of COVID-19 Public Health Restrictions","Public health restrictions, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, have had potentially wide-ranging, unintended effects on health-related behaviours such as diet and physical activity and also affected mental health due to reduced social interactions. This study explored how health-related behaviours and mental health were impacted in a sample of the UK public during the first set of COVID-19 public health restrictions. Two online surveys were administered in the UK, one within the first three months of the restrictions (Timepoints 1 (T1-involving pre-pandemic recall) and 2/T2) and another ten weeks later (Timepoint 3/T3). Moderate&ndash;vigorous physical activity (MVPA), outdoor time, sitting time, screen time and sexual activity were self-reported. Diet was assessed using the Dietary Instrument for Nutrition Education questionnaire. Mental health was measured using the short-form Warwick&ndash;Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale and Becks' Anxiety and Depression Inventories. Differences between timepoints were explored using the Friedman, Wilcoxon signed-rank, McNemar and McNemar&ndash;Bowker tests. Two hundred and ninety-six adults (74% under 65 years old;65% female) provided data across all timepoints. Between T1 and T2, MVPA, time outdoors and sexual activity decreased while sitting, and screen time increased (p &lt; 0.05). Between T2 and T3, saturated fat intake, MVPA, time outdoors, and mental wellbeing increased while sitting, screen time and anxiety symptoms decreased (p &lt; 0.05). This study found that depending on the level of COVID-19 public health restrictions in place, there appeared to be a varying impact on different health-related behaviours and mental health.

"Long COVID Neuropsychological Deficits after Severe, Moderate, or Mild Infection","There is growing awareness that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, even in its mild or moderate respiratory forms, can include long-term neuropsychological deficits. Standardized neuropsychological, psychiatric, neurological, and olfactory tests were administered to 45 patients 236.51 &plusmn;22.54 days after hospital discharge following severe, moderate, or mild respiratory severity from SARS-CoV-2 infection (severe = intensive care unit hospitalization, moderate = conventional hospitalization, mild = no hospitalization). Deficits were found in all domains of cognition, and the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms was relatively high in the three groups. The severe infection group performed more poorly on long-term episodic memory tests and exhibited greater anosognosia than did the other two groups. Those with moderate infection had poorer emotion recognition, which was positively correlated with persistent olfactory dysfunction. Individuals with mild infection were more stressed, anxious, and depressed.

These platforms servicing enterprise employee mental health needs have not been evaluated with respect to their ability to enhance management communication. Hence, the aims of the present study are to explore communication and service attributes across a sample of five operational leading commercial start-up platforms for mental service delivery to employees. We have observed that all platform models focused on providing on-demand mental health consultation services. Existing platforms fail to adequately support management communication for mental health solutions across 80% of platforms reviewed.

"Impact of COVID-19 on School Populations and Associated Factors: A Systematic Review","Apart from the severe impact on public health and well-being, the chain effect resulting from the COVID-19 health crisis is a profound disruption for various other sectors, notably in education. COVID-19 has driven massive transformation in many aspects of the educational landscape, particularly as teaching and learning shifted online due to school closure. Despite the many impacts of the health crises on school populations, a systematic review regarding this particular issue has yet to be conducted. This study, therefore, attempts to comprehensively review the impact of health crises on school populations (student, teacher, parent, and school administration). An extensive literature search guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) reporting checklist was performed in two selected databases, namely Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus to identify how this particular topic was previously studied. Exclusion and inclusion criteria were set to ensure that only research papers written in English from the year 2000 to the present (April 2021) were included. From a total of 457 studies screened, only 41 of them were deemed eligible to be included for qualitative synthesis. The findings revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic was the only health crisis discussed when it comes to investigating the impact of health crises on school populations. This study found four notable consequences of health crises on school populations, which are impacts on mental health, teaching and learning, quality of life, and physical health. Among factors associated with the impact of the health crises are;demographic factors, concerns about the pandemic, education-related factors, health-related factors, geographic factors, economic concerns, teaching challenges, and parenting in the pandemic. This study is expected to be a reference for future works in formulating crises mitigation strategies to reduce the impact of health crises on schools by exploring the contexts of the crises.","Tri Sakti, Andi Muhammad, Mohd Ajis, Siti Zaiton, Azlan, Arina Anis, Kim, Hyung Joon, Wong, Elizabeth, Mohamad, Emma","https://www.google.com/search?q=Impact+of+COVID-19+on+School+Populations+and+Associated+Factors:+A+Systematic+Review","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(7):4024, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29352,""
"Airport security: Lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic","Reflecting on the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, we can see that, even though we have faced war, terror attacks, extreme nature and weather events, economic depressions and more, none of them affected global economies, our freedom of travel, our personal and mental health as fast and as deeply as the COVID-19 pandemic. Once considered a local event to China, it rapidly spread across the globe within a few months, bringing travel between countries to a halt and interfering catastrophically with the aviation industry. Airports and airlines soon discovered that not only were they on the brink of bankruptcy, they also needed furlough their employees, shut down terminals and fleets and, in race to establish new methodologies for public health demands to try to regain some aviation and commerce activity. The airport security sector also suffered, losing manpower, struggling with infected employees, involving staff in safety related duties which were not part of their job description and seeing new stakeholders to set the 'new security' agenda for their home court. Focus was diverted from counter-terrorism. Obviously, due to the circumstances, direct operation and development budgets were frozen or re-allocated, so work plans and an array of improvements are now under consideration. The most agile airports set up innovation labs to identy updated technological solutions in supporting daily efforts, especially with the public demand for contactless travel. Soon, some regulators began to introduce regulations, and are trying to set the industry to work on gold standards and platforms, pursuing governmental official confidence that will, in time, translate into authorisation to operate safe travels (especially on international routes, as in some countries domestic traffic has a reasonable volume). This paper analyses civil aviation actors and vectors throughout the pandemic, and offers predictions for the near future trends, especially for aviation security directors.

"COVID-19 Health Crisis Workloads and Screening for Psychological Impact in Nursing Home Staff: A Qualitative and Quantitative Survey","Background: Nursing homes were particularly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to evaluate qualitatively and quantitatively with the use of a self-reported questionnaire as a tool for screening for mental disorders in nursing home staff. Methods: A multicenter epidemiological study was conducted in 12 nursing homes in France with 1117 nursing home staff eligible. Socio-demographic, occupational, and medical data were collected by anonymous self-reported questionnaire using validated scales to assess anxiety/depressive symptoms (HAD scale) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PCL-5). A total of 12 semi-structured interviews were conducted to assess acceptance and expectations for the use of the questionnaire. Results: The participation rate was 34.5%. Data from 373 questionnaires were included in the analysis. The questionnaire was well accepted by the participants and met their wishes for prevention action. The sample was 82% female. More than half reported a feeling of powerlessness and lack of time or staffing. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms was 22%, depressive symptoms 10%, and post-traumatic stress 7%. Conclusions: This study underlines the interest in screening for mental disorders by self-reported questionnaire and deploying preventive actions in the workplace to reduce stress and facilitate the reconciliation of family and working life in this context of the pandemic.","Tebbeb, Nesrine, Villemagne, Fanny, Prieur, Thomas, Dorier, SolÃ¨ne, Fort, Emmanuel, CÃ©larier, Thomas, Fontana, Luc, Barth, Nathalie, PÃ©lissier, Carole","https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID-19+Health+Crisis+Workloads+and+Screening+for+Psychological+Impact+in+Nursing+Home+Staff:+A+Qualitative+and+Quantitative+Survey","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(7):4061, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29354,""
"Risk perception, knowledge, attitude, and preventive practice towards COVID-19 outbreak: A cross-sectional online survey in Kerala","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic affects people of all ages;healthy and unhealthy. The only measure for prevention of the spread of infection is SMS (social distance, mask, and sanitation) in the absence of an effective drug or vaccine. The lockdown had affected people's mobility and livelihood. Objectives: This study assessed the risk perception, knowledge, attitude, and preventive practice of people of Kerala towards the COVID-19 outbreak and the association between the risk perception, knowledge, attitude and preventive practices and sociodemographic variables and the factors associated with risk perception. Methods: An online survey using Google Forms was conducted during the month of July 2020 among 451 persons from all the 14 districts of Kerala. Results: The majority of the study participants (60%) perceived their risk as low. Most of the participants (69.4%) had a very high level of knowledge with an overall correct rate of 86% regarding symptoms, risk factors, mode of spread, and treatment of COVID-19. The mean (SD) of knowledge, attitude, and preventive practice were 12.6 (1.8), 4.6 (1.2), and 9.3 (1.1) respectively. Most of the participants (94.9%) expressed a negative attitude about control of the outbreak and (93.1%) had good preventive practices. The risk perception was significantly associated with preventive practice (p &lt; .05). Ordinal logistic regression analysis revealed that risk perception was significantly associated with living in a hotspot or containment zone, having comorbidities, occupation in government/semi-government/central government institutions, and source of income as salary. Conclusion: There is a need for effective health education programs aimed at enhancing positive attitude and adherence to strict practices of SMS (social distance, mask, and sanitation) and updated knowledge of COVID-19 are needed to contain the pandemic at the local level.","Swapna, K.

"Workplace Factors, Burnout Signs, and Clinical Mental Health Symptoms among Mental Health Workers in Lombardy and Quebec during the First Wave of COVID-19","Several research contributions have depicted the impact of the pandemic environment on healthcare and social care personnel. Even though the high prevalence of burnout depression and anxiety in healthcare settings before COVID-19 has been well documented in the research, the recent increase in psychological distress and mental health issues in healthcare and mental health workers should be attributed to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of the present study is to develop, evaluate, and compare a model of COVID-19 workplace stressors between two different territories, the Italian region of Lombardy and the Canadian province of Quebec. Within this model, burnout is depicted as the strongest determinant of mental health symptoms for mental health workers. In turn, the main workplace determinants of burnout are the perception of a lack of support from the organization and the fear of contracting COVID-19 at work. Findings also provide insights for designing interventions to promote and protect mental health workers in the context of the pandemic. In conclusion, it is necessary to monitor burnout and carefully analyze elements of organizational culture, in addition to offering clinical and psychological care for those in need.","Rapisarda, Filippo, Vallarino, Martine, Brousseau-Paradis, Camille, Benedictis, Luigi De, CorbiÃ¨re, Marc, Villotti, Patrizia, Cavallini, Elena, Briand, Catherine, Cailhol, Lionel, Lesage, Alain","https://www.google.com/search?q=Workplace+Factors,+Burnout+Signs,+and+Clinical+Mental+Health+Symptoms+among+Mental+Health+Workers+in+Lombardy+and+Quebec+during+the+First+Wave+of+COVID-19","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(7):3806, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29359,""

"Emerging Pattern of Post-COVID-19 Parosmia and Its Effect on Food Perception","Olfactory dysfunction is amongst the many symptoms of Long COVID. Whilst most people that experience smell loss post COVID-19 recover their sense of smell and taste within a few weeks, about 10% of cases experience long-term problems, and their smell recovery journey often begins a few months later when everyday items start to smell distorted. This is known as parosmia. The aim of this study was to identify the key food triggers of parosmic distortions and investigate the relationship between distortion and disgust in order to establish the impact of parosmia on diet and quality of life. In this cross-sectional study (n = 727), respondents experiencing smell distortions completed a questionnaire covering aspects of smell loss, parosmia and the associated change in valence of everyday items. There was a significant correlation between strength and disgust (p &lt; 0.0001), and when the selected items were reported as distorted, they were described as either unpleasant or gag-inducing 84% of the time. This change in valence associated with loss of expected pleasure and the presence of strange tastes and burning sensations must certainly lead to changes in eating behaviours and serious longer-term consequences for mental health and quality of life.","Parker, Jane K.; Methven, Lisa, Pellegrino, Robert, Smith, Barry C.; Gane, Simon, Kelly, Christine E.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Emerging+Pattern+of+Post-COVID-19+Parosmia+and+Its+Effect+on+Food+Perception","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Foods; 11(7):967, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29361,""

"Peer Power! Secure Peer Attachment Mediates the Effect of Parental Attachment on Depressive Withdrawal of Teenagers","Adolescents' depressive social withdrawal is a relevant concern for mental health professionals, and it is widespread among community teenagers in form of subclinical symptoms. Different studies suggest that insecure attachment representations increase the adolescents' likelihood to show symptoms of withdrawal (e.g., loneliness). This study explored the effect of the general attachment internal working model (IWM) and the independent and cumulative effects of the specific attachment representations of parents-in terms of secure base/safe haven-and peers on adolescents' withdrawal. Additionally, the mediation of peer attachment on the effect of parental attachment on symptoms was explored. All analyses were conducted controlling for the difference between teenagers living with parents together or divorced/separated, as children of divorcees are considered more exposed to stressors. Ninety-one adolescents aged 12&ndash;17 years old were assessed online during the COVID pandemic period, employing the Youth Self-Report to assess withdrawal and the Friends and Family Interview to assess attachment-general IWM and attachment-specific representations. Results show no influence of parents together/separated or of the general IWM on withdrawal, but higher parent secure base/safe haven and peer attachment cumulatively predicted 10&ndash;21% less withdrawal. Moreover, more positive peer attachment mediated 61% of the effect of the parental secure attachment on withdrawal, revealing an indirect effect of parental attachment on withdrawal through peer attachment. In conclusion, both parents and peers are influential on adolescent mental health, and fostering positive peer relationships can buffer the effect of dysfunctional family relationships on teenagers' withdrawal.","Muzi, Stefania, Rogier, Guyonne, Pace, Cecilia Serena","https://www.google.com/search?q=Peer+Power!+Secure+Peer+Attachment+Mediates+the+Effect+of+Parental+Attachment+on+Depressive+Withdrawal+of+Teenagers","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(7):4068, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29364,""

"University Students' Classroom Emotional Climate and Attitudes during and after COVID-19 Lockdown","With the advent of COVID-19, universities around the world have been forced to move to a fully online mode of delivery because of lockdown policies. This led to a flurry of studies into issues such as internet access, student attitudes to online learning and mental health during lockdown. However, researchers need a validated survey for assessing the classroom emotional climate and student attitudes towards learning in universities that can be used for online, face-to-face or blended delivery. Such a survey could be used to illuminate students' perceptions of the experiences that make up learning at university level, in terms of such factors as care from teachers, collaboration and motivation. In this article, we report the validation of a University Classroom Emotional Climate (UCEC) questionnaire and an Attitudes to Learning scale, as well as their use in comparing the classroom emotional climate and attitudes during COVID-19 lockdown (fully online delivery) with post-lockdown (mixed-mode delivery). Female students experienced the post-lockdown condition significantly more positively than during lockdown for all scales except Care, while the only significant difference for males between the during and post-lockdown was their choice to engage with learning (Control) and the degree of Challenge that they found with the learning materials.","McLure, Felicity I.; Koul, Rekha B.; Fraser, Barry J.","https://www.google.com/search?q=University+Students'+Classroom+Emotional+Climate+and+Attitudes+during+and+after+COVID-19+Lockdown","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Education Sciences; 12, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29366,""
"Potential Role of the Antidepressants Fluoxetine and Fluvoxamine in the Treatment of COVID-19","Mapping non-canonical cellular pathways affected by approved medications can accelerate drug repurposing efforts, which are crucial in situations with a global impact such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Fluoxetine and fluvoxamine are well-established and widely-used antidepressive agents that act as serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI-s). Interestingly, these drugs have been reported earlier to act as lysosomotropic agents, inhibitors of acid sphingomyelinase in the lysosomes, and as ligands of sigma-1 receptors, mechanisms that might be used to fight severe outcomes of COVID-19. In certain cases, these drugs were administered for selected COVID-19 patients because of their antidepressive effects, while in other cases, clinical studies were performed to assess the effect of these drugs on treating COVID-19 patients. Clinical studies produced promising data that encourage the further investigation of fluoxetine and fluvoxamine regarding their use in COVID-19. In this review, we summarize experimental data and the results of the performed clinical studies. We also provide an overview of previous knowledge on the tissue distribution of these drugs and by integrating this information with the published experimental results, we highlight the real opportunity of using these drugs in our fight against COVID-19.","Mahdi, Mohamed, HermÃ¡n, Levente, RÃ©thelyi, JÃ¡nos M.; BÃ¡lint, BÃ¡lint LÃ¡szlÃ³","https://www.google.com/search?q=Potential+Role+of+the+Antidepressants+Fluoxetine+and+Fluvoxamine+in+the+Treatment+of+COVID-19","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Molecular Sciences; 23(7):3812, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29367,""
"Fair Credit Markets: Using Household Balance Sheets to Promote Consumer Welfare","Access to credit can provide a path out of poverty. Improvidently granted, however, credit also can lead to financial ruin for the borrower. Unfortunately, the various regulatory approaches to consumer lending do not effectively distinguish between these two effects of the lending process. This Article develops a framework, based on the household balance sheet, that effectively distinguishes between lending that is welfare-enhancing for the borrower and lending that is potentially (indeed likely) ruinous and argues that the two types of lending should be regulated in vastly different ways. From a balance sheet perspective, various kinds of personal loans impact borrowers in vastly different ways. This difference depends on whether the loan proceeds are being used: (a) to make an investment (where the borrower hopes to earn a spread between the cost of the borrowing and the returns on the investment);(b) to fund capital expenditures (homes, cars, etc.);or (c) to fund current consumption (medical care, food, etc.). From a balance sheet perspective, this third type of lending is distinct. Such loans reduce wealth and are correlated with significant physical and mental health problems among borrowers. Payday loans are the paradigmatic example of the use of credit to fund current consumption. Loans to fund current consumption reduce the wealth of the borrower because they create a liability on the ""personal balance sheet"" of the borrower without creating any corresponding asset. The general category of loans to fund current consumption includes both loans used to fund unforeseen contingencies, like emergency medical care or emergency car repairs, and those used to make routine purchases. Consistent with the stated justification for creating these lending facilities, which is serving households and communities, the emergency lending facilities of the U.S. Federal Reserve should be made accessible to individuals facing emergency liquidity needs in a partnership with the nation's commercial banks. Loans that are taken out for current consumption but are not used for emergencies also should be afforded special regulatory treatment. Lenders who make nonemergency loans for current consumption should owe fiduciary duties to their borrowers. Compliance with such duties would require not only much greater disclosure than is currently mandated but also would impose a duty of suitability on lenders, which would require lenders to provide borrowers with the most appropriate loan for their needs-among other protections discussed here. These heightened duties also should be extended to borrowers when they take out a loan that increases the debt on a borrower 's balance sheet by more than 25%.","Macey, Jonathan","https://www.google.com/search?q=Fair+Credit+Markets:+Using+Household+Balance+Sheets+to+Promote+Consumer+Welfare","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Texas Law Review; 100(4):683-745, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29368,""
"Free Zinc as a Predictive Marker for COVID-19 Mortality Risk","Free zinc is considered to be the exchangeable and biological active form of zinc in serum, and is discussed to be a suitable biomarker for alterations in body zinc homeostasis and related diseases. Given that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by a marked decrease in total serum zinc, and clinical data indicate that zinc status impacts the susceptibility and severity of the infection, we hypothesized that free zinc in serum might be altered in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and may reflect disease severity. To test this hypothesis, free zinc concentrations in serum samples of survivors and nonsurvivors of COVID-19 were analyzed by fluorometric microassay. Similar to the reported total serum zinc deficit measured by total reflection X-ray fluorescence, free serum zinc in COVID-19 patients was considerably lower than that in control subjects, and surviving patients displayed significantly higher levels of free zinc than those of nonsurvivors (mean &plusmn;SD;0.4 &plusmn;0.2 nM vs. 0.2 &plusmn;0.1 nM;p = 0.0004). In contrast to recovering total zinc concentrations (r = 0.706, p &lt; 0.001) or the declining copper&ndash;zinc ratio (r = &minus;0.646;p &lt; 0.001), free zinc concentrations remained unaltered with time in COVID-19 nonsurvivors. Free serum zinc concentrations were particularly low in male as compared to female patients (mean &plusmn;SD;0.4 &plusmn;0.2 nM vs. 0.2 &plusmn;0.1 nM;p = 0.0003). This is of particular interest, as the male sex is described as a risk factor for severe COVID-19. Overall, results indicate that depressed free serum zinc levels are associated with increased risk of death in COVID-19, suggesting that free zinc may serve as a novel prognostic marker for the severity and course of COVID-19.","Maares, Maria, Hackler, Julian, Haupt, Alessia, Heller, Raban Arved, Bachmann, Manuel, Diegmann, Joachim, Moghaddam, Arash, Schomburg, Lutz, Haase, Hajo","https://www.google.com/search?q=Free+Zinc+as+a+Predictive+Marker+for+COVID-19+Mortality+Risk","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Nutrients; 14(7):1407, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29369,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Virus Pandemic on the Incidence of First Psychotic Spectrum Disorders","The effects of COVID-19 on the human body are not yet understood enough. Medical history provides information on cases of psychiatric symptoms during viral infections in the 20th century, such as the influenza pandemic. Currently, it is observed that there is an increasing number of new psychiatric disorders in previously healthy individuals. In addition, because of the decreased amount of reporting to health care providers, including psychiatrists, many physicians suggest that the number of neuropsychiatric disorders may be underestimated. In this paper, we review available studies on the occurrence of first-time psychotic spectrum disorder (PSD) in individuals related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The reviewed studies suggest that first-time psychotic disorder in COVID-19 patients is statistically significantly more frequent compared to influenza, as well as to other respiratory infections. The emergence of new PSDs is explained by direct neurotropism of the virus on the one hand and by immunological mechanisms on the other. The main conclusions of this review should be treated with caution, and future research on this topic is needed. The authors recognize the particular need to develop standardized laboratory panels that include inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-&alpha;), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing, and SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays to entirely understand the etiology of neuropsychiatric complications of SARS-CoV-2 infections and the pandemic itself. In addition, public health efforts are required to promote mental health, especially during COVID-19.","Los, Kacper, Kulikowska, Joanna, Waszkiewicz, Napoleon","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Impact+of+the+COVID-19+Virus+Pandemic+on+the+Incidence+of+First+Psychotic+Spectrum+Disorders","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(7):3781, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29370,""
"A Study of the Impact of River Improvement and Greening on Public Reassurance and the Urban Well-Being Index during the COVID-19 Pandemic","This study aims to investigate the effect of river improvement and greening projects on people and the urban happiness index. First, the quantitative method was adopted, and data collected from 734 questionnaires were analyzed using SPSS 26.0 software. Then, the qualitative method was used, and semi-structured interviews were conducted to collect the opinions of 12 interviewees, including scholars, government employees, citizens, and practitioners. Finally, we discuss multiple comparison analysis testing. The survey results indicate that river improvement and greening projects could be conducted to take advantage of diverse ecological environments, urban transportation planning, and geographical location. Such projects can help people relieve stress, even during the COVID-19 pandemic;improve their physical and mental health;and enhance their environmental awareness. However, due to poor traffic flow, a low space utilization rate, and inflexible management practices, visiting these environments has posed a risk of infection. As a result, most respondents indicated that the leisure benefits of green fields are limited and not helpful for improving their physical and mental health or having fun. Additionally, survey responses by people from different backgrounds (p &lt; 0.01) varied.

"The Relationship Between Psychological Resilience and the Big Five Personality Traits","COVID-19 has resulted in change, uncertainty, and anxiety in the workplace. Emotional resilience is needed to overcome resulting mental health burdens. Personality traits are important determinants of emotional resilience. This study examined the relationship between resilience and the big five personality traits for mining employees in Mongolia. Four of the five traits, agreeableness, conscientiousness, openness, and extraversion, were correlated with resilience. The study offers insights into the relationship of personality traits and resilience in a new context. Understanding the relationship between resilience and personality traits can help managers understand and better support their employees.","Khosbayar, Alimaa, Andrade, Maureen Snow, Miller, Ronald Mellado","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Relationship+Between+Psychological+Resilience+and+the+Big+Five+Personality+Traits","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Management Review; 18(1):5-11,103, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29372,""
"Remote Support of Elderly Women Participating in Mental Health Promotion Programme during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Single-Group Longitudinal Intervention","The aim of the study was to evaluate the longitudinal changes in mental well-being during the switch of the intervention from a personal contact to a remotely delivered Mental Health Prevention and Promotion Programme in elderly women at high risk of developing depression. The study included 70 women aged over 60 with a mean age of 72.28 years. In order to determine mental well-being, the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was used at four time points: January, April, September and December 2020. A self-developed questionnaire was used to determine predictors of mental well-being. Two-way ANOVA demonstrated a lack of significant differences between the means in the GDS scores at the four data collection time points (p = 0.21). Frequent use of green areas reduced the GDS score on average by 1.52 points (p = 0.01), while owning a garden by 1.51 points (p = 0.04). The illness of a family member increased the GDS score by an average of 1.7 points (p = 0.02). No significant mood deterioration was found between January 2020 and December 2020 in the studied group of elderly women at a high risk of developing depression, which suggests that the remote support provided in the mental health promotion programme was effective.","Juszko, Karolina, Serweta, Anna, Cieslik, Blazej, Idzikowski, Wojciech, Szczepanska-Gieracha, Joanna, Gajda, Robert","https://www.google.com/search?q=Remote+Support+of+Elderly+Women+Participating+in+Mental+Health+Promotion+Programme+during+the+COVID-19+Pandemic:+A+Single-Group+Longitudinal+Intervention","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(7):4073, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29373,""
"The Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Assessment of Sexual Life-Repeated Cross-Sectional Surveys among Polish Adults in 2017, 2020 and 2021","The study aims to investigate whether assessment of sexual life remained stable during the COVID-19 pandemic. Two surveys were conducted among Polish adults aged 18&ndash;70 years in June 2020 (n = 2042;perspective of last 2&ndash;3 months) and in June 2021 (n = 2418;last 12 months). Data from 2017 (n = 1980) were used as a reference point. Four questions allowed for defining five sexual life assessment profiles (k-means cluster analysis). Their characteristics were presented using 12 variables and 16 factors that contributed to difficulties in sexual life. The 2020 survey showed a temporary increase in the importance of sexual life and the frequency of sexual intercourse. However, the percentage of respondents representing the most favorable profile decreased significantly over the consecutive survey periods (47.1%, 34.2%, and 32.3%, respectively). Pandemic-induced fatigue and stress as well as the permanent presence of others at home were reported as two main factors negatively affecting the frequency of sexual intercourse during the pandemic. Respondents who assessed their sexual life as poor were more likely to consider illness, depression, and low self-esteem as factors negatively impacting their sexual life in 2021 than a year earlier. The results confirmed that as the pandemic drew on, the assessment of sexual life changed compared to the time around the first lockdown.","Izdebski, Zbigniew, Slowikowska-Hilczer, Jolanta, Mazur, Joanna","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Effect+of+the+COVID-19+Pandemic+on+the+Assessment+of+Sexual+Life-Repeated+Cross-Sectional+Surveys+among+Polish+Adults+in+2017,+2020+and+2021","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(7):4110, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29374,""
"Association between Long Working Hours and Psychological Distress: The Effect Modification by Request to Stay Home When Sick in the Workplace during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The effect of workplace infection control measures required by the COVID-19 pandemic on the association between long working hours and psychological distress has not yet been fully revealed. This study investigated the effect of requesting to stay home when sick (RSH) on the association between long working hours and psychological distress. We conducted a cross-sectional survey in December 2020 among participants who had previously registered with a Japanese web survey company. A total of 27,036 workers completed a self-administered questionnaire which assessed usual daily overtime work hours. RSH was assessed using an original single-item scale, while psychological distress was measured with the K6 scale. After the interaction effect of overtime work hours and RSH on psychological distress was tested, we conducted stratified analyses using RSH. The statistical analysis demonstrated a significant interaction effect (p for interaction &lt; 0.001). When we conducted stratified analyses, the odds ratios increased with longer working hours, both with and without RSH groups;however, the risk of long working hours causing psychological distress was greater in the latter group (odds ratio = 1.95 [95% confidence interval: 1.62&ndash;2.36] than in the former group (odds ratio = 1.73 [95% confidence interval: 1.55&ndash;1.93]). We found that working without RSH could strengthen the association between long working hours and psychological distress.

"Analysis of the Predictive Role of Self-Compassion on Emotional Distress during COVID-19 Lockdown","Research has shown that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a mental health burden worldwide. Most studies have focused on the factors associated with a higher risk of mental health problems, and only a few studies have looked at the potential protective factors. The general objective of this study was to determine whether self-compassion has a protective effect against the risk of mental health problems and especially on perceived infectability. If so, we intended to determine which of the three specific facets of self-compassion (i.e., mindfulness vs. over-identification;self-kindness vs. self-judgment;common humanity vs. isolation;) has the greatest weight in predicting emotional distress. We conducted a cross-sectional study through an online survey completed by 855 participants in Spain. Results confirmed that the three facets of self-compassion reduce the negative correlation between perceived infectability and emotional distress, diminishing its role in predicting emotional distress. These results are discussed in relation to the protective role of self-compassion and the need to further explore the variables associated with a lower risk of mental problems derived from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","GutiÃ©rrez-HernÃ¡ndez, MarÃ­a Elena, Fanjul RodrÃ­guez, Luisa Fernanda, DÃ­az Megolla, Alicia, Oyanadel, CristiÃ¡n, PeÃ±ate Castro, Wenceslao","https://www.google.com/search?q=Analysis+of+the+Predictive+Role+of+Self-Compassion+on+Emotional+Distress+during+COVID-19+Lockdown","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Social Sciences; 11(4):151, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29376,""
"The Oneiric Activity during and after the COVID-19 Total Lockdown in Italy: A Longitudinal Study","A growing body of evidence highlights that the COVID-19 pandemic affected oneiric activity. However, only a few studies have assessed the longitudinal changes in dream phenomenology during different phases of the pandemic, often focused on a limited number of dream variables. The aim of the present study was to provide an exhaustive assessment of dream features during total lockdown (TL) and a post-lockdown (PL) period characterized by eased restrictive measures in Italy. We performed a longitudinal study using a web-based survey to collect demographic, COVID-19 related, clinical, sleep, and dream data at TL and PL. Our final sample included 108 participants. The high frequency of poor sleep quality, anxiety, and depressive symptoms observed during TL remained stable at PL, while sleep latency (t = &minus;4.09;p &lt; 0.001) and PTSD-related disruptive nocturnal behaviors (t = &minus;5.68;p &lt; 0.001) exhibited a reduction at PL. A PL decrease in time spent with digital media was observed (t = &minus;2.77;p = 0.007). We found a strong PL reduction in dream frequency (t = &minus;5.49;p &lt; 0.001), emotional load (t = &minus;2.71;p = 0.008), vividness (t = &minus;4.90;p &lt; 0.001), bizarreness (t = &minus;4.05;p &lt; 0.001), length (t = &minus;4.67;p &lt; 0.001), and lucid dream frequency (t = &minus;2.40;p = 0.018). Fear was the most frequently reported emotion in dreams at TL (26.9%) and PL (22.2%). Only the frequency of specific lockdown-related dream contents exhibited a reduction at PL. These findings highlight that the end of the home confinement had a strong impact on the oneiric activity, in the direction of reduced dream frequency, intensity, and lockdown-related contents. The co-occurrence of such changes with a decline in nocturnal PTSD-related symptoms, sleep latency, and time with digital media suggests an influence of post-traumatic stress levels, lifestyle modifications, and sleep pattern on dream changes during different phases of the pandemic. The stable prevalence of fear in dreams and the large frequency of poor sleep quality, depressive symptoms, and anxiety are probably related to the persistence of many negative consequences of the pandemic. Overall, these results are consistent with the continuity hypothesis of dreams.","Gorgoni, Maurizio, Scarpelli, Serena, Alfonsi, Valentina, Annarumma, Ludovica, Pellegrini, Elisa, Fasiello, Elisabetta, Cordone, Susanna, Dâ€™Atri, Aurora, Salfi, Federico, Amicucci, Giulia, Ferrara, Michele, Pazzaglia, Mariella, De Gennaro, Luigi","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Oneiric+Activity+during+and+after+the+COVID-19+Total+Lockdown+in+Italy:+A+Longitudinal+Study","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(7):3857, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29377,""

"A Population-Level Analysis of Changes in Circadian Rhythms and Sleep and Their Association with Negative Emotions during the Outbreak of COVID-19 in China","Since 2019, COVID-19 began spreading globally and has significantly affected peoples' daily lifestyles. The public was asked to stay at home for constant quarantine and community containment starting on 23 January 2020. To assess the circadian rhythms and sleep changes and their influential factors during the COVID-19 outbreak, a questionnaire was administered to 451 Chinese participants during 20&ndash;31 January 2020. The changes in circadian rhythm, sleep&ndash;wake cycle, dining, and exercise of the participants and their correlation with negative emotions were analyzed. Furthermore, the effects of three factors (holiday, quarantine, and concerns regarding the pandemic situation) on these changes were assessed. We found that 34.6% of the participants reported circadian rhythm disturbance. Moreover, 67.2% presented negative emotions (worry, fear, downheartedness, anxiety, depression, and stupefaction) regarding the pandemic situation, among which worry was the most prevalent. Gender and age were significant factors for changes in the circadian phases and emotions. There was a correlation between circadian rhythm alterations and negative emotions. In addition, holiday, quarantine, and concerns regarding the pandemic situation had significant effects on circadian rhythms and sleep in a substantial part of the population. Regression analysis demonstrated reciprocal influences between many of these variables. Our findings suggest that circadian rhythms, sleep, and negative emotions in the normal population need to be considered during the pandemic period and that the adjustment of circadian rhythms could help promote sleep, restore emotions and improve public health.","Chen, Siyu, Huang, Tianyu, Huang, Yutao, Nie, Cenxing, Liang, Jingwen, Ma, Huan, Liu, Xinyan, Xu, Yanwen, Guo, Jinhu","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+Population-Level+Analysis+of+Changes+in+Circadian+Rhythms+and+Sleep+and+Their+Association+with+Negative+Emotions+during+the+Outbreak+of+COVID-19+in+China","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: COVID; 2(4):450-463, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29381,""
"Multimorbidity Profiles and Infection Severity in COVID-19 Population Using Network Analysis in the Andalusian Health Population Database","Identifying the population at risk of COVID-19 infection severity is a priority for clinicians and health systems. Most studies to date have only focused on the effect of specific disorders on infection severity, without considering that patients usually present multiple chronic diseases and that these conditions tend to group together in the form of multimorbidity patterns. In this large-scale epidemiological study, including primary and hospital care information of 166,242 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection from the Spanish region of Andalusia, we applied network analysis to identify multimorbidity profiles and analyze their impact on the risk of hospitalization and mortality. Our results showed that multimorbidity was a risk factor for COVID-19 severity and that this risk increased with the morbidity burden. Individuals with advanced cardio-metabolic profiles frequently presented the highest infection severity risk in both sexes. The pattern with the highest severity associated in men was present in almost 28.7% of those aged &ge;80 years and included associations between cardiovascular, respiratory, and metabolic diseases;age-adjusted odds ratio (OR) 95% confidence interval (1.71 (1.44&ndash;2.02)). In women, similar patterns were also associated the most with infection severity, in 7% of 65&ndash;79-year-olds (1.44 (1.34&ndash;1.54)) and in 29% of &ge;80-year-olds (1.35 (1.18&ndash;1.53)). Patients with mental health patterns also showed one of the highest risks of COVID-19 severity, especially in women. These findings strongly recommend the implementation of personalized approaches to patients with multimorbidity and SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in the population with high morbidity burden.","Carmona-PÃ­rez, JonÃ¡s, Ioakeim-Skoufa, Ignatios, Gimeno-Miguel, Antonio, Poblador-Plou, Beatriz, GonzÃ¡lez-Rubio, Francisca, MuÃ±oyerro-MuÃ±iz, Dolores, RodrÃ­guez-Herrera, Juliana, Goicoechea-Salazar, Juan Antonio, Prados-Torres, Alexandra, Villegas-Portero, RomÃ¡n","https://www.google.com/search?q=Multimorbidity+Profiles+and+Infection+Severity+in+COVID-19+Population+Using+Network+Analysis+in+the+Andalusian+Health+Population+Database","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(7):3808, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29382,""
"Mental Health Symptoms among General Practitioners Facing the Acute Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Detecting Different Reaction Groups","During the 2020 first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, general practitioners (GPs) represented the first line of primary care and were highly exposed to the pandemic risks, with a consequent risk of developing a wide range of mental health symptoms. However, scant data are still available on factors associated with a worse outcome. The aim of the present study was to investigate mental health symptoms in 139 GPs in the aftermath of the first COVID-19 national lockdown in Italy, detecting groups of subjects with different depressive, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress symptom severity. The impact of the mental health symptoms on quality of life and individual functioning were also evaluated. A cluster analysis identified three groups with mild (44.6%), moderate (35.3%), and severe psychopathological burden (20.1%). Higher symptom severity was related to younger age, fewer years in service as GPs, working in a high incidence area for the pandemic, having a relative at risk of medical complications due to COVID-19, besides more severe global functioning impairment, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress. The present findings showed that GPs, forced to perform their professional activity in extremely stressful conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic, were at high risk of developing mental health problems and a worse quality of life.","Carmassi, Claudia, Dellâ€™Oste, Valerio, Barberi, Filippo Maria, Bertelloni, Carlo Antonio, Pedrinelli, Virginia, Dellâ€™Osso, Liliana","https://www.google.com/search?q=Mental+Health+Symptoms+among+General+Practitioners+Facing+the+Acute+Phase+of+the+COVID-19+Pandemic:+Detecting+Different+Reaction+Groups","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(7):4007, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29383,""

"The Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Infection on Youth Mental Health: A Narrative Review","Background: COVID-19 pandemic has affected the physical health, psychological wellbeing, and mental health of the whole population. Young people are among those most at risk of developing mental health symptoms or disorders related to the pandemic. Purpose: the present narrative review is aimed at providing an updated overview of the current literature concerning the psychological impact of the SARS-CoV-2 infection but also of the COVID-19 outbreak, environmental restriction, and social distancing on mental health outcomes among the youth population aged between 15 and 25 years. Methods: in December 2021, an electronic search on this topic was performed on PubMed. Relevant publications from January 2020 until December 2021 were included. Findings: 53 cross-sectional studies, 26 longitudinal studies, 4 ecological studies, 1 qualitative study, and 1 systematic review were included. We found many methodological limitations in the studies included, especially poor choice of study samples and short follow-ups. Little literature was in support of a strong relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and consequences on youth mental health. On the contrary, many studies showed how extraordinary measures to limit the spread of the virus have impacted young people in terms of onset of new mental disorders and symptoms, suicidality, and access to emergency psychiatric services. Depressive and anxiety symptoms and disorders show the greatest increase in incidence, especially in girls and young women. Conclusions: it seems important to pay attention to the mental health of young people in relation to the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.

For that purpose, 699 parents with children aged 6&ndash;17 and 552 adolescents aged 12&ndash;17, who completed the parent and adolescent version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire at the beginning of 2019, responded to a survey from 26 May to 15 June 2020 that assessed psychological well-being and life conditions during quarantine (i.e., sociodemographic characteristics, situation before the lockdown, physical environment and accompaniment during the lockdown, COVID-related variables). According to both parent- and self-reports, children and youth experienced a significant worsening in emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention, peer problems, and total difficulties subscales. Findings also suggested that impairment was mainly associated with variables related to the child's situation prior to home quarantine, the quality and quantity of the child's social networks during the lockdown, the daily routines the child followed, the concerns the child had about health, and the presence of economic and learning problems caused by the COVID-19. Thus, the present investigation emphasizes the need for carefully monitoring the mental health of younger people, provides guidance for the development of interventions that mitigate some of the psychological difficulties faced in a situation of confinement, and highlights the importance of paying special attention to high-risk groups.","Bosch, Rosa, Pagerols, Mireia, Prat, Raquel, EspaÃ±ol-MartÃ­n, Gemma, Rivas, Cristina, Dolz, Montserrat, Haro, Josep Maria, Ramos-Quiroga, Josep Antoni, RibasÃ©s, Marta, Casas, Miquel","https://www.google.com/search?q=Changes+in+the+Mental+Health+of+Children+and+Adolescents+during+the+COVID-19+Lockdown:+Associated+Factors+and+Life+Conditions","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(7):4120, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29387,""
"Update of the Potential Treatments for Psychiatric and Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in the Context of the Post-COVID-19 Condition: Still a Lot of Suffering and Many More Things to Learn","Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) has defined a post-COVID-19 condition. Some of these symptoms can be categorized as psychiatric long COVID-19 if they appeared in the aftermath of COVID-19, including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, somatic symptoms disorders such as hyperventilation syndrome, fatigue, cognitive and sleep disorders. Psychiatric and neuropsychiatric post-COVID-19 present mental health specialists with difficult challenges because of its complexity and the multiple ways in which it integrates into a singular somatic context. Methods: We conducted a systematic research paradigm from SARS-CoV-2 using LitCOVID and Web of Science to search management strategies and potential treatments for psychiatric post-COVID-19 symptoms. Results: Management strategies must be based on a multidisciplinary approach to promote the global evaluation of psychiatric and physical symptoms, systematic detection and prevention. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors appear to be the best choice to treat post-COVID-19 depression and anxiety disorders, and tofisopam could be helpful for anxiety. Cognitive behavioral therapy techniques adjusted to post-COVID-19 fatigue, functional remediation, extracorporeal apheresis, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation, monoclonal antibodies, flavonoids, oxytocin or L-carnitine all represent hypothetical therapeutic avenues that remain to be evaluated in clinical trials. Conclusions: Psychiatric and neuropsychiatric post-COVID-19 symptoms occur frequently and are debilitating. Attention should be paid to this condition and studies undertaken to specify the effective treatments.","Benzakour, Lamyae, Bondolfi, Guido","https://www.google.com/search?q=Update+of+the+Potential+Treatments+for+Psychiatric+and+Neuropsychiatric+Symptoms+in+the+Context+of+the+Post-COVID-19+Condition:+Still+a+Lot+of+Suffering+and+Many+More+Things+to+Learn","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Trauma Care; 2(2):131-150, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29388,""

"PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE","Hollett talks about the Perioperative Nurses Week. The theme for this year's Perioperative Nurses Week is ""Caring for others starts with caring for ourselves: The value of being valued."" Our cases have been rough. Nurses provide care to a COVID-19 positive patient who was a victim of domestic violence, care for a COVID-19 positive patient who is on long-term ECMO, and manage the steady, and never-ending, stream of patients requiring laparoscopic cholecystectomies, fixes for various fractures, and exploratory laparotomies. Improvisation was at the forefront of our case which takes extra effort and some amazing communication skills. Exposure to repetitive and traumatic cases is wearing us down over time. We are tired.

"THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS ON FINANCIAL MARKETS: A QUALITATIVE APPROACH","Just after the agreed Phase One trade deal between the US and China, the world is now experiencing a major epidemic of coronavirus infection. The Coronavirus has affected almost all sectors of life, including all sides of the economy and financial markets. It caused sharp decrease in demand and lessened the economic activity. The virus outbreak has become one of the biggest threats to the global economy and financial markets. Modern companies are very connected through economic integration and supply chain. Due to the lockdowns global companies have disruptions in supply, transportation and mainly at selling outputs. These result in decreases in net incomes and even losses at the firms. Stock prices react these procedures rapidly. But not all company stocks react the same way. Thus we separate the impact into two groups. This paper studies impact of Coronavirus on developed and emerging financial markets. Developed financial markets as US, and European markets practice turbulences in stock and bond markets. The central banks of these economies responded cutting interest rates, yet this action didnt stimulate the market continiomly. Emerging markets as China, India, Brazil, Mexico, Russia, Indonesia and Turkey suffered harder from the virus as economic inactivity through devaluation in the currencies and increasing unemployment. This paper lists the impacts of the virus on these group country financial markets in a qualitative way.

"Social Support Mediates the Association between Attachment Style and Psychological Distress during COVID-19 in Israel","Aim: The aim of this study was to examine the relationships between attachment style, social support, and psychological distress (i.e., depression and anxiety) during the COVID-19 lockdown of the third wave in Israel. Specifically, we examined whether social support mediates the well-documented relationship between attachment style and psychological distress. Methods: An online survey was administered from 3 January to 6 February, 2021, while a strict lockdown was in place. The sample included 288 Israelis ranging between the ages of 18&ndash;78, recruited by snowball sampling. Psychological distress was evaluated by Patients Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD-7);attachment style by the Experiences in Close Relationships (ECR-36), and social support by the Multi-dimensional Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). A mediation model was applied with social support mediating the association between attachment style and depression and anxiety. Results: Significant correlations were found between attachment style and psychological distress, and between social support and psychological distress. Social support partially mediated the associations between attachment style and psychological distress (Depression: p &lt; 0.001, confidence interval [CI] = 0.4018, 1.7468;Anxiety: p &lt; 0.001, confidence interval [CI] = 0.0493, 0.9822). These results remained the same while controlling for age. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the secure attachment style serves as a protective factor against psychological distress and vice versa;insecure attachment style serves as a risk factor for developing psychological distress during a peak period of COVID-19. Nevertheless, social support played a central role in the association between attachment style and psychological distress, thus, individuals with an insecure attachment may thus be helped by offering them social support during a crisis, which in turn may increase their well-being.","Adar, Tal, Davidof, May, Elkana, Odelia","https://www.google.com/search?q=Social+Support+Mediates+the+Association+between+Attachment+Style+and+Psychological+Distress+during+COVID-19+in+Israel","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Viruses; 14(4):693, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29392,""
"Health Starting Points: Continuity and Change in Physical and Mental Health before and during the Pandemic","The pandemic has created multiple changes in the lives of Americans with growing and widespread concerns about the implications for the nationâ€™s health and well-being. Most empirical examinations of the physical and mental health implications of the pandemic have rested on aggregate comparisons of pre-pandemic and pandemic indicators of health. We contribute to this body of work by considering continuity and change in health and well-being over time. We draw on respondents in a population-based sample with repeated health measures of physical health, depressive symptoms, and anxiety collected prior to the pandemic and subsequently during the pandemic. Using Sankey figures we illustrate their health pathways and as a result highlight the importance of a longitudinal lens on assessments of health.

"Therapeutic interventions for burnout syndrome in healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic: integrative reading review","OBJECTIVE: to analyze the scientific evidence available in the literature on therapeutic interventions applied to Burnout Syndrome in health professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: An integrative review was carried out between August and October 2021, in which the databases and portals PubMed, BVS, SciELO, Google Scholar and CAPES Journal Portal were consulted, resulting in eleven articles analyzed. RESULTS: The analysis of the articles included in the study showed that self-care and organizational interventions in health professionals contributed to the reduction of symptoms of Burnout Syndrome. The studies reported that the measures of therapeutic interventions that were implemented, including aromatherapy, music therapy, the application of EFT, LMX strategies, minimize the effects of factors that contribute to the increase in Burnout Syndrome in health professionals, as well as the reorganization of the working day and improvements in the work environment that favor a more positive perception of professional practice. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to the increased prevalence of Burnout Syndrome in healthcare professionals. Thus, measures such as mental health education, as well as therapeutic interventions for those already affected by the disease, are essential for professionals to maintain their physical and mental well-being.","Silva, A.

"Examining the Impact of Turkish Couples' Intimacy Levels in Romantic Relationship on Children's Anxiety During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Intimacy refers to closeness and an expressive and personal romantic relationship between couples/partners. More importantly, intimacy in romantic relationships is known to influence children's well-being and mental health. Couples who suffer from a lack of intimacy in their relationship are more vulnerable to psychophysiological disorders, depression and other non-psychiatric disorders and these disorders may have an impact on the children living with them. Under today's circumstances, little is known about the link of intimacy in romantic relationships with children's anxiety particularly within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, this study examines the relationship between intimacy in romantic and children's anxiety levels during COVID-19 disease. Participants were 12,126 Turkish couples (mean age=35.27 +/- 5.37) who completed the intimacy in romantic relationship scale and state-trait anxiety inventory for children online. Socio-demographic data form was created to measures variables such as age, gender, and the COVID-19 experiences. The results suggest that single couples were found to have a better romantic relationship than married couples. Self-disclosure, physical attraction, support, and trust were found to be related to anxiety levels of children. This pattern of results highlights the importance of intimacy in a romantic relationship on children anxiety levels in the face of adversity which have important implications for research and practice.","Gecer, E.; Tongar, H.

"SOCIO-EMOTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF EMERGENCY DISTANCE TEACHING: A MIXED-METHOD INVESTIGATION IN GREECE","Aim/Purpose The study examines the teachers' perceptions towards a set of socio-emotional characteristics of distance education (DE) in primary and secondary schools during the Covid-19 pandemic. The examined characteristics include perceived joy, stress, effort/fatigue, isolation, inclusiveness, and collaboration/interaction. Background The transition to emergency distance education had a large socio-emotional impact on teachers. Recent evidence certifies an increase in mental health issues like stress and load. Studies also recognized online teaching barriers including difficulties in communication and interaction with students. This study focuses on the examination of the socio-emotional characteristics of distance education as perceived by primary and secondary education teachers in Greece. The study also investigates differences between primary and secondary education, teaching disciplines, and the role of individual factors like gender, age, and experience. Methodology The study used a mixed-method research design with closed-ended and open-ended questions on a sample of 845 teachers of primary and secondary education in Greece. The closed-ended questionnaire consisted of 19 items of socioemotional DE characteristics, measured in a 5-point bipolar format. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)was conducted on 16 items, indicating three components: (a) effort/fatigue, (b) inclusiveness, and (c) collaboration/interactivity. A single-item scale was considered for joy, fatigue, stress, and isolation. The finalized measurement model was evaluated in terms of item loadings, reliability of measures, convergent, and discriminant validity, with the help of the SmartPLS software. Descriptive statistics and percentages were calculated with the help of SPSS software. Because of the non-normal distribution of the data, non-parametric methods of Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis were performed to examine significant differences in teacher groups. The qualitative part of the analysis was conducted on text data received from two open-ended questions, on a sample of 602 cases. The identified qualitative constructs were investigated through content thematic analysis focusing on the identification of the socio-emotional codes and references, excluding non-relevant themes and cases. Contribution The findings of the study contribute towards the deeper understanding of the teachers' psychological or emotional state during the early stage of the Covid-19 emergency DE, as well as on the role of individual and other factors like gender, age, teaching stage, and teaching subject. The results can be leveraged during or after the pandemic, to design pedagogical or psychological practices and strategies to encourage and facilitate the teachers' transition to DE. Findings A measurement model of the teachers' perceived socio-emotional characteristics towards emergency distance education was developed and validated. The model includes the components of: (a) effort/fatigue, (b) inclusiveness, (c) collaboration/interactivity, (d) isolation, (e) joy, and (f) stress. The quantitative results indicated that teachers experienced increased levels of fatigue, and perceived DE as difficult and time-consuming. Teachers of primary education reported significantly lower levels of perceived collaboration/interaction than secondary teachers. Female teachers reported significantly higher scores of both joy and stress, while the youngest age groups expressed the highest scores of joy. The teaching subject also revealed differences in fatigue. Through qualitative analysis, this study also identified several socio-emotional thematic codes revealing the teachers' difficulties in interaction and communication with students as well as a set of emotional attributes like fatigue, joy, and stress. Recommendations for Practitioners Teachers should modify their face-to-face teaching material and adjust it to online teaching principles, avoiding future load and frustration. Different approaches should be implemented in primary and secondary education and indifferent teaching disciplines. Also, teachers should be trained on DE-oriented digital skills, ICT competencies, and socio-emotional skills, e.g., by receiving psychological and socio-emotional support from experts. Strategies to decrease fatigue and stress, especially in synchronous teaching should be traced by schools and educators. Recommendations for Researchers The findings provide theoretical evidence on the teachers' socio-emotional attitude towards DE and their experiences in the first stages of the emergency remote education due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Impact on Society This research highlights the perceived DE characteristics and the barriers to online teaching during Covid-19. Schools, educators, and society should collaborate to provide awareness and opportunities for successful distance education practices. Future Research The survey is based on individual self-reported measures, and this restricts the deeper understanding of the findings. Hence, future research should extend this work by using different methods of data collection like for instance observations, course recordings, interviews, or focus groups.","Tzafilkou, K.; Perifanou, M.; Economides, A.

"Academic Procrastination As A Challenge For Students' Mental Health In The Context Of Distance Learning And The Virtual World During The Covid-19 Pandemic","The research aims to study the dynamics of academic procrastination and its impact on the mental health of students during the transition to distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was identified a declining tendency of overall rates of academic procrastination and at the same time increase in the number of carriers of mid and high levels of academic procrastination. The decline in the general rates of academic procrastination at the beginning of 2021 testifies to the adaptation processes experienced by students to the conditions of distance learning. It was documented that students' academic procrastination is accompanied by a steady negative emotional tension. During the transition to distance learning, the intensity of students' learning activity has increased, which altogether causes stress as one of the main reasons for the academic procrastination among future psychologists. The study identified a risk of academic procrastination manifestation among students for their mental health, which provides a basis for developing and testing a program to prevent the phenomenon of academic procrastination among degree-seeking students.","Stoliarchuk, O.; Khrypko, S.; Olga, D.; Ishchuk, O.; Kokhanova, O.; Sorokina, O.; Salata, K.","https://doi.org/10.22937/ijcsns.2022.22.3.36","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Computer Science and Network Security; 22(3):276-284, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29397,""
"Elderly people from old age homes have higher risk of malnutrition and depression as compared to family setup","With increase in average age of population and increasing trend of nuclear families, old age homes are fast becoming a norm in India. The COVID-19 pandemic has made nutritionists revisit the health status of our elderly living in different family set ups. The present study was carried out with the objective to compare the health and risk of malnutrition among elderly (? 60 yrs in age) living in three different residential set ups i.e. old age homes, urban family or rural family. The study was carried out in Hisar district of Haryana state in Northern India. In this cross-sectional study, sixty subjects each (N=180) from the three residential set ups were selected randomly and assessed for depression, level of independence in daily activities and risk for malnutrition. Standard scales viz. Geriatric Depression Scale, Barthel Index and Mini Nutritional Assessment Scale were used. The PAR (Physical Activity Ratio) values for activities performed in a day were aggregated over the period i.e. 24 hours to yield physical activity level. It was observed that respondents from rural family set up were more active as compared to their counterparts in urban family set up or old age homes. Osteoporosis (94.44%), joint pain (87.78%), loss of appetite (85.56%) and anemia (80.56%) were the most commonly reported problems. Per cent prevalence of most problems was higher in old age home respondents. The level of independence for most activities was lowest in old age home respondents as compared to other two residential set ups. Depression was evident in 36.67 per cent of total respondents with higher per cent prevalence in residents of old age home. It may be concluded that elderly people from old age homes have higher risk of malnutrition and depression as compared to urban or rural family setup. Interventions are highly recommended for mental and nutritional well-being of elderly specially those living in old age homes. Considering the increasing trend of old age homes, deeper studies are required on their living conditions. There should be stringent SOP's for all old age homes and elderly care.","Priti, Kumari, Sindhu, S.

Video-conferencing applications like Zoom gained popularity and have become the primary means of communication for social or work events and meetings. These applications have also in many places replaced face-to-face healthcare visits and have penetrated school-based learning. The long-term implications of this digital technology on self-esteem and body image require further study. Main Body: Video-conferencing applications have led to people being more conscious of their appearance and this has resulted in increased cases of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). There is increased focus on body appearance and cosmetic procedures to fix minor defects. Although the treatment for BDD is like depression, it requires the personalization of therapy specific to the needs of the patient. Conclusion: In this review, we aim to highlight the impact of the pandemic on body image and the longterm implications of virtual conferencing. The review also highlights available pharmacological and non pharmacological treatment approaches in the management of body dysmorphic disorder related to virtual video conferencing.","Sarangi, A.; Yadav, S.; Gude, J.; Amor, W.","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.22965","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Cureus Journal of Medical Science; 14(3):6, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29402,""

"Psychological impact of the COVID-19 on hospitalized patients: A qualitative study","Background: As the 2019 coronavirus spreads rapidly around the world, it has caused widespread fear and anxiety in various populations. This study aimed to explore the psychological effects of COVID-19 on patients with this disease. Materials and Methods: A qualitative study was conducted with a phenomenological approach. A purposive sample of 11 patients with COVID-19 was recruited. Data were collected from the beginning of March to the beginning of June 2020 using semi-structured interviews and they were analyzed according to Van Manen's method. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Initially, 315 codes were extracted. During data analysis and comparisons, the codes were reduced to 108. Ultimately, 10 categories, 38 subcategories, and 3 themes emerged. The theme of â€œbehavioral responsesâ€ including 5 categories (Remorse, Fear and despair, Death anxiety, Growth, Support), â€œdisease-caused helplessnessâ€ including two categories (Failure, Denial), and â€œdecline of social networksâ€ including three categories (Rejection, Stigma, Feeling guilty). Conclusions: After understanding the findings of this research, nurses working in the wards of patients with COVID-19 can better consider the importance of assessing and analyzing the psychological challenges and experiences of these patients during the course of illness and quarantine. Findings also enhance the identification and organization of training needs during such a pandemic and the design of nursing programs to meet them.","Ghapanvari, Fatemeh, Namdar, Peyman, Moradi, Mahnaz, Yekefallah, Leili","https://doi.org/10.4103/ijnmr.IJNMR_382_20","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Iranian Journal of Nursing and Midwifery Research; 27(2):92-98, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29404,""
"Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal Mental Health Status Prevailing among COVID-19 Patients in Mumbai, India","Introduction: The aim was to determine the prevalence and predictors of depression among less symptomatic COVID-19 patients. Methods: A questionnaire-based assessment was conducted among asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients when admitted in a COVID-19 facility (T1) and after 6 months (T2). Interviews were conducted using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 instrument. Socio-demographic details and length of facility stay were recorded. Changes in scores between the two-time points T1 and T2 were compared. Factors predicting depression were determined using Chi-square and Mannâ€“Whitney U test during facility stay, and those predicting worsening over time were obtained using multivariate regression models. Results: Among the 91.4% (n = 450) participants, prevalence of depression was 38.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 34.0â€“43.0) with a significant increase of 7.8-fold (95% CI = 4.8â€“12.8) in depression as the duration of stay increased beyond a median of 5 days. A significant association was observed between higher income and lower depression (odds ratios = 0.6, P = 0.03). 84% (n = 378) responded at the second timepoint assessment after a median of 6.62 months (T2). There was a significant difference observed between the 2.6% (n = 6) that worsened into depression at T2 and the 73.8% (n = 107) that improved out of depression at T2 (P = 0.001). Age &gt;45 years (P = 0.007), males (P = 0.011) and reinfection (P = 0.039) significantly led to worsening of depression. Conclusion: There is a need for actively detecting and managing depression in institutionally quarantined survivors, considering limiting such quarantine to no more than a week, and providing routine screening and care for depression beyond this period.","Singh, Arjun, Singhavi, Hitesh, Florida, Sharin, Lakdawala, Muffazal, Mhatre, Sharayu, Deodhar, Jayita, Chaturvedi, Pankaj, Dikshit, Rajesh","https://doi.org/10.4103/ijcm.ijcm_928_21","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Indian Journal of Community Medicine; 47(1):55-60, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29405,""
"Effects of the COVID-19 epidemic on sleep quality in college students","Objective: To investigate sleep quality and related factors in college students during the COVID-19 epidemic. Methods: Two cross-sectional studies included 1696 participants prior to the COVID-19 epidemic and 811 participants during the epidemic. Propensity score matching me1hod was used to match the two samples with ratio of 1: 1 Totally 711 participants were included in each group. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scale, Connor-David-son resilience scale, 9-item Patient Heal1h Questionnaire and 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale were used to evaluate the sleep quality and related mental health factors prior to and during the epidemic. Results: Sleep quality was poorer during the COVID-19 epidemic (9.3% ) than prior the epidemic (14. 9 % ). Logistic regression analysis showed that exposure to COVID-19, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and psychological resilience were related to sleep quality among college students. Conclusion: Sleep quality in college students during 1he COVID-19 epidemic is worse than that prior to the epidemic. Depressive and anxiety symptoms and psychological resilience are related to sleep quality.

"Analysing the Impacts of Financial Expenditure of Prefectures on Methods of Suicide Completion in Japan","Recently, several studies reported that the governmental financial expenditures play important roles in the prevention of increasing suicide mortalities;however, the specific regional policies, designed dependent on regional cultural, economic, education and welfare backgrounds, affect suicide mortality by a specific suicidal means. Therefore, the present study determined the impacts of the regional governmental expenditure of six major divisions, â€œpublic healthâ€, â€œpublic worksâ€, â€œpoliceâ€, â€œambulance/fire servicesâ€, â€œwelfareâ€ and â€œeducationâ€ on suicide mortalities by five major suicidal means, â€œhangingâ€, â€œpoisoningâ€, â€œcharcoal burningâ€, â€œjumpingâ€ and â€œthrowingâ€, across the 47 prefectures in Japan during 2009â€“2018 using fixed-effect analysis of hierarchal linear regression with robust standard error. The expenditures of â€œambulance/fire servicesâ€ and â€œeducationâ€ indicated the negative relation to suicide mortalities by wide-spectrum suicidal means, whereas expenditures of â€œpublic worksâ€ did not affect suicide mortalities. In the education subdivisions, expenditure of â€œkindergartenâ€ and â€œelementary schoolâ€ indicated the impacts of reduction of suicide mortalities, whereas the expenditures of â€œspecial schoolâ€ for individuals with disabilities unexpectedly contribute to increasing suicide mortalities by poisoning, charcoal burning and throwing of females. Regarding subdivisions of welfare, expenditure of â€œchild welfareâ€ and â€œsocial welfareâ€ contributed to a reduction in suicide mortalities, but expenditure of â€œelderly welfareâ€ surprisingly contributed to increasing suicide mortalities. Furthermore, expenditures of welfare subdivision abolished the negative impacts of the expenditures of educational subdivisions, kindergarten and elementary school, but the positive impact of expenditure of special school on female suicide mortalities was not affected. These results suggest that most Japanese people are struggling to care for children even in the situation of an increasing elderly population with a decreasing birthrate. Therefore, it is important to enhance the investment welfare policy for the future to improve the childcare environment. The results demonstrated by this study suggest that the scientifically evidence-based redistributions of welfare expenditure in regional government, at least partially, provide improvement of Japanese society and welfare systems, under the continuous severe Japanese social concerns associated with increasing elderly population with a decreasing birthrate.","Kashimoto, Kanae, Okada, Motohiro","https://doi.org/10.3390/psychiatryint3010001","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatry International; 3(1):1, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29407,""
"A Multi-Center Study for the Development of the Taiwan Cognition Questionnaire (TCQ) in Major Depressive Disorder","Cognitive dysfunction is associated with functional impairment of patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The goals were to explore the associated factors of cognitive impairment in MDD and to develop and validate a brief and culture-relevant questionnaire, the Taiwan Cognition Questionnaire (TCQ), among patients with MDD. This was a cross-sectional, multi-center observational study of MDD patients in Taiwan. Participants of Group 1 from 10 centers contributed to the validation of the TCQ by their response and sociodemographics. The participants of Group 2 from one center received an objective cognitive assessment for clarification of the relationship between the TCQ score and its associated factors. In Group 1, 493 participants were recruited. As for Group 2, an extra 100 participants were recruited. The global Cronbachâ€™s alpha for the TCQ was 0.908. According to the coordinates of the ROC curve, 9/10 was the ideal cut-off point. With the criteria, the sensitivity/specificity of the TCQ was 0.610/0.689. The TCQ score was positively associated with a history of being admitted to acute psychiatric care and the severity of depression and negatively associated with objective cognitive measures. The TCQ provides a reliable, valid, and convenient measure of subjective cognitive dysfunction in patients with MDD.","Yung-Chieh, Yen, Nan-Ying, Chiu, Hwang, Tzung-Jeng, Tung-Ping, Su, Yen-Kuang, Yang, Cheng-Sheng, Chen, Cheng-Ta, Li, Kuan-Pin, Su, Te-Jen, Lai, Chang, Chia-Ming","https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm12030359","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Personalized Medicine; 12(3):359, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29408,""
"Headache in the Workplace: Analysis of Factors Influencing Headaches in Terms of Productivity and Health","Headache is a very common condition that can have a significant impact on work. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of headaches and their impact on a sample of 1076 workers from 18 small companies operating in different sectors. The workers who volunteered to participate were asked to fill in the Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT-6) and answer questions designed to assess stressful and traumatic factors potentially associated with headaches. The volunteers subsequently underwent a medical examination and tests for diagnosing metabolic syndrome. Out of the 1044 workers who completed the questionnaire (participation rate = 97%), 509 (48.8%) reported suffering from headaches. In a multivariate logistic regression model, female gender, recent bereavement, intrusive leadership, and sleep problems were significantly associated with headaches. In univariate logistic regression models, headache intensity was associated with an increased risk of anxiety (OR 1.10;CI95% 1.09;1.12) and depression (OR 1.09;CI95% 1.08;1.11). Headache impact was also associated with the risk of metabolic syndrome (OR 1.02;CI95% 1.00, 1.04), obesity (OR 1.02, CI95% 1.01;1.03), and reduced HDL cholesterol (OR 1.03;CI95% 1.01;1.04). The impact of headache calls for intervention in the workplace not only to promote a prompt diagnosis of the different forms of headaches but also to improve work organization, leadership style, and the quality of sleep.","Magnavita, Nicola","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19063712","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(6):3712, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29409,""
"Social Capital as a Mediator and Moderator in the Association between Loneliness and Health, Israel as a Case Study","Loneliness has been associated with poor health. Social capital (SC) could possibly prevent the ill effects of loneliness. The study aims to assess the association of loneliness with physical and mental health in four different communities in Israel and study the impact of structural and cognitive SC on that association. A cross-sectional face-to-face survey with 4620 adults in four towns was conducted. The questionnaire included self-rated health (SRH), mental health (MH), loneliness, cognitive and structural SC and socioeconomic characteristics. Logistic regression analysis and mediation and moderation effects were calculated. Loneliness was associated with worse SRH (OR = 0.4â€“0.5) and worse MH (OR = 2.0â€“10). Both SC variables were associated with health. However, towns differ in these associations. Structural SC serves as a significant mediator between loneliness and SRH in all towns and is a mediator between loneliness and MH in two towns. Cognitive social capital was a moderator between loneliness and MH in two towns. This study suggests that increasing SC could possibly compensate for loneliness and buffer its effect on health. The study reinforces the need for the performance of separate health profiles to assess possible interventions for each community, as not always can we generalize these results to all communities.","Baron-Epel, Orna, Elran-Barak, Roni, Donchin, Milka","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19063698","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(6):3698, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29410,""
"How Are Non-Medical Settlement Service Organizations Supporting Access to Healthcare and Mental Health Services for Immigrants: A Scoping Review","Following resettlement in high-income countries, many immigrants and refugees experience barriers to accessing primary healthcare. Local non-medical settlement organizations, such as the Local Immigration Partnerships in Canada, that support immigrant integration, may also support access to mental health and healthcare services for immigrant populations. This scoping review aims to identify and map the types and characteristics of approaches and interventions that immigrant settlement organizations undertake to support access to primary healthcare for clients. We systematically searched MEDLINE, Social Services s, CINAHL, and PsycInfo databases from 1 May 2013 to 31 May 2021 and mapped research findings using the Social-Ecological Model. The search identified 3299 citations;10 studies met all inclusion criteria. Results suggest these organizations support access to primary healthcare services, often at the individual, relationship and community level, by collaborating with health sector partners in the community, connecting clients to health services and service providers, advocating for immigrant health, providing educational programming, and initiating community development/mobilization and advocacy activities. Further research is needed to better understand the impact of local non-medical immigrant settlement organizations involved in health care planning and service delivery on reducing barriers to access in order for primary care services to reach marginalized, high-need immigrant populations.","Ratnayake, Ayesha, Sayfi, Shahab, Veronis, Luisa, Torres, Sara, Baek, Sihyun, Pottie, Kevin","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19063616","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(6):3616, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29411,""
"Sickness Presenteeism in Prison Officers: Risk Factors and Implications for Wellbeing and Productivity","Sickness presenteeism involves employees continuing to work while unwell. As presenteeism is influenced by contextual and individual difference factors, it is important to assess its prevalence and implications for wellbeing and productivity in different occupational groups. This study examines these issues in a sample of prison officers working in UK institutions. Data were obtained from a survey of 1956 prison officers. Measures assessed the prevalence of and reasons for presenteeism and the perceived impact on job performance, along with mental health and perceptions of workplace safety climate. More than nine respondents out of ten (92%) reported working while unwell at least sometimes, with 43% reporting that they always did so. Presenteeism frequency was significantly related to mental health symptoms, impaired job performance and a poorer workplace safety climate. The reasons provided for presenteeism explained 31% of the variance in self-reported mental health, 34% in job performance and 17% in workplace safety climate, but the pattern of predictors varied according to the outcome. The findings can be used to inform interventions at the organisational and individual levels to encourage a â€˜healthierâ€™ approach to sickness absence, with likely benefits for staff wellbeing, job performance and workplace safety climate.","Kinman, Gail, Clements, Andrew J.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19063389","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(6):3389, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29412,""
"A Single-Case Design Investigation for Measuring the Efficacy of Gestalt Therapy to Treat Depression in Older Adults with Dementia in Italy and in Mexico: A Research Protocol","Psychotherapy is one of the evidence-based clinical interventions for the treatment of depression in older adults with dementia. Randomised controlled trials are often the first methodological choice to gain evidence, yet they are not applicable to a wide range of humanistic psychotherapies. Amongst all, the efficacy of the Gestalt therapy (GT) is under-investigated. The purpose of this paper is to present a research protocol, aiming to assess the effects of a GT-based intervention on people with dementia (PWD) and indirect influence on their family carers. The study implements the single-case experimental design with time series analysis that will be carried out in Italy and Mexico. Six people in each country, who received a diagnosis of dementia and present depressive symptoms, will be recruited. Eight or more GT sessions will be provided, whose fidelity will be assessed by the GT fidelity scale. Quantitative outcome measures are foreseen for monitoring participantsâ€™ depression, anxiety, quality of life, loneliness, carersâ€™ burden, and the caregiving dyad mutuality at baseline and follow-up. The advantages and limitations of the research design are considered. If GT will effectively result in the treatment of depression in PWD, it could enrich the range of evidence-based interventions provided by healthcare services.","Merizzi, Alessandra, Biasi, Rosanna, Ãlvarez Zamudio, JosÃ© Fernando, Margherita Spagnuolo, Lobb, Mirko Di, Rosa, Santini, Sara","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19063260","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(6):3260, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29413,""

Participants, aged 18â€“25 years (21.07 Â± 1.53), completed a web-based survey in which they were asked to retrospectively self-report on ACEs while answering questions on health risk behaviours (e.g., smoking, substance use, riding a car with a drunk driver) and psychological well-being. Only 8.7% of the study sample experienced no ACEs, and almost half of the sample (48.9%) experienced =4 ACEs. Findings from adjusted models showed that, compared with students with no ACEs, those who experienced =4 ACEs had higher odds of lifetime illicit drug use (AOR = 2.73, p &lt; 0.05), riding with a drunk driver (AOR = 2.44, p &lt; 0.05), suicidal ideation before age 18 (AOR = 28.49, p &lt; 0.01) and in the past 12 months (AOR = 5.39, p &lt; 0.01). An increased number of ACEs was also associated with lower psychological well-being (B = -3.94, p &lt; 0.001). Findings from this study have implications for mental health professionals as well as university administrators, as students with a higher number of traumatic experiences may require greater levels of support and services.","Laurinaityte, Ilona, Assini-Meytin, Luciana C.; Cunichina, Ksenija","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19063253","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(6):3253, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29414,""
"Effects of Animal-Assisted Therapy (AAT) in Alzheimerâ€™s Disease: A Case Study","Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by cortical dementia and irreversibly progressive developments leading to a vegetative state and, finally, to death. Although many aspects of its etiology, diagnosis and treatment still remain obscure and the current approach to the disease mostly suffers from limited and low-efficiency therapeutic means, nevertheless, recent interventions have aimed at improving patientsâ€™ quality of life through nonpharmacological approaches, including animal-assisted therapy (AAT), arousing growing interest. In order to assess the physiological and neuropsychological effects of AAT on AD, 24 residents of a rest house in northern Italy were enrolled. The intervention consisted of one 45-minute AAT session per week over ten weeks. Twelve residents (six AD and six non-AD) received AAT and twelve (six AD and six non-AD) were controls. In order to evaluate the physiological and clinical effect of AAT on AD residents, three cardiac parameters, including the systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate, were measured. Moreover, the neurocognitive and depressive states were assessed by the Mini Mental State Examination and the Geriatric Depression Scale, respectively. Analyses were performed by a four-way ANOVA model (including two ways for repeated measures) considering each main effect and interaction possible in the design. Our findings, despite the small sample size, suggest that AAT has a positive significant effect on physiological parameters and neurocognitive impairment, while no effect was observed on the depression level.","Gregorini, Armando, Angela Di, Canio, Palmucci, Emanuele, Tomasetti, Marco, Rocchi, Marco B.

"Rapid On-Site Detection of Illicit Drugs in Smuggled Samples with a Portable Electrochemical Device","The smuggling of illicit drugs urges the development of new tools for rapid on-site identification in cargos. Current methods rely on presumptive color tests and portable spectroscopic techniques. However, these methods sometimes exhibit inaccurate results due to commonly used cutting agents, the colorful nature of the sample or because the drugs are smuggled in common goods. Interestingly, electrochemical sensors can deal with these specific problems. Herein, an electrochemical device is presented that uses affordable screen-printed electrodes for the electrochemical profiling of several illicit drugs by square-wave voltammetry (SWV). The identification of the illicit compound is based on the oxidation potential of the analyte. Hence, a library of electrochemical profiles is built upon the analysis of illicit drugs and common cutting agents. This library allows the design of a tailor-made script that enables the identification of each drug through a user-friendly interface (laptop or mobile phone). Importantly, the electrochemical test is compared by analyzing 48 confiscated samples with other portable devices based on Raman and FTIR spectroscopy as well as a laboratory standard method (i.e., gas chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry). Overall, the electrochemical results, obtained through the analysis of different samples from confiscated cargos at an end-user site, present a promising alternative to current methods, offering low-cost and rapid testing in the field.","Parrilla, Marc, Slosse, Amorn, Robin Van, Echelpoel, Noelia Felipe, Montiel, Langley, Amelia R.; Filip Van, Durme, De Wael, Karolien","https://doi.org/10.3390/chemosensors10030108","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Chemosensors; 10(3):108, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29416,""

"Thermo-Energy Performance of Lightweight Steel Framed Constructions: A Case Study","The building sector continues to play an essential role in reducing worldwide energy consumption. The reduced consumption is accompanied by stricter regulation for the thermotechnical design of the building envelope. The redefined nearly Zero Energy Building levels that will come into force for each member state will pressure designers to rethink the constructive details so that mandatory levels can be reached, without increasing the construction costs over an optimum level but at the same time reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The paper aims to illustrate the main conclusions obtained in assessing the thermo-energy performance of a steel-framed building representing a holistically designed modular laboratory located in a moderate continental temperate climate, characteristic of the south-eastern part of the Pannonian Depression with some sub-Mediterranean influences. An extensive numerical simulation of the main junctions was performed. The thermal performance was established in terms of the main parameters, the adjusted thermal resistances and global thermal insulation coefficient. Further on, the energy consumption for heating was established, and the associated energy rating was in compliance with the Romanian regulations. A parametric study was done to illustrate the energy performance of the investigated case in the five representative climatic zones from Romania. An important conclusion of the research indicates that an emphasis must be placed on the thermotechnical design of Light Steel Framed solutions against increased thermal bridge areas caused by the steelâ€™s high thermal conductivity for all building components to reach nZEB levels. Nevertheless, the results indicate an exemplary behaviour compared to classical solutions, but at the same time, the need for an iterative redesign so that all thermo-energy performance indicators are achieved.","Moga, Ligia, Petran, Ioan, Santos, Paulo, Ungureanu, Viorel","https://doi.org/10.3390/buildings12030321","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Buildings; 12(3):321, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29418,""
"One Year after the Flood: Prevalence and Correlates of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder among Residents in Fort McMurray","Background: The 2020 Fort McMurray (FMM) and area flood caused more than $228 million in insured damage, affected over 1200 structures, and more than 13,000 people were evacuated. Objective: This study sought to determine the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-like symptoms and the risk predictors among the population of FMM one year after the 2020 flooding. Methods: An online quantitative cross-sectional survey was distributed to residents of FMM via REDCap between 24 April to 2 June 2021 to collect sociodemographic, clinical, and flood-related information. The PTSD checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-C) was used to assess likely PTSD among respondents. Results: 186 of 249 respondents completed all essential self-assessment questionnaires in the analysis, yielding a response rate of 74.7%. The prevalence of likely PTSD was 39.6% (65). Respondents with a history of depression were more likely to develop PTSD symptoms (OR = 5.71;95% CI: 1.68â€“19.36). Similarly, responders with limited and no family support after the disaster were more prone to report PTSD symptoms ((OR = 2.87;95% CI: 1.02â€“8.05) and (OR = 2.87;95% CI: 1.06â€“7.74), respectively). Conclusions: Our research indicated that history of depression and the need for mental health counseling significantly increased the risk of developing PTSD symptoms following flooding;family support is protective. Further studies are needed to explore the relations between the need to receive counseling and presenting with likely PTSD symptoms.","Mao, Wanying, Eboreime, Ejemai, Shalaby, Reham, Nkire, Nnamdi, Agyapong, Belinda, Pazderka, Hannah, Obuobi-Donkor, Gloria, Medard, Adu, Owusu, Ernest, Oluwasina, Folajinmi, Zhang, Yanbo, Agyapong, Vincent I.

"Physical Exercise Ameliorates Anxiety, Depression and Sleep Quality in College Students: Experimental Evidence from Exercise Intensity and Frequency","Background: The main purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of exercise intensity and exercise frequency on anxiety, depression and sleep quality in college students. Methods: All participants came from a university in northeastern China. All participants were tested for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and were diagnosed with anxiety disorders. The research subjects were divided into six groups, namely the low-intensity and low-frequency group (group 1), low-intensity and moderate-frequency group (group 2), low-intensity and high-frequency group (group 3), high-intensity and low-frequency group (group 4), and high-intensity and moderate-frequency group (group 5) and high-intensity and high-frequency group (group 6). The duration of each physical exercise for each group was 1 h. Participantsâ€™ exercise intensity was monitored using Polar H10 HR sensors and the Borg RPE scale. The experiment was carried out for a total of 6 weeks. The researchers conducted pre- and post-test scores on the subjectsâ€™ anxiety, depression and sleep quality through questionnaires. Results: Exercise intensity improved anxiety and decreased symptoms of depression better than exercise frequency;sleep quality was more closely related to exercise intensity. Conclusion: Exercise intensity and exercise frequency have different effects on anxiety, depression and sleep quality improvement, indicating that exercise intensity and exercise frequency have different effects on anxiety, depression and sleep quality of college students.","Ji, Chaoxin, Yang, Jun, Lin, Lin, Chen, Song","https://doi.org/10.3390/bs12030061","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Behavioral Sciences; 12(3):61, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29420,""
"Alcohol Use and Prefrontal Cortex Volume Trajectories in Young Adults with Mood Disorders and Associated Clinical Outcomes","(1) Background: Alcohol use in the course of mood disorders is associated with worse clinical outcomes. The mechanisms by which alcohol use alters the course of illness are unclear but may relate to prefrontal cortical (PFC) sensitivity to alcohol. We investigated associations between alcohol use and PFC structural trajectories in young adults with a mood disorder compared to typically developing peers. (2) Methods: 41 young adults (24 with a mood disorder, agemean = 21 Â± 2 years) completed clinical evaluations, assessment of alcohol use, and two structural MRI scans approximately one year apart. Freesurfer was used to segment PFC regions of interest (ROIs) (anterior cingulate, orbitofrontal cortex, and frontal pole). Effects of group, alcohol use, time, and interactions among these variables on PFC ROIs at baseline and follow-up were modeled. Associations were examined between alcohol use and longitudinal changes in PFC ROIs with prospective mood. (3) Results: Greater alcohol use was prospectively associated with decreased frontal pole volume in participants with a mood disorder, but not typically developing comparison participants (time-by-group-by-alcohol interaction;p = 0.007);however, this interaction became a statistical trend in a sensitivity analysis excluding one outlier in terms of alcohol use. Greater alcohol use and a decrease in frontal pole volume related to longer duration of major depression during follow-up (pâ€™s &lt; 0.05). (4) Conclusion: Preliminary findings support more research on alcohol use, PFC trajectories, and depression recurrence in young adults with a mood disorder including individuals with heavier drinking patterns.","Kirsch, Dylan E.; Tretyak, Valeria, Le, Vanessa, Huffman, Ansley, Fromme, Kim, Strakowski, Stephen M.; Lippard, Elizabeth T.

"The impact of the COVID-19 vaccine distribution on mental health outcomes","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a ""second pandemic"" of anxiety and depression. While vaccines are primarily aimed at reducing COVID-19 transmission and mortality risks, they may have important secondary benefits. We use data from U.S. Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey merged to state-level COVID-19 vaccination eligibility data to estimate the secondary benefits of COVID-19 vaccination on mental health outcomes. To address endogenous COVID-19 vaccination, we leverage state-level variation in the timing of when age groups are eligible for vaccination. We estimate that COVID-19 vaccination reduces anxiety and depression symptoms by nearly 30%. Nearly all the benefits are private benefits, and we find little evidence of spillover effects, that is, increases in community vaccination rates are not associated with improved anxiety or depression symptoms among the unvaccinated. We find that COVID-19 vaccination is associated with larger reductions in anxiety or depression symptoms among individuals with lower education levels, who rent their housing, who are not able to telework, and who have children in their household. The economic benefit of reductions in anxiety and depression are approximately $350 billion. Our results highlight an important, but understudied, secondary benefit of COVID-19 vaccinations.","Agrawal, V.; Cantor, J. H.; Sood, N.; Whaley, C.

"Shedding light on biological sex differences and microbiotaâ€“gutâ€“brain axis: a comprehensive review of its roles in neuropsychiatric disorders","Women and men are suggested to have differences in vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), schizophrenia, eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa, and bulimia nervosa, neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimerâ€™s disease, Parkinsonâ€™s disease. Genetic factors and sex hormones are apparently the main mediators of these differences. Recent evidence uncovers that reciprocal interactions between sex-related features (e.g., sex hormones and sex differences in the brain) and gut microbiota could play a role in the development of neuropsychiatric disorders via influencing the gutâ€“brain axis. It is increasingly evident that sexâ€“microbiotaâ€“brain interactions take part in the occurrence of neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Accordingly, integrating the existing evidence might help to enlighten the fundamental roles of these interactions in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders. In addition, an increased understanding of the biological sex differences on the microbiotaâ€“brain may lead to advances in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders and increase the potential for precision medicine. This review discusses the effects of sex differences on the brain and gut microbiota and the putative underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, we discuss the consequences of interactions between sex differences and gut microbiota on the emergence of particular neuropsychiatric disorders.","Shobeiri, Parnian, Kalantari, Amirali, Teixeira, AntÃ´nio L.; Rezaei, Nima","https://doi.org/10.1186/S13293-022-00422-6","","Database: BioMed Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Biology of Sex Differences; 13(1):12-12, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29424,""
"Sex-specific associations of fat mass and muscle mass with cardiovascular disease risk factors in adults with type 2 diabetes living with overweight and obesity: secondary analysis of the Look AHEAD trial","Background Distinguishable sex differences exist in fat mass and muscle mass. High fat mass and low muscle mass are independently associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in people living with type 2 diabetes;however, it is unknown if the association between fat mass and CVD risk is modified by muscle mass, or vice versa. This study examined the sex-specific interplay between fat mass and muscle mass on CVD risk factors in adults with type 2 diabetes living with overweight and obesity. Methods Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measures were used to compute fat mass index (FMI) and appendicular muscle mass index (ASMI), and participants were separated into high-fat mass vs. low-fat mass and high-muscle mass vs. low-muscle mass. A two-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA: high-FMI vs. low-FMI by high-ASMI vs. low-ASMI) was performed on CVD risk factors (i.e., hemoglobin A1C [A1C];high-density lipoprotein cholesterol;low-density lipoprotein cholesterol;triglycerides;systolic and diastolic blood pressure;cardiorespiratory fitness, depression and health related-quality of life [HR-QoL]) at baseline and following a 1-year intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) for females and males separately, with a primary focus on the fat mass by muscle mass interaction effects. Results Data from 1,369 participants (62.7% females) who completed baseline DXA were analyzed. In females, there was a fat mass by muscle mass interaction effect on A1C (p = 0.016) at baseline. Post-hoc analysis showed that, in the low-FMI group, A1C was significantly higher in low-ASMI when compared to high-ASMI (60.3 +/- 14.1 vs. 55.5 +/- 13.5 mmol/mol, p = 0.023). In the high-FMI group, there was no difference between high-ASMI and low-ASMI (56.4 +/- 12.5 vs. 56.5 +/- 12.8 mmol/mol, p = 0.610). In males, only high-FMI was associated with higher A1C when compared to low-FMI (57.1 +/- 14.4 vs. 54.2 +/- 12.0 mmol/mol, p = 0.008) at baseline. Following ILI, there were significant fat mass by muscle mass interaction effects on changes in the mental component of HR-QoL in males. Conclusion Considering that A1C predicts future CVD, strategies to lower A1C may be especially important in females with low fat and low muscle mass living with type 2 diabetes. Our results highlight the complicated and sex-specific contribution of fat mass and muscle mass to CVD risk factors.","Terada, T.; Reed, J. L.; Vidal-Almela, S.; Mistura, M.; Kamiya, K.; Way, K.

"Using evaluative frameworks to examine the implementation outcomes of a cognitive behavioral therapy program for autistic students with anxiety within public school settings","Cognitive behavioral therapy for youth with autism spectrum disorder and anxiety is effective, but disparities exist in accessing these programs. Training school providers to deliver cognitive behavioral therapy may help to address these disparities. However, little is known about how cognitive behavioral therapy programs are implemented by interdisciplinary school providers and the broader impact of these programs. This study aimed to address this gap and was part of a larger trial that examined the effectiveness of Facing Your Fearsâ€“School-Based across 25 public schools. Study aims were to understand the impact of Facing Your Fearsâ€“School-Based and factors that impacted implementation. Thirty providers participated in exit interviews guided by the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance framework. Primary themes included (1) the fit of Facing Your Fearsâ€“School-Based for diverse students;(2) the effects of Facing Your Fearsâ€“School-Based on studentsâ€™ school participation;and (3) planned Facing Your Fearsâ€“School-Based maintenance. Participants also highlighted the programâ€™s accessibility for non-mental health providers and reported adapting Facing Your Fearsâ€“School-Based in response to student needs. Results suggest that Facing Your Fearsâ€“School-Based may have a broader impact on students and highlight the importance of task sharing to overcome mental health staff shortages within public schools. Programs that can be implemented flexibly are also critical given variability in school structures and student needs. Lay : Cognitive behavioral therapy helps to treat anxiety symptoms in autistic youth, but it is difficult for families to access cognitive behavioral therapy in the community. Training school providers to deliver cognitive behavioral therapy may help autistic youth and their families to access these programs. Unfortunately, we do not know how cognitive behavioral therapy programs can be delivered by school providers and how these programs help the autistic students who access them. This study addressed this gap and was part of a larger study that looked at the effectiveness of Facing Your Fearsâ€“School-Based in 25 public schools. The study goals were to understand whether Facing Your Fearsâ€“School-Based helped students and the factors that made it easy or difficult to deliver Facing Your Fearsâ€“School-Based in schools. Thirty providers participated in interviews guided by the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance framework. Participants shared information that fell into several major categories that included (1) delivering Facing Your Fearsâ€“School-Based to many different students;(2) the positive impact of Facing Your Fearsâ€“School-Based on studentsâ€™ school participation;and (3) plans to continue using Facing Your Fearsâ€“School-Based. School providers also shared that Facing Your Fearsâ€“School-Based was easy to use for non-mental health providers and reported adapting Facing Your Fearsâ€“School-Based to meet student needs. The results of this study suggest that Facing Your Fearsâ€“School-Based may help autistic students and highlight the importance of using mental health programs in schools that are flexible, able to be adapted, and that are able to be used by many different types of school providers.","Pickard, K.; Meyer, A.; Reyes, N.; Tanda, T.; Reaven, J.","https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613211065797","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Autism; 26(3):640-653, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29426,""

"The impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of adolescent athletes;a multi-year evaluation of over 10 000 athletes","Purpose: The changes in mental health associated with COVID-19 restrictions among youth athletes remain unknown. The purpose of this study was to define the impacts of sport cancelation and reinitiation on the mental health of adolescent athletes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Wisconsin adolescent athletes completed surveys including age, sex, sports played, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item (PHQ-9) in May 2020 following COVID-19 related sport cancelations (Spring20, n = 3243) and after the reinitiation of sports in May 2021 (Spring21, n= 1906). Data from Spring21 were compared to Spring20 and historical data from prior to the pandemic (PreCOVID = 5231). Results: A total of 10,380 participants were included (16.2 Â± 1.2 years, 49% female). After adjusting for age and sex within propensity score weighted ANOVA models, PHQ-9 total scores (mean [95%CI]) were significantly lower (better) in Spring21 than Spring20, but remained higher (worse) than before COVID (PreCOVID = 2.0 [1.8, 2.2], Spring20 5 7.0 [6.8, 7.2], Spring2155.0 [4.8, 7.2], p&lt;0.001). Similarly, age and sex-adjusted ordinal regression models found that the prevalence of moderate to severe depression was lower in Spring21 than Spring20, but higher than PreCOVID-19 (PreCOVID-19 5 5.3%, Spring20 5 37.8%, Spring21 = 22.8%, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Compared to historical values, adolescent athletes reported markedly higher levels of depression in the early COVID-19 pandemic during the widespread cancelation of sports. In 2021, resumption of sport participation was associated with significant improvements in depression. Nonetheless, depression symptoms remained higher in 2021 than historical levels prior to COVID among Wisconsin adolescent athletes.","Watson, A.; Biese, K.; Haraldsdottir, K.; Reardon, C.; McGuine, T.","https://doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000001016","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine; 32(2):165-166, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29430,""
"Use of a self-guided mindfulness mobile application to improve pain outcomes in individuals with knee osteoarthritis","Purpose: The relationship between osteoarthritis (OA) and mental health is well-proven. Mindfulness, or purposeful awareness of one's senses without interpretation or judgment, is useful in treating chronic pain. This study explored the impact of mindfulness, taught viamobile app, on pain due to KneeOA. Methods: Multi-center, single-blind, randomized trial compared use of a mindfulness app (Headspace) with placebo app (Daily Water) in adults with symptomatic, X-ray-confirmed kneeOA. All were given standardized OA education and home exercises and instructed to use the app 10 minutes/day, 5 days/ week, for 12 weeks. KOOS and SF-12 surveys were completed at 0 and 12 weeks. Users reported exercise & app use. Results: In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, 70 participants were enrolled, with none excluded for treatment nonadherence. However, 21 did not complete follow-up questionnaires and could not be included in data analysis. Dropout was comparable (13/37 intervention vs. 8/33 control, p=0.321) with no demographic disparity. Forty-nine (24 intervention vs. 25 control) provided week 12 outcome data. Adequate (50 min/week) app use was noted in 14 (58.3%) in the intervention group and 16 (64%) among controls. Changes over time were assessed within each group with paired t-tests and compared between the groups using t-tests for independent samples. Although there was a tendency for KOOS scores to increase by a greater amount in the intervention group than in the control, these changes were not statistically significant between groups. SF-12 Mental and Physical Health scores did not change significantly in either group and no significant difference was observed between groups for these scores. Conclusions: This study was limited by small sample size due recruitment difficulties during the COVID pandemic. There were no statistically significant differences across groups;however, the treatment group saw a statistically significant, minimally clinically important difference in 4 of 5 KOOS subscores over the study period. Larger studies may better evaluate this trend towards benefit. Lastly, adherence to regular use of an app may prove challenging. Significance: This study provided initial pilot data evaluating the use of a mindfulness app as an adjunct treatment for symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. Results support further study with larger sample sizes to better characterize its impact.","Sylvester, J.; Knobloch, A.; Hess, M.","https://doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000001015","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine; 32(2):224, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29431,""
"Retirement from collegiate athletics: Presence and characterization of mental health programming","Purpose: Proactive mental health care has the potential to offer protection to college athletes who face an increased risk for depression at the end of their athletic careers. This study assesses existing and ideal mental health programming to prepare college athletes for retirement from competitive sport. Methods:A 20-question survey was designed to assess three domains: 1) the presence of proactive mental health programming addressing retirement in collegiate athletes 2) features of existing programming 3) features of ideal programming. The survey was administered over the AMSSM electronic mailing list. Responses were collected anonymously between October 2021and December 2021 with Qualtrics software. Results: 108 collegiate sports medicine professionals took part in the survey. 53% belonged to athletic programs with mental health programming to prepare students for retirement from collegiate athletics. Existing programming was mostly: required (53%) and delivered by behavioral health specialists (53%) the 1st semester senior year (21%) with 70% delivered multiple semesters. Prior to COVID-19, programming was mostly in-person seminars (24%) and small group meetings (22%) and is now mostly virtual seminars (20%). Sports medicine professionals indicated their ideal programming would be required (78%) in individual or small groups and delivered by a behavioral health specialist (50%) the 1st semester senior year (22%) and in additional semesters (59%). Themes from the goals of ideal programming include: insight into potential mental health concerns, awareness of resources, normalization of transition difficulties, selfcompassion and finding purpose outside of athletics. Conclusions: Collegiate sports medicine professionals are concerned about athletes as they retire from competitive sport, yet only around half of athletic programs prepare athletes for this transition. Wider adoption of similar programming is needed. Promisingly, characteristics of existing and ideal programming is similar with many shared goals, offering guidance in the design and delivery of proactive mental health care.","Duckworth, C.; Statuta, S.; Freeman, J.","https://doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0000000000001014","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine; 32(2):171, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29432,""
"Communicating With Breast Imaging Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Impact on Patient Care and Physician Wellness","Objective Assess the impact of COVID-19 on patient-breast radiologist interactions and evaluate the relationship between safety measure-constrained communication and physician wellbeing. Methods A 41-question survey on the perceived effect of COVID-19 on patient care was distributed from June 2020 to September 2020 to members of the Society of Breast Imaging and the National Consortium of Breast Centers. Non-radiologists and international members were excluded. Anxiety and psychological distress scores were calculated. A multivariable logistic model was used to identify demographic and mental health factors associated with responses. Results Five hundred twenty-five surveys met inclusion criteria (23% response rate). Diminished ability to fulfill patients' emotional needs was reported by 46% (221/479), a response associated with younger age (OR, 0.8 per decade;P &lt; 0.01), higher anxiety (OR, 2.3;P &lt; 0.01), and higher psychological distress (OR, 2.2;P = 0.04). Personal protective equipment made patient communication more difficult for 88% (422/478), a response associated with younger age (OR, 0.8 per decade;P = 0.008), female gender (OR, 1.9;P &lt; 0.01), and greater anxiety (OR, 2.6;P = 0.001). The inability to provide the same level of care as prior to COVID-19 was reported by 37% (177/481) and was associated with greater anxiety (OR, 3.4;P &lt; 0.001) and psychological distress (OR, 1.7;P = 0.03). Conclusion The majority of breast radiologists reported that COVID-19 has had a negative impact on patient care.

"Online therapy in a shared reality: The novel coronavirus as a test case","When the novel coronavirus began to spread, many countries mandated lockdowns, quarantines, and social distancing, posing a threat to both clients and therapists and perhaps representing a ""shared traumatic reality"" (STR). Simultaneously, many mental health professionals moved to ""online therapy,"" a mode that might increase the sense of having a shared reality. This study aimed to examine the extent to which therapists consider the pandemic an STR and the associations among helping professionals' sociodemographic and professional profiles, their perceptions of STR, their attitudes toward psychological online interventions (POI), and their satisfaction using such interventions. A total of 150 therapists completed an online Google Forms survey between April 17 and May 6, 2020, before therapists returned to their workplaces. The survey included questionnaires about STR and about attitudes toward and satisfaction with online therapy. Participants perceived the pandemic as an STR, particularly in the trauma dimension. The newly developed index of ""shared concerns"" showed that this perception was mainly a result of financial and health concerns. The satisfaction of using POI depended on participants' attitudes toward online therapy. The more experience therapists had, the less they perceived the current situation as an STR. This study, extending the theoretical concept of STR via the newly developed index, recommends that pandemics be included within the typology of shared traumatic events. Moreover, although positive attitudes toward online therapy are prevalent, young professionals require training to use POI for various traumatic situations.

"A randomized controlled trial of a smartphone-based well-being training in public school system employees during the COVID-19 pandemic","Whereas the extraordinary pressures of the COVID-19 pandemic on student mental health have received considerable attention, less attention has been placed on educator well-being. School system employees play a vital role in society, and teacher levels of well-being are associated with the educational outcomes of young people. We extend extant research on the prevalence and correlates of educator distress during the pandemic by reporting on a pragmatic randomized wait-list controlled trial (N = 662;64% teachers) of an innovative mental health promotion strategy implemented during the pandemic;a free 4-week smartphone-based meditation app designed to train key constituents of well-being (Healthy Minds Program [HMP]). Following our preregistered analysis plan and consistent with hypotheses, assignment to the HMP predicted significantly larger reductions in psychological distress, our primary outcome, at post intervention (Cohen's d = -.53, 95% CI [-.69, -.38], p &lt; .001) and at the 3-month follow-up (d = -.33 [-.48, -.18], p &lt; .001). Also consistent with hypotheses, we observed similar indications of immediate and sustained benefit following the HMP on all six preregistered secondary outcomes selected to tap skills targeted in the app (e.g., perseverative thinking, social connection, well-being;absolute ds = .19-.42, all ps &lt; .031 corrected except mindful action at follow-up). We found no evidence for elevated adverse events, and the HMP was equally effective among participants with elevated baseline anxiety and depressive symptoms. These data suggest that the HMP may be an effective and scalable approach to supporting the mental health and well-being of teachers and other school system employees, with implications for employee retention and performance and student outcomes. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement Although teachers and other school system employees play a vital role in society and have reported high levels of distress during the COVID-19 pandemic, relatively little attention has been placed on promoting their mental health and well-being. In a randomized trial of 662 Wisconsin school system employees (64.4% teachers) conducted during the pandemic, we report that a 4-week smartphone-based meditation app significantly reduced psychological distress and improved well-being, while also strengthening key skills underlying well-being (e.g., cognitive defusion, social connection) immediately following the intervention and three months after it. Mobile meditation-based interventions may be an effective and scalable approach to supporting the mental health and well-being of teachers and other school system employees, with implications for several critical challenges facing educational systems, including employee retention and performance and the relationship of these to student outcomes.

"The impact of COVID-19 anxiety on quality of life in Canadian adults: The moderating role of intolerance of uncertainty and health locus of control","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has contributed to a global increase in mental health problems including ""COVID-19 anxiety,"" the presence of dysfunctional anxiety about the novel coronavirus (e.g., fear of contracting or spreading the virus). The present study investigated potential moderators of the relationship between COVID-19 anxiety and (a) daily functioning and (b) quality of life, to determine which individuals are most susceptible to these negative outcomes. Intolerance of uncertainty and health locus of control were examined as possible moderators. This study recruited 193 Canadian adults using crowdsourcing platforms during the third wave of COVID-19. Participants completed online questionnaires assessing demographics and the constructs of interest. Regression analyses found that neither intolerance of uncertainty nor health locus of control significantly moderated the relationships between COVID-19 anxiety and daily functioning. However, both intolerance of uncertainty and health locus of control were significant moderators between COVID-19 anxiety and quality of life. These findings extend past research by emphasizing the need to target specific risk factors, such as intolerance of uncertainty and health locus of control, in therapeutic settings to better support individuals' quality of life during this difficult and unpredictable time.

"Patients' and therapists' experiences of CBT videoconferencing in anxiety disorders","Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) videoconferencing has been demonstrated to be an effective treatment for anxiety disorders and an equal alternative to face-to-face CBT. However, qualitative patient and therapist experiences of CBT videoconferencing have been less researched. Due to COVID-19, mental health services have shifted to remote therapy methods;thus, understanding patient and therapist experiences are crucial to better inform service policies and best practices. The current study focused on patient and therapist experiences of CBT videoconferencing at the Centre for Anxiety Disorders and Trauma (CADAT). Researchers used qualitative content analysis to explore patients' (n = 54) and therapists' (n = 15) responses to an online survey. Results yielded four themes: behavioural experiments work well if the problem lends itself to videoconferencing, overall practicalities but some home environment implications, privacy and technical issues, high telepresence and the negative impact on the therapeutic alliance, and COVID-19 influences attitude positively. The findings have clinical implications for CBT videoconferencing, including a need for specific training in assessment and intervention for therapists using videoconferencing. Key learning aims Readers of this paper will be able to: Describe patient and therapist qualitative experiences of CBT videoconferencing.

"The psychological outcomes of covid-19 affected the pandemic-after risk perceptions of nurse clinicians: A latent profile analysis","Background Risk perception among nurses after the COVID-19 pandemic is a crucial factor affecting their attitudes and willingness to work in clinics. Those with poor psychological status could perceive risks sensitively as fears or threats that are discouraging. This article aimed to determine whether psychological outcomes, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and insomnia, following the COVID-19 pandemic were differentially related to the risk perceptions of nurses working in clinics and increased perceived risk. Method The participants were 668 nurse clinicians from five local hospitals. Risk perceptions and psychological outcomes were measured by adapted questionnaires via the Internet. Latent profile analysis (LPA) identified subgroups of individuals who showed similar profiles regarding the perceived risks in nursing. Multinomial regression and probit regression were used to examine the extent to which sociodemographic and psychological outcomes predicted class membership. Results LPA revealed four classes: groups with low-, mild-, moderate-, and high-level risk perceptions. Membership of the high-level risk perception class was predicted by the severity of psychological outcomes. Anxiety significantly accounted for a moderate increase in risk perceptions, while the symptoms of insomnia, depression, and PTSD accelerated the increase to the high level of risk perception class. Conclusions By classifying groups of nurse clinicians sharing similar profiles regarding risk perceptions and then exploring associated predictors, this study shows the psychological outcomes after COVID-19 significantly impacted pandemic-associated risk perceptions and suggests intervening in nurses' psychological outcomes while simultaneously focusing on work-related worries is important following the outbreak of COVID-19.

Since people with Multiple Sclerosis (pwMS) are usually at higher risk of psychological distress than age-matched healthy controls (HC), a meta-analytic study was conducted, aimed at evaluating i) differences between pwMS and HC in the psychological variables during the pandemic, ii) differences in the levels of anxiety, depression, stress, sleep disturbances and quality of life before and during the Covid-19 pandemic in pwMS. Methods : The literature search on three electronic databases yielded 196 studies (113 after the duplicates removal). Seven studies compared psychological variables between pwMS and HC during the pandemic, while seven studies evaluated the pre- vs during the pandemic differences in pwMS. The following outcomes were selected: depression, anxiety, physical QoL, mental QoL, stress, sleep quality/disturbances. Mean weighted effect sizes (ES) were calculated using Hedges'g, via Prometa3 software. Results : During the pandemic, pwMS showed higher levels of depression (g=0.51, p=0.001), anxiety (g=0.41, p=0.032), and stress (g=0.51, p=0.016) compared to HC. The comparison on psychological outcomes before and during the pandemic in pwMS revealed no significant increase during the pandemic on levels of anxiety (g=0.08, p=0.380), depression (g=0.02, p=0.772), mental QoL (g= -0.14, p=0.060), physical QoL (g=0.00, p=0.986), whereas sleep quality deteriorated during the pandemic (g=0.52, p&lt;0.001). Conclusions : In agreement with pre-pandemic literature, pwMS showed higher levels of psychological distress than HC also during the Covid-19 pandemic. Contrariwise, longitudinal studies revealed that, in pwMS, the only psychological-associated variable that worsened significantly was the sleep quality, but this outcome was evaluated only in two studies. Future studies will have to assess/evaluate the long-term psychological consequences of the pandemic on pwMS.","Manuela, Altieri, Rocco, Capuano, Alvino, Bisecco, Alessandro, d'Ambrosio, Daniela, Buonanno, Gioacchino, Tedeschi, Gabriella, Santangelo, Antonio, Gallo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2022.103774","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders;: 103774, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29442,""
"Longitudinal trajectories of insomnia symptoms among college students during the COVID-19 lockdown in China","Purpose This study aimed to examine the patterns and predictors of the trajectories of college students' insomnia symptoms across different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A total of 35,516 college students completed three online surveys during the COVID-19 outbreak period (3â€“10 February 2020), initial remission period (24 Marchâ€“3 April 2020), and effective control period (1â€“15 June 2020), respectively. These surveys measured the participants' socio-demographic and pandemic related factors, insomnia symptoms, mental health status, and psychosocial factors. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to examine predictors for trajectory membership. Results The prevalence of insomnia symptoms increases during home quarantine. Five insomnia symptoms trajectories were observed: resistance (82.8% of the sample), recovery (5.0%), delayed-dysfunction (5.8%), chronic-dysfunction (1.8%), and relapsing/remitting (4.6%). Female gender, residence location in urban, has history of sleep problems, smoking, alcohol use, community or village has confirmed COVID-19 cases, current poor mental health, higher negative coping were related to higher risk of developing insomnia symptoms in at least one time point, whereas better family function increased the possibility of recovery relative to chronic dysfunction. Lower social support and positive coping could also cause insomnia chronicity. Conclusion Adolescents have different trajectories of insomnia symptoms during pandemic lockdown. Although most adolescents did not experience insomnia or recovered over time, some adolescents, especially those with the risk factors noted above, exhibit delayed or chronic symptoms. These findings could inform mental health professionals regarding how to provide individualized and appropriate intervention for college students after their return to school.","Wang, Dongfang, Zhao, Jingbo, Zhai, Shuyi, Huang, Shuiqing, Yang, Zheng, Pan, Ye, Liu, Xianchen, Fan, Fang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2022.110795","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Psychosomatic Research;: 110795, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29443,""
"Resilience predicts positive mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic in New Yorkers with and without obsessive-compulsive disorder","There has been substantial concern about the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly for those with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) given the overlap between OCD symptoms (e.g., excessive handwashing) and appropriate disease prevention measures. However, the pandemic has demonstrated a heterogeneous mental health effects, suggesting that individual-level factors could play a role in buffering or exacerbating its deleterious impact. This study aimed to understand how individual differences in resilience were associated with trajectories of obsessive-compulsive, depression, and anxiety symptoms among healthy adults and those with OCD residing in New York City, considered the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States at its onset. The sample consisted of healthy individuals (nÂ =Â 30) and people with OCD (nÂ =Â 33) who completed clinical interviews and self-report questionnaires that assessed baseline resilience, OCD symptoms, depression, anxiety, and perceived positive effects of the pandemic at four assessment timepoints: baseline (April 2020) and one, two, and six months later. Linear mixed-effects growth models revealed that greater resilience was associated with stable trajectories of symptoms over time. Conversely, less resilience was associated with worsening obsessive-compulsive symptoms from the two-month to six-month assessment timepoints and worsening depressive symptoms at six months across both groups, and with worsening anxiety symptoms in individuals with OCD at six months. Resilience was correlated with the ability to appreciate â€œsilver liningsâ€ of the pandemic. These findings highlight resilience as a potential treatment target for bolstering mental health outcomes among individuals with and without psychopathology during sustained and unprecedented periods of stress.","Hezel, Dianne M.; Rapp, Amy M.; Wheaton, Michael G.; Kayser, Reilly R.; Rose, Sarah V.; Messner, Gabrielle R.; Middleton, Rachel, Simpson, H.

"Household air pollution from wood-burning cookstoves and C-reactive protein among women in rural Honduras","Household air pollution from solid fuel combustion was estimated to cause 2.31 million deaths worldwide in 2019;cardiovascular disease is a substantial contributor to the global burden. We evaluated the cross-sectional association between household air pollution (24-h gravimetric kitchen and personal particulate matter (PM2.5) and black carbon (BC)) and C-reactive protein (CRP) measured in dried blood spots among 107 women in rural Honduras using wood-burning traditional or Justa (an engineered combustion chamber) stoves. A suite of 6 additional markers of systemic injury and inflammation were considered in secondary analyses. We adjusted for potential confounders and assessed effect modification of several cardiovascular-disease risk factors. The median (25th, 75th percentiles) 24-h-average personal PM2.5 concentration was 115Â Âµg/m3 (65,154Â Âµg/m3) for traditional stove users and 52Â Âµg/m3 (39, 81Â Âµg/m3) for Justa stove users;kitchen PM2.5 and BC had similar patterns. Higher concentrations of PM2.5 and BC were associated with higher levels of CRP (e.g., a 25% increase in personal PM2.5 was associated with a 10.5% increase in CRP [95% CI: 1.2-20.6]). In secondary analyses, results were generally consistent with a null association. Evidence for effect modification between pollutant measures and four different cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., high blood pressure) was inconsistent. These results support the growing evidence linking household air pollution and cardiovascular disease.

"Predictors of â€˜problematic internet useâ€™ among adolescents and adults amid the pandemic in India","Background Globally, problematic internet use (PIU) is acknowledged as a significant behavioural problem in adolescents and youth. It is being researched for further clarity as an independent behavioural disorder. It is crucial to explore predictors of PIU to understand the high-risk psychosocial indicators of problematic internet use, particularly amid the COVID-19 pandemic in India. Aim The present study aimed at studying age, gender, mental health, coping strategies and lifestyle indicators as predictors for PIU in adolescents, young adults and middle-aged adults. Methods The study used a cross-sectional design, and the data was collected using Perceived Stress Scale, Internet Gaming Disorders-9, DSM-5 Self-Rated Level-1, and Brief-COPE scale. Multiple regression analysis was employed to find the predictors of PIU in a sample of 1027 i.e., adolescents (13â€“19 years), young adults (20â€“39 years), and middle-aged adults (40â€“60 years). Separate regression analyses were carried out for the three subgroups as well. Results Results showed that the age, perceived stress, maladaptive coping strategies (substance use, self-blaming, self-distraction, behavioural disengagement), repetitive thoughts and actions, and impact of COVID-19 were significant independent predictors of PIU. Furthermore, differences in independent predictors were found in different sub-groups of age. Discussion This study indicated that adolescents and youth are more susceptible to PIU. In addition, maladaptive coping strategies predicted PIU significantly, which indicates that PIU is not an effective coping strategy but can be understood as maladaptive behaviour involving escapism. Furthermore, only repetitive thoughts and actions predicted PIU, which clarifies PIU as an independent pathology. Conclusion This study found specific predictors for the three sub-groups â€“ adolescents, young adults, and middle-aged adults - that would further aid management plans for problematic internet use. Moreover, the role of the COVID-19 pandemic on PIU is also critical.","Singh, Shweta, Datta, Manjistha, Gupta, Pawan, Batra, Saakshi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cegh.2022.101036","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Clinical Epidemiology and Global Health;: 101036, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29448,""
"Longitudinal study of Postpartum Depression in COVID-19 Era: Risk and Protective Factors","Objective: COVID-19 impacted the childbirth experience and increased rates of postpartum depression (PPD). We assessed longitudinal effects of the pandemic on rates of PPD. Study Design: We evaluated PPD causes and symptoms among women who delivered during the first COVID-19 quarantine in Israel. Postpartum women completed online questionnaires 3 (T1) and 6 months (T2) following delivery. COVID-19 related questionnaires included â€˜Fear of COVID-19â€™ and â€˜COVID-19 exposureâ€™ questionnaires. PPD symptoms, situational anxiety and social support, were evaluated with the EPDS, STAI, and MSPSS questionnaires. Results: Mean EPDS scores increased between T1 and T2 (6.31Â±5.6 vs. 6.92Â±5.9, mean difference -0.64Â±4.59 (95% CI (-1.21)- (-0.06));t(244)=-2.17, p=0.031) and STAI scores decreased (45.35Â±16.4 vs. 41.47Â±14.0, t(234)=4.39, p=0.000). Despite exposure to increased numbers of COVID-19 events (3.63Â±1.8 vs. (6.34Â±2.3) the impact of exposure decreased between T1 and T2 (8.91Â±4.6 vs. 7.47Â±4.1), p&lt; 0.001). No differences were found between Fear of COVID-19 in T1 (17.25Â±5.3), and T2 (17.10Â±5.3);t=0.42, p=0.676, nor in COVID-19 related financial difficulties between T1 (2.80Â±1.2) and T2 (2.83Â±1.1);t(266)=-0.581, p=0.561. In the MSPSS, significant differences were noted on the family scale between T1 (.36.10Â±1) and T2 (5.91Â±1.4) scores;t(216)=2.68, p=0.0008. Regression analysis showed three statistically significant variables that correlated with increased EPDS scores;MSPSS family subscale [F(1,212.00)= 4.308, p =0.039], STAI scores [F(1,212.00)= 31.988, p =0.000], and the impact of exposure to COVID-19 [F(1,212.00)= 5.038, p =0.026]. Conclusion: Rates of PPD increased for women who delivered during the first COVID 19 lockdown. Further research is warranted to help reduce PPD among these women.","Gluska, H.; Shiffman, N.; Mayer, Y.; Margalit, S.; Daher, R.; Elyasyan, L.; Weiner, M.

"Opioid usage and COVID-19 prognosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have profound health, social, psychological, and economic ramifications. Infection by COVID-19 has been of concern in people who use opioids, as opioid use has been known to mediate immunosuppression and is associated with respiratory depression and end-organ damage. With differing modalities of opioid usage, the association between opioids and COVID-19 outcomes is not well understood. We performed a comprehensive systematic search of seven health science databases, including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang Data, up to December 15, 2021. We identified a total of five related articles, which were included in this study. The meta-analysis showed that opioids have a significant association with ICU admission for COVID-19 patients (ORÂ =Â 5.41, 95%CI: 1.85 to 15.79, PÂ =Â 0.002). Use of opioids was also associated with higher mortality among patients with COVID-19 compared to non-users (ORÂ =Â 2.74, 95%CI: 1.34 to 5.62, PÂ =Â 0.034), while use of opioids was not significantly associated with need for mechanical ventilation (ORÂ =Â 3.68, 95%CI: 0.85 to 15.90, PÂ =Â 0.081). Furthermore, the adjusted analysis indicated that COVID-19 patients with a history of opioid use were more likely to be admitted to the ICU (ORÂ =Â 3.57, 95%CI: 3.05 to 4.17, P&lt;0.001) and have higher mortality rates (ORÂ =Â 1.72, 95%CI: 1.09 to 2.72, PÂ =Â 0.02), while there was no significant association with need for mechanical ventilation (ORÂ =Â 2.09, 95%CI: 0.77 to 5.64, PÂ =Â 0.146). Significant heterogeneity existed across the included studies. Patients using opioids with COVID-19 were at higher risk of ICU admission and mortality. Prospective studies are required to confirm these findings.","Ao, Guangyu, Li, Anthony, Wang, Yushu, Li, Jing, Tran, Carolyn, Chen, Min, Qi, Xin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2022.03.048","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: The American Journal of Emergency Medicine;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29450,""
"Patterns of opioid prescribing in emergency departments during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic was superimposed upon an ongoing epidemic of opioid use disorder and overdose deaths. Although the trend of opioid prescription patterns (OPP) had decreased in response to public health efforts before the pandemic, little is known about the OPP from emergency department (ED) clinicians during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We conducted a pre-post study of adult patients who were discharged from 13 EDs and one urgent care within our academic medical system between 01/01/2019 and 09/30/2020 using an interrupted time series (ITS) approach. Patient characteristics and prescription data were extracted from the single unified electronic medical record across all study sites. Prescriptions of opioids were converted into morphine equivalent dose (MED). We compared the â€œCovid-19 Pandemicâ€ period (C19, 03/29/2020â€“9/30/2020) and the â€œPre-Pandemicâ€ period (PP, 1/19/2020â€“03/28/2020). We used a multivariate logistic regression to assess clinical factors associated with opioid prescriptions. Results We analyzed 361,794 ED visits by adult patients, including 259,242 (72%) PP and 102,552 (28%) C19 visits. Demographic information and percentages of patients receiving opioid prescriptions were similar in both groups. The median [IQR] MED per prescription was higher for C19 patients (70 [56â€“90]) than for PP patients (60 [60â€“90], PÂ &lt;Â 0.001). ITS demonstrated a significant trend toward higher MED prescription per ED visit during the pandemic (coefficient 0.11, 95% CI 0.05â€“0.16, PÂ =Â 0.002). A few factors, that were associated with lower likelihood of opioid prescriptions before the pandemic, became non-significant during the pandemic. Conclusion Our study demonstrated that emergency clinicians increased the prescribed amount of opioids per prescription during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period. Etiologies for this finding could include lack of access to primary care and other specialties during the pandemic, or lower volumes allowing for emergency clinicians to identify who is safe to be prescribed opioids.","Lurie, Tucker, Bonin, Naomi, Rea, Jeffrey, Tuteja, Gurshawn, Dezman, Zachary, Wilkerson, R.

"Collective Occupational Trauma, Health Care Quality, and Trauma-Informed Leadership: Intersections and Implications","Managing stress, burnout, and vicarious trauma is a long-standing issue for the health and behavioral health workforce, including those in case management. Yet, the recent novel coronavirus pandemic has amplified routine burnout to record levels. Practitioners and patients are amid a new dynamic of collective occupational trauma (COT). In this realm, health and behavioral health workers (HBWs) experience the same reality as their patients, families, and support systems; professional boundaries become blurred, leading to heightened levels of emotional vulnerability that can prompt the development of more pervasive psychopathology. This reality has put the Quadruple Aim in peril, with increased workforce turnover, staff shortages, costs, and quality challenges. This article: Applicable to all health and behavioral health settings where case management is practiced. Organizational cultures must shift from a ""process and roll"" mindset to one that is trauma-informed. Implementation of TIC has yielded successful outcomes for the workforce via enhanced patient engagement, treatment adherence, and successful outcomes. In tandem, TIC leadership and supervision models have had promising results and should be more readily utilized; they acknowledge and address workforce trauma while prioritizing staff health, mental health, and wellness. Failure to shift the culture will result in an ongoing exodus of practitioners, leaving insufficient numbers to render safe, cost-effective, efficient, and patient-centered care. The case management workforce comprises professional disciplines across health and behavioral health, employed in every setting. The expanding workforce presence has put them at risk of COT. Leadership strategies must shift to acknowledge workforce exposure to occupational trauma, address mental health and wellness, and address professional self-care. This shift is key to mitigating retention, sustainability, and quality challenges.","Fink-Samnick","https://doi.org/10.1097/NCM.0000000000000559","20220401","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29453,""
"Health and access to healthcare in homeless people: Protocol for a mixed-methods study","Homelessness is a more complex problem than the simple lack of a place to live. Homeless people (HP) often suffer from poor health and premature death due to their limited access healthcare, and are also deprived of basic human and social rights. The study protocol described here aims to evaluate the complex relationship between homelessness and health, and identify the barriers and facilitators that impact access to healthcare by HP. This is a mixed-methods study that uses an explanatory sequential design. The first phase will consist of a cross-sectional study of 300 HP. Specific health questionnaires will be used to obtain information on health status, challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, self-reported use of healthcare, diagnoses and pharmacologic treatments, substance abuse (DAST-10), diet quality (IASE), depression (PHQ-9), and human basic needs and social support (SSQ-6). The second phase will be a qualitative study of HP using the ""life story"" technique with purposive sampling. We will determine the effects of different personal, family, and structural factors on the life and health status of participants. The interviews will be structured and defined using Nussbaum's capability approach. It is well-known that HP experience poor health and premature death, but more information is needed about the influence of the different specific social determinants of these outcomes and about the barriers and facilitators that affect the access of HP to healthcare. The results of this mixed methods study will help to develop global health strategies that improve the health and access to healthcare in HP.","Bedmar, Bennasar-Veny, Artigas-Lelong, SalvÃƒÂ -Mut, Pou, CapitÃƒÂ¡n-Moyano, GarcÃƒÂ­a-Toro, YÃƒÂ¡ÃƒÂ±ez","https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000028816","20220401","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29454,""
"Risk factors associated with an outbreak of COVID-19 in a meat processing plant in southern Germany, April to June 2020","Meat processing plants have been prominent hotspots for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreaks around the world. We describe infection prevention measures and risk factors for infection spread at a meat processing plant in Germany with a COVID-19 outbreak from April to June 2020. We analysed a cohort of all employees and defined cases as employees with either a PCR or ELISA positive result. Of 1,270 employees, 453 (36%) had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The highest attack rates were observed in meat processing and slaughtering areas. Multivariable analysis revealed that being a subcontracted employee (adjusted risk ratio (aRR)): 1.43, 95% CI: 1.06-1.96), working in the meat cutting area (aRR: 2.44, 95% CI: 1.45-4.48), working in the slaughtering area (aRR: 2.35, 95% CI: 1.32-4.45) and being a veterinary inspector (aRR: 4.77, 95% CI: 1.16-23.68) increased infection risk. Sharing accommodation or transportation were not identified as risk factors for infection. Our results suggest that workplace was the main risk factor for infection spread. These results highlight the importance of implementing preventive measures targeting meat processing plants. Face masks, distancing, staggering breaks, increased hygiene and regular testing for SARS-CoV2 helped limit this outbreak, as the plant remained open throughout the outbreak.","Finci, Siebenbaum, Richtzenhain, Edwards, Rau, Ehrhardt, Koiou, Joggerst, Brockmann","https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2022.27.13.2100354","20220401","SARS-CoV-2; meat processing plant; prevention measures; risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29455,""
"Factors associated with weight gain during the COVID-19 pandemic","To limit transmission of COVID-19, state governments issued shelter-in-place orders. These orders coincided with a decrease in daily step count and an increase in overeating. We evaluated factors associated with weight gain of Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã‚Â 15 pounds during the pandemic within an integrated health care system. We included adults ages 18 and above with at least one weight measurement before the pandemic (March 19, 2019-March 19, 2020) and another measurement after COVID-19 vaccines became available, more than 9 months into the pandemic (December 14, 2020-December 14, 2021). Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with weight gain of 15 pounds or more. Of 524,451 adults included in the study, median age was 61 years, 43.2% were men, 36.2% self identified as White, 8.6% Black, 35.7% Hispanic, and 16.2% Asian. During the pandemic, 38,213 (7.3%) adults gained Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã‚Â 15 pounds. A higher proportion of young adults gained weight (16.2% age 18-39, 7.6% age 40-64, 4.7% age 65-79%, and 3.1% age Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã‚Â 80). No significant difference was observed between men and women (7.2% men and 7.4% women). Weight gain was more prevalent among adults from low-income neighborhoods (8.9% low-income neighborhoods, 8.0% intermediate-income neighborhoods, and 6.5% high-income neighborhoods). Multivariable logistic regression demonstrated that compared to adults ages 65-79 years, young adults ages 18-39 years had the highest risk of gaining Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã‚Â 15 pounds (adjusted OR 5.19, 95% CI 5.01-5.38). Black race was associated with weight gain in an unadjusted analysis (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.21-1.30). However, this association was significantly attenuated after adjusting for other risk factors including neighborhood income levels (adjusted OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02-1.10). Having a diagnosis of depression pre-pandemic was also associated with weight gain during the pandemic (adjusted OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.50-1.58). In this racially and ethnically diverse population in southern California, significant weight gain of 15 pounds or more was observed in 7.3% of the adult population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Young adults, individuals who resided in low-income neighborhoods, and patients with depression were disproportionally affected.","Goitia, Chen, Patel, Herald, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.orcp.2022.03.002","20220401","Depression; Weight gain; Young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29456,""
"Socioemotional development in infants of pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic: the role of prenatal and postnatal maternal distress","An upsurge in psychological distress was documented in pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigated with a longitudinal design whether prenatal and postnatal maternal distress during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with lower infant socioemotional development. Pregnant women (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°468, M<sub>age</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°30,00, 97.6% White) were recruited during the first COVID-19 mandatory lockdown in Quebec, Canada, from April 2nd to April 13th 2020 and were re-contacted at two months postpartum to complete self-reported measures of general (i.e. not specifically related to the COVID-19 pandemic) anxio-depressive symptoms and infant development. Structural equation modeling analyses were performed using maximum likelihood parameter estimation. Higher maternal prenatal distress significantly contributed to poorer infant socioemotional development. A mediation model showed that postnatal distress significantly mediated the association between prenatal distress and infant socioemotional development, whereas the direct effect of prenatal distress was no longer significant. Prenatal and postnatal maternal distress accounted for 13.7% of the variance in infant socioemotional development. Our results call for special means of clinical surveillance in mothers and for innovative (online) interventions aiming to support maternal mental health during pregnancy and after delivery.","Duguay, Garon-Bissonnette, Lemieux, Dubois-Comtois, Mayrand, Berthelot","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13034-022-00458-x","20220401","COVID-19; Infant socioemotional development; Perinatal distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29457,""
"Telehealth use by mental health professionals during COVID-19","To examine and describe telehealth use and attitudes among mental health professionals in Australia and New Zealand during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants completed a brief online survey between May and July 2020. Participants were recruited via peak and professional organisations and through psychology-focused social media groups and networks. The survey examined frequency of telehealth use, reasons for non-use, telehealth modalities, prior use, attitudes towards use, plans for future use, and training, information or resource needs. A total of 528 professionals (85.2% female) participated in the survey, of which 98.9% reported using telehealth and 32.2% reported using telehealth exclusively. Respondents were less likely to use telehealth if they worked with clients experiencing complex issues (e.g. trauma), had more hours of weekly client contact, had a choice about whether to use telehealth or felt less positive about using technology. Respondents were more likely to hold positive views towards telehealth if they were female, had used online programmes with clients previously, were frequent telehealth users and were comfortable using technology. Participants expressed mixed views on client safety and the impact of telehealth on therapeutic process and effectiveness. Telehealth has a clear and ongoing role within mental healthcare and there is a need for strong guidance for professionals on how to manage client risk, privacy, security and adapt therapy for delivery via telehealth. In particular, there is a need for individual-, organisational-, professional- and policy-level responses to ensure that telehealth remains a viable and effective healthcare medium into the future.","Farrer, Clough, Bekker, Calear, Werner-Seidler, Newby, Knott, Gooding, Reynolds, Brennan, Batterham","https://doi.org/10.1177/00048674221089229","20220401","COVID-19; Telehealth; implementation; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29458,""

"Assessment of depression, anxiety and stress experienced by health care and allied workers involved in SARS-CoV2 pandemic","The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to a global health crisis. Health workforce has been working vigorously in COVID-19 management. So, we have planned this study with an aim to assess the psychological profile of healthcare and allied workers involved in SARS-CoV2 pandemic and to look for associated factors. A cross-sectional observational study was planned at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna. Study population comprised of Health care workers and allied health care workers involved in COVID-19 management. Data from 254 study participants have been included in the study. The prevalence of severe and extremely severe depression among study participants was 8.3 and 3.1 percent. Severe and extremely severe anxiety prevalence was found to be 9.4 and 13.8 percent. The prevalence of severe and extremely severe stress was 2.4 and 2.4 percent each. Education till post-graduation, unmarried, occupation of doctor, Comorbidity of headache and occurrence of influenza-like illness in last 3 months had a statistically significant association with high depression score. With high Anxiety score and high-stress score statistically significant association was seen in education till postgraduation, unmarried, occupation of doctor, duration of 1 COVID-19 duty of Ã¢â€°Â¥8 hours. The study highlights high psychological comorbidities in the form of depression, anxiety and stress among health care workers and allied health care workers working in COVID-19 pandemic.

"Who Is at Risk of Poor Mental Health Following Coronavirus Disease-19 Outpatient Management?","Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) convalescents are at risk of developing a <i>de novo</i> mental health disorder or worsening of a pre-existing one. COVID-19 outpatients have been less well characterized than their hospitalized counterparts. The objectives of our study were to identify indicators for poor mental health following COVID-19 outpatient management and to identify high-risk individuals. We conducted a binational online survey study with adult non-hospitalized COVID-19 convalescents (Austria/AT: <i>n</i> = 1,157, Italy/IT: <i>n</i> = 893). Primary endpoints were positive screening for depression and anxiety (Patient Health Questionnaire; PHQ-4) and self-perceived overall mental health (OMH) and quality of life (QoL) rated with 4 point Likert scales. Psychosocial stress was surveyed with a modified PHQ stress module. Associations of the mental health and QoL with socio-demographic, COVID-19 course, and recovery variables were assessed by multi-parameter Random Forest and Poisson modeling. Mental health risk subsets were defined by self-organizing maps (SOMs) and hierarchical clustering algorithms. The survey analyses are publicly available (https://im2-ibk.shinyapps.io/mental_health_dashboard/). Depression and/or anxiety before infection was reported by 4.6% (IT)/6% (AT) of participants. At a median of 79 days (AT)/96 days (IT) post-COVID-19 onset, 12.4% (AT)/19.3% (IT) of subjects were screened positive for anxiety and 17.3% (AT)/23.2% (IT) for depression. Over one-fifth of the respondents rated their OMH (AT: 21.8%, IT: 24.1%) or QoL (AT: 20.3%, IT: 25.9%) as fair or poor. Psychosocial stress, physical performance loss, high numbers of acute and sub-acute COVID-19 complaints, and the presence of acute and sub-acute neurocognitive symptoms (impaired concentration, confusion, and forgetfulness) were the strongest correlates of deteriorating mental health and poor QoL. In clustering analysis, these variables defined subsets with a particularly high propensity of post-COVID-19 mental health impairment and decreased QoL. Pre-existing depression or anxiety (DA) was associated with an increased symptom burden during acute COVID-19 and recovery. Our study revealed a bidirectional relationship between COVID-19 symptoms and mental health. We put forward specific acute symptoms of the disease as ""red flags"" of mental health deterioration, which should prompt general practitioners to identify non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients who may benefit from early psychological and psychiatric intervention.

"Monthly Trends in the Life Events Reported in the Prior Year and First Year of the COVID-19 Pandemic in New Zealand","The current study examines changes in the economic, social, and well-being life events that women and men reported during the first 7 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Analyses compared monthly averages in cross-sectional national probability data from two annual waves of the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study collected between October 2018-September 2019 (<i>N</i> = 17,924), and October 2019-September 2020 (<i>N</i> = 41,653), which included the first 7 months of the pandemic (Mar-Sep 2020). Results indicated that people (particularly women) reported increased job loss in the months following an initial COVID-19 lockdown relative to the same months the year earlier. Women also experienced an increase in family troubles when restrictions eased and reported increased negative lifestyle changes that persisted throughout the first 7 months of the pandemic. The proportion of people experiencing many other life events (e.g., mental health, financial concerns) in New Zealand did not differ reliably from the pre-pandemic monthly baseline. These results highlight resilience to many potential negative life events within the first 7 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the pandemic did not affect everyone equally, and the burden of increased negative events appears more heavily borne by women. As the pandemic continues more than 18 months from initial community transmission of COVID-19, our findings provide important insight into the impact of the pandemic on potential negative life events, especially among women, that may have critical consequences for mental health, gender equality, and social well-being over time.","Howard, Overall, Sibley","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.829643","20220401","COVID-19 pandemic; gender; life events; longitudinal analysis; stressors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29463,""
"Burned-Out: Middle School Teachers After One Year of Online Remote Teaching During COVID-19","During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, teachers around the globe had been forced to move their teaching to full-time online, remote teaching. In this study, we aimed at understanding teacher burnout during COVID-19. We conducted a survey among 399 teachers at the peak of a prolonged physical school closure. Teachers reported experiencing more burnout during (vs. before) the COVID-19 pandemic. Contributing factors to this burnout were high family work conflict and low online teaching proficiency. Burnout was associated with lower work-related wellbeing: Lower work commitment, and higher turnover intentions. It was also associated with lower psychological wellbeing: More depressive and anxiety symptoms, and lower subjective wellbeing. Approach (but not avoid) coping strategies served as a protective factor against the burnout-turnover intentions association. We conclude with recommendations on how to mitigate teacher burnout, thereby contributing to teacher wellbeing.","Gutentag, Asterhan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.802520","20220401","COVID-19; burnout; family work conflict; online; online teaching proficiency; remote teaching; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29464,""
"Frontline Mongolian Healthcare Professionals and Adverse Mental Health Conditions During the Peak of COVID-19 Pandemic","The relatively young and inexperienced healthcare professionals in Mongolia faced with an unprecedent service demand in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the small size of the healthcare workforce the Mongolian Health Ministry had no choice but to mandate continuous and long workhours from the healthcare workforce. Many of the healthcare professionals exhibited signs and symptoms of mental health disorders. This study aimed to discern the prevalence various mental health concerns, i.e., depression, anxiety and stress, insomnia, and to discern the factors that increased susceptibility to mental health disorders among frontline healthcare professionals providing healthcare services for COVID-19 patients in Mongolia. A Cross-sectional research design was implemented. We collected data from 965 healthcare professional, randomly selected from 18 government hospitals, in four regions of Mongolia. Data were collected using the Depression Anxiety Stress-21, the General Self-Efficacy Scale, and the Insomnia Severity Index instruments. We constructed the scale of Pandemic Response Symptoms (PaReSy) which captured stress, depression, and anxiety. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Kruskal-Wallis statistical test and multinominal logistic regression analysis. Prevalence of depression (52.3%, CI 95%: 49.1-55.5%), anxiety (70.2%, CI 95%: 67.2-73.0%), and stress (35.8%, CI 95%: 32.7-38.9%) was documented among Mongolian healthcare professionals. Perception of self-efficacy reduced susceptibility to PaReSy either at mild/moderate (OR = 0.948, 95% CI = 0.911-0.988, <i>P</i> = 0.011) or severe/extremely severe level (OR = 0.911, 95% CI = 0.861-0.963, <i>P</i> = 0.001). Within each stratum of insomnia, the risk of experiencing PaReSy increased almost linearly both in the category of mild/moderate PaReSy and in the category of severe/extremely severe PaReSy. Improving self-efficacy and sleeping quality can assist healthcare workers to manage depression, anxiety, and stress. Findings provide important evidence to implement measures and strategies to assist healthcare professionals in low- and middle-income countries to constructively address their mental health concerns and needs.","Tsogbadrakh, Yanjmaa, Badamdorj, Choijiljav, Gendenjamts, Ayush, Pojin, Davaakhuu, Sukhbat, Dovdon, Davaasuren, Stark","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.800809","20220401","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; insomnia; psychological wellbeing; self-efficacy; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29465,""
"""Post-lockdown Depression"": Adaptation Difficulties, Depressive Symptoms, and the Role of Positive Solitude When Returning to Routine After the Lifting of Nation-Wide COVID-19 Social Restrictions","The aim of the current study was to identify difficulties in adapting to normal life once COVID-19 lockdown has been lifted. Israel was used as a case study, as COVID-19 social restrictions, including a nation-wide lockdown, were lifted almost completely by mid-April 2021, following a large-scale vaccination operation. A sample of 293 mid-age and older Israeli adults (<i>M</i> age = 61.6 Ã‚Â± 12.8, range 40-85 years old) reported on return-to-routine adaptation difficulties (on a novel index), depression, positive solitude, and several demographic factors. Of the participants, 40.4% met the criteria of (at least) mild depressive symptoms. Higher levels of adaptation difficulties were related to higher ratios of clinical depressive symptoms. This link was moderated by positive solitude. Namely, the association between return-to-routine adaptation difficulties and depression was mainly indicated for individuals with low positive solitude. The current findings are of special interest to public welfare, as adaptation difficulties were associated with higher chance for clinical depressive symptoms, while positive solitude was found to be as an efficient moderator during this period. The large proportion of depressive symptoms that persist despite lifting of social restrictions should be taken into consideration by policy makers when designing return-to-routine plans.","Keisari, Palgi, Ring, Folkman, Ben-David","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.838903","20220401","adaptation difficulties; depressive symptoms; lockdown; mid-life; older adults; positive solitude","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29466,""
"Contributions of COVID-19 Pandemic-Related Stressors to Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Mental Health During Pregnancy","This study aimed to identify racial and ethnic disparities in prenatal mental health and identify COVID-19 pandemic-related health/healthcare and economic contributors to these disparities, using an established framework for disparity investigation. This cross-sectional study includes 10,930 pregnant people at Kaiser Permanente Northern California who completed an online survey between June 22, 2020 and April 28, 2021 on COVID-19 pandemic-related health/healthcare and economic stressors, depression, and anxiety. Self-reported race and ethnicity were extracted from electronic health records. Weighted analyses were used to evaluate the association between racial and ethnic category and prenatal depression and anxiety; the prevalence of each stressor by race and ethnicity; and the relationship between each stressor and prenatal depression and anxiety in each racial and ethnic category. The sample was 22% Asian, 3% Black, 20% Hispanic, 5% Other/Multiracial/Unknown, and 49% White. Compared to White people, Black and Hispanic people had a higher prevalence of prenatal depression (aPR: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.45, 2.35 and aPR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.37, respectively) and anxiety (aPR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.34, 2.18 and aPR: 1.10, 95% CI: 0.94, 1.29, respectively). Compared to White people, Black and Hispanic people had a higher prevalence of moderate/severe distress due to changes in prenatal care (24 vs. 34 and 31%), and food insecurity (9 vs. 31 and 24%). Among Black and Hispanic people, distress due to changes in prenatal care was associated with a greater prevalence of prenatal depression (aPR: 2.27, 95% CI: 1.41, 3.64 and aPR: 2.76, 95% CI: 2.12, 3.58, respectively) and prenatal anxiety (aPR: 3.00, 95% CI: 1.85, 4.84 and aPR: 2.82, 95% CI: 2.15, 3.71, respectively). Additionally, among Hispanic people, high-risk employment and food insecurity were associated with a greater prevalence of prenatal depression and anxiety. This study identified racial and ethnic disparities in mental health for pregnant Black and Hispanic people. Distress due to prenatal care changes contributed to the observed disparities in prenatal depression and anxiety for Black and Hispanic people and food insecurity additionally contributed to the observed disparities for Hispanic people. Addressing distress due to changes to prenatal care and food insecurity specifically in Black and Hispanic people may help reduce the high burden of poor mental health and reduce observed disparities in these communities.","Avalos, Nance, Zhu, Croen, Young-Wolff, Zerbo, Hedderson, Ferrara, Ames, Badon","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.837659","20220401","COVID-19; antenatal anxiety; antenatal depression; prenatal anxiety; prenatal depression; social determinants of health; stressors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29467,""
"Riboflavin for COVID-19 Adjuvant Treatment in Patients With Mental Health Disorders: Observational Study","<b>Background:</b> COVID-19 treatment remains a challenge for medicine because of the extremely short time for clinical studies of drug candidates, so the drug repurposing strategy, which implies the use of well-known and safe substances, is a promising approach. <b>Objective:</b> We present the results of an observational clinical study that focused on the influence of riboflavin (vitamin B2) supplementation on the immune markers of COVID-19 severity in patients with mental health disorders. <b>Results:</b> We have found that 10Ã‚Â mg of flavin mononucleotide (a soluble form of riboflavin) intramuscularly twice a day within 7Ã‚Â days correlated with the normalization of clinically relevant immune markers (neutrophils and lymphocytes counts, as well as their ratio) in COVID-19 patients.

"Social Inequalities in Young People's Mental Distress During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Do Psychosocial Resource Factors Matter?","The COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately affected young people aged 16-25 years and has brought about a major increase in mental health problems. Although there is persisting evidence regarding SES differences in mental health status, there is still little knowledge of the processes linking SES to young people's mental health, in particular during the current pandemic. Guided by a stress process model this study examines the role of different psychosocial resource factors in mitigating the vulnerability to mental distress among disadvantaged young people and specifies a range of possible mediating pathways. The research draws on a nationally representative longitudinal sample of 16-25 year-olds who participated in the Youth Economic Activity and Health (YEAH) online survey conducted in the UK between February and October 2021. Mental health was measured using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist for anxiety and depression. Socio-economic disadvantage was indicated by parental education and receipt of free school meals. Experience of stress was indicated by financial strain. Psychosocial resource factors included indicators of optimism, self-efficacy, and social support. We controlled for age, gender, living arrangements, and economic activity of the young person (being in education, employment or NEET). The findings suggest sequential mediating processes where SES influences are partially mediated <i>via</i> financial strain and the psychosocial resource factors. In addition, the psychosocial resource factors showed independent effects supporting mental health in the face of socio-economic adversity. Moreover, social support played a significant role in boosting self-efficacy and optimism, which in turn reduce mental distress. The findings highlighting the importance of specifying the assumed mediating processes, and to consider multiple resource factors instead of single aspects to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the processes linking SES to young people's mental health.","Schoon, Henseke","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.820270","20220401","COVID-19; mental health; optimism; self-efficacy; social inequalities; social support; young people","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29469,""
"Decline in Mental Health in the Beginning of the COVID-19 Outbreak Among European Older Adults-Associations With Social Factors, Infection Rates, and Government Response","Governments across the world have deployed a wide range of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Certain NPIs, like limiting social contacts or lockdowns, had negative consequences for mental health in the population. Especially elder people are prone to mental illnesses during the current pandemic. This article investigates how social factors, infections rates, and stringency of NPIs are associated with a decline in mental health in different European countries. Data stem from the eighth wave of the SHARE survey. Additional data sources were used to build macro indicators for infection rates and NPIs. Two subsamples of persons with mental health problems were selected (people who reported being depressed, <i>n</i> = 9.240 or nervous/anxious, <i>n</i> = 10.551). Decline in mental health was assessed by asking whether depressive symptoms or nervousness/anxiety have become worse since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. For each outcome, logistic regression models with survey-design were used to estimate odds ratios (OR), using social factors (age, gender, education, living alone, and personal contacts) and macro indicators (stringency of NPIs and infection rates) as predictors. Higher age was associated with a lower likelihood of becoming more depressed (OR 0.87) or nervous/anxious (OR 0.88), while female gender increased the odds of a decline in mental health (OR 1.53 for being more depressed; OR 1.57 for being more nervous/anxious). Higher education was only associated with becoming more nervous/anxious (OR 1.59), while living alone or rare personal contacts were not statistically significant. People from countries with higher infection rates were more likely to become more depressed (OR 3.31) or nervous/anxious (OR 4.12), while stringency of NPIs showed inconsistent associations. A majority of European older adults showed a decline in mental health since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. This is especially true in countries with high prevalence rates of COVID-19. Among older European adults, age seems to be a protective factor for a decline in mental health while female gender apparently is a risk factor. Moreover, although NPIs are an essential preventative mechanism to reduce the pandemic spread, they might influence the vulnerability for elderly people suffering from mental health problems.","LÃƒÂ¼decke, von dem Knesebeck","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.844560","20220401","COVID-19; NPI; anxiety; depression; elder people; mental health; social factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29470,""
"Changes in Compliance With Personal Preventive Measures and Mental Health Status Among Chinese Factory Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Observational Prospective Cohort Study","Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination together with good compliance with personal preventive measures may help eradicate the ongoing pandemic. This observational prospective cohort study investigated the changes in compliance with personal preventive measures, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality among factory workers within a 3-month follow-up period. A total of 663 workers were recruited by a stratified multi-stage cluster sampling in March 2020, and all of them completed a follow-up survey three months later. Multilevel logistic and linear regression models (level 1: factories; level 2: individual participants) were fitted. A significant decline was observed in consistent facemask wearing in workplace (from 98.0 to 90.3%, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) and in other public spaces (from 97.1 to 94.4%, <i>P</i> = 0.02), sanitizing hands (from 70.9 to 48.0%, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), household disinfection (from 47.7 to 37.9%, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) and probable depression (from 14.9 to 1.5%, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) over the follow-up period.

"Somatic Symptoms, Anxiety, and Depression Among College Students in the Czech Republic and Slovakia: A Cross-Sectional Study","Studying in college can be a challenging time for many students, which can affect their mental health. In addition to academic pressure and stressful tasks, another aggravating factor in student life is the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The aim of the study was to examine the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and somatic symptoms in Czech and Slovak college students during the COVID-19 pandemic and to evaluate possible socio-demographic determinants of mental health problems. A total of 3,099 respondents participated in this cross-sectional study (Czech Republic: 1,422, Slovakia: 1,677). The analyzes included the Patient Health Questionnaire for somatic symptoms (PHQ-15), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder instrument (GAD-7), and the Patient Health Questionnaire for depression (PHQ-9). Socio-demographic factors were gender, age, family structure, marital status, form of study, degree of study, year of study, field of study, distance between home and college, residence, and housing during the semester. Among Czech students, prevalence of somatic complaints, anxiety and depression was 72.2, 40.3, and 52%, respectively. Among Slovak students, prevalence of somatic complaints, anxiety and depression was 69.5, 34.6, and 47%, respectively. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the most severe mental health problems were identified in a non-negligible part of the sample (Czech Republic: PHQ-15 = 10.1%, GAD-7 = 4.9%, PHQ-9 = 3.4%; Slovakia: PHQ-15 = 7.4%, GAD-7 = 3.5%, PHQ-9 = 2.7%). Regarding the differences between the analyzed countries, a significantly higher score in somatic symptoms, anxiety, and depression was identified in the Czech Republic. Significant differences in mental disorders were found in most socio-demographic characteristics. The main results of the logistic regression analysis revealed that risk factors for mental health disorders in Czech and Slovak students were female gender, younger age, third degree of study, and study of Informatics, Mathematics, Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). Especially in the case of these high-risk groups of students, public policies should consider a response to impending problems. The findings are an appeal for a proactive approach to improving the mental health of students and for the implementation of effective prevention programs, which are more than necessary in the Czech and Slovak college environment.","Gavurova, Ivankova, Rigelsky, Mudarri, Miovsky","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.859107","20220401","COVID-19; GAD-7; PHQ-15; PHQ-9; disorder; mental health; prevalence; socio-demographic determinants","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29472,""
"Isolation in patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases during COVID-19 pandemic compared to healthy individuals: a questionnaire survey","As a result of the pandemic, many patients with an inflammatory rheumatic disease (IRD) have isolated themselves. The lack of disease management together with fear of infection could lead to changes in physical- and mental health. The aim of this study was to evaluate the social- and health behaviour in patients with an IRD compared with the behaviour of healthy individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study was a questionnaire survey answered by patients with an IRD and healthy individuals (HI). The questionnaire contained seven sections with questions regarding COVID-19 and quality of life including SF-36, EQ-5D-5L, and visual analogue scale (VAS) pain, fatigue and global health. Of 1663 invited participants, 661 patients with IRD and 266 HI were included in the analyses. Patients with an IRD felt more isolated during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with HI (IRD: 9.5% (61/644), HI: 3.1% (8/259), p-valueÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). More HI (5.4%) had been infected with COVID-19 than patients with an IRD (1.7%). Among patients with an IRD those with worse self-reported disease activity outcomes (VAS pain, fatigue and global health, all p-valueÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), worse social functioning and emotional well-being were more isolated than individuals with low disease activity. Patients with an IRD feel more isolated during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to HI.

"Medical residents' mental distress in the COVID-19 pandemic: An urgent need for mental health care","Medical residents' mental health is currently an issue of concern for medical educators worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic has raised the greatest concerns given the psychological effects of this scenario on medical residents on the frontlines of the pandemic. To assess the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on physicians in residency training, the collective symptoms of burnout, depression and anxiety are used to identify the residents' beliefs and clinical practices related to COVID-19 patients and their behaviors concerning disease prevention. This observational study involved 3071 medical residents from all regions of Brazil. An online questionnaire assessed the presence of burnout using the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory, depressive symptoms using the Patient Health Questionaire-9, anxiety symptoms using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and COVID-19 Impact Questions to assess the residents' beliefs and clinical practices related to COVID-19 patients. Exploratory analyses, logistic regression and multinomial regression analysis were performed in this investigation. Moderate and severe depressive symptoms were the most common (67.7%) followed by anxiety symptoms (52.8%) and burnout (48.6%). The difference between residents with or without contact with COVID-19 patients was significant increased when analyzing different aspects of clinical practice, behavior, substance use and mental health. These results suggest an increase in depression and anxiety symptoms among medical residents dealing with COVID-19, upstaging previous concerns about medical residents' mental health. The prevalence of burnout is similar to that of a nonpandemic scenario. Considering the severity of the pandemic scenario and the overburden of healthcare services, medical residents' mental health deserves special care.","Steil, Pereira Tokeshi, Bernardo, da Silva Neto, Davi, BÃƒÂ¡rbara, Mendonca, Fidalgo, Teixeira Gois","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266228","20220331","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29475,""
"Overview and Methodology of the Adolescent Behaviors and Experiences Survey - United States, January-June 2021","Many U.S. schools closed nationwide in March 2020 to prevent the spread of COVID-19. School closures and online-only instruction have negatively affected certain students, with studies showing adverse effects of the pandemic on mental health. However, little is known about other experiences such as economic and food insecurity and abuse by a parent, as well as risk behaviors such as alcohol and drug use among youths across the United States during the pandemic. To address this gap, CDC developed the one-time, online Adolescent Behaviors and Experiences Survey (ABES), which was conducted during January-June 2021 to assess student behaviors and experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic among high school students, including unintentional injury, violence, tobacco product use, sexual behaviors, and dietary behaviors. This overview report of the ABES MMWR Supplement describes the ABES methodology, including the student questionnaire and administration, sampling, data collection, weighting, and analysis. ABES used a stratified, three-stage cluster probability-based sampling approach to obtain a nationally representative sample of students in grades 9-12 attending public and private schools. Teachers of selected classes provided students with access to the anonymous online survey while following local consent procedures. Data were collected using a 110-item questionnaire during January-June 2021 in 128 schools. A total of 7,998 students submitted surveys, and 7,705 of these surveys had valid data (i.e., Ã¢â€°Â¥20 questions answered). The school response rate was 38%, the student response rate was 48%, and the overall response rate was 18%. Information on mode of instruction and school-provided equipment was also collected from all sampled schools. This overview report provides student- and school-level characteristics obtained from descriptive analyses, and the other reports in the ABES MMWR Supplement include information on substance use, mental health and suicidality, perceived racism, and disruptions to student life among high school students. Findings from ABES during the COVID-19 pandemic can help guide parents, teachers, school administrators, community leaders, clinicians, and public health officials in decision-making for student support and school health programs.","Rico, Brener, Thornton, Mpofu, Harris, Roberts, Kilmer, Chyen, Whittle, Leon-Nguyen, Lim, Saba, Bryan, Smith-Grant, Underwood","https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.su7103a1","20220331","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29476,""
"Mental Health, Suicidality, and Connectedness Among High School Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic - Adolescent Behaviors and Experiences Survey, United States, January-June 2021","Disruptions and consequences related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including school closures, social isolation, family economic hardship, family loss or illness, and reduced access to health care, raise concerns about their effects on the mental health and well-being of youths. This report uses data from the 2021 Adolescent Behaviors and Experiences Survey, an online survey of a probability-based, nationally representative sample of U.S. public- and private-school students in grades 9-12 (N = 7,705), to assess U.S. high school students' mental health and suicidality during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study also examines whether mental health and suicidality are associated with feeling close to persons at school and being virtually connected to others during the pandemic. Overall, 37.1% of students experienced poor mental health during the pandemic, and 31.1% experienced poor mental health during the preceding 30 days. In addition, during the 12 months before the survey, 44.2% experienced persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness, 19.9% had seriously considered attempting suicide, and 9.0% had attempted suicide. Compared with those who did not feel close to persons at school, students who felt close to persons at school had a significantly lower prevalence of poor mental health during the pandemic (28.4% versus 45.2%) and during the past 30 days (23.5% versus 37.8%), persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness (35.4% versus 52.9%), having seriously considered attempting suicide (14.0% versus 25.6%), and having attempted suicide (5.8% versus 11.9%). The same pattern was observed among students who were virtually connected to others during the pandemic (i.e., with family, friends, or other groups by using a computer, telephone, or other device) versus those who were not. Comprehensive strategies that improve feelings of connectedness with others in the family, in the community, and at school might foster improved mental health among youths during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Jones, Ethier, Hertz, DeGue, Le, Thornton, Lim, Dittus, Geda","https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.su7103a3","20220331","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29477,""
"Perceived Racism and Demographic, Mental Health, and Behavioral Characteristics Among High School Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic - Adolescent Behaviors and Experiences Survey, United States, January-June 2021","Perceived racism in school (i.e., a student's report of being treated badly or unfairly because of their race or ethnicity) is an important yet understudied determinant of adolescent health and well-being. Knowing how perceived racism influences adolescent health can help reduce health inequities. CDC's 2021 Adolescent Behaviors and Experiences Survey (ABES), an online survey of a probability-based, nationally representative sample of U.S. public- and private-school students in grades 9-12 (N = 7,705), was conducted during January-June 2021 to assess student behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. CDC analyzed data from ABES to measure perceived racism and the extent to which perceptions of racism are associated with demographic, mental health, and behavioral characteristics. Mental health and behavioral characteristics analyzed included mental health status; virtual connection with others outside of school; serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions; and feeling close to persons at school. Demographic characteristics analyzed included sex, race and ethnicity, and grade. Prevalence of perceived racism and associations between perceived racism and demographic, mental health, and behavioral characteristics are reported overall and stratified by race and ethnicity. Approximately one third (35.6%) of U.S. high school students reported perceived racism. Perceived racism was highest among Asian (63.9%), Black (55.2%), and multiracial students (54.5%). Students who reported perceived racism had higher prevalences of poor mental health (38.1%); difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions (44.1%); and not feeling close to persons at school (40.7%). Perceived racism was higher among those students who reported poor mental health than those who did not report poor mental health during the pandemic among Asian (67.9% versus 40.5%), Black (62.1% versus 38.5%), Hispanic (45.7% and 22.9%), and White students (24.5% versus 12.7%). A better understanding of how negative health outcomes are associated with student experiences of racism can guide training for staff and students to promote cultural awareness and antiracist and inclusivity interventions, which are critical for promoting safe school environments for all students.","Mpofu, Cooper, Ashley, Geda, Harding, Johns, Spinks-Franklin, Njai, Moyse, Underwood","https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.su7103a4","20220331","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29478,""

"Contextual determinants of subjective age in midlife and old age: The example of daily variations in COVID-19 infection rates","Feeling younger than one's age reflects a process of age-group dissociation that is frequently activated when belonging to one's age group has negative connotations. Regarding the Corona pandemic, time periods with a higher number of individuals infected with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) might have elicited younger subjective ages, particularly among older adults as they belonged to a ""COVID-19 risk group."" We investigated the subjective age of <i>n</i> = 233 German individuals aged 47-94 years who were assessed between June and September 2020. COVID-19 cases in Germany were considerably rising from August 2020 on. We were able to confirm an association between a higher infection rate and a younger subjective age; individuals assessed in June, July, August, and September felt on average 9.2%, 9.6%, 13.2%, and 19.2% younger than their chronological age. Controlling for subjective age assessed prior to the pandemic, current depressive symptoms and health concerns, as well as for age, gender, and education, the effect of month of assessment on subjective age remained significant. Also, the number of new COVID-19 infections reported on each individual's day of assessment was a significant predictor of subjective age. The association between a higher infection rate and a younger subjective age was stronger among individuals who were chronologically older and those who reported stronger health concerns. Our findings thus suggest that individuals-particularly those who are older and those who are more worried about their health-feel younger at times when COVID-19 infection rates are higher, which might be a mechanism to cope with the virus threat.

"Giving birth alone due to COVID-19-related hospital restrictions compared to accompanied birth: psychological distress in women with caesarean section or vaginal birthÃ‚Â - a cross-sectional study","We examined the mental health of mothers after unaccompanied birth (unaccompanied group, UG) due to COVID-19-related visiting bans and compared the data with a control group with accompanied birth (AG). Additionally, a distinction was made between caesarean section (CS) and vaginal birth (VB), as existing research indicates a higher risk for mental distress after CS. The cross-sectional study included 27 mothers in the UG and 27 matched controls (AG). Anxiety, depression, postpartum traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), and psychological well-being were assessed. Additionally, emotions and attitudes related to the restrictions were measured by self-developed items. Psychological distress was high especially in the UG (anxiety: 23%, PTSS: 34.6%, low well-being: 42.3%, depression: 11.5%). Mothers in the AG had lower psychological distress than those in the UG, but still had enhanced rates of PTSS (11.1%) and diminished well-being (22.2%). In both groups, women with CS reported higher anxiety and trauma scores and lower well-being than women with VB. Unaccompanied mothers with CS perceived visitation restrictions as less appropriate and felt more helpless, angry, worried, and frustrated about the partner's absence than women with VB. The partner's absence during, but also after childbirth has a major impact on psychological outcomes. Particularly, higher rates of anxiety and PTSS can lead to negative consequences for mothers and their children. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to relax visitation bans and avoid unaccompanied births. Psychological treatment in obstetric units is more urgently needed than ever, especially for women with a caesarean section.","Oddo-Sommerfeld, Schermelleh-Engel, Konopka, La Rosa, Louwen, Sommerlad","https://doi.org/10.1515/jpm-2021-0368","20220331","COVID-19; delivery modes; postpartum anxiety; postpartum depression; postpartum traumatic stress; unaccompanied birth; visiting bans","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29482,""
"[Can we influence the negative drug attitude? Interpretation of the rejection of COVID-19 vaccine in the light of results of a pilot study]","Vaccination refusal is a serious obstacle to minimizing the spread of COVID-19. Nevertheless, the rejection of vaccine can be considered the result of a negative attitude towards medical treatment, and according to our previously published data, it can be influenced by the underlying affective state. Increased incidence of affective disorders and anxiety could be observed globally during the pandemic, which may have a significant impact on vaccination acceptance. The aim of our pilot study was to determine the association between clinical improvement of affective and neurocognitive symptoms and change of drug attitude and health control beliefs in a sample of psychiatric patients. A data set of 85 patients with psychiatric disorder has been analysed with the use of Patient's Health Belief Questionnaire on Psychiatric Treatment (PHBQPT) with 5 subscales (Negative Aspect of Medication - NA; Positive Aspect of Medication - PA; Doctor health locus of control- Doctor HLOC; Internal HLOC; Psychological Reactance - PR); Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS-Anx; HADS-Dep) and neurocognitive tests, such as the Stroop test and the Trail Making Tests. All the tests were performed before and after a 14 days treatment. Paired t-tests and generalized linear models were performed to assess the associations between the variables. The baseline scores of NA and HADS-Anx correlated significantly (p=0.001) and after two weeks of treatment NA decreased (p=0.001), while Doctor HLOC and Internal HLOC increased (p=0.001 and p=0.006). The patients performance of the neurocognitive tests improved (all p&lt;0.05). The reduction of HADS-Anx (p=0.002) and HADS-Dep (p=0.006) scores showed significant associations with the decrease of NA. Increase of the PA score was associated with reduction of HADS-Dep (p=0.028). Improvement of neurocognitive functions had no effect on PHBQPT scores. Important conclusions can be drawn regarding the rejection of the COVID-19 vaccine based on the associations found between the intensity of affective and anxiety symptoms and the attitude towards treatment. Our findings suggest that affective symptoms have a negative influence on the attitude towards treatment and that the improvement of these symptoms can facilitate the acceptance of the therapy, regardless of diagnosis. The modest effect of the improvement of neurocognitive functioning on the attitude towards drugs and the significant role of affective-emotional factors suggest that the accep-tance of vaccination probably cannot be facilitated solely with the aid of educational programs. Considering the increasing incidence of affective disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic, the screening of affective and anxiety symptoms and treatment of these disorders could be an important step towards the acceptance of the vaccine. Although psychiatry is not considered as a frontline care unit of the COVID cases, more attention is needed to pay on the availability of mental health services because refuse of vaccine can develop due to affective disorders too.

"Mental health conditions and academic burnout among medical and non-medical undergraduates during the mitigation of COVID-19 pandemic in China","The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed a great impact on people's mental health, especially for undergraduate students. This study aimed to compare the mental health conditions and academic burnout between medical and non-medical undergraduates in China when the COVID-19 pandemic is mitigating. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among 4,972 undergraduates between October 2020 and April 2021, when the pandemic was basically under control. The survey included basic demographics information and standardized scales to evaluate depression, anxiety, perceived stress, daytime sleepiness, alcohol abuse/dependence, quality of life, fatigue, and academic burnout. Compared with medical undergraduates, non-medical undergraduates had higher rates of moderate to severe depression symptoms (29.1% vs. 17.9%, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), moderate to severe anxiety symptoms (19.7% vs. 8.9%, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), alcohol abuse/dependence (16.3% vs.10.3%, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), excessive daytime sleepiness (47.4% vs. 43.4%, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.018), high perceived stress (34.7% vs. 22.2%, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), high level of fatigue (51.8% vs. 42.2%, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), low QOL (35.8% vs. 21.4%, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), and higher academic burnout score (59.4 vs. 57.5, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Being non-medical undergraduates, depression, alcohol abuse/dependence, excessive daytime sleepiness, and high perceived stress were positively associated with academic burnout, while high QOL was negatively associated with the burnout (all PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001).

"First episode psychotic disorders in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic A descriptive review of casereports","Since the onset of COVID-19 pandemic many case reports and case series dealt with new onset psychotic disorders in patients either infected with SARS-CoV-2 or thematically linked to the pandemic, but without an infection. Our aim was to provide a comprehensive collection of these reports to illustrate the nature of these psychoses. We conducted a literature search in Medline, EMBASE, PSYCHINFO, using search terms regarding first episode psychotic disorders in the context of corona. 96 case reports or case series covering 146 patients (62 without and 84 with SARS-CoV-2 infection) were found. Compared to patients without infection, patients with infection showed significantly more often visual hallucinations (28.6% vs 8.1%), confusion (36.9% vs 11.3%), an acute onset of illness (88.5% vs 59.6%) and less often depression (13.1% vs 35.5%) and a delusional content related to the pandemic (29.5% vs 78.3%). Both groups had an equally favourable outcome with a duration of psychosis Ã¢â€°Â¤2 weeks in half and full remission in two thirds of patients. In patients with infection signs of inflammation were reported in 78.3% and increased CRP in 58.6%. While reports on patients with infection are continuously published, no report about patients without infection was found after July 2020. Cases without infection were considered reactive and originated all from the first wave of the Corona pandemic. In cases with infection, inflammation was considered as the main pathogenetic factor but was not found in all patients. Diagnosis was impeded by the overlap of psychosis with delirium.","Rittmannsberger, Barth, Malik, Malsiner-Walli, Yazdi","https://doi.org/10.1017/neu.2022.11","20220331","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29486,""
"Longitudinal changes in home confinement and mental health implications: a 17-month follow-up study in England during the COVID-19 pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought about significant behavioural changes, one of which is increased time spent at home. This could have important public health implications. This study aimed to explore longitudinal patterns of 'home confinement' (defined as not leaving the house/garden) during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the associated predictors and mental health outcomes. Data were from the UCL COVID-19 Social Study. The analytical sample consisted of 25 390 adults in England who were followed up for 17 months (March 2020-July 2021). Data were analysed using growth mixture models. Our analyses identified three classes of growth trajectories, including one class showing a high level of persistent home confinement (the home-confined, 24.8%), one changing class with clear alignment with national containment measures (the adaptive, 32.0%), and one class with a persistently low level of confinement (the unconfined, 43.1%). A range of factors were associated with the class membership of home-confinement trajectories, such as age, gender, income, employment status, social relationships and health. The home-confined class had the highest number of depressive (diff = 1.34-1.68, p &lt; 0.001) and anxiety symptoms (diff = 0.84-1.05, p &lt; 0.001) at the end of the follow-up than the other two classes. There was substantial heterogeneity in longitudinal patterns of home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic. People with a persistent high level of confinement had the worst mental health outcomes, calling for special attention in mental health action plans, in particular targeted interventions for at-risk groups.","Bu, Steptoe, Fancourt","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291722000605","20220331","Anxiety; COVID-19; depression; growth mixture model; isolation; panel data","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29487,""
"One Year Facing COVID Systematic Evaluation of Risk Factors Associated With Mental Distress Among Hospital Workers in Italy","Italy was the first Western country affected by the COVID-19 pandemic that still constitutes a severe challenge for healthcare workers (HCWs), with a deep impact on their mental health. Several studies confirmed that a considerable proportion of HCW developed adverse psychological impairment (PsI). To focus on preventive and rehabilitation measures, it is fundamental to identify individual and occupational risk factors. We systematically assessed possible PsI among all employees in a large university hospital in Italy, using validated psychometric scales in the context of occupational health surveillance. In the period of July 2020 to July 2021, we enrolled 990 HCWs. For each subject, the psychological wellbeing was screened in two steps. The first-level questionnaire collected gender, age, occupational role, personal and occupational COVID-19 exposure, general psychological discomfort (GHQ-12), post-traumatic stress symptoms (IES-R), and anxiety (GAD-7). Workers showing PsI (i.e., test scores above the cutoff in at least one among GHQ-12, IES-R, and GAD-7) have been further investigated by the second-level questionnaire (psycho-diagnostic) composed by PHQ-9, DES-II, and SCL-90 scales. If the second-level showed clinically relevant symptoms, then we offered individual specialist treatment (third level). Three hundred sixteen workers (32%) presented signs of PsI at the first-level screening questionnaire. Women, nurses, and subjects engaged in the COVID-19 area and with an infected family member showed significantly higher PsI risk. PsI prevalence was strongly associated with the pandemic trend in the region but sensibly decreased after January 2021, when almost all workers received the vaccination. A proportion of subjects with PsI presented clinically relevant symptoms (second-level screening) on PHQ-9 (35%), DES (20%), and SCL-90 (28%). These symptoms were associated neither to direct working experience with patients with COVID-19 nor to COVID-19 experience in the family and seemed not to be influenced by the pandemic waves or workers vaccination. The evaluation of psychological wellbeing of all hospital workers, directly or indirectly exposed to pandemic consequences, constitutes a unique condition to detect individual, occupational, and non-occupational risk factors for PsI in situations of high stress and/or disasters, as well as variables associated with symptom chronicization.","Bonzini, Comotti, Fattori, CantÃƒÂ¹, Colombo, Tombola, Myslymi, Gatti, Stucchi, Nava, Bordini, Riboldi, Brambilla","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.834753","20220401","COVID-19 vaccine; healthcare workers; mental health; psychological impairment; risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29488,""
"Exploring Factors and Associate Responses for Anxiety in the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: A Web-Based Survey in Japan","Anxiety plays an important role in psychology. An exploration of anxiety and its associated reactions may provide insight into measures for addressing mental health problems caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Data from this study provide potential correlational responses to anxiety. A cross-sectional study using data collected <i>via</i> an online self-reported questionnaire was conducted in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6), we assessed anxiety levels and explored the relationship between anxiety STAI-6 score, sources of COVID-19 information, the influences of COVID-19, social anxiety symptoms, discrimination, and evaluation of the government. A total of 4,127 participants were included in the analysis. The level of anxiety was not equally distributed across the general population with respect to age, gender, educational level, occupation, income, presence of underlying disease, and location (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The number of sources of information on COVID-19 had a positive correlation with the STAI-6 score (Spearman's rho = 0.176, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The influence of the pandemic was correlated with moderate-severe anxiety. A high level of anxiety added to social anxiety (Spearman's rho = 0.04, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and discriminatory behavior (Spearman's rho = 0.11, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Being female (Estimate = 0.926) and from a non-emergency area (Estimate = -0.308) was related to higher STAI scores, and higher education (Estimate = -0.305), and income (Estimate = -0.168) decreased the STAI score. The respondents who had a lower evaluative score of the preventive activities undertaken by the national and local governments had higher STAI-6 scores. Our findings provide statistical evidence for the associated reaction of anxiety and that anxiety reactions may vary in predictable ways. Further studies should focus on the strategic interventions that may decrease the associated responses to anxiety, to address mental health issues due to the pandemic.","Zhuang, Cai, Lu, Xu, Lin, Wong, Hu, Yamamoto, Morita, Aoyagi, He","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.795219","20220401","COVID-19; STAI-6; anxiety; associate response; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29489,""
"COVID-19 risk perceptions and precautions among the elderly: A study of CALD adults in South Australia","<b>Background:</b> Coping with COVID-19 is a challenge for culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) older adults. In Australia, little attention has been given to understanding associations between cultural contexts, health promotion, and socio-emotional and mental health challenges of older CALD adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we have collected data from older CALD adults to examine their COVID-19 risk perceptions and its association with their health precautions, behavioural dimensions and emergency preparation. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional survey was conducted in South Australia.

The results show that about one third of the respondents (35.5%) gave up at least one of the surveyed health care services. The most frequent cancellations were dental (15.2%) and specialist check-ups (11.8%), followed by postponement of physiotherapy, ergotherapy or speech therapy (6.1%), cancellation of general practitioner (GP) check-ups (5.8%), postponement of psychotherapy (2.0%), postponement of planned hospital treatment (1.8%) and not going to an emergency room (0.7%). Almost 10% of the respondents reported not visiting a physician despite health complaints. Compared to respondents without such a waiver, these respondents were more often female and younger than 35 years, less often rated their health as very good or good, more often had a diagnosis of depression and more often used telemedical contacts as an alternative to visiting the practice during the pandemic.

"Building and Testing of a Conceptual Model to Describe and Measure the Health of People as Affected by Post-traumatic Stress Disorder During Social Unrest: A Confirmatory Factor Analysis and Structural Equation Modeling","Social unrest affects people's health and well-being. People's health-related needs during social unrest are concerns in both research and clinical practice. This study aimed to build and test a framework to describe and understand the health status and needs of people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during social unrest. This study was a cross-sectional survey. A total of 460 people who had experienced post-traumatic distress as a result of the social unrest in 2019 and 2020 were included. A conceptual model comprised four essential areas, namely posttraumatic distress symptoms, participation restrictions, perceived stigma and functional disability, was built from literature. Part 1 validated four instruments that evaluate and define the factor structure of these four areas, In Part II, structural equation modeling was used to test and validate a combined model. Factors underlying the four areas were defined. Analysis using structural equation modeling confirmed a best fit of the model. PTSD symptoms, perceived stigma and participation restriction during social unrest contributed significantly to functional disability; PTSD symptoms exerted a direct effect on participation restriction and perceived stigma; and the effect of PTSD symptoms on functional disability was mediated through its influence on perceived stigma during social unrest. A community-based inclusive approach is essential to understand the holistic needs of people with PTSD during social unrest. To improve health and well-being in addition to evaluating mental health impacts, considering interactions with the rapid change and stressful social environment is essential.","Chung","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.838606","20220401","PTSD; community health; participation; social unrest; stigma; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Humans; Latent Class Analysis; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29493,""

Participants showed a moderate self-perceived level of eHealth literacy (<i>M</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°30, <i>SD</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.8). Participants who reported higher levels of eHealth literacy were more likely to exhibit lower levels of anxiety and depression, higher social support, and greater resilience. After adjusting for background characteristics, the results of the multilevel logistic analysis showed that eHealth literacy was significantly associated with anxiety and depression, social support, and individual resilience. Younger participants and those who were highly educated reported enhanced eHealth literacy. This study presents a baseline reference for eHealth literacy among Chinese PCPs. Improving their ability to search for and use reliable web-based information was beneficial for facilitating perceived social support and raising resilience during the pandemic. Strategies to provide high-quality web-based information to PCPs to self-assess and identify psychological distress at an early stage should be encouraged.","Xu, Shi, Xia, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1177/20552076221089789","20220401","SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant; anxiety; depression; eHealth literacy; primary care provider; resilience; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29494,""
"Cross-Sectional Survey of Smoking Patterns During the COVID-19 Pandemic in a Tobacco Cessation and Lung Cancer Screening Program","<b>Background:</b> Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) produces a wide array of deleterious consequences, some of which are unintended. Data are sparse on whether, and if so, how, current cigarette smoking habits are affected by COVID-19. We describe changes to smoking habits and their correlates during the COVID-19 pandemic among participants in a tobacco cessation and lung cancer screening program. <b>Methods:</b> Between June and October 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of a convenience sample of 150 participants in a lung cancer screening and tobacco cessation program. The survey consisted of 3 parts: (1) changes in tobacco use, (2) impact and coping strategies toward COVID-19, and (3) COVID-19 exposure and use of protective measures. Demographic variables included age, sex, race/ethnicity, and marital status. <b>Results:</b> All 150 participants who were contacted agreed to participate in this cross-sectional survey. The statistically significant correlates of increased tobacco use were high uncertainty about the future (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001), loneliness because of social distancing or self-isolating (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001), anger or frustration with how the pandemic has disrupted daily life (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001), boredom resulting from inability to work or engage in regular daily activities/routines (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001), desire to cope using alcohol or drugs (<i>P</i>=0.002), sadness or feelings of hopelessness (<i>P</i>=0.003), and worry or fear about challenges to securing basic needs such as groceries or medication (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001). In contrast, those who smoked less were more likely to practice social distancing (<i>P</i>=0.002) and use protective measures (<i>P</i>=0.005). <b>Conclusion:</b> Among those who decreased or stopped smoking, correlates included greater use of protective measures for COVID-19, including social distancing and testing. These data may aid healthcare providers to identify and provide counsel to cigarette smokers at greater risks for increasing tobacco consumption during stresses such as COVID-19.","Mejia, Zoorob, Levine, Huang, Hennekens","https://doi.org/10.31486/toj.21.0082","20220401","COVID-19; smoking; smoking cessation; tobacco cessation; tobacco smoking","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29495,""
"Impact of Isolation During the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Patient Burden of Parkinson's Disease: A PMD Alliance Survey","As the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in social restrictions around the globe, this cross-sectional survey aimed to assess the impact of social isolation on self- or proxy-reported symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) during the pandemic. The survey was distributed among 7109 subscribers of the Parkinson and Movement Disorders Alliance (PMD Alliance) News and Information list and was open only to people with PD (PwP) and care partners (CP, defined as main caregivers of PwP and serving as proxy respondents). No attempt was made to identify PwP and CP pairs. The survey was distributed online using Survey Monkey between 01/06/2021 and 02/27/2021. Respondents were grouped by level of social support from outside of their household during the pandemic (decreased or maintained [ie, the same as pre-pandemic or increased]). Of 7109 invited participants, 718Ã‚Â responded to the survey (response rate 10.1%). PwP (self-reports) accounted for 70.6% of respondents and CP (proxy reports) for 29.4%. Decreased social support from outside of the household during the COVID-19 pandemic (58.5% of all responses) was significantly associated with increases in sadness/depression and anxiety, compared with maintained levels of social support (p &lt; 0.0001 for both comparisons). It was also associated with increased burden of several non-motor (decline in memory, problem solving, or communication, p = 0.0009; new or worsening confusion, p &lt; 0.0001; new or worsening delusions, p = 0.018) and motor PD symptoms. Decline in social support from outside of the household during the COVID-19 pandemic showed a statistically significant and negative association with the burden of mood and non-motor symptoms of PD. These results call for increased vigilance towards non-motor symptoms in PwP experiencing social isolation and highlight the need for stronger provider focus on encouraging PwP and their CPs to build and maintain social connections and engagements.","Hermanowicz, Ospina, Torres-Yaghi, Gould, Papesh, Rivera, Miller, Jones, Musick, May","https://doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S351691","20220401","COVID-19; ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease; anxiety; depression; non-motor symptoms; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29496,""
"Obesity and lipid metabolism disorders determine the risk for development of long COVID syndrome: a cross-sectional study from 50,402 COVID-19 patients","Metabolic disorders have been identified as major risk factors for severe acute courses of COVID-19. With decreasing numbers of infections in many countries, the long COVID syndrome (LCS) represents the next major challenge in pandemic management, warranting the precise definition of risk factors for LCS development. We identified 50,402 COVID-19 patients in the Disease Analyzer database (IQVIA) featuring data from 1056 general practices in Germany. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors for the development of LCS. Of the 50,402 COVID-19 patients included into this analysis, 1,708 (3.4%) were diagnosed with LCS. In a multivariate regression analysis, we identified lipid metabolism disorders (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.28-1.65, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and obesity (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.08-1.44, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.003) as strong risk factors for the development of LCS.

"Therapist disclosure to combat COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy: a narrative review","With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019-2020 and the rapid development of vaccines to prevent this disease came a rise in interest around vaccine hesitancy. Naturally, methods of combatting vaccine hesitancy and increasing vaccination rates are of paramount importance. One such method is building upon the trust and openness of one's relationship with their healthcare provider. Specifically, this paper examines how psychotherapist self-disclosure could facilitate effective health behaviors in patients, focusing on vaccines. Traditionally, mental health therapists have been encouraged to avoid self-disclosure of personal information due to the possibility of unbalancing or damaging the therapeutic relationship. However, research from medicine and other disciplines suggests that personal recommendation, self-disclosure of vaccination status, and expert encouragement may be effective methods of addressing vaccine hesitancy. In addition, recommendations for therapists in discussing vaccination and in working with vaccine-hesitant patients are provided.","Cannity","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10865-022-00305-6","20220331","COVID; Psychotherapy; Self-disclosure; Transparency; Vaccine hesitancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29498,""
"Emotional and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms of preterm vs full-term children during COVID-19 pandemic restrictions","Preterm children are at higher risk of developing mental health problems than full-term children. Deterioration of children's mental health was observed during COVID-19 pandemic restrictive measures. Our study compared emotional and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms during school closure between preterm and full-term children. Data from two French birth cohorts-ELFE and EPIPAGE-2-were used. In 2011, infants born Ã¢â€°Â¥22 weeks' gestation were recruited. Parents completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire when the children were 9 years old and experiencing school closure. Multivariate multinomial logistic regression models were used. Subjects included 4164 full-term and 1119 preterm children. In univariate analyses, compared to full-term children: extremely and very preterm children more frequently had abnormal and borderline ADHD scores (odds ratio [OR] 1.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.50-2.30, OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.08-1.85, respectively) and abnormal emotional scores (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.43-2.40); moderate to late preterm children more often had abnormal ADHD scores (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.01-1.78). The associations did not remain when previous symptoms at 5 years old were considered. School closure during lockdown did not appear toÃ‚Â increase the risk of mental health problems in preterm compared to full-term children. Preterm children are at higher risk of developing mental health problems than full-term children. Deterioration in children's mental health was observed during COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. However, whether preterm children were a particularly vulnerable subgroup during school closure is unclear. In univariate analyses, extremely and very preterm children more often had abnormal and borderline ADHD symptoms and abnormal emotional symptom scores than full-term children. The associations did not remain significantly associated when previous symptoms were considered. Preterm compared to full-term children more often suffer from ADHD and emotional symptoms, but school closure during lockdown did not appear to increase this risk.","Bailhache, Monnier, Moulin, Thierry, Vandentorren, CÃƒÂ´tÃƒÂ©, Falissard, Simeon, Geay, Marchand, Dufourg, Charles, Ancel, Melchior, Rouquette, Galera, Bajos, Carrat, Ancel, Charles, Jusot, Martin, Meyer, PailhÃƒÂ©, Roquette, Severi, Sprire, Touvier, Zins","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-022-02037-4","20220331","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29499,""
"Impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on patients with chronic pain: multicenter study in Korea","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused significant changes. This study aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on patients with chronic pain. Patients with chronic pain from 23 university hospitals in South Korea participated in this study. The anonymous survey questionnaire consisted of 25 questions regarding the following: demographic data, diagnosis, hospital visit frequency, exercise duration, time outside, sleep duration, weight change, nervousness and anxiety, depression, interest or pleasure, fatigue, daily life difficulties, and self-harm thoughts. Depression severity was evaluated using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the relationship between increased pain and patient factors. A total of 914 patients completed the survey, 35.9% of whom had decreased their number of visits to the hospital, mostly due to COVID-19. The pain level of 200 patients has worsened since the COVID-19 outbreak, which was more prominent in complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Noticeable post-COVID-19 changes such as exercise duration, time spent outside, sleep patterns, mood, and weight affected patients with chronic pain. Depression severity was more significant in patients with CRPS. The total PHQ-9 average score of patients with CRPS was 15.5, corresponding to major depressive orders. The patients' decreased exercise duration, decreased sleep duration, and increased depression were significantly associated with increased pain. COVID-19 has caused several changes in patients with chronic pain. During the pandemic, decreased exercise and sleep duration and increased depression were associated with patients' increasing pain.","John, Lim, Hong, Jeong, Choi, Park, Kim, Kim, Kim","https://doi.org/10.3344/kjp.2022.35.2.209","20220331","COVID-19; Chronic Pain; Complex Regional Pain Syndrome; Coronavirus; Depression; Fatigue; Pandemics; Physical Distancing; Sleep; Social Isolation; Surveys and Questionnaires.","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29500,""
"Relationships Between Physical Activity, Boredom Proneness, and Subjective Well-Being Among UK Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic","This investigation sought to examine physical activity (PA) as a potential determinant of chronic boredom and associated well-being within the context of COVID-related restrictions. A representative sample of U.K. adults (N = 1,521) completed a survey on June 1, 2020. Bivariate analyses demonstrated that individuals who met guidelines and maintained or increased PA scored higher on life satisfaction, worthwhileness, and happiness and lower on anxiety (i.e.,Ã‚Â indicators of well-being) and boredom proneness (d = 0.13-0.43). Boredom proneness was correlated with all indicators of well-being (r = .38-.54). A series of regression models revealed that PA predicted lower boredom proneness and better life satisfaction, worthwhileness, and happiness. Boredom proneness accounted for the covariance between PA and well-being.

"Post-traumatic stress disorder in patients with rheumatic disease during the COVID-19 outbreak: a cross-sectional case-control study in China","The COVID-19 pandemic is not only a traumatic event, but a collective stressor unfolding over time, causing devastating implications for the mental health. This study aimed to shed light on the mental health status of patients with rheumatic disease (RD) during the massive outbreak of COVID-19 in China, especially the prevalence and severity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) compared with healthy individuals. A total of 486 patients with RD and 486 age-matched and sex-matched healthy individuals were recruited into the study. For each participant, we collected demographic and clinical characteristics data. The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and four items from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were used to investigate the prevalence and severity of PTSD and sleep quality, respectively. Compared with healthy control subjects (n=486), patients with RD (n=486) had a higher prevalence of PTSD (12.1% vs 4.1%; p&lt;0.001). Higher total scores on the PCL-5 and on all four items from the PSQI (pÃ¢â€°Â¤0.001) were also observed. Female, old age, poor sleep quality, long duration of RD, poor subjective evaluation of the disease and pessimistic subjective perception of the epidemic were identified as risk factors of PTSD in patients with RD during the COVID-19 epidemic. During the COVID-19 outbreak, patients with RD presented a higher prevalence and severity of PTSD and showed more sleep disturbances. Our findings confirm the importance of psychological assessment and mental healthcare out of regular clinical care for patients with RD during the pandemic.","Wu, Geng, Shang, Wang, Lu, Ma, Liu, Xu","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-049749","20220401","COVID-19; MENTAL HEALTH; RHEUMATOLOGY; COVID-19; Case-Control Studies; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Pandemics; Rheumatic Diseases; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29502,""
"Patients presenting to an acute general hospital with acute mental health needs: a retrospective observational cohort study","To examine the numbers and patterns of patients presenting to an urban acute general hospital with acute mental health presentations and to further investigate any variation related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Retrospective observational cohort study. An urban acute general hospital in London, UK, comprising of five sites and two emergency departments. The hospital provides tertiary level general acute care but is not an acute mental health services provider. There is an inpatient liaison psychiatry service. 358Ã¢â‚¬â€°131 patients attended the emergency departments of our acute general hospital during the study period. Of these, 14Ã¢â‚¬â€°871 patients attended with an acute mental health presentation. A further 14Ã¢â‚¬â€°947 patients attending with a physical illness were also noted to have a concurrent recorded mental health diagnosis. Large numbers of patients present to our acute general hospital with mental health illness even though the organisation does not provide mental health services other than inpatient liaison psychiatry. There was some variation in the numbers and patterns of presentations related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Patient numbers reduced to a mean of 9.13 (SD 3.38) patients presenting per day during the first 'lockdown' compared with 10.75 (SD 1.96) patients per day in an earlier matched time period (t=3.80, p&lt;0.01). Acute mental health presentations following the third lockdown increased to a mean of 13.84Ã¢â‚¬â€°a day. Large numbers of patients present to our acute general hospital with mental health illness. This suggests a need for appropriate resource, staffing and training to address the needs of these patients in a non-mental health provider organisation and subsequent appropriate transfer for timely treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting lockdowns have resulted in variation in the numbers and patterns of patients presenting with acute mental health illness but these presentations are not new. Considerable work is still needed to provide integrated care which addresses the physical and mental healthcare needs of patients presenting to acute and general hospitals.","Cann, Barter, Battle, Schwenck, Anakwe","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-059102","20220401","COVID-19; accident &amp; emergency medicine; health policy; mental health; COVID-19; Communicable Disease Control; Hospitals, General; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Retrospective Studies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29503,""
"Psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and shielding in adults and children with early-onset neuromuscular and neurological disorders and their families: a mixed-methods study","To describe and evaluate the psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures to reduce the risk of transmission on patients with early-onset neuromuscular and neurological disorders (NMDs) and their families. A mixed-methods study in which data were collected between 17 September 2020 and 31 December 2020 using a semi-structured telephone questionnaire developed specifically to meet research aims, and were analysed using quantitative methods and qualitative inductive thematic analysis. Forty questionnaires were completed by patients with NMDs (eg, muscular dystrophies, spinal muscular atrophy) or their parent. 70% (n=28) of patients were male, aged 2-48 years. 90% (n=36) were wheelchair users; 72.5% (n=29) required long-term non-invasive or tracheostomy ventilation. Strict adherence to risk mitigation strategies, for example, shielding, were reported at the start of the pandemic. Over half continued some or all measures after official limitations were relaxed. 67.5% (n=27) reported changes to personal care assistance arrangements including temporary cessation of outside carers. Three themes were identified: (1) Concern regarding the health impact of COVID-19; (2) Perceptions of strategies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission; (3) Psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The level and pervasiveness of frequently reported negative psychological effects, for example, anxiety and fear fluctuated, and were related to the perceived risk of COVID-19, concern about attending hospital, and perceived lack of access to intensive care management if severe COVID-19 infection occurred. Support, particularly from family and healthcare services, were considered to have positive psychosocial effects. Measures to reduce transmission of COVID-19 have greatly affected patients with NMDs and their families. For most, negative psychosocial impacts have and will continue to improve, but this may depend on the incidence of further pandemic waves. Consistent, up-to-date and accessible information on clinical outcomes and risk mitigation must be provided to support patients' physical and mental well-being.","Spurr, Tan, Wakeman, Chatwin, Hughes, Simonds","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-055430","20220401","COVID-19; MENTAL HEALTH; Neuromuscular disease; Paediatric neurology; QUALITATIVE RESEARCH; Risk management; Adolescent; Adult; COVID-19; Child; Child, Preschool; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nervous System Diseases; Pandemics; Parents; SARS-CoV-2; Young Adult","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29504,""
"Opioid treatment program safety measures during the COVID-19 pandemic: a statewide survey","Opioid treatment programs (OTPs) serve as daily essential services for people with opioid use disorder. This study seeks to identify modifications to operations and adoption of safety measures at Pennsylvania OTPs during the COVID-19 pandemic. A 25-min online survey to clinical and administrative directors at all 103 state-licensed OTPs in Pennsylvania was fielded from September to November 2020. Survey domains included: 1) changes to services, client volume, hours and staffing during the COVID-19 pandemic 2) types of services modifications 3) safety protocols to reduce COVID-19 transmission 4) challenges to operations during the pandemic. Forty-seven directors responded, for a response rate of 45%. Almost all respondents reported making some service modification (96%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°43). Almost half (47%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°21) of respondents reported reductions in the number of clients served. OTPs were more likely to adopt safety protocols that did not require significant funding, such as limiting the number of people entering the site (100%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°44), posting COVID-safety information (100%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°44), enforcing social distancing (98%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°43), and increasing sanitation (100%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°44). Only 34% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°14) of OTPS provided N95 masks to most or all staff. Respondents reported that staff's stress and negative mental health (86%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°38) and staff caregiving responsibilities (84%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°37) during the pandemic were challenges to maintaining OTP operations. OTPs faced numerous challenges to operations and adoption of safety measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Funding mechanisms and interventions to improve adoption of safety protocols, staff mental health as well as research on patient experiences and preferences can inform further OTP adaptation to the COVID-19 pandemic and future emergency planning.","Bandara, Maniates, Hulsey, Smith, DiDomenico, Stuart, Saloner, Krawczyk","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-022-07832-7","20220401","COVID-19; Opioid use disorder; Substance use disorder treatment; Analgesics, Opioid; COVID-19; Humans; Opioid-Related Disorders; Pandemics; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29505,""

"Youth Well-being During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The family stress model proposes economic hardship results in caregiver distress and relational problems, which negatively impact youth outcomes. We extend this model to evaluate the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic-related family hardships on caregiver and youth stress, and, in turn, youth's psychological well-being. We also investigate how social supports moderate this relationship. We used 2 samples of cross-sectional survey data collected between May 2020 and May 2021: children aged 2 to 12 years (n = 977) and adolescents aged 11 to 17 years (n = 669). Variables included pandemic-related family hardships, stress, social support, and youth life satisfaction. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Experiencing more pandemic-related family hardships was associated with increased caregiver and youth stress (b = 0.04 to 0.21, SE = 0.01-0.02) and, in turn, decreased youth life satisfaction (b = -0.36 to -0.38, SE = 0.04-0.07). Social connectedness (b^ = 0.11-0.17, SE = 0.04) and family engagement (b^ = 0.12-0.18, SE = 0.05-0.06) had direct positive associations with life satisfaction; for children aged 2 to 12 years, greater family engagement was associated with decreased effect of child stress on life satisfaction (b^ = 0.15, SE = 0.05). For adolescents, females had higher levels of stress compared with males (b^ = 0.40, SE = 0.6), and having anxiety and/or depression was associated with decreased life satisfaction (b^ = -0.24, SE = 0.11). Caregivers and youth who experienced more coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic hardships had higher levels of stress, particularly adolescent females. Although stress negatively impacted life satisfaction across all ages, family engagement was a protective factor for children aged 2 to 12 years, whereas having anxiety and/or depression was a risk factor for adolescents. For all youth, however, being more socially connected and engaged with family promoted life satisfaction.","Blackwell, Mansolf, Sherlock, Ganiban, Hofheimer, Barone, Bekelman, Blair, Cella, Collazo, Croen, Deoni, Elliott, Ferrara, Fry, Gershon, Herbstman, Karagas, LeWinn, Margolis, Miller, O'Shea, Porucznik, Wright","https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2021-054754","20220401","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29507,""
"Urban green space interaction and wellbeing - investigating the experience of international students in Berlin during the first COVID-19 lockdown","This qualitative study explores the topic of mental health/wellbeing with reference to exposure to urban green space (UGS). It builds on previous research, which has highlighted the potential for green space interaction for supporting positive emotional and mental wellbeing, particularly in times of stress and uncertainty. Using this basis, the paper explores whether UGS interaction also helped to mitigate the negative mental health impacts brought about by the first COVID-19 lockdown. The specific focus is on students and expatriates living in Berlin, Germany as this population groupbecame increasingly vulnerable during this time as a result of uncertainty and restrictions in their daily lives brought about the enforced lockdown measures. More specifically, this paper investigates how a change in their daily routines created opportunities to interact with and experience UGS differently and how their emotional response and perception towards these spaces changed. Semi-structured interviews allowed for stories, experiences and emotions to unfold, which revealed that the participants' gained an appreciation for the potential of UGS to support their wellbeing during a stressful and isolating time. UGS interaction also allowed them to form tangible memories of summer 2020 as it provided a safe arena for them to maintain social contact with friends outdoors, or to escape their home environment and experience respite and relaxation in a natural setting. The findings demonstrate that for this sub-group of the population UGS became a reliable constant and a valuable public health resource, which may also help to mitigate the long-term adverse mental health impacts of the pandemic.","Collins, Haase, Heiland, Kabisch","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2022.127543","20220401","Mental Health; Restoration; Stress reduction; Urban green space; pandemic; students; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29508,""
"The Effect of Work Connectivity Behavior After-Hours on Employee Psychological Distress: The Role of Leader Workaholism and Work-to-Family Conflict","The work connectivity behavior after-hours (WCBA) has become increasingly intense among Chinese employees in recent years, especially in the rapidly developed internet industry. This has made the after-hours work connectivity behavior, a popular topic in the organizational psychology field. Based on boundary theory, we explored the mechanism of after-hour work connectivity behavior on employees' psychological distress and identified the work-to-family conflict (WFC) as mediator. Besides, leader characteristics are essential environmental variables and always play as moderators, among which leader workaholism is prevalent in the internet industry. However, the impact of leader workaholism on employees' behavior is still inconsistent and even contradictory. Thus, this study further examines the moderating effect of leader workaholism between the after-hour work connectivity behavior and employees' psychological distress. We conducted a multitime, multisource questionnaire survey in Internet companies in China. Before collecting the data, all participants were assured that their responses would be confidential and used only for academic research. At time 1, the team leader rated his or her workaholism, and team members rated WCBA. At time 2 (3 weeks later), team members were asked to complete the questionnaire containing scales of WFC, psychological distress. The two rounds of data collection resulted in 211 matched team leader-team member responses. We performed a path analysis using Mplus 7.4. Both the duration and frequency of WCBA can positively predict employees' psychological distress through WFC (the mediating effect = 0.628, 95% CI = [0.593, 0.663]). Specifically, WCBA can increase the level of WFC, which leads to the employees' psychological distress further. Leader workaholism can negatively moderate the relationship between WCBA and WFC, further moderating the mediating effect of WFC. Work-to-family conflict played as a mediator in the relationship between WCBA and employees' psychological distress. These results may be helpful to recognize the negative effect of WCBA and the role of leader workaholism in the relationship.","Dong, Zhang, Li, Ren","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.722679","20220401","leader workaholism; mental health; psychological distress; work connectivity behavior after-hours; work-to-family conflict; COVID-19; Family Conflict; Female; Humans; Male; Psychological Distress; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29509,""
"The Effectiveness of a Serious Game (MemoreBox) for Cognitive Functioning Among Seniors in Care Facilities: Field Study","Serious games have been found to have enhancing and preventative effects on cognitive abilities in healthy older adults. Yet, there are few results on the effects in older seniors with age-related low cognitive impairments. Their special needs were considered when designing and using innovate technology in the area of prevention, which is especially relevant owing to the continuously aging population. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of a serious game on the cognitive abilities of seniors in order to potentially implement innovative resource-oriented technological interventions that can help to meet future challenges. In this controlled trial, we tested the serious game MemoreBox, which features modules specifically designed for seniors in nursing homes. Over a period of 1 year, we tested the cognitive abilities of 1000 seniors at 4 time points using the Mini-Mental Status Test. Only half of the participating seniors engaged with the serious game. The study included an intervention group (n=56) and a control group (did not play; n=55). Based on the in-game data collection, a second intervention group (n=38) was identified within the original intervention group, which exactly followed the planned protocol. There were no noteworthy differences between the demographic and main variables of the overall sample. The large reduction in the sample size was due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic (drop-out rate: 88.9%). The CI was set at 5%. Mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) between the cognitive abilities of the intervention and control groups did not show a statistically significant difference between time and group (F<sub>2.710,295.379</sub>=1.942; P=.13; partial ÃŽÂ·Ã‚Â²=0.018). We noted approximately the same findings for mixed ANOVA between the cognitive abilities of the second intervention and control groups (F<sub>3,273</sub>=2.574; P=.054; partial ÃŽÂ·Ã‚Â²=0.028). However, we did observe clear tendencies and a statistically significant difference between the 2 groups after 9 months of the intervention (t<sub>88.1</sub>=-2.394; P=.02). The results of this study show similarities with the current research situation. Moreover, the data indicate that the intervention can have an effect on the cognitive abilities of seniors, provided that they regularly play the serious game of MemoreBox. The small sample size means that the tendency toward improvement cannot be proven as statistically significant. However, the tendency shown warrants further research. Establishing an effective prevention tool as part of standard care in nursing homes by means of an easy-to-use serious game would be a considerable contribution to the weakened health care system in Germany as it would offer a means of activating senior citizens in partially and fully inpatient care facilities.

"Physician Burnout and the Electronic Health Record Leading Up to and During the First Year of COVID-19: Systematic Review","Physician burnout was first documented in 1974, and the electronic health record (EHR) has been known to contribute to the symptoms of physician burnout. Authors pondered the extent of this effect, recognizing the increased use of telemedicine during the first year of COVID-19. The aim of this review was to objectively analyze the literature over the last 5 years for empirical evidence of burnout incident to the EHR and to identify barriers to, facilitators to, and associated patient satisfaction with using the EHR to improve symptoms of burnout. No human participants were involved in this review; however, 100% of participants in studies analyzed were adult physicians. We queried 4 research databases and 1 targeted journal for studies commensurate with the objective statement from January 1, 2016 through January 31, 2021 (n=25). The hours spent in documentation and workflow are responsible for the sense of loss of autonomy, lack of work-life balance, lack of control of one's schedule, cognitive fatigue, a general loss of autonomy, and poor relationships with colleagues. Researchers have identified training, local customization of templates and workflow, and the use of scribes as strategies to alleviate the administrative burden of the EHR and decrease symptoms of burnout. The solutions provided in the literature only addressed 2 of the 3 factors (workflow and documentation time) but not the third factor (usability). Practitioners and administrators should focus on the former 2 factors because they are within their sphere of control. EHR vendors should focus on empirical evidence to identify and improve the usability features with the greatest impact. Researchers should design experiments to explore solutions that address all 3 factors of the EHR that contribute to burnout.

"People Who Die by Suicide Without Receiving Mental Health Services: A Systematic Review","The majority of people who die by suicide have never seen a mental health professional or been diagnosed with a mental illness. To date, this majority group has largely been ignored, with most existing research focusing on predictors of suicide such as past suicide attempts. Identifying the characteristics of people who die by suicide without receiving services, often with a fatal first attempt, is crucial to reduce suicide rates through guiding improvements to service pathways and ""just in time"" interventions. In this systematic review, PsycInfo, PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science were searched for peer-reviewed articles published from 1980 to 1st March 2021. Included studies examined predictors of non-receipt of formal mental health services among people who died by suicide. Data were extracted from published reports and the quality of included studies was assessed using a modified version of the Joanna Briggs Institute Checklist for Analytical Cross Sectional Studies. This review was registered with PROSPERO, CRD 42021226543. Sixty-seven studies met inclusion criteria, with sample sizes ranging from 39 to 193,152 individuals. Male sex, younger or older age, and rural location were consistently associated with non-receipt of mental health services. People not receiving mental health services were also less likely to have a psychiatric diagnosis, past suicidal behavior or contact with general health services, and more likely to use violent means of suicide. There was some evidence that minority ethnicity and psychosocial stressors were associated with service non-receipt. People who die by suicide without receiving mental health services are likely to have diverse profiles, indicating the need for multifaceted approaches to effectively support people at risk of suicide. Identifying the needs and preferences of individuals who are at risk of suicide is crucial in developing new support pathways and services, and improving the quality of existing services. http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.asp?ID=CRD42021226543.","Tang, Reily, Arena, Batterham, Calear, Carter, Mackinnon, Christensen","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.736948","20220401","coronial data; healthcare utilization; mental health services; suicide; systematic review; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Health Services; Rural Population","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29512,""
"Assessment of Financial Toxicity Among Patients With Advanced Lung Cancer in Western China","<b>Background:</b> Lung cancer is the leading source of cancer-caused disability-adjusted life years. Medical cost burden impacts the well-being of patients through reducing income, cutting daily expenses, curtailing leisure activities, and depleting exhausting savings. The COmprehensive Score for Financial Toxicity (COST) was created and validated by De Souza and colleagues. Our study intends to measure the financial burdens of cancer therapy and investigate the link between financial toxicity and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in an advanced lung cancer population. <b>Methods:</b> Patients aged Ã¢â€°Â¥ 18 years with confirmed stage III to IV lung cancer were eligible. The COST questionnaire verified by de Souza et al. was used to identify financial toxicity. Multivariable linear regression analysis with log transformation univariate analysis and Pearson correlations were used to perform the analysis. <b>Results:</b> The majority of the patients (90.8%, <i>n</i> = 138/152) had an annual income of $50,000 ($7,775). The cohort's insurance situation was as follows: 64.5% of the cohort had social insurance, 20.4% had commercial insurance, and 22.0% had both. Patients who were younger age (50-59, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), employed but on sick leave, and had lower income reported increased levels of financial toxicity (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). The risk factors for high financial toxicity: (i) younger age (50-59), (ii) &lt;1 month of savings, and (iii) being employed but on sick leave. Increased financial toxicity is moderately correlated with a decrease in QoL. <b>Conclusion:</b> Poorer psychological status and specific demographics are linked to increased financial toxicity (lower COST). Financial toxicity has a modest relationship with HRQoL and may have a clear link with HRQoL measurements.","Xu, Xu, Xi, Zhang, Zhou, Chang, Yang, Zhang, Wang, Ju, Yang, Chen, Che, Chen, Qu, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.754199","20220401","financial burden; financial toxicity; health-related quality of life (HRQL); lung cancer; medical cost; Adolescent; COVID-19; China; Cost of Illness; Financial Stress; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Quality of Life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29513,""
"Change in Work-Related Income Following the Uptake of Treatment for Mental Disorders Among Young Migrant and Non-migrant Women in Norway: A National Register Study","<b>Background:</b> Women, and migrant women in particular, are at increased risk of many common mental disorders, which may potentially impact their labor market participation and their work-related income. Previous research found that mental disorders are associated with several work-related outcomes such as loss of income, however, not much is known about how this varies with migrant background. This study investigated the change in work-related income following the uptake of outpatient mental healthcare (OPMH) treatment, a proxy for mental disorder, in young women with and without migrant background. Additionally, we looked at how the association varied by income level. <b>Methods:</b> Using data from four national registries, the study population consisted of women aged 23-40 years residing in Norway for at least three consecutive years between 2006 and 2013 (N = 640,527). By using a stratified linear regression with individual fixed effects, we investigated differences between majority women, descendants and eight migrant groups. Interaction analysis was conducted in order to examine differences in income loss following the uptake of OPMH treatment among women with and without migrant background. <b>Results:</b> Results showed that OPMH treatment was associated with a decrease in income for all groups. However, the negative effect was stronger among those with low income. Only migrant women from Western and EU Eastern Europe with a high income were not significantly affected following OPMH treatment. <b>Conclusion:</b> Experiencing a mental disorder during a critical age for establishment in the labor market can negatively affect not only income, but also future workforce participation, and increase dependency on social welfare services and other health outcomes, regardless of migrant background. Loss of income due to mental disorders can also affect future mental health, resulting in a vicious circle and contributing to more inequalities in the society.","Hynek, Hollander, Liefbroer, Hauge, Straiton","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.736624","20220401","early adulthood; income; mental disorder; migrant women; national register data; outpatient mental health care; Adult; COVID-19; Female; Humans; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Norway; Transients and Migrants; Young Adult","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29514,""
"Attempted Suicide in the Older Adults: A Case Series From the Psychiatry Ward of the University Hospital Maggiore Della CaritÃƒÂ , Novara, Italy","<b>Introduction:</b> As suicide rates increase with age, it is mandatory to carefully assess old age suicidal behaviors. Our aim was to describe the main socio-demographic and clinical features of a sample of suicide attempters aged 65 years and older, and to assess differences within the sample (men vs. women; patients with vs. without a previous history of suicide attempt; patients with vs. without a previous psychiatric history). <b>Methods:</b> Retrospective study conducted at the Maggiore della CaritÃƒ University Hospital, Novara, Italy. <b>Results:</b> A higher percentage of female patients in our sample were treated by or referred to mental health services, while a greater percentage of male patients required a prolonged clinical observation in the Emergency Room (ER) or in non-psychiatric wards before psychiatric admission. The percentage of patients without previous psychiatric history taking anxiolytic and sedative medications was 25%. <b>Conclusion:</b> It is likely that different clusters and types of suicide attempters exist. Women in our sample appeared more proactive in asking for help, and more likely to be already treated by or referred to a psychiatric service, suggesting the need to facilitate the access to psychiatric services for the male population aged 65 years and older, or to offer support and care for the non-psychiatric reasons (comorbidities, pain, and loss of autonomy) possibly underlying suicidal behavior in this specific group. The use of medications deserves more attention considering the possible critical diagnostic issues in this age group.","Gramaglia, Martelli, Scotti, Bestagini, Gambaro, Romero, Zeppegno","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.732284","20220401","Psychiatry Ward; elderly; gender; multiple attempters; suicide attempt; Aged; COVID-19; Female; Hospitals, University; Humans; Italy; Male; Psychiatry; Retrospective Studies; Suicide, Attempted","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-02","",29515,""
