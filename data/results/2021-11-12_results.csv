"Frontline Healthcare workers suffering from psychosomatic disorders during COVID-19 (a pandemic): A Systematic review","Purpose: The emergence of SARS CoV-2, has imposed high pressure on the healthcare system worldwide. As a consequence, frontline healthcare workers were impacted widely. The aim of this systematic review is to examine the impact of COVID-19 on mental status of FHW during pandemic. Methods: Databases such as PubMed, Scopus, google scholar were searched extensively from the date of inception till April 2021. All cross-sectional studies published in English assessing the mental condition and well-being of frontline caregivers during COVID-19 were included in the study. The quality assessment was done by Newcastle Ottawa scale. Results: Ten thousand eight hundred sixty-nine articles were found. After conscientious literature search, total 78 articles were included satisfying the objective of the review. The highest and lowest values for the rates of depression, anxiety and insomnia was found to be 99.51% & 6.07%, 85.7% & 73.6%, and 5.3% & 11.4%, respectively. Conclusion: It has been found that FHW were psychologically impacted by the pandemic. This could be due to lack of resources such as PPE, organizational support, inefficient relevant knowledge regarding the novel virus, its extremely indelible transmission rates, fear of contamination, stigmatization, and/or due to prevalence of ignorance by government and health policy makers.

"Drawing lessons on better governing for emergencies for improved resilience against health emergencies","The COVID-19 pandemic has taught us that preparednessfor and resilience against health emergencies is critical. To improve preparedness for health emergencies, the emergency preparedness and response governance architecture at all levels should be strengthened. It should be based on cross-cutting, whole-of-government, and whole-of-society approaches, moving away from siloed perspectives. Moreover, resilience against health emergencies should be based on universal health coverage and anchored in the International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005 core capacities implementation. Capacities and capabilities that are required to improve health services for national and global health security should also be strengthened.","European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, Nitzan, Dorit, Perehinets, Ihor, Meyer, J.

"Uncertainty management in organizational crisis communication: the impact of crisis responsibility uncertainty and attribution-based emotions on publics' further crisis information seeking","PurposeAlthough uncertainty has been identified as a key crisis characteristic and a multi-faceted construct essential to effective crisis management research and practice, only a few studies examined publics' perceived uncertainty with a focus on crisis severity uncertainty, leaving crisis responsibility uncertainty uninvestigated in organizational crisis settings.Design/methodology/approachTo close this research gap empirically, this study employed data from an online survey of a total of 817 US adults to examine how participants' crisis responsibility uncertainty and their attribution-based crisis emotions might impact their crisis responses such as further crisis information seeking.FindingsFirst, findings show that participants' crisis responsibility uncertainty was negatively associated with their attribution-independent (AI) crisis emotions (i.e. anxiety, fear, apprehension and sympathy) and external-attribution-dependent (EAD) crisis emotions (i.e. disgust, contempt, anger and sadness), but positively associated with internal-attribution-dependent (IAD) crisis emotions (i.e. guilt, embarrassment and shame). Second, crisis responsibility uncertainty and AI crisis emotions were positive predictors for participants' further crisis information seeking. Third, AI crisis emotions and IAD crisis emotions were parallel mediators for the relationship between participants' crisis responsibility uncertainty and their further crisis information seeking.Practical implicationsOrganizations need to pay attention to the perceived uncertainty about crisis responsibility and attribution-based crisis emotions since they can impact the decision of seeking crisis information during an ongoing organizational crisis.Originality/valueThis study improves uncertainty management in organizational crisis communication research and practice, connecting crisis responsibility uncertainty, attribution-based crisis emotions and publics' crisis information seeking.","Yen-I, Lee, Lu, Xuerong, Jin, Yan","https://doi.org/10.1108/JCOM-02-2021-0018","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of Communication Management; 25(4):437-453, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Communication Management; 25(4):437-453, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-12","",21794,""
"Health-Related Quality of Life in patients with Checkpoint Inhibitor Enterocolitis","IntroductionImmune checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) have transformed the treatment of many advanced cancers but cause immune related adverse events including enterocolitis (CPI-E). The conventional inflammatory bowel diseases ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohnâ€™s disease (CD) are associated with unfavourable health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes, but there are currently no data on HRQoL in the setting of CPI-E. This study aimed to investigate HRQoL in CPI-E.MethodsA prospective study was conducted across two London hospital trusts between February-April 2021. UC, CD and CPI-E patient cohorts were recruited from outpatient clinics and the biologic infusion unit. Disease activity was assessed using non-invasive scoring systems: modified-Partial Mayo Score (m-PMS), modified-Harvey Bradshaw Index (m-HBI), Simple Crohnâ€™s and Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI) and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). HRQoL outcomes were assessed using validated questionnaires: Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8), Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), IBD-Questionnaire (IBD-Q) and Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue (MAF).ResultsSeventy-five patients (33 CD, 21 UC, 21 CPI-E) were recruited. 33 CD patients (100%) and 20 UC patients (95.2%) were receiving biologic therapy. Thirteen CPI-E patients (61.9%) received Anti-PD1/PDL1 monotherapy and (38.1%) received combination anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapy. Twenty-four CD patients (72.7%), 11 UC patients (52.4%) and 16 CPI-E patients (76.2%) were shielding due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Using m-PMS, m-HBI, SCCAI and CTCAE, &gt;80% in each of the three cohorts were either classed as being in remission or having mild disease activity. Three CPI-E patients (14.3%) had moderate depression (PHQ-8 =10) and a further 9 (42.9%) had mild depression (PHQ-8 score 5-9). Nine CPI-E patients (42.9%) had significant fatigue (MAF score =30) and 6 (28.6%) had mild or moderate anxiety (GAD-7 =5). There were no significant differences in PHQ-8, GAD-7, IBD-Q and MAF between CPI-E, CD and UC patients, suggesting comparable levels of psychological morbidity in the three groups. Significant correlations were found between CPI-E disease activity and IBD-Q and GAD-7 scores.ConclusionOur study suggests that psychological morbidity in CPI-E is common and comparable to rates in CD and UC, even in the setting of clinical remission. Clinicians should be aware of this complication and take a holistic approach to this patient group.","Torkizadeh, Melissa, Hajir, Ibraheim, Radhakrishnan, Shiva, Larkin, James, Howson, William, Williams, Horace, Hicks, Lucy, Moulton, Calum D.; Alexander, James L.; Powell, Nick","https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2021-BSG.185","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Gut; 70(Suppl 4):A100, 2021.; Publication details: Gut; 70(Suppl 4):A100, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-12","",21795,""
"Investigating the effect of psychological capital on evidence-based clinical practice of nurses in dealing with patients with coronavirus disease: The mediating role of psychological security","Background: The coronavirus pandemic has caused fear and anxiety worldwide, especially amongst nurses. Examining the psychological effects of this disease on the mental health of nurses involved in the care of patients with this infection is critically important. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the nursesâ€™ psychology capital and their views on mental security, job satisfaction and clinical performance. Methods: One hundred consenting nurses from a university general hospital in Arak, Iran, completed three well-established questionnaires that asked about their psychology knowledge, views on mental security and clinical performance. The data were analyzed statistically, using confirmatory factor analysis and partial least squares method. Also, the path analysis test, t-test and regression beta coefficient were used to test the studyâ€™s four hypotheses on psychological capital and security. Results: The findings indicated that there were significant relationships, based on the theoretical model, amongst the nursesâ€™ views on their psychology knowledge (or capital) and that it had a positive and significant effect on nurses' psychological security for working with COVID-19 patients. Also, the knowledge positively impacted their clinical performance and professional efficacy, while improving their sense of optimism, patience and hope for future. Conclusions: There were positive interactions between the nursesâ€™ psychological capital and the clinical performance, mental security, optimism and hope. Nurses with psychology capital had less worries on these subjects than those who lacked it. Such nurses believed they were more resourceful and able to provide better care to patients with coronavirus infection than those who lacked the knowledge.

"Psychological distress among students of higher education due to e-learning crackup: moderating role of university support","Purpose: The emergence of electronic learning during the COVID-19 outbreak has been the way by which higher education has attempted to save the situation. However, e-learning still causes psychological distress because of its crackups and fear. Hence, the authors aim to study the impact of e-learning crackup on fear of academic year loss and psychological distress by incorporating university support as a moderator. Design/methodology/approach: Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) has been used to analyze data. Findings: The results depict that e-learning crackup fosters students' fear of academic year loss, but e-learning crackup has an insignificant impact on psychological distress. However, psychological distress is driven by fear of an academic year loss. Lastly, university support moderates the relationship between e-learning crackup and psychological distress, but no moderating role exists between fear of academic year loss and psychological distress. Originality/value: The recent pandemic has severely affected the mental health of students. Therefore, it is crucial to study the reasons that foster distress among them. But, unfortunately, there is a prominent absence of research for inspecting students' psychological distress because of the e-learning crisis, especially in the wake of COVID-19.

"Never waste a crisis!? - The impact of the covid-19 crisis on the mental health of EDM Djs","The COVID-19 crisis places an unprecedented strain on an industry already characterized by poor mental health due to challenging working conditions, including the difficulty of sustaining a living, anti-social working hours, exhaustion, and the inability to plan time and future. This article discusses the current mental health conditions of musicians in dealing with the exceptional situation through a retrospective perspective on those affected. Based on a qualitative interview study conducted with EDM DJs during the first lockdown in Germany, I use three exemplary cases to give insights into their individual experienced living environments and working conditions. I show how the COVID-19 crisis is related to their previous life situation, mental state, and personal self-perceptions as DJs. I further argue that the current crisis may not only have a negative impact on the (already poor) mental health of creative professionals but may also bring health-promoting potential.

All patients were =40 years of age. Commonest objects were long e.g. pens or high risk e.g. batteries/razors. However, a wider variety of objects were swallowed during the pandemic.Our outcomes reflect those in published data1, with most procedures successful when objects were known to be in the stomach.DFBI is often spontaneous and stress related, rather than a suicide attempt, on a background of complex personality disorder. It is thought DFBI gives a psychological â€˜gainâ€™ in forcing care, with multiple healthcare contacts resulting from the act2.Care plans are common in other forms of DSH but lacking in DFBI. These may benefit repeat attenders, ensuring endoscopy only performed when strictly necessary and minimising the psychological gain from the act.Mental health issues have increased during the pandemic, this has impacted on already stretched endoscopy services with increase in DFBI, possibly due to decreased access to psychiatric services. This act is resource intensive and difficult to manage, a care plan should be considered after admission with DFBI.4. Birk M et al.

"Sadness, Negativity, and Uncertainty in Education During COVID-19 on Social Media","The global COVID-19 pandemic increased social media usage to obtain information and to share concerns, feelings, and emotions, turning it into a prolific field of research through which it is possible to understand how audiences are coping with the multitude of recent challenges. This paper presents results from a social media analysis of 61532 education-related news headlines posted by the major daily news provider in Portugal, Sic NotÃ­cias, on Facebook, from January to December 2020. We focus on how the news impacted on audiencesâ€™ emotional response and discourse, and we analyze the key issues of the most commented news content. The results show a prevailing sadness among audiences and a very negative discourse all throughout 2020, with a high degree uncertainty being expressed. The main concerns revolved around parents supporting children in their first remote learning endeavors, financial sustainability, the lack of devices, the disinfection of schools, and the studentsâ€™ mobility, particularly in the non-higher education context.","Oliveira, Luciana, Silva, Paulino, Mesquita, Anabela, Arminda Sa, Sequeira, Oliveira, Adriana","https://doi.org/10.4018/IJOPCD.2022010103","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: International Journal of Online Pedagogy and Course Design; 12(1):1-21, 2022.; Publication details: International Journal of Online Pedagogy and Course Design; 12(1):1-21, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-12","",21801,""
"The symptom burden of irritable bowel syndrome in tertiary care during the Covid-19 pandemic","IntroductionRecent data on the natural history of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) highlight the prognostic importance of extra-intestinal and psychological symptom profiles. Those with a high psychological burden have been shown to have the worst prognosis, and are consequently most likely to be referred to tertiary care. The Covid-19 pandemic caused significant disruption to tertiary services and affected the mental health of the nation, however there is minimal data on the effects on patients with IBS in tertiary care. We therefore compared the symptom profiles of tertiary referrals with refractory IBS, 12-months before, and 12-months after the onset of Covid-19 restrictions in the UK.MethodsAs part of their routine care, all patients with refractory IBS referred to the tertiary service before and after the Covid-19 pandemic prospectively completed a series of questionnaires during their baseline consultation including;IBS symptom severity score (IBS-SSS), non-colonic symptom score, Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD), and Quality of Life (QoL). Demographic data and symptom profiles were compared between patients seen in the 12 months before the pandemic (22/03/2019 - 22/03/2020) with those seen in the 12-months after (23/03/2020 - 23/03/2021), using non-parametric tests.ResultsOverall, 190 patients (median age 43 years, n=157 (82.6%) female, 41.0% IBS-C, 24.7% IBS-D, IBS-M 33.7% and 0.5% IBS-U) with refractory IBS were included. Compared to those seen in the 12-months before the pandemic (n=107), the cohort seen during the Covid-19 pandemic (n=83) had a significantly higher median IBS-SSS (318 vs. 352, p=0.03), and more extra-intestinal symptoms (non-colonic score: 225 vs. 269, p=0.03). During the pandemic, median abdominal pain (50 vs. 63, p=0.05) and abdominal distension scores (60 vs. 75, p=0.008) were significantly higher, and patients that were unmarried had a higher median IBS symptom severity (IBS-SSS: 320 vs. 359, p=0.03). Interestingly, those seen during the pandemic had more difficulty with sleep (53 vs. 68, p=0.03), and more feelings of helplessness and loss of control (50 vs. 70, p=0.02), compared to those seen before the pandemic. There was no difference in the levels of anxiety and depression between the pre and post lockdown groups (HAD-Anxiety: 11 vs. 11.5, p=0.96;HAD-Depression: 8 vs. 8, p=0.84).ConclusionsThis study has shown for the first time that patients seen in tertiary care with refractory IBS during the covid-19 pandemic had a significantly higher symptom burden emphasising the importance of gut-brain axis in IBS. Furthermore, lack of support and perceived loss of control appear to be contributory factors.","Noble, Hithin, Hasan, Syed S.; Whorwell, Peter J.; Dipesh, Vasant","https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2021-BSG.31","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Gut; 70(Suppl 4):A17-A18, 2021.; Publication details: Gut; 70(Suppl 4):A17-A18, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-12","",21802,""
"A patient centred pathway to support self management for patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease","IntroductionThe aim of this project was to implement the new pathway â€˜Transforming the care of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver diseaseâ€™ in the secondary care Gastroenterology Clinic with a view to reducing the number of patients requiring medical review, meet waiting time targets and promote supported self-managementNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a spectrum of liver pathology, strongly associated with obesity and diabetes. Lifestyle change aimed at weight loss through diet and physical activity is the mainstay of clinical management guidelines for NAFLD (NICE 2016). Only 34% of people link being overweight to liver disease (versus over 80% understanding the link between ex cess weight and heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes).Evidence highlights just providing NAFLD patients with information and advice to change behaviour is an insufficient intervention. Readiness to change weight-related behaviours (both physical activity and eating habits) is often low and not associated with severity of liver disease. Being diagnosed with NAFLD is insufficient to propel people into the â€˜preparation/actionâ€™ stage of change. This is not surprising given that NAFLD is often asymptomatic. Patients do not â€˜seeâ€™ their condition. (Stewart et al 2014).A multi-disciplinary approach promoting supported self-management is recommended. A review by Taylor et al (2014) stated that all healthcare organisations should be providing self-management as an integral component of care.MethodsLocal health intelligence data was reviewed to justify rationale for establishing a new pathway for patients with NAFLD. According to health intelligence figures, 862 patients were admitted to hospital with NAFLD and NASH as either their main reason for admission or a secondary reason during a 12 month period (1st October 2018 - 30 September 2019).Prior to the new pathway the majority of patients with abnormal Liver Function Test (LFT) were referred to hospital and saw medical staff at their first appointment. Due to the volume of patients this led to a long waiting list to be seen. GPs were unsure when to refer patients and which bloods/investigations should be performed beforehand. There was no dedicated input from Health Psychology or Diabetes Specialists.The Lead Clinician and Lead Hepatology Nurse Specialist led on development of a new pathway. They agreed input and way forward for a multidisciplinary approach with General Practitioners, dietetic and psychology departments. It was agreed GPs would perform chronic liver disease screen, ultrasound and FIB4. If ultrasound suggested NAFLD patients would be referred to the new multi-disciplinary clinic. Each patient was seen by a Liver Nurse for a fibroscan and if required they also saw a Consultant in the same clinic. All appropriate patients were referred for psychology assessment in the same clinic slot. Dietetic support was available asynchronously.Following the initial clinic appointment all review appointments were offered by psychology (4-8 review virtual review appointments).Repeat bloods were done at blood hubs set up locally. Patients were only brought back into clinic if they required more tests, a repeat fibroscan and for 6 month review.Over a 15 month period 101 patients received a brief low intensity psychology intervention. Participants were encouraged to change their health behaviour. Each participant was seen for an assessment (and up to 8 weekly follow-up consultations via email, telephone or video call). Each patient was reviewed by the Health Psychologist at three and six months. At each contact participants were asked to complete A Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADs) fourteen item scale (Zigmond and Snaith, 1983) commonly used to determine the levels of anxiety and depression that a person is experiencing.Each participant was provided with a Fitbit Inspire fitness tracker at their baseline appointment and were asked to record and report back their seven day average step count to the Health Psychologist. A goal setting booklet and four week walking plan was provided to assist with this.Results101 patients, (53% Males and 47% Females) agreed to participate. The BMI of patients assessed was 40.1 (113.5kg). Almost all patients were not meeting guidelines of 150mins of physical activity per week. Baseline step count was 1635. The majority presented with two or more long term conditions alongside NAFLD. Most common being Type 2 Diabetes (44%) and anxiety/depression (27%). Average Fib 4 score was 1.4, KPa 14.4. HbA1c 58.8, Cholesterol 5.0, ALT 81.4, AST 58.4.91% of patients were followed up (9% drop out). Average weight loss 5.5kg (range 0.5kg- 23kg). 82% increased daily step count (1635 to 5958). Anxiety scores (HADs) decreased from (7.4 to 6) and Depression scores reduced 6.3 to 3.3.Due to Covid 19 restrictions we donâ€™t have repeat measures on medical markers for all patients. However some case studies are encouraging.At the end of their 6 month follow-up appointment, participants were asked to provide free text qualitative feedback on their thoughts about the new pathway and multi-disciplinary approach.Questions asked included â€˜What happened?â€™, â€˜How did you feel?â€™, â€˜What was good?â€™ and â€˜What could be improved?â€™Comments received includedâ€˜Great serviceâ€™ â€˜Kept in touch- keeps your mind on itâ€™â€˜Found the health psychology input helpful. Having someone to talk to who was interested in me cheered me upâ€™â€™ Really useful to have someone to report back to in terms of achieving weight loss goals â€˜â€˜Extremely helpful in terms of explaining why weight loss was so importantâ€™Think it is really helped having someone who is supportive and willing to listen is a big help. You donâ€™t feel youâ€™re achieving anything if youâ€™ve got nobody to bounce it offâ€™.â€˜I feel more confident that I can make changesâ€™â€˜First Class Service â€“, I feel a lot more positiveâ€™â€˜The support I received at the NAFLD clinic was useful, it was good to talk about weight and why it was important to change things. Made me realise I needed to start making changes for myself and my family. We have all lost weightâ€™â€˜Felt supported from the team. Telephone support really worked for me. Made me feel good and realise the progress I had madeâ€™ConclusionsThe results have identified that patients who attended the multi-disciplinary clinic made substantial improvements to their lifestyle. Average daily step count increased over the 6 month period, from 1635 to 5958. 82% patients reported an increase in activity levels;27% patients had been shielding but reported doing home based exercise programmes. Average self-reported weight loss at 6 months was 5.5kg (range 0.5kg- 23kg). There were also a reduction in the average anxiety and depression scores using HADS, from 7.4 to 6 for anxiety and 6.3 to 3.3 for depression.The majority of patients, who engaged reported an increase in self-efficacy in terms of achieving weight loss. An important outcome (measured via patientâ€™s qualitative feedback) was around self-confidence and recognition that small changes were a great step in the right direction.A learning point when we are able to fully resume normal service delivery is to try and increase the number of patients benefitting from this service. We see scope to potentially access patients earlier in primary care before they are referred to the Gastroenterology Team thus reducing waiting times and freeing up secondary care medical staff for more complex cases.Although the Liver Nurse Specialist team were fully on board with identifying suitable patients, not all eligible patients took the service up. We are not sure the reason for this, although we are aware that the cohort of patients with NAFLD are often considered the â€˜hard to reachâ€™ patients, faced with multiple challenges, which may mean â€˜healthâ€™ can slip down their priority list. It is worth noting that the majority of patients seen had complex long standing issues contributing to their poor health. Aspects of family functioning including conflict and divorce;emotional eating, insomnia, depression, anxiety we e highlighted and in most cases were worked with throughout the support sessions from the psychologist.Overall, it is considered that this new pathway and multidisciplinary clinic has been very worthwhile. There have been noticeable improvements identified through the use of appropriate assessment tools and from positive qualitative patient and clinician feedback. In terms of future plans funding has been secured to work with innovation colleagues to provide a virtual version of supported self-management for less complex patients. This will allow a greater through put of patients and help further implement the new NAFLD pathway and multi-disciplinary approach.","McCallum, Mary, Mukhopadhya, Ashis, Dundas, Pauline","https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2021-BSG.374","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Gut; 70(Suppl 4):A202-A203, 2021.; Publication details: Gut; 70(Suppl 4):A202-A203, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-12","",21803,""

"Clinical case of gastroesophageal reflux disease exacerbation in a middle-aged patient with covid-19","Objective. To describe COVID-19 influence on gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) exacerbation using clinical case. Main points. COVID-19 infection remains an urgent problem for modern medicine due to its high contagiousness and rapid dis-tribution among the working population. We presented a clinical case of a 49-year-old female patient with respiratory complaints and extraesophageal manifestations of GERD. Conclusion. This clinical case showed that clinicians should consider various mechanisms of respiratory symptoms, which becomes exceptionally relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic. The development of atypical symptoms in a patient of working age without concomitant pathology causes difficulties in early diagnosis and timely treatment, in contrast to comorbid elderly and senile patients. Several mechanisms led to an exacerbation of GERD with the development of wheezing. Therefore, a clinician should meticulously take a medical history, form a trusting relationship with a patient, detect and correct early signs of anxiety and depression with a multidisciplinary team.

Mental health stresses during the pandemic seem to have had a role in susceptible individuals reaching crises point in this behaviour.

"Health inequity and COVID-19 in North Macedonia: fact sheet","Health inequities are the unfair and avoidable differences in health status within a population. In North Macedonia and across countries of the WHO European Region, some people live healthier lives and have better health outcomes than others, even with the same access to health services, due to insecurity in livelihoods (e.g. income, living conditions, employment, quality and security of local neighbourhoods). For example, even thoughimprovements have been made in average levels of health and life expectancy, these gains have not been shared equally across different sections of society. Health inequities are not new. Prior to the arrival of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in North Macedonia, women with the most years of education could expect to live three years longer than women with the fewest years of education, while men with the most years of education could expect to live almost six years longer than men with the fewest years of education.Peopleâ€™s quality of life is linked to the conditions in which they are born, grow, learn, work and age, as well as to health systems. Living with long-standing limiting illness (e.g. noncommunicable diseases, respiratory disease, and depression/anxiety disorders) reduces a personâ€™s quality of life and is a risk factor for poverty and social exclusion, as well as for severe illness and premature death from COVID-19, if infected. In North Macedonia,there is a greater gap in living with long-standing limiting illness between men and women with fewest years of education, and women with fewest years of education are most affected. Equity-proofed investments in health systems can help to reduce unmet need for health care and the number of people living with long-standing limiting illness, and they also increase the health, social and economic resilience of individuals, families and communities.","World Health Organization, Regional Office for Europe","https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/345237","","Database: WHOIRIS; GREY-COVIDWHO; Publication type: non-conventional","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-12","",21809,""

"In the wake of the pandemic: preparing for long COVID","This briefâ€™s key messages are:COVID-19 can cause persistent ill-health. Around a quarter of people who have had the virus experience symptoms that continue for at least a month but one in 10 are still unwell after 12 weeks. This has been described by patient groups as â€œLong COVIDâ€. Our understanding of how to diagnose and manage Long COVID is still evolving but the condition can be very debilitating. It is associated with a range of overlapping symptoms including generalized chest and muscle pain, fatigue, shortness of breath, and cognitive dysfunction, and the mechanisms involved affect multiple system and include persisting inflammation, thrombosis, and autoimmunity. It can affect anyone, but women and health care workers seem to be at greater risk. Long COVID has a serious impact on peopleâ€™s ability to go back to work or have a social life. It affects their mental health and may have significant economic consequences for them, their families and for society. Policy responses need to take account of the complexity of Long COVID and how what is known about it is evolving rapidly. Areas to address include: The need for multidisciplinary, multispecialty approaches to assessment and management;Development, in association with patients and their families, of new care pathways and contextually appropriate guidelines for health professionals, especially in primary care to enable case management to be tailored to the manifestations of disease and involvement of different organ systems;The creation of appropriate services, including rehabilitation and online support tools;Action to tackle the wider consequences of Long COVID, including attention to employment rights, sick pay policies, and access to benefit and disability benefit packages;Involving patients both to foster self-care and self-help and in shaping awareness of Long COVID and the service (and research) needs it generates;and implementing well-functioning patient registers and other surveillance systems;creating cohorts of patients;and following up those affected as a means to support the research which is so critical to understanding and treating Long COVID.","European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, Rajan, Selina, Khunti, Kamlesh, Alwan, Nisreen, Steves, Claire, Greenhalgh, Trish, MacDermott, Nathalie, Sagan, Anna, McKee, Martin","https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/339629","","Database: WHOIRIS; GREY-COVIDWHO; Publication details: Health Systems and Policy Analysis|Policy brief 39;2021.; Publication details: Health Systems and Policy Analysis|Policy brief 39;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-12","",21815,""

"Factors associated with carer psychological and physical health during end-of-life caregiving: an observational analysis of a population-based post-bereavement survey of carers of people with cancer","OBJECTIVE: Family caregivers play an essential role in end-of-life care but suffer considerable impact on their own health. A better understanding of main factors related to carers' health is important to inform interventions. The purpose of the study was to test for the first time the potential impact of a comprehensive set of observable variables on carer health during end-of-life caregiving within a population-based carer sample. DESIGN: National retrospective, cross-sectional, 4-month post-bereavement postal census survey of family carers of people who died from cancer. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Relatives who registered a death from cancer during a 2-week period in England were identified from death certificates by the Office of National Statistics; response rate was 1504/5271 (28.5%). OUTCOME MEASURES: Carers' mental health was measured through General Health Questionnaire (GHQ)-12; general health was measured through EuroQoL EQ-Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-5D VAS). METHODS: Survey questions to measure potential variables associated with carer health were based on past research and covered patients' symptoms and functioning; caregiving activities and hours; informal and formal help received; work hours, other caregiving, volunteering; changes to work, income and expenditure; sleep and relaxation; and demographic variables. Bivariate analyses and ordinary least square regression were performed to investigate these variables' relationship with outcomes. RESULTS: Patients' psychological symptoms and functioning, caregiving hours, female gender and self-sought formal help related to worse mental health. General practitioner and social care input and relaxation related to better mental health. Patients' psychological symptoms, caregiving hours and female gender were associated with worse general health, and older age, employment and relaxation were associated with better general health. CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in carers' health overall may be made by focusing on potential impacts of patients' psychological symptoms on carers, facilitating respite and relaxation, and paying particular attention to factors affecting female carers.","Grande, Gunn; Rowland, Christine; Cotterill, Sarah; Batistatou, Evridiki; Hanratty, Barbara","https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-047275","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMJ Open;11(10): e047275, 2021 10 29.; Publication details: BMJ Open;11(10): e047275, 2021 10 29.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-12","",21817,""
