"Shared Genomic Architectures of Covid-19 and Antisocial Behavior: Implications During Pandemics","BACKGROUND. Norm violation, aggression, and antisocial behaviors (ASB) are harmful to society. In times of crisis, such as the current pandemic, individuals with higher antisocial tendencies may subvert efforts to ameliorate social problems. Complicating research on this topic, however, is the fact that variance in both ASB and health traits is partly heritable, suggesting the possibility of genetic correlations between them. METHODS. We characterized the shared polygenic architecture of ASB, Covid-19, and related traits, leveraging summary statistics from genome-wide association studies. RESULTS. After multiple-testing correction, ASB was genetically correlated with average income (rg=-0.54; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.65, -0.43); education years (rg=-0.48; CI: -0.59, -0.38; verbal reasoning (rg=-0.44; CI: -0.58, -0.30); healthspan (rg=-0.47; CI: -0.62, -0.31), lifespan (rg=-0.33 (CI: -0.46, -0.21); breastfed as baby (rg=-0.24; 95% CI: -0.38, -0.11); cheese intake (rg=-0.28 (CI: -0.38, -0.18); Covid-19 (rg=0.51, 95% CI: 0.12, 0.90; heavy, manual labor (rg=0.58; CI: 0.45, 0.70); noisy workplace (rg=0.63; CI: 0.48, 0.77); Townsend Deprivation Index (rg=0.70; CI: 0.56, 0.84); gastrointestinal diseases (rg=0.46; 95% CI: 0.23, 0.70); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (rg=0.51; CI: 0.33, 0.68); genitourinary diseases (rg=0.38; CI: 0.22, 0.55); neuroticism (rg=0.29; CI: 0.20, 0.38); seen doctor for nerves, anxiety, tension, or depression (rg=0.42; CI: 0.31, 0.54); plays computer games (rg=0.15; CI: 0.06, 0.25); violent-crime victim (rg=0.36; CI: 0.16, 0.56); risk tolerance (rg=0.50; CI: 0.39, 0.65); saw sudden violent death (rg=0.42; CI: 0.20, 0.64). CONCLUSIONS. Our results suggest ASB shares genetic architecture with Covid-19 and related health outcomes. We discuss the public-health and bioethical implications of our results.","Charleen D.
