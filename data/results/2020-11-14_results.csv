"COVID-19: The possible seasonal shape of things to come","Introduction The world is currently experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic  The northern hemisphere awaits winter with foreboding, anticipating an amplification of the current second wave of COVID-19 concurrent with annual seasonal influenza  Methods This paper attempts to overview current seasonal COVID-19 trends  Results Cases are spiking now in winter in Australia and also in summer weather, such as in Florida  Clearly warm weather does not significantly dampen viral spread unless public health mitigation measures are adhered to  Respiratory pathogens (including influenza), will co-circulate in winter  Co-infection with influenza and COVID-19 may worsen outcomes and mutations of either virus may change and further negatively affect such outcomes  The public in Australia has avidly taken the influenza vaccine and this, along with COVID-19 prevention measures, has drastically curbed influenza spread in this country  Conclusions Countries in the northern hemisphere with high rates of COVID-19 should strive to reduce numbers prior to the onset of winter  Those that managed to maintain low COVID-19 rates due to public health measures should endeavor to maintain this status quo despite opening borders for economically badly needed tourists  Spikes of cases in countries wherein COVID-19 was formerly under control will deter tourists, further depressing beleaguered economies  Vigilance must be maintained until an effective vaccine becomes available  The key is to have public health driven economy whereby opening of borders and activities organized are driven by evidence based public health advice  Influenza vaccination is highly recommended","Grech, Victor, Cuschieri, Sarah, Gauci, Charmaine","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2020.105262","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Early Human Development;: 105262, 2020.; Publication details: Early Human Development;: 105262, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-14","",7130,""
"Modelling pandemic depression and anxiety: The mediational role of core beliefs and meaning making","BACKGROUND The aim of this research was to examine core belief violation and disrupted meaning making as primary cognitive processes regulating mental health during the pandemic  The study tested the hypothesis that both these cognitive processes function as mediating mechanisms, accounting for the adverse mental health effects of multiple pandemic stressors  METHODS A survey design (NÂ =Â 2380) assessed demographic variables associated with poor pandemic mental health (gender, age, ethnicity, education), direct COVID stressors (diagnosis, death), indirect COVID stressors (unemployment, increased living costs, childcare loss), core belief violation, meaning made of the pandemic, coronavirus anxiety (CA), depression, and general anxiety  RESULTS: Core belief violation and disrupted meaning making explained the severity of depression, general anxiety, and CA to a significantly greater degree than did demographics, direct COVID stressors, and indirect COVID stressors combined  In addition, core belief violation and disrupted meaning making significantly mediated the impact of direct and indirect COVID stressors on all mental health outcomes  Specifically, each stressor was associated with increased core belief violation and decreased meaning making of the pandemic, in turn, those whose core beliefs were violated and those who made less meaning of the pandemic experienced greater depression, general anxiety, and CA  LIMITATIONS The use of a cross-sectional design prohibited assessment of alternative causal orders  CONCLUSIONS This study describes the first unifying model of pandemic mental health, establishing violation of core beliefs and the inability to make meaning of the pandemic as targets for clinical intervention in the context diverse pandemic stressors","Milman, Evgenia, Lee, Sherman A.; Neimeyer, Robert A.; Mathis, Amanda A.; Jobe, Mary C.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadr.2020.100023","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders Reports;: 100023, 2020.; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders Reports;: 100023, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-14","",7131,""

"Effects of COVID-19 related restrictive measures on parents of children with developmental difficulties","Purpose: Social distancing and school closures have changed the lives of many parents around the globe  In addition to these problems, parents of children with developmental difficulties (DD) have faced additional stressors that make them even more susceptible to higher stress levels and the onset or worsening of anxiety or depression  Consequentially, these stressors may have an indirect effect on parental functioning and children with DD owing to the spillover effect  Design/methodology/approach: The purpose of this paper is to draw attention to parents of children with DD through an overview of possible additional stressors that have appeared during the coronavirus pandemic in Croatia  In writing this viewpoint paper, three sources were consulted: official state documents, communication with professionals (e g  speech therapists) and online support groups for parents of children with DD  Findings: Restrictive measures during the lockdown led to a lack of both formal and informal support for parents of children with DD  Moreover, the possibility of infection led to higher levels of fear among these parents;children with DD also encountered problems coping with both the restrictive measures and the demands of distance learning  Practical implications: This paper may present a good starting point for both governments and NGOs when discussing and planning further advancement in the quality of response to the COVID-19 pandemic and a â€œrecoveryâ€ response after the crisis  This overview may provide better insight into COVID-19â€“related consequences among parents of children with DD, which is vital to increasing the effectiveness of future measures and actions  Originality/value: Although some negative effects of the pandemic on children have already been discussed by several authors, little attention has been paid to parents, and even less so to parents of children with DD  This paper may even represent a pioneering work in exploring the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on this population group  Â© 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited","Lucic, L.; Brkljacic, T.; BrajÅ¡a-Å½ganec, A.","https://doi.org/10.1108/JCS-07-2020-0041","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of Children's Services;2020.; Publication details: Journal of Children's Services;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-14","",7136,""
"PP22 Developing digital simulation: faculty reflections on actor development","IntroductionMental health Simulation has an important role to play in improving clinical outcomes for patients  Transitioning to digital simulation presents facilitators, actors and technicians with several challenges to maintain high fidelity simulations MethodsDuring the Coronavirus pandemic, Maudsley Simulation took a full-day simulation course and made adaptations for online delivery over a half day, testing in-house during a piloting phase  At the Simulation Centre, the sole focus for our simulated patients is acting, as technicians stage manage and dress scenes for them  The actors are experienced in playing these roles and have attended a Quality Assurance Course Trial sessions were passively observed by other faculty members  Following each session, observations and reflections were logged and organised thematically ResultsInitially, platform instability was challenging for the team and actors, and was felt to undermine the fidelity of scenarios  We started by trialling teleconference type scenarios that were static in nature and set in the community but developed this over subsequent trials  Actors are well versed in acting to camera and adapted quickly to this aspect of online simulation  Transitions to scenarios proved challenging and distracting in the early stages but were improved upon with audio-visual clips Discussion and ConclusionSeveral issues required resolution to allow high-fidelity online simulation to be delivered  Switching platforms, adjusting pre-briefs for actors to include technical aspects of stage management, transitions and IT support greatly improved this and supported the achievement and maintenance of high fidelity scenarios for participants and observers Actorsâ€™ spaces were tested to ensure the lighting, sound quality and camera angles were good  Actors were guided to dress their environment at home with input from technicians We overcame initial difficulties for a scenario set on a psychiatric ward, by inviting the actor into our simulation centre  This allowed the technician to dress the environment and have more control over the audio-visual set up  The male actor used a hand-held cam to create a much more immersive experience, which was deemed to be an improvement by our team  A closer view of facial expressions resulted in a more empathetic approach to the patient, as his fears and worries were much more apparent and this was reflected on in the debriefs Online simulation provides quality outcomes for participants, which will enable greater access for clinicians in remote or overseas locations to attend high quality simulation training  We plan to deliver full-day formats in future","Bignell, Anita, Virk, Kiran, Evans, Gareth, Owen, Oâ€™Sullivan, Parish, Sandra, Powell, Jennifer","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjstel-2020-aspihconf.41","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: BMJ Simulation & Technology Enhanced Learning;6(Suppl 1):A25, 2020.; Publication details: BMJ Simulation & Technology Enhanced Learning;6(Suppl 1):A25, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-14","",7137,""

"Social distancing, cultural and psychological effects on learners in a rural setting in Zimbabwe","Social distancing has proven to be one effective reaction to the threat of increasing numbers of Coronavirus (COVID-19) cases and fatalities  The crisis around COVID-19 and social distancing is leaving an indelible footprint on the hearts and minds of the learners  The impact and ripple effects around the teaching and learning fraternities is likely too vast to comprehend for the learners  The study seeks to unveil the socio-cultural and psychological effects of social distancing on the learners in Zimbabwe  The study was limited to Matabeleland North Province of Zimbabwe  Respondents were 10 learners from secondary schools and 10 from primary schools  Data were electronically collected to observe the ongoing lockdown and social distancing measures  Semi-structured interview schedules were the tools for data gathering  The study was underpinned using the interactionist, socio-cultural theory of Vygotsky and Sullivanâ€™s interpersonal theory  The findings of the study revealed that learners lack psycho- social support from home  The situation is causing stress, depression, loss of feeling of control over oneâ€™s life, low self-esteem and loss of aspiration  There is also unavailability of peer support, peer tutoring, co-operative and competitive learning and resources which are essential pedagogies for effective learning  Access to the Internet is a challenge for many learners due to the poor economic status of the country  Most of the learners are worried about their well-being and that of their family-members in-turn, this affects the academe  Guidance and counselling lessons have become more vital to support learners during this social distancing era  Â© 2020, Florida Gulf Coast University  All rights reserved","Sikhangezile, N.; Modise, M.

"Life in lockdown: A telephone survey to investigate the impact of COVID-19 lockdown measures on the lives of older people (&#8805; 75Â years)","BACKGROUND: In response to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, the UK government introduced social distancing measures and identified specific populations at high risk from the virus. People &#8805;70 were deemed ""Clinically Vulnerable."" Distancing measures were introduced to reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19. However, these may have a negative impact on older people who are vulnerable to social isolation and may have challenges accessing services and provisions. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the impact of COVID-19 lockdown measures on the lives of older people. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional telephone survey. PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling older people, 76-97Â years. OUTCOMES: Health anxiety; General health (RAND Short-form 36 Survey); Physical activity; Depression (PHQ-8); Anxiety (GAD-2); Loneliness; Access to services; Challenges, concerns and positive experiences. DATA ANALYSIS: Counts (%), means (SDs). Thematic analysis was used to identify themes from open questions. RESULTS: n = 142. 52% did not worry about their health; 76% rated their health as ""good"", ""very good"" or ""excellent"". < 10% met the criteria indicative of depression (PHQ-8), or anxiety (GAD-2). 42% were less active than before lockdown. 27% were lonely at least some of the time. Over half of participants identified positive aspects. CONCLUSIONS: Most participants reported good health with low levels of health anxiety, anxiety and depression. Many were able to identify positive aspects to lockdown and may be better equipped to deal with lockdown than anticipated. Strategies may be required to ameliorate the negative impact of loneliness for a minority of older people, and help some resume previous activity levels and pursuits.","Brown, Lesley; Mossabir, Rahena; Harrison, Nicola; Brundle, Caroline; Smith, Jane; Clegg, Andrew","https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ageing/afaa255","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Age Ageing;2020 Nov 10.; Publication details: Age Ageing;2020 Nov 10.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-14","",7148,""
"The differential mental health impact of COVID-19 in Arab countries","COVID-19 pandemic's mental health impact on Arab countries is under-researched. The goal of this investigation was to study the differential impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of Arab countries. A questionnaire including measures of COVID-19 traumatic stress, PTSD, depression, anxiety, and cumulative stressors and trauma was distributed anonymously online in seven Arab countries (Egypt (N = 255), Kuwait (N = 442), Jordan (N = 216), Saudi Arabia (N = 212, Algeria (N = 110), Iraq and Palestine (N = 139)). We used ANOVA and stepwise regression to analyze the data. For each country, regression, PTSD, depression, and anxiety were dependent variables; we entered in the first-step, gender, age, religion, education, and income. In the second step, we entered ""cumulative stressors and traumas."" In the third step, we entered COVID-19 traumatic stress. The ANOVA results indicated that the differences in COVID19 traumatic stress, PTSD, depression, and anxiety between the countries were significant. Post-hoc analysis indicated that Egypt is significantly higher than all the other Arab countries in COVID-19 traumatic stress, PTSD, anxiety, and depression. The subsample from Palestine and Iraq had a significantly higher cumulative trauma load than the other Arab countries but did not have higher levels of COVID-19 traumatic stress or PTSD. Stepwise regression indicated that COVID-19 traumatic stress accounted for significant variance above and beyond the variance accounted for by previous cumulative stressors and traumas for anxiety in all countries and PTSD and depression in all countries except for Algeria. We discussed the implications for these results for the urgent mental health needs of Arab countries.","Shuwiekh, Hanaa A M; Kira, Ibrahim A; Sous, Mariam Sous Fahmy; Ashby, Jeffrey S; Alhuwailah, Amthal; Baali, Shadia Bint Ali; Azdaou, Chafika; Oliemat, Enas M; Jamil, Hikmet J","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12144-020-01148-7","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Curr Psychol;: 1-15, 2020 Nov 02.; Publication details: Curr Psychol;: 1-15, 2020 Nov 02.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-14","",7149,""

"Neurotic generation of Covid-19 in Eastern Europe","The article presents the results of research on neuroticism among students in Poland and Ukraine, which has been contributed to by the coronavirus pandemic. The research was conducted on-line, on a sample of 1,978 respondents in Poland, and 411 in Ukraine. The results of this research indicate that average and high levels of neuroticism were observed among 61% of respondents in Poland, and 47% in Ukraine. The regression analysis has shown that the main factors which have an impact on the level of neuroticism are; educational burnout, gender, financial situation, interest in the pandemic and satisfaction with life. Neuroticism indicated by the respondents increases with educational burnout, loss of economic resources and an increase in the interest in the pandemic. Moreover, female respondents score higher on the scale of neuroticism. Comparative analyses between Polish and Ukrainian students indicate that Ukrainian youth cope with quarantine and distance education better, and have better mental health. The collected observations show that in the conditions of a pandemic, neuroticism among young generations may increase.","Piotr Dlugosz et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4600C-FAA-C3E","20201114","PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; stress; neuroticism; educational burnout; students; poland and ukraine; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-14","",7155,""
"Antecedents and consequences of COVID-19 conspiracy theories: a rapid review of the evidence","COVID-19 conspiracy theories emerged almost immediately after the beginning of the pandemic, and the number of believers does not appear to decline. Believing in these theories can negatively affect adherence to safety guidelines and vaccination intentions, potentially endangering the lives of many. Thus, one part in successfully fighting the pandemic is to understand the antecedents and consequences of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, which are here presented in a rapid review summarizing research from more than 28 countries. We evaluate the contribution of individual difference variables (demographic variables, personality traits, coping with threat and uncertainty), beliefs, biases, and attitudes (epistemically suspect beliefs, thinking styles and cognitive biases, attitudes towards science), and social factors (group identities, trust in authorities, social media) to COVID-19 conspiracy theories. We discuss the consequences of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs in regard to safeguarding behaviours (hygiene, distancing, and mask-wearing), self-centred (hoarding) and misguided behaviours (pseudoscientific practices), vaccination intentions, mental health and negative social consequences (e.g., discrimination and violence). Differences between countries as well as various conspiracy theories are considered. Summarising, we suggest that belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories is boosted by low levels of trust in a context of threat and low levels of comprehensive, accessible information in a context of uncertainty and unknowns. We conclude that research is urgently needed to address potential interventions to (re-)establish trust and provide accessible information about COVID-19.","Valerie Van Mulukom et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4616B-24D-145","20201114","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Biases, Framing, and Heuristics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Reasoning; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cultural Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Attitudes and Persuasion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Motivational Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Personality and Situations; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prejudice and Discrimination; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Self and Social Identity; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Well-being; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Violence and Aggression; threat; covid-19; psychology; protective behaviours; information; hoarding; review; trust in science; trust in government; coronavirus; pseudoscientific practices; pandemic; social media; mental health; violence; discrimination; personality; belief; infodemic; conspiracy belief; thinking style; vaccination intention; group identities; uncertainty; social sciences; trust","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-14","",7156,""
