"Self-injury, suicidal ideation and -attempt and eating disorders in young people following the initial and second COVID-19 lockdown","Summary Background: The initial COVID-19 lockdowns have had negative effect on different mental health measures, especially in young women. However, the impact on self-injury, suicidality and eating disorder (ED) are less elucidated and remains inconsistent. We compare self-reported self-injury, suicide ideation and -attempt and symptoms of EDs from before through different pandemic periods until spring 2021. Methods: Young participants in the Danish National Birth Cohort reported these measures in an 18-year follow-up in 2015-2021 and in a COVID-19 survey in spring 2021 when participants were aged 19-24 years. Changes in measures from pre to post lockdown were estimated with longitudinal data (N=7,597) and with repeated cross-sectional data (N=24,625) by linear regression. Findings: In the longitudinal comparisons 14% of women and 7% of men reported self-injury pre lockdown, which decreased 6%-points (95% CI:-7%;-5%) for women and 3%-points (95% CI:-4%;-2%) for men during lockdown. For suicide ideation, the pre lockdown proportions were 25% and 18% for women and men respectively, and decreased 7%-points (95% CI:-8%;-6%) for women and 3%-points (95% CI:-5%;-1%) for men. For suicide attempt no change was observed. Pre lockdown 15% and 3% of women and men, respectively, had symptoms of EDs, which decreased 2%-points (95% CI:-3%;-1%) for women. We observed no changes in proportions of self-injury, suicide ideation or EDs in the repeated cross-sectional data. Interpretation: Our findings provide no support for increase in self-injury, suicidality and EDs following the lockdowns, and if anything, indicate a reduction in self-injury and suicide ideation as well as EDs in women.","Stine Danielsen; Andrea Joensen; Per Krag Andersen; Trine Madsen; Katrine Strandberg-Larsen","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.03.08.22271980","20220310","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28229,""
"Symptoms of depression and anxiety among Vietnamese immigrants in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic","We aimed to examine mental health status and related factors among Vietnamese immigrants in Japan during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic using data from an online cross-sectional survey administered from September 21 to October 21, 2021. Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scores were considered the main outcome measures. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors related to symptoms of depression and anxiety, and the chosen variables were entered simultaneously in the survey. Among 621 participants (age: 26.0{+/-}4.8 years; male: 347 [55.9%]) who completed the questionnaire, 73.7% reported a decrease in income when compared with the period before the COVID-19 pandemic, and 60.4% reported being recently affected by poor socioeconomic status. Moderate-to-severe symptoms of depression (PHQ-9 score [&ge;]10 points) and mild-to-severe symptoms of anxiety (GAD-7 [&ge;]5 points) were observed in 247 (39.8%) and 285 (45.9%) individuals, respectively. Factors related to depressive symptoms were being single (odds ratio [OR]=1.76, p=0.042), medical or psychiatric co-morbidity (OR=2.15, p<0.001), and low socioeconomic status (OR=2.06, p<0.001). Factors related to anxiety symptoms were being single (OR=1.72, p=0.044), medical or psychiatric co-morbidity (OR=2.52, p<0.001), low socioeconomic status (OR=2.72, p<0.001), and absence of a partner with whom to discuss one's health (OR=1.66, p=0.013). The current findings demonstrate that, when compared with Japanese citizens, Vietnamese immigrants experienced a decrease in income, worsening working conditions, and poor mental health status during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings highlight the potential contribution of low socioeconomic status and social isolation to poor mental health status.","Tadashi Yamashita; Pham Nguyen Quy; Emi Nogami; Erina Seto-Suh; Chika Yamada; Saori Iwamoto; Kyoko Shimazawa; Kenji Kato","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.03.09.22271973","20220310","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28230,""

To deliver care in this context, telehealth groups were a therapeutic option for occupational therapists for mental health care. This paper presents an occupational therapy experience with telehealth groups in Brazil, sustained by the Dynamic Occupational Therapy Method, seeking to discuss the use of technology during the COVID-19 outbreak, the limits and potential of occupational therapy in the face of the necessary change in work with groups. The paper is a critical analysis of practice sustained by a practice-based evidence perspective through a collaborative partnership between practitioners and academics from Brazil and the UK. Practitioners reflected on their professional skills in an online context, highlighting their initial concerns and their discoveries within this new practice scenario. The delivery of telehealth groupwork in occupational therapy in mental health practice requires multiple digital tools, and the occupational therapist needs to understand digital inequity issues (digital access or skills), be digitally upskilled to meet client needs, and also be guided by clear occupational therapy theoretical and methodological frameworks that underpin telehealth practices.","Ferrari, Sonia Maria Leonardi; Pywell, Samantha Domenique; Costa, Ana Lucia Borges da; Marcolino, TaÃ­s Quevedo","http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S2526-89102022000100402","","Database: COVIDWHO; LILACS; Publication type: article; Publication details: Cad.

"Occupational participation, stress, anxiety and depression in workers and students from Brazilian universities during the COVID-19 pandemic; ParticipaÃ§Ã£o ocupacional, estresse, ansiedade e depressÃ£o em trabalhadores e estudantes de universidades brasileiras durante a pandemia de COVID-19","Abstract  Introduction The physical, social and occupational restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic have affected the health and well-being of the world population.  Objective To identify the repercussions of the pandemic on the occupational participation of students, lecturers and technicians from three public universities in Northern Brazil, to compare the changes reported by participants in occupational participation before and during the pandemic, and to identify symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress self-reported.  Method This is a Cross-sectional, descriptive and comparative study with a quantitative approach. One hundred and ninety-nine (n = 199) participants (students, lecturers and technicians) responded to an online questionnaire, the ""Occupational Participation Checklist"" and the Anxiety, Stress and Depression Scale (DASS-21). Data analysis were descriptive and also performed by applying the Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney tests.  Results During the pandemic, an increase in occupational participation was identified for all participants in domestic activities (p &lt;0.001) and a decrease in work and study face to face (p &lt;0.001). Students reported more symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress when compared to lecturers (p&lt;0.001). Most students did not organise their time to fulfil their occupations with satisfaction. Such difficulties were associated with symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress, especially among the student's group (p&lt;0.001).  Conclusion This study provided preliminary evidence about differences in occupational participation before and during the Covid-19 pandemic. The organization of time and difficulties in occupational participation were associated to levels of anxiety, depression and stress, especially in the sample of students.; Resumo  IntroduÃ§Ã£o As restriÃ§Ãµes fÃ­sicas, sociais e ocupacionais impostas pela pandemia de COVID-19 tÃªm afetado a saÃºde, o bem-estar e a qualidade de vida da populaÃ§Ã£o mundial.

"Impact of COVID-19 on mental health in a Low and Middle-Income Country; Impacto do COVID-19 na saÃºde mental em um paÃ­s de baixa e mÃ©dia renda","Abstract Mental disorders (MD) are commonly comorbid with cardiovascular, metabolic, and some infectious diseases. Since the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is affecting the most multimorbid individuals, we might expect that the epidemic will be particularly problematic for people with MD. Understanding the burden of an outbreak on mental health is fundamental to effective action towards containing the spread of the disease, as psychopathology might reduce endurance during the lockdown. This can potentially reduce adhesion to ongoing treatment resulting in avoidable recurrence of a disorder. Additionally, there is the stress caused by the eminent risk of infection or economic uncertainty, especially in low-middle income settings. This is an overview on the expected influence of the COVID-19 on mental health from a research group that has not long ago been involved in the Zika epidemic. It aims to discuss the effects of the pandemic on a Low and Middle-Income country (LMIC), Brazil.; Resumo Os Transtornos Mentais (TM) sÃ£o comorbidades comuns associadas a doenÃ§as cardiovasculares, metabÃ³licas e algumas doenÃ§as infecciosas.

"Mental Health Disorders among Covid-19 Infected Saudi Cohort","Background: Numerous studies revealed mental health disorders among general population and healthcare workers during Covid-19 pandemic. However, fewer data are available on mental health status of Covid-19 infected patients. Present study was aimed to survey Covid-19 infected Saudi cohort for common mental health disorders. Objective: To determine the frequency of common mental health disorders (anxiety, depression, insomnia and post-traumatic stress disorders [PTSD]) in Covid-19 infected Saudi cohort. Design: Descriptive cross-sectional. Settings: King Fahd Armed Forces Hospital Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (ksa) during March to April 2021 Patients and Methods: The population of the study comprised of cohort of confirmed Covid-19 infected patients (n=310) managed at King Fahd Armed Forces Hospital Jeddah, KSA. The GAD-7 score was used to assess anxiety;Patient Health Questionnaire-9 for depression, Impact of Event Scaleâ€“revised for PTSD and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) was used to assess insomnia. Results: The most frequent mental health disorder found in the present study was anxiety (77.1%) followed by clinically significant depression (36.1%), insomnia (33.9%), and PTSD (21.6%). Individuals with lower level of education demonstrated one and half fold higher risk of having anxiety (OR of 1.54, 95% CI: 1.006-2.343, P=0.047) and widows demonstrated 2-fold higher risk of developing insomnia (OR of 1.7, 95% CI: 1.028-2.80, P=0.039).

"Psychoemotional state of medical workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction. Medical workers need to cope with a number of serious problems, ranging from an increased risk of death in medical institutions and at home, an increase in working hours and physical and psychological stress at work, as well as solving difficult situations arising from contact with members of the public and social isolation from colleagues and loved ones. The physical and psychological impact of working during the COVID-19 pandemic was significant: thousands of medical workers worldwide died from SARSCoV-2 infection, and some even committed suicide. It is important to note that healthcare professionals are crucial to any healthcare system. In addition, the negative impact of COVID-19 on global mental health is obviously increasing. From a social perspective, the emerging mental health burden on health care workers and other workers raises serious concerns about the sustainability of health services. Aim: To analyze the literature data on the psycho-emotional state of medical workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Search strategy: The search for sources was carried out in the following bases: Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, MedLine, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar in the electronic scientific library e-Library.ru, CyberLeninka. Inclusion criteria: the depth of the literature search was 3 years (2019-2021), original articles, literature reviews, meta-analyzes, regulatory documents in English and Russian. Exclusion criteria: publications of low methodological quality, which did not reflect the main importance, with unclear and ambiguous conclusions, repeated publications, conference proceedings and clinical cases. As a result of the search, we identified only 215 foreign and domestic publications, of which 74 publications were included in this review. Results and conclusions: According to the results of our study, numerous publications show that during the COVID-19 pandemic, at least one symptom of emotional burnout and distress was detected in medical workers.","Kussainova, D.

"Administrating the development of tourism and hospitality industries during the COVID-19 pandemic","Starting from 2020 to the present day, because of the COVID-19 pandemic in the sphere of tourism and hotel industry, as well as in related areas, there has been a decline or even complete cessation of activity, as a result of which a significant number of enterprises have become bankrupt or in crisis. So there is a need to find such a way of development of the spheres of tourism and hospitality, which would provide an opportunity not only to preserve these areas, but also to provide, after leaving the pandemic, the conditions for their further development in such a manner that as many as possible business entities are involved in their activities. It is also necessary to take into account the demand of people - potential recreants (tourists and vacationers), which should be satisfied, despite the pandemic, because during isolation and restrictions in movement and communication with nature, a depressed and painful state occurs, which leads to a deterioration in efficiency and a decrease in the number of able-bodied personnel. As an instrument to overcome the existing crisis, it is proposed to create campsites with the involvement of all stakeholders from enterprises in the sphere of tourism, hotel and other industries. Such an approach makes it possible to work during a pandemic due to the lack of crowding in one place. At the same time, thanks to the differentiated approach when creating campsites, it is possible to satisfy the maximum possible range of demand from potential tourists and vacationers by creating conditions of stay that are different in comfort. As for the possibility of working not only during a pandemic, but also after its completion, camping is best suited for this, since when it is created, a stable entrepreneurial managed structure is formed - a territorial recreational system that becomes the core for the further development of tourism, hotel industry and other areas directly or indirectly related to their activities.","Ryabev, A.

"Teaching Care During Covid-19: Reflective Assessment for Becoming-Historians","This article argues that the Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT) that took place during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021 left learners and teachers alike awash in feelings of helplessness, loss, and anguish. While online learning literacy and pedagogy have improved over the course of 2020 and 2021, and interesting and important innovations have been implemented and explored, the foundational inequalities have not lessened or disappeared. This article argues for the use of care as a necessary pedagogy in the virtual classroom using a case study of one class. The labour of care needs to be considered as part of the labour of pedagogy during Covid-19. I argue for care being built into both pedagogy and assessment as part of a radical pedagogy for this time. I explore reflective assessment embedded in a pedagogy of care as a way to, if not combat, recognise and respond to the inequalities embodied in ERT and the society it exists in, towards radical change. Active reflection draws out the impact that ERT has had on the ""being"" and ""becoming"" of pre-service History teachers.","Godsell, S.","https://doi.org/10.25159/1947-9417/8680","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Education as Change; 26:1-23, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28245,""
"Suicide and drug toxicity mortality in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic: use of medical examiner data for public health purposes in Nova Scotia","Introduction. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by government authorities have raised concerns about the possibility of increased mortality from suicide and drug or medication intoxication, due to the exacerbation of mental illnesses, economic issues, changes in drug and medication supply, ability to access harm reduction services, and various other factors. Methodology. We obtained our data from the Nova Scotia Medical Examiner's Service. We developed case definitions and assessed their performance characteristics. We modeled trends in monthly suicide and drug deaths before the pandemic and compared the number of deaths observed in the year of the pandemic with those expected. Results. There was a significant decrease in suicide deaths in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nova Scotia, with approximately 21 fewer suicide deaths not related to drug intoxication than expected between March 2020 and February 2021 (hazard ratio = 0.82). No change was observed in drug intoxication mortality. Case definitions were successfully applied to free-written cause-of-death reports and to cases where the cause and nature of death were still under investigation. Conclusion. Case classification and follow-up processes can be implemented in collaboration with medical examiners and coroners so that public health authorities can continuously monitor suicide and drug intoxication mortality as quickly as possible. Because medical examiners and coroners are the custodians of a wealth of data that can be used to prevent further deaths, it is time to mobilize these systems into public health follow-ups.","Schleihauf, E.; Bowes, M.

"Effects of a virtual education program and active breaks on healthy habits on the Human Resources staff of the Ministry of Public Education (MEP) during the COVID-19 pandemic","Due to the actual COVID-19 pandemic context and the remote working model, the objective of this study was to explore the effectiveness of an educational program on the life habits of the Human Resources staff in the Ministry of Public Education (MEP) with the intention of implementing practices that will achieve greater physical and mental wellness. Methods: a questionnaire prepared with Google Forms tool. This was structured by five questions based on the Transtheoretical Model (MT) (Cabrera, 2000) and two questions on the PAR-Q & YOU questionnaire (CSEP, 2002). In addition, an interview was conducted with the Head of Human Resources to obtain key information to support the approach of the proposal. Results: the female gender was the one with the greatest predominance;about half of this population live alone. After the virtual sessions, positive progress was made in the first four stages of the TM, given that, for example, the population that was considering performing physical activity in the next few days increased from 89% to 93.9%. Furthermore, before the intervention, 91.3% had no cardiovascular complications and around 40% had joint discomfort or some back injury. This intervention was a key opportunity to motivate the change towards a more active and healthy lifestyle among MEP's HR staff. Conclusions: it was opportune to develop the intervention and mediate for a positive change towards the practice of physical activity. In addition, 72.29% confirmed having had an improvement in both physical and mental health, the latter of great relevance in the conditions of the current pandemic.","Vargas-Hernandez, D.

"Emotional impact and resilience in adolescents in Spain and Ecuador during COVID-19: A cross-cultural study","The COVID-19 pandemic is im-pacting the emotional health of adolescents. Factors such as resilience can buffer this important impact on their well-being. Our aim was to study the association between anxious-depressive symptomatology and resilience in adolescents from Spain and Mexico, and to compare the differences between the two samples. A total of 476 adolescents (70.10 % female) aged 9-18 years (M = 15.62;SD = 1.22), equally distributed between the two countries, participated in the study. They were assessed using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale and the Resilience Scale. We conduct-ed descriptive analyses, independent samples t-tests, effect size calculation and Pearson correlations. The results showed that the profile of adaptive adjustment to the pandemic was: being a male, not having experienced a stressful life event, not having previous physical or psychological health problems and residing in Spain. While the risk profile for the pandemic was: being a female, having a stressful life event, having some type of previous physical and psychological health problem, and residing in Ecuador. Our data point to the importance of detecting the specific needs of adolescents according to their socio-economic and cultural context in order to implement interventions to protect their mental health during the pandemic.","Valero-Moreno, S.; Lacomba-Trejo, L.; Nieto, M.

"SOCIAL WELL-BEING OF THE PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL COMMUNITY DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN ROSTOV OBLAST (BASED ON THE MATERIALS OF IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS)","After the World Health Organization recognized the situation with the spread of the new coronavirus infection as critical, a huge array of a wide variety of studies, mainly of applied value, appeared. Many of these studies are devoid of a methodological basis and semantic grounds because not enough time has passed for a fundamental understanding of what and how to study. For the correct understanding of the essence and real state of the social well-being of medical workers, a system of both internal and external control is required. Internal control is a key task of state health policy at the federal, regional, and municipal levels. External control is the prerogative of third-party public and scientific organizations capable of representing the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of social processes in the health care sector, giving them a neutral and objective assessment. A rational form of external control is the sociological diagnosis of the effects of the pandemic, both for public health and for the social and mental health of certain professional groups. The task of modern sociology is to quantitatively and qualitatively measure components of social health of the professional medical community, the integral criterion of which is social well-being as a subjective perception and assessment by an individual medical worker of the level of their achievements, degree of realization of their needs, and the effectiveness of their life strategy, taking into account the sociocultural context (at the micro- and macrolevel) and objective factors (vectors of social policy of the state, situation in health care and public health, rhetoric of the mass media, and level of education in society). The concept of social well-being is closely related to the phenomenon of social adaptation. Merton's conceptual scheme of social adaptation (with a slight change in the sequence of types with an emphasis on the constructiveness of behavior models, rather than their anomalousness) is used to study the types of behavior of medical workers in a complex epidemiological situation. The theoretical significance of the typologization of social adaptation models is to reduce the conglomerate of behavioral acts and individual life worlds of medical workers to simplified scientific constructs for the correct understanding of the current situation and development of tools for social work with the professional medical community if there is a real need for them. The concept of social adaptation allows considering social well-being not as some kind of artificial objective reality, but as a dynamic characteristic of the actor's professional thinking.","Vyalykh, N.

"Determination of Depression, Anxiety and Stress in Pregnancy During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Objective: This study aims to determine the depression, anxiety and stress in pregnant women during the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Materials and Methods: The sample of this descriptive study consisted of 203 pregnant women reached over online between May 15 and June 1, 2020. To collect data in the study, the 'Personal Information Form', 'COVID-19 PandemicRelated Information Form' and 'Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21)' were used. Results: In our study, it was determined that 81.7% of the pregnant women experienced anxiety, 56.1% depression and 24.1% stress, according to the median values obtained from DASS-21. The median values of anxiety and stress of unemployed women were higher than those of working women and the difference between them was statistically significant (p=0.011;p=0.023). The differences between social media use (p=0.044;p=0.048;p=0.015), thinking that they are positive for COVID-19 (p=0.009;p=0.014;p=0.001), thoughts about the end of the COVID-19 pandemic (p=0.001;p=0.001;p=0.001), worrying about their own health and the fetus (p=0.001;p=0.001;p=0.001), and experiencing abnormal physical symptoms (p=0.001;p=0.001;p=0.001) had statistically significant effects on the anxiety, depression and stress subscale median values of pregnant women. Conclusion: Pregnant women were found to experience depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is considered that knowing the negative psychosocial reactions experienced by pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic and taking protective measures will contribute to improving the health outcomes of the mother and the fetus.","Yildirim, F.; Gunaydin, N.; Arar, M.

"Stress-free vet visits: considering the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic","Visits to the small animal veterinary practice are typically stressful for many animals, especially where they already have an anxious or fearful disposition. Although the purpose of the visit is to improve the animal's welfare (by improving physical health and wellbeing), there may be an impact on the animal's mental health and emotional state. The current pandemic situation has made vet visits even more difficult, because a number of options for preparing for the visit, or carrying out the visit itself, have not always been available. This article considers techniques for minimising fear, anxiety and stress in companion animals being treated at the vet practice, through preparation, protocols and procedures. Principles of good practice when helping animals to have the least stressful experience during a vet visit are considered. Additional special measures for particularly anxious or fearful animals are also discussed. The identification of stress-reducing protocols is largely based on the low-stress handling techniques identified in research and the importance of these as perceived by veterinary staff. Changes within the practice that have impacted animals' anxiety levels, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, are identified and considered. Reflections concerning the pandemic experience, as provided to the author by a number of veterinary surgeons and nurses, are recorded and considered as the basis for further research. Consideration is also given to the feasibility and value of retaining some changes implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Williams, J.","https://doi.org/10.12968/coan.2021.0066","","Database: CAB Abstracts; Publication type: article; Publication details: Companion Animal; 27(2), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28255,""
"Thinking about the Spanish flu in Bogot in the era of COVID-19 (Special Issue: Especial de pandemias) [Spanish]","Introduction: The current COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that although the disease indiscriminately attacks the population, the popular classes are particularly more exposed due to their conditions of life, which is similar to the Spanish flu epidemic that reached the Colombian capital in 1918. Development: In this study, we analyzed discourses that were built around the capital's popular classes during the Spanish flu epidemic in 1918. The approach to primary sources, especially the graphic press of the time, accounts for the precariousness with which the poor, located in a peripheral depressed sector of the city, had to face a lethal disease that caused great confusion as it advanced rapidly through a city that lacked public health services. Whereas, the Bogot.. elites, who tried to mitigate the crisis under the discourse of Christian charity, blamed the poor for their fate, which resulted in their lack of hygiene and foresight and their disorder. Conclusions: Today, a century after the flu epidemic in Bogot.. and in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been evidenced in the face of a series of measures ordered by the national and local governments that include mandatory quarantines, the permanence of visions and discourses in which poor patients, far from being understood in their social reality, continue to be seen as a danger to the rest of society.","Art..culomar..a Fernanda Dur..n-Sanchez, C.

"Cognitive emotion regulation, anxiety, and depression in patients hospitalized with COVID-19","Background: A number of studies from different countries have been devoted to studying the psychological state of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the severity of the symptoms of the disease itself, the situation of uncertainty can negatively affect the patients' psychological well-being. Objective: Our research aimed to explore ways for patients with COVID-19 to regulate their emotional state during hospitalization, and how they can reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. Design: The research involved 127 people hospitalized due to confirmed COVID-19: 67 men (52.8%) and 60 women (47.2%), ages 19 to 77 years (M = 43.34, Me = 42, SD = 11.81). We used a set of questionnaires which included the Beck Depression Questionnaire;the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale;the Perceived Social Support Questionnaire (22-item);the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire;and the Dembo-Rubinstein self-assessment scales. Results: Twenty-five and four-tenths percent (25.4%) of the participants had severe symptoms of anxiety, and 24.13% had symptoms of depression. Women showed higher symptoms of depression than men. ANOVA showed no significant differences in the use of emotion regulation strategies in patients being hospitalized at different intervals, or in patients of different age groups. Factor analysis made it possible to distinguish three patterns of emotion regulation: 1) adaptive cognitive change;2) fixation on negative experiences;and 3) deflection of responsibility. Significant positive correlations were found between symptoms of depression and anxiety, and coping by fixation on negative experience only. Conclusion: Although various means of cognitive emotion regulation by patients hospitalized with COVID-19 are currently being presented, these strategies are not associated with significant reductions in their symptoms of depression and anxiety.

Results: Welch's ANOVA showed significant differences between the time-periods in meaningfulness, hardiness, anxiety, depression, and the General Symptomatic Index (GSI) (W = 4.899, p &lt; 0.01;W = 3.173, p &lt; 0.05;W = 8.096, p &lt; 0.01;W = 3.244, p &lt; 0.022;and W = 4.899, p &lt; 0.01, respectively). General linear models for anxiety, depression, and GSI showed that biological sex, chronic diseases, self-assessed fears, and hardiness contributed to all of them. In all three models, hardiness had the most significant impact. Anxiety was also influenced by the time factor, both in itself and in its interaction with hardiness levels. With less hardiness, more anxiety occurred over time. Conclusion: Hardiness was shown to be a personal adaptive resource in stressful situations related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Acute Myopericarditis After First Dose of mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine in a Young Adult","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has brought the global community to a halt. A return to normalcy is dependent on effective reopening strategies that encourage herd immunity through the implementation of vaccines. Cardiopulmonary inflammation has been reported in SARS-CoV-2 infection, independent of the severity, mainly amongst the juvenile population. Cardiovascular involvement following SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with higher mortality and morbidity. Cardiovascular complications following COVID-19 vaccination have been documented as less severe, with no link between cardiovascular injury and death. This case report describes the presentation of an otherwise healthy 18 year-old male who experienced retrosternal chest pain after receiving a first dose of the mRNA-1273 vaccine. The patient had a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for COVID-19 infection. An electrocardiogram revealed diffuse ST elevation and PR segment depression, with increased inflammatory markers consistent with pericarditis. Elevation of troponin (16 ng/mL), evidence of borderline reduced ejection fraction (50-55%), and global left ventricular hypokinesis were suggestive of myopericarditis. Infectious and autoimmune studies were negative. The patient was treated mainly with non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs and colchicine, which resulted in a significant improvement of clinical symptoms. As the administration of emergency COVID-19 vaccines continues worldwide, it is of paramount importance to be aware of possible adverse events, including those affecting the cardiovascular system.","Fadah, K.; Abolbashari, M.; Ojha, C.; Alkhateeb, H.","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.22111","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Cureus Journal of Medical Science; 14(2):5, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28259,""

"Early phase of COVID-19 quarantine impacted insomnia symptoms in Turkish families","Quarantine and isolation are the most important public health measures used to prevent the transmission of infectious diseases among individuals. Quarantine and social isolation cause some health problems, such as depressive symptoms, sleep disturbances, anxiety, irritability, feeling of loneliness, helplessness, and trauma and post-traumatic stress symptoms. In this study, we aimed to examine early phase of COVID-19 quarantine impacted insomnia symptoms in Turkish families. The population of the study comprised students attending the Department of Healthcare Services of Eldivan Health Vocational School at cankiri Karatekin University and their families. In total, 564 students and their families completed online surveys. Data was collected with Google forms. Snowball sampling was used as the data collection method. Female participants, those who gained weight during home quarantine, those who put their phones under their pillow or at the bedside and in another room, and those who used a phone or tablet before sleeping were found to have significantly more insomnia compared to others. The mean day of uninterrupted home quarantine was higher for participants experiencing insomnia (p&lt;0.05).

"An ounce of prevention is still worth a pound of cure, especially in the time of COVID-19","Preventive care - screenings, vaccinations, mental health assessments, and oral and vision health - remain important even in the context of the pandemic. Vaccinations for preventing outbreaks of other infectious diseases (eg, measles, pertussis) are particularly important this year because childhood vaccination rates have decreased. Influenza vaccination is needed to reduce respiratory disease burden on an already taxed health care system. Finally, as they become available, vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, will be a critical tool to help end the pandemic. Throughout the COVID-19 epidemic, a great deal of anxiety has surfaced about safely accessing health care services. Health care providers have adopted a wide variety of strategies to mitigate risk. These strategies include measures to increase social distancing (eg, limits on waiting room capacity);mask wearing by all people in health care facilities;screening of patients for COVID-19 symptoms and, in some instances, for infection;and expanding the use of telemedicine. Patients now have a range of options for safely receiving care and should ask and be informed about these options when making appointments. Care that is needed acutely should not be delayed;vaccinations (for both children and adults) are essential services that should be given on time, and in-person nonurgent care (such as screenings) should be considered when risk of infection is low, based on local COVID-19 transmission rates, and when appropriate Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-recommended mitigation strategies are in place.","Hacker, K.

"Physical activity in children during COVID-19 period: systematic review","The aim of this study is to evaluate the importance of physical activitiy in protecting the health of children and adolescents whose physical activity opportunities were restricted during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. Physical activity contributes to the physical and mental health of children and young people, especially a stronger immune system. On March 11, 2020, The World Health Organization described the COVID-19 virus outbreak as a global pandemic. Due to the restrictions made as a result of the decisions taken by many countries due to the COVID-19 virus epidemic, significant changes have occurred in the Daily lives of children, young people and families. Many countries have restricted the use of physical distance, social interactions, sports, playgrounds and parking spaces. As a result of these restrictions, the decrease in physical activity habits in children has been a cause for concern. Given the strong relationship between health status and physical activity, it appears that during the COVID-19 pandemic, children's health deteriorated further due to a sedentary lifestyle. Because an inactive lifestyle;it is directly related to obesity, weakening of the immune system and risk of chronic diseases. Parents, educators, healthcare professionals and the media have a great role to play in increasing children's physical activity levels. During this period, children should try tos tay healthy with simple exercises that combine games and fun activities while staying at home. Suggestions fort his include participating in physical activities appropriate to pandemic constraints, participating in new leisure activities, using online health and/or physical activity practices. As a result;parents and authorities have great responsibilities in creating adequate physical activity opportunities to protect the health of children and young people during the epidemic.","Canli, M.; z..dogru, A.; Kara, E.","https://doi.org/10.5336/sportsci.2020-79699","","Database: CAB Abstracts; Publication type: article; Publication details: T..rkiye Klinikleri Spor Bilimleri; 13(2):312-317, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28265,""
"The PTSD Checklist (PCL) in victims of terrorism: Comparative analysis of the psychometric properties of its administration by telephone vs in person","Introduction and objectives. In many situations, such as confinement situations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is not possible to administer psychological instruments in person, as originally contemplated in their development. However, the mode of administration can affect the psychometric properties of instrument scores. The PTSD Checklist (PCL) is one of the most widely used instruments for assessing the symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in person. This study is the first research that has analyzed and compared the factorial structure, the internal consistency, the validity of contrasted groups, the diagnostic validity, and the nomological validity of scores on the PCL administered in person and by telephone. Material and methods. The PCL was administered in both application modes to a sample of 634 victims of terrorism along with a structured diagnostic interview and measures of depression and anxiety. Results. Scores on both administration modes of the PCL have the same unifactorial structure, excellent indexes of internal consistency (alpha &gt; .90) and very good indexes of diagnostic validity to identify the PTSD (AUC &gt; .90), discriminate significantly and with large effect sizes (d = 0.88-2.84) between victims with PTSD, with depressive or anxiety disorders and without disorders, and present significant and large correla-tions with measures of other constructs with which PTSD is closely related, namely depression and anxiety. Conclusions. The results suggest that the PCL can be administered over the telephone with the same psychometric guarantees as in person.","Redondo, B.

"Fear of COVID-19 Scale: Adaptation and psychometric properties in Peruvian population","Context and objective: Current context caused by COVID-19 has changed social and day-to-day life worldwide. Mental health is no exception. The objective of this study was to adapt and analyze the psychometric properties of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) in a sample of Peruvian professionals. Material and methods. The sample was composed of 169 participants of a longitudinal study about burnout during the pandemic in Peru. Translation-back translation method was performed (from English to Spanish). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted. Additionally, reliability analyses (Cronbach's Alpha, McDonald's Omega and Test-retest) and correlations with other variables were carried out. Results: Results confirm the one-dimensional nature of the instrument (CFA) with excellent indicators of goodness of fit (CFI = .996;TLI = .99;RMSEA = .06;SRMR = .04) and present good levels of reliability (alpha = .79;omega = .81;ICC = .75). Furthermore, evidence for external validity was found with the Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale and Perceived Stress Scale. The FCV-19S score presents previously unknown correlations with fear of infection of relatives, fear of infection in public places and self-reported perceived health. The score differs by gender, but further examination with larger samples are needed. Main conclusions: The Peruvian version of the FCV-19S shows solid psychometric properties. Its use is attractive for the study of mental health during the pandemic, and the design and focalization of initiatives in vulnerable groups and spaces.","Hernandez, W.; Burneo, A.; Cassaretto, M.","https://doi.org/10.5093/anyes2021a14","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Ansiedad Y Estres-Anxiety and Stress; 27(2-3):103-111, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28267,""
"Screen-based behaviour in children is more than meets the eye","Increased screen time (ST) in children is quickly becoming a public health concern as children are now reliant on technology for social interaction and educational development. The eye-health community has paid considerable attention to this in the recent literature, documenting it as digital eye strain. Continual close eye work and a lack of outdoor play contribute to digital eye strain and todayâ€™s myopia epidemic. This is a cause for concern for public health stakeholders insofar as it leads to sedentary, screen-based behaviour (SSB) in children. This results in a lack of physical activity and impacts both their bodies and their mental health. The potentially harmful effects of prolonged screen exposure on developing brains and bodies are likely to be unique and significant as physiological growth changes intersect with exponentially expanding e-platforms. While embracing the benefits of a highly digitalised world, we need to simultaneously mitigate the potential risks they pose to the health of growing children.","Munsamy, A.

"Parenting Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder during Crises: Differential Responses between the Financial and the COVID-19 Pandemic Crisis","Parenting a child with autism can be particularly stressful and challenging, especially during periods of crises. This study focuses on parenting children with autism during the COVID-19 pandemic in comparison to the economic crisis, six years ago. We administered the same set of questionnaires (CES-D, F-COPES, PSI-SF, and WHOQoL-BREF), along with a demographic characteristic and a COVID-19-related questionnaire to the same group of parents of children with autism as we did six years ago. Results indicated that during the COVID-19 crisis, the level of parenting stress and the distress due to personal factors related to demands of parenting, were significantly lower compared to the economic crisis, while the environment facet of quality of life was significantly higher. The depressive symptomatology was elevated during both periods. Finally, when addressing the pandemic crisis, parents were more likely to passively accept problematic issues, less able to obtain social support, and less able to acquire and accept help from others. In our sample, findings differentiate the genre of crises through the parentsâ€™ responses regarding the sense of competence in their parental role, their quality of life, and the coping strategies they implemented. The study implies that each crisis must be confronted with particular responses to particular needs.","Papanikolaou, K.; Ntre, V.; Gertsou, I.

"Promoting Mental Health and Wellbeing in Multicultural Australia: A Collaborative Regional Approach","Migrant communities are often under-served by mental health services. Lack of community engagement results in missed opportunities for mental health promotion and early intervention, delayed care, and high rates of untreated psychological distress. Bilingual clinicians and others who work with these communities lack linguistically and culturally appropriate resources. This article reports on the implementation and evaluation of a community-based group mindfulness program delivered to Arabic and Bangla-speaking communities in Sydney, Australia, including modifications made to the content and format in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The program was positioned within a stepped-care model for primary mental health care and adopted a collaborative regional approach. In addition to improved mental health outcomes for face-to-face and online program participants, we have documented numerous referrals to specialist services and extensive diffusion of mindfulness skills, mostly to family members, within each community. Community partnerships were critical to community engagement. Training workshops to build the skills of the bilingual health and community workforce increased the programâ€™s reach. In immigrant nations such as Australia, mainstream mental health promotion must be complemented by activities that target specific population groups. Scaled up, and with appropriate adaptation, the group mindfulness program offers a low-intensity in-language intervention for under-served communities.","Blignault, I.; Saab, H.; Woodland, L.; Giourgas, K.; Baddah, H.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19052723","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(5), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28270,""
"Life Habits and Mental Health: Behavioural Addiction, Health Benefits of Daily Habits, and the Reward System","In this review, the underlying mechanisms of health benefits and the risk of habitual behaviours such as internet use and media multitasking were explored, considering their associations with the reward/motivation system. The review highlights that several routines that are beneficial when undertaken normally may evolve into excessive behaviour and have a negative impact, as represented by â€œthe inverted U-curve modelâ€. This is especially critical in the current era, where technology like the internet has become mainstream despite the enormous addictive risk. The understanding of underlying mechanisms of behavioural addiction and optimal level of habitual behaviours for mental health benefits are deepened by shedding light on some findings of neuroimaging studies to have hints to facilitate better management and prevention strategies of addictive problems. With the evolution of the world, and the inevitable use of some technologies that carry the risk of addiction, more effective strategies for preventing and managing addiction are in more demand than before, and the insights of this study are also valuable foundations for future research.","Fujiwara, H.; Tsurumi, K.; Shibata, M.; Kobayashi, K.; Miyagi, T.; Ueno, T.; Oishi, N.; Murai, T.","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.813507","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Frontiers in Psychiatry; 13, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28271,""
"Caregiver-Reported Changes in the Socioemotional Wellbeing and Daily Habits of Children With Special Educational Needs During the First COVID-19 National Lockdown in the United Kingdom","The implementation of social distancing measures (e.g., school closures) by governments worldwide to prevent the spread of COVID-19 has affected millions of children and their families. However, the consequences of such measures on the wellbeing of children with special educational needs (SEN) and their caregivers are not fully understood. The present study examined the socioemotional wellbeing and daily habits of children between 5 and 12 years old with SEN during the first national COVID-19 lockdown in the United Kingdom. Participants were 995 caregivers between 18 and 61 years old living in the United Kingdom who completed a 20 -min electronic survey on child and family wellbeing distributed via social networks between July and August 2020. The findings showed that children with SEN were more likely to experience more emotional and behavioral difficulties during the lockdown than children without SEN. Children with SEN but without mental health difficulties did not have more behavior difficulties during the lockdown than children without SEN. There was a significant increase in screen time and decrease in sleep time for children with and without SEN during the lockdown, but children with SEN were using screens more often than children without SEN both before and during the lockdown. Finally, caregivers with children with SEN reported more difficulty with the confinement than caregivers with children without SEN, but caregiver and child poor mental health were likely to explain the difference. The findings show that the wellbeing of children with SEN was more likely to be negatively affected by the lockdown than the wellbeing of children without SEN. Caregiver and child mental health were likely to explain the differences.","Morgul, E.; Kallitsoglou, A.; Essau, C.

"Scope of computational biology and bioinformatics towards the discovery of potential therapeutic agents against viral diseases","Computational biology and bioinformatics resources provide a cutting-edge platform for the screening and development of novel therapeutic agents against probable targets of emerging viral diseases. Emerging viral infections such as COVID-19, Ebola, Nipha andMiddle East respiratory syndrome are some of the potential public health threats reported with high mortality and morbidity. The infections caused by these viruses were recently considered as acute onset immune dysrhythmia syndrome. The altered monocytic, cytokines and chemokines balances observed in several emerging viral infections lead to the acute respiratory distress and multiinflammatory syndromes [1]. Recent studies suggested that many countries were unable to manage the drastic and unexpected onset of these viral outbreaks and such a scenario adversely affected the global economy [2]. There are limited vaccines currently available for most of these viral infections and the vaccine development strategies are extremely tedious and complex. In addition, there are no approved drugs available for most of the emerging viral infections. For example, although the use of non toxic concentrations of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), a glucose analog that inhibits the activity of phosphoglucoisomerase in the glycolytic pathway of SARS-CoV-2 is suggested to be one of the promising therapeutic agents for COVID-19, the successful application of this drug is yet to be confirmed [3]. Thus, the present editorial briefly outlines the scope of bioinformatics and computational biology toward the discovery of potential therapeutic agents against various viral diseases.","Skariyachan, S.","https://doi.org/10.2217/fvl-2021-0281","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Future Virology;: 4, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28273,""
"#Socialdistancing: Social Media Use and Online Social Support Moderate the Effect of Pandemic-Related Stress on Internalizing Symptoms in Emerging Adults","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to major stressors, increases in internalizing symptomatology, and greater reliance on online interactions. We examined associations between social media use, online social support, pandemic-related stress, and internalizing symptoms, and tested the moderating role of social media use on the relation between stress and symptom change across time. Methods: Emerging adults aged 18â€“25 (N = 200) self-reported pandemic-related stress, internalizing symptoms, social media use, and online social support in May 2020, then repeated measures of internalizing symptoms in August 2020. Results: Greater social media use was cross-sectionally associated with greater stress and anxiety symptoms. High social media use in conjunction with high interpersonal stress was predictive of increases in depression, whereas low online social support and high total stress was predictive of increases in anxiety. Discussion: Findings suggest that general social media usage and online social support are differentially related to internalizing symptom change among emerging adults.","Politte-Corn, Madison, Nick, Elizabeth A.; Dickey, Lindsay, Pegg, Samantha, Cole, David A.; Kujawa, Autumn","https://doi.org/10.1521/jscp.2021.40.6.30","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology; 41(1):30, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28274,""

Methods: Participants (N = 236;Mage = 30.3;64% female) were assessed 1â€“3 years prior to the pandemic and again in April of 2020. Markers of self-regulation (vagal tone, attachment insecurity, stress-reactive rumination, and attentional control) were assessed at Time 1, as were depressive symptoms, sleep problems, relationship satisfaction, perceived stress, and substance use. These outcomes were assessed again during the pandemic, along with anxiety symptoms and peri-traumatic distress. Results: Poor pre-pandemic self-regulation was associated with higher peri-pandemic depressive and anxiety symptoms, peri-traumatic distress, and cannabis use. Self-regulation was not associated with sleep, relationship satisfaction, alcohol use, or drug use and did not moderate changes over time. Discussion: Prospective analyses indicated simultaneous, independent associations of cognitive and emotional self-regulation with mental health and well-being during the initial COVID-19 pandemic surge, yet pre-pandemic self-regulation did not account for trajectories of change over time. Findings emphasize the importance of prospective data for understanding biopsychosocial resilience during the pandemic and beyond.","Haydon, Katherine C.; Salvatore, Jessica E.","https://doi.org/10.1521/jscp.2021.40.6.1","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology; 41(1):1, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28275,""
"Health perceptions among victims in post-accord Colombia: Focus groups in a province affected by the armed conflict","The peace agreement with the Colombian guerrilla group Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombiaâ€”EjÃ©rcito del Pueblo represented an opportunity for peacebuilding and victimsâ€™ reparation, rather than the end of the internal armed conflict. In this context, this study aimed to uncover the consequences of conflict on victimsâ€™ health and on health service provision, and their perceived health status during the post-accord stage in the Meta region, located in the countryâ€™s eastern plains. Historically, this region has been one of the territories most affected by the presence of conflict-related groups and armed confrontations. Through focus groups, this research explored the health perceptions and experiences of victims of armed conflict. Ten focus groups were conducted with men and women, victims of the armed-conflict, in four municipalities with different degrees of armed conflict intensity. The focus group transcripts were coded using NVivo. The results show that the way women have experienced conflict and the effects of conflict on mental health in general for men, women, and children were recurrent themes in the dialogue of victims. Likewise, it highlights the need to understand the barriers that the current health model imposes on the right to health itself. From the victimâ€™s perspective, they experience stigmatization, discrimination, and revictimization when accessing health services. These barriers co-occur along with structural limitations of the health system that affect the general population.","GonzÃ¡lez-Uribe, Catalina, Olmos-PinzÃ³n, Antonio, LeÃ³n-Giraldo, SebastiÃ¡n, Bernal, Oscar, Moreno-Serra, Rodrigo","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0264684","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: PLoS One; 17(3), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28276,""
"A call for open data to develop mental health digital biomarkers","Digital biomarkers of mental health, created using data extracted from everyday technologies including smartphones, wearable devices, social media and computer interactions, have the opportunity to revolutionise mental health diagnosis and treatment by providing near-continuous unobtrusive and remote measures of behaviours associated with mental health symptoms. Machine learning models process data traces from these technologies to identify digital biomarkers. In this editorial, we caution clinicians against using digital biomarkers in practice until models are assessed for equitable predictions (â€˜model equityâ€™) across demographically diverse patients at scale, behaviours over time, and data types extracted from different devices and platforms. We posit that it will be difficult for any individual clinic or large-scale study to assess and ensure model equity and alternatively call for the creation of a repository of open de-identified data for digital biomarker development.","Adler, Daniel A.; Wang, Fei, Mohr, David C.; Estrin, Deborah, Livesey, Cecilia, Choudhury, Tanzeem","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.28","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(2), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28277,""
"A rapid review of emergency department interventions for children and young people presenting with suicidal ideation","BackgroundSuicidal ideation is an increasingly common presentation to the paediatric emergency department. The presence of suicidal ideation is linked to acute psychiatric hospital admission and increased risk of suicide. The paediatric emergency department plays a critical role in reducing risk of suicide, strengthening protective factors and encouraging patient engagement with ongoing care.AimsThis rapid review aims to synthesise evidence on interventions that can be implemented in the paediatric emergency department for children and adolescents presenting with suicidal ideation.MethodSix electronic databases were searched for studies published since January 2010: PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Cochrane. Outcomes of interest included suicidal ideation, engagement with out-patient services, incidence of depressive symptoms, hopelessness, family empowerment, hospital admission and feasibility of interventions. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to evaluate the quality of studies.ResultsSix studies of paediatric emergency department-initiated family-based (n = 4) and motivational interviewing interventions (n = 2) were narratively reviewed. The studies were mainly small and of varying quality. The evidence synthesis suggests that both types of intervention, when initiated by the paediatric emergency department, reduce suicidal ideation and improve patient engagement with out-patient services. Family-based interventions also showed a reduction in suicidality and improvement in family empowerment, hopelessness and depressive symptoms.ConclusionsPaediatric emergency department-initiated interventions are crucial to reduce suicidal ideation and risk of suicide, and to enhance ongoing engagement with out-patient services. Further research is needed;however, family-based and motivational interviewing interventions could be feasibly and effectively implemented in the paediatric emergency department setting.","Virk, Farazi, Waine, Julie, Berry, Clio","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.21","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(2), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28278,""
"Digital technologies to support adolescents with depression and anxiety: Review","SUMMARY Depression and anxiety are common in adolescents, but most affected will not get any formal help. Digital mental health technologies (i.e. resources and interventions to support and improve mental health) are a potential way to extend the reach and increase adolescents' access to therapies, at a relatively low cost. Many young people can access the internet and mobile technologies, including in low- and middle-income countries. There has been increased interest in integrating technologies in a range of settings, especially because of the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescent mental health, at a time when services are under pressure. This clinical review gives an overview of digital technologies to support the prevention and management of depression and anxiety in adolescence. The technologies are presented in relation to their technological approaches, underlying psychological or other theories, setting, development, evaluations to date and how they might be accessed. There is also a discussion of the potential benefits, challenges and future developments in this field.

"NALOXONE TRAINING: AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ONCOLOGY NURSES TO SAVE LIVES","Overdose deaths have increased during the Covid-19 pandemic, likely attributed to fentanyl, a synthetic opioid. Naloxone is a harm reduction strategy, and similar to a fire extinguisher, to be used in emergencies. If administered in time, naloxone can reverse an opioid overdose. A hospital-wide survey of multidisciplinary oncology healthcare providers evaluating experiences and knowledge related to opioid use disorders (OUDs) was distributed via email over a 4 week time period in early 2020. This  focuses on naloxone administration and nurses, including Advanced Practice Providers (APPs). The total possible sample was ~1560 participants (~360 APPs and ~1200 nurses). The final sample included 180 APPs and 518 nurses (n = 698). The response rates were 50% for APPs and 43% for nurses. The mean age for nurses was 38.4 (SD 11.4) and 40.2 (SD 10) for APPs. A greater percentage of participants were female (n = 641, 91.8%) and White (n = 631, 90.4%). Overall, 49.7% of nurses (n =257) and 62.3% of APPs (n = 112) had worked in oncology for &gt; 5 years. Participants were asked to respond to the following statement: ""I feel comfortable administering naloxone in the community"". A greater percentage of APPs (39.4%, n = 69) compared to nurses (29.1%, n = 145) answered no. Overall, the majority of nurses (n = 201, 40.4%) and APPs (n = 71, 40.6%) answered ""Yes- I would feel comfortable with training"". Nurses (n = 309, 64.2%) and APPs (n = 104, 60.1%) were interested in attending a naloxone training class. Many oncology nurses and APPs would feel comfortable administering naloxone in the community with training, and the majority are interested in attending a naloxone training course. This represents an opportunity for oncology nurses and APPs to positively impact the opioid epidemic, for not only patients affected by cancer, but there may be a positive trickle-down effect on families and communities. Incorporating naloxone training as a continuing education opportunity for oncology nurses and APPs, and may increase knowledge, decrease addiction stigma, and ultimately save lives.","McNally, Gretchen, McLaughlin, Eric, Baiocchi, Robert, Rosselet, Robin","https://doi.org/10.1188/22.ONF.E2","","Database: CINAHL; Publication type: article; Publication details: Oncology Nursing Forum; 49(2):E83-E84, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28280,""
"MENTORSHIP: A LIFELINE FOR ONCOLOGY NURSES DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","As nurses have confronted COVID-19, arguably the most serious health crisis of our time, the need to care for themselves and their colleagues has become crucial. A meta-analysis published in 2020 showed the toll on healthcare workers was significant for anxiety, depression, and insomnia. The department of nursing at a large urban cancer hospital created and launched a successful mentoring program in 2016. With many institutional changes driven by COVID-19, the program was paused at the height of the crisis. In Fall 2020 the decision was made to re-open enrollment and participation surpassed all previous cohorts, as a record number of nurses initiated mentoring partnerships while the pandemic was still raging. Program leaders sought to understand the experiences of nurses participating in the mentoring program during COVID-19, assessing its impact on psychological well-being, professional support, and job satisfaction. Traditional means of connecting mentoring partners were replaced during the pandemic by an entirely virtual platform. A survey was sent to 193 mentoring participants from the Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 cohorts representing nurses and APRNs in various positions across the institution. The survey captured demographics followed by eight mentoring-specific questions. 61 participants (N=61) responded, a 31.6% response rate. Survey results showed 70.5% of respondents felt that their mentoring partnership improved job satisfaction and 77% said mentoring was a source of professional support. Most significantly, 72.2% of respondents state their mentoring partnership positively contributed to their psychological wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic. A virtual mentoring platform prompted by COVID-19 had a positive impact on participants overall. Survey results show that the program improved job satisfaction, which can impact staff retention rates. Professional development remained dynamic because of the mentoring program. Nurses felt supported during the pandemic both personally and professionally. Final presentation will share the program structure and a full review of survey data. The virtual format of the mentoring program leveraged technology to allow record-level participation, personal connection, and flexibility during an uncertain time. Large group sessions were combined with interactive virtual break-out rooms. In these sessions, partners met, discussed goals, and engaged in didactic exercises. This program could be implemented at other centers to increase nursing job satisfaction, retention, and psychological well-being.

"Online art therapy for multiple sclerosis","Introduction: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease that can trigger disabling signs and symptoms. Art Therapy uses various artistic resources as a means to recover and improve wellbeing and mental, emotional and social health. During the period of social distance caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, online art therapy presents itself as a viable technique for people with MS. Objectives: Analyze the possibilities of online art therapy for people with MS. Methods: Nine women with relapsing-remitting MS (n=5/56%) and secondary-progressive MS (n=4/44%), aged from 28 to 63 years (Mean=45;SD=13.65) and EDSS between 0 and 7. All were invited to participate in online art therapy workshops and randomly constituted three groups with three people each. They carried out individual anamnesis and were supplied with materials such as sheets of A4 bond paper, scissors, white glue, gouache or acrylic paint, brushes, felt-tip pens/crayons or colored brushes, notebooks and magazines to cut out. The workshops lasted one hour each and were held by WhatsApp once a week. Results: Reports of anxiety, sadness and need were identified and correlated to the lack of communication and interaction resulting from the social isolation experienced by COVID-19. Thus, Art Therapy promoted therapeutic interaction between participants and art therapists through free artistic expression. Conclusions: Online Art Therapy was effective for this group of women with MS, as it provided improved well-being and quality of life in a period of social distancing triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. The small number of participants was important for the directed attention and maintenance of focus during the activities.","Teresa, T.; Margareth, Z.; Dias, A.","https://doi.org/10.1177/13524585211052173","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Multiple Sclerosis Journal; 28(2):NP22-NP23, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28283,""
"Mental Health-Related Emergency Department Visits Among Children During The Early COVID-19 Pandemic","Objective: To measure univariate and covariate-adjusted trends in children's mental health-related emergency department (MH-ED) use across geographically diverse areas of the U.S. during the first wave of the Coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Method: This is a retrospective, cross-sectional cohort study using electronic health records from four academic health systems, comparing percent volume change and adjusted risk of child MH-ED visits among children aged 3â€“17Â years, matched on 36-week (3/18/19â€“11/25/19 vs. 3/16/20â€“11/22/20) and 12-week seasonal time intervals. Adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated using multivariate Poisson regression. Results: Visits declined during spring-fall 2020 (nÂ =Â 3892 vs. nÂ =Â 5228, -25.5%) and during spring (nÂ =Â 1051 vs. nÂ =Â 1839, -42.8%), summer (nÂ =Â 1430 vs. nÂ =Â 1469, -2.6%), and fall (nÂ =Â 1411 vs. nÂ =Â 1920, -26.5%), compared with 2019. There were greater declines among males (28.2% vs. females -22.9%), children 6â€“12-year (-28.6% vs. -25.9% for 3â€“5Â years and -22.9% for 13â€“17Â years), and Black children (-34.8% vs. -17.7% to -24.9%). Visits also declined for developmental disorders (-17.0%) and childhood-onset disorders (e.g., attention deficit and hyperactivity disorders;-18.0%). During summer-fall 2020, suicide-related visits rose (summer +29.8%, fall +20.4%), but were not significantly elevated from 2019 when controlling for demographic shifts. In contrast, MH-ED use during spring-fall 2020 was significantly reduced for intellectual disabilities (IRR 0.62 [95% CI 0.47â€“0.86]), developmental disorders (IRR 0.71 [0.54â€“0.92]), and childhood-onset disorders (IRR 0.74 [0.56â€“0.97]). Conclusions: The early pandemic brought overall declines in child MH-ED use alongside co-occurring demographic and diagnostic shifts. Children vulnerable to missed detection during instructional disruptions experienced disproportionate declines, suggesting need for future longitudinal research in this population.","Edgcomb, J.

"Healing strokes: Virtually improving stroke survivors and caregivers' well-being through student-run art therapy support group","Background: Depression and anxiety impact recovery and quality of life in 1 in 3 stroke survivors. Caregivers also experience burnout. Creative art-based therapy boosts feelings of accomplishment, self-esteem, and neuroplasticity by stimulating diverse brain regions. Few outpatient art therapy programs exist for stroke survivors and caregivers, limited further during the COVID-19 pandemic. We aim to implement an outpatient, student-run virtual art therapy curriculum using a patient-carer team approach to foster a supportive peer community, reduce depressive symptoms in survivors, and increase relief for caregivers. Methods: A multidisciplinary team of stroke physician, nurse, occupational therapist, clinic managers, and undergraduate student volunteers created an evidenced-based art therapy curriculum feasible for stroke survivors. An art educator trained volunteers in empathetic communication, teaching techniques, and patient privacy. Participants pre-registered for weekly 1 hour classes held via video conference and received art materials by mail. We administered surveys at initial registration and quarterly. An institutional grant provided funding. Results: From September 2020 - July 2021, Healing Strokes hosted 30 classes using the curriculum (Table 1) for 71 survivors and caregivers from 9 states at a 1:5 volunteer-to-participant ratio. 20 participants (14 survivors, 6 caregivers) self-reported benefits of peer support, creative inspiration, increased sense of accomplishment, and improvement in speech and fine motor skills. Conclusion: Implementation of a virtual outpatient art-based therapy program for stroke survivors and caregivers is feasible with participants self-reporting benefits in functional recovery and mood. Post-stroke supportive care programs can expand to include art therapy during a pandemic. Future studies can validate the impact on peer support, function, and post-stroke depression and anxiety.

"Home schooling and lock-down can foot the blame for an interesting COVID-19 complication","Objective: The period of enforced school-closures from March 2020 to March 2021 has taken a huge toll on children in Ireland. Ill-effects of COVID-19 including direct infection, social isolation and mental health problems are clear to see. However, not all complications are so obvious. We examined the findings of paediatric nerve conduction studies (NCS) carried out at a tertiary general hospital in the South of Ireland. We aimed to highlight at increase in the incidence of 'idiopathic' common peroneal nerve palsies arising during the COVID-19 social and school restrictions. Methods: We examined the results from all NCS performed on children (&lt;18 years) during the two and a half year period between January 2019 and July 2021. We correlated our findings with the clinical patient information from the time of the neurophysiological investigation. Results: One hundred and two NCS examinations were performed on 95 different children between January 2019 and July 2021. During the 1-year period before the COVID-19 pandemic arrived in Ireland (January 2019 to January 2020) there was only a single case of paediatric common peroneal nerve palsy recorded. This case had an obvious precipitant cause (recent significant weight loss). During the time of school closures, there were five cases including one case of bilateral common peroneal nerve palsy. MRI and examination identified no cause, and all children reported adopting abnormal sitting postures while carrying out schoolwork at home (prolonged kneeling, side sitting, unsuitable seating). Conclusions: Children have been seen as invisible victims of the COVID-19 pandemic, and although the direct health burden of COVID-19 infection on children is lower than in vulnerable adults;there are many negative social, educational, psychiatric and indeed neurological effectors of paediatric health arising from the COVID-19 crisis. We hypothesise that the prolonged school closures led to an increase in 'idiopathic' paediatric common peroneal nerve palsies, which are otherwise extremely rare in this population.","Carter, M.; Fernandes, F.; McSweeney, N.; O'Mahony, O.; Dineen, J.; McNamara, B.","https://doi.org/10.1111/dmcn.15123","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology; 64(SUPPL 1):23-24, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28287,""
"[Thumb-tack needles based on ""<i>Biaoben</i> acupoint compatibility"" for sequela of COVID-19 during recovery period]","To observe the effect of thumb-tack needles based on ""<i>Biaoben</i> acupoint compatibility"" on sequela symptoms, mental state and pulmonary ventilation function in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during recovery period. Fifty cases of COVID-19 during recovery period were randomly divided into an observation group and a control group, 25 cases in each group. The patients in the observation group were treated with thumb-tack needles at Guanyuan (CV 4), Zusanli (ST 36) and Taiyuan (LU 9). The patients in the control group were treated with sham thumb-tack needles at identical acupoints as the observation group. The treatment in the two groups was given once a day, 7-day treatment was taken as a course of treatment, and totally two courses of treatment were given. The TCM symptom score, Hamilton anxiety scale (HAMA) score, Hamilton depression scale (HAMD) score, pulmonary function (forced vital capacity [FVC], forced expiratory volume in the first second [FEV1], peak expiratory flow [PEF]), the severity of pulmonary ventilation dysfunction and pulmonary imaging changes in the two groups were compared before and after treatment. Compared before treatment, the total scores and each item scores of TCM symptom scale, HAMA scores and HAMD scores in the two groups were reduced after treatment (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). Except for the symptom scores of dry throat and dry stool, the total score and each item score of TCM symptom scale, HAMA score and HAMD score in the observation group were lower than those in the control group (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). Compared before treatment, FVC, FEV1 and PEF in the two groups were increased after treatment (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05), and those in the observation group were higher than the control group (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). The severity of pulmonary ventilation dysfunction in the two groups was reduced after treatment (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05), and the severity in the observation group was better than that in the control group (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). After treatment, the lung shadow area in the two groups was decreased (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05), and that in the observation group was smaller than the control group (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). The improvement of imaging change in the observation group was better than that in the control group (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). The thumb-tack needles based on ""<i>Biaoben</i> acupoint compatibility"" could significantly reduce the sequela symptoms, anxiety and depression in patients with COVID-19 during recovery stage, and improve the pulmonary ventilation function. <b>Ã§â€ºÂ®Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¯Â¼Å¡</b>Ã¨Â§â€šÃ¥Â¯Å¸Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ã¦Â â€¡Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã©â€¦ÂÃ§Â©Â´Ã¢â‚¬ÂÃ¦ÂÂ¿Ã©â€™Ë†Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¦â€“Â°Ã¥Å¾â€¹Ã¥â€ Â Ã§Å Â¶Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦Â¯â€™Ã¨â€šÂºÃ§â€šÅ½Ã¦ÂÂ¢Ã¥Â¤ÂÃ¦Å“Å¸Ã¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã©Ââ€”Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ§Â²Â¾Ã§Â¥Å¾Ã§Å Â¶Ã¦â‚¬ÂÃ¥ÂÅ Ã¨â€šÂºÃ©â‚¬Å¡Ã¦Â°â€Ã¥Å Å¸Ã¨Æ’Â½Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â³â€¢Ã¯Â¼Å¡</b>Ã¥Â°â€ 50Ã¤Â¾â€¹Ã¦â€“Â°Ã¥Å¾â€¹Ã¥â€ Â Ã§Å Â¶Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦Â¯â€™Ã¨â€šÂºÃ§â€šÅ½Ã¦ÂÂ¢Ã¥Â¤ÂÃ¦Å“Å¸Ã¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã©Å¡ÂÃ¦Å“ÂºÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ¨Â§â€šÃ¥Â¯Å¸Ã§Â»â€žÃ¥â€™Å’Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã§â€¦Â§Ã§Â»â€žÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Ââ€ž25Ã¤Â¾â€¹Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¨Â§â€šÃ¥Â¯Å¸Ã§Â»â€žÃ©â€¡â€¡Ã§â€Â¨Ã¦ÂÂ¿Ã©â€™Ë†Ã¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã§Â©Â´Ã¥Ââ€“Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¥â€¦Æ’Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¨Â¶Â³Ã¤Â¸â€°Ã©â€¡Å’Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¥Â¤ÂªÃ¦Â¸Å Ã¯Â¼â€ºÃ¥Â¯Â¹Ã§â€¦Â§Ã§Â»â€žÃ©â‚¬â€°Ã§â€Â¨Ã§â€°Â¹Ã¥Ë†Â¶Ã§Å¡Â®Ã¥â€ â€¦Ã©â€™Ë†Ã¥â€¦Â·Ã¨Â¿â€ºÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã¥Ââ€¡Ã¥Å¸â€¹Ã©â€™Ë†Ã¥Â¤â€žÃ§Ââ€ Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Ââ€“Ã§Â©Â´Ã¥ÂÅ’Ã¨Â§â€šÃ¥Â¯Å¸Ã§Â»â€žÃ£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Â¯ÂÃ¥Â¤Â©1Ã¦Â¬Â¡Ã¯Â¼Å’7 dÃ¤Â¸ÂºÃ¤Â¸â‚¬Ã§â€“â€”Ã§Â¨â€¹Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥â€¦Â±Ã¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”2Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ§â€“â€”Ã§Â¨â€¹Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Â¯â€Ã¨Â¾Æ’Ã¤Â¸Â¤Ã§Â»â€žÃ¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¥â€°ÂÃ¥ÂÅ½Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¥Å’Â»Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¦Â±â€°Ã¥Â¯â€ Ã¥Â°â€Ã©Â¡Â¿Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¡Â¨Ã¯Â¼Ë†HAMAÃ¯Â¼â€°Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¦Â±â€°Ã¥Â¯â€ Ã¥Â°â€Ã©Â¡Â¿Ã¦Å â€˜Ã©Æ’ÂÃ©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¡Â¨Ã¯Â¼Ë†HAMDÃ¯Â¼â€°Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¨â€šÂºÃ¥Å Å¸Ã¨Æ’Â½Ã¥Ââ€šÃ¦â€¢Â°[Ã§â€Â¨Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¨â€šÂºÃ¦Â´Â»Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¯Â¼Ë†FVCÃ¯Â¼â€°Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ§Â¬Â¬1Ã§Â§â€™Ã§â€Â¨Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¥â€˜Â¼Ã¦Â°â€Ã¥Â®Â¹Ã§Â§Â¯Ã¯Â¼Ë†FEV1Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¦Â½Â®Ã¦Â°â€Ã¥Â³Â°Ã¦ÂµÂÃ©â€¡ÂÃ¯Â¼Ë†PEFÃ¯Â¼â€°]Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¨â€šÂºÃ©â‚¬Å¡Ã¦Â°â€Ã¥Å Å¸Ã¨Æ’Â½Ã©Å¡Å“Ã§Â¢ÂÃ§Â¨â€¹Ã¥ÂºÂ¦Ã¥ÂÅ Ã¨â€šÂºÃ©Æ’Â¨Ã¥Â½Â±Ã¥Æ’ÂÃ¥Â­Â¦Ã¥ÂËœÃ¥Å’â€“Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã¯Â¼Å¡</b>Ã¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â¸Â¤Ã§Â»â€žÃ¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¥Å’Â»Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã¦â‚¬Â»Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¥ÂÅ Ã¥Ââ€žÃ©Â¡Â¹Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã£â‚¬ÂHAMAÃ¨Â¯â€žÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã£â‚¬ÂHAMDÃ¨Â¯â€žÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã¥Ââ€¡Ã¨Â¾Æ’Ã¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¥â€°ÂÃ©â„¢ÂÃ¤Â½Å½Ã¯Â¼Ë†<i>P</i>&lt;0.05Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¯Â¼â€ºÃ©â„¢Â¤Ã¥â€™Â½Ã¥Â¹Â²Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥Â¤Â§Ã¤Â¾Â¿Ã¥Â¹Â²Ã§Â»â€œÃ¨Â¯â€žÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã¥Â¤â€“Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¨Â§â€šÃ¥Â¯Å¸Ã§Â»â€žÃ¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¥Å’Â»Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã¦â‚¬Â»Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¥ÂÅ Ã¥Ââ€žÃ©Â¡Â¹Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã£â‚¬ÂHAMAÃ¨Â¯â€žÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã£â‚¬ÂHAMDÃ¨Â¯â€žÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã¥Ââ€¡Ã¤Â½Å½Ã¤ÂºÅ½Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã§â€¦Â§Ã§Â»â€žÃ¯Â¼Ë†<i>P</i>&lt;0.05Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â¸Â¤Ã§Â»â€žÃ¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦FVCÃ£â‚¬ÂFEV1Ã£â‚¬ÂPEFÃ¥Ââ€¡Ã¨Â¾Æ’Ã¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¥â€°ÂÃ¥Ââ€¡Ã©Â«ËœÃ¯Â¼Ë†<i>P</i>&lt;0.05Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â¸â€Ã¨Â§â€šÃ¥Â¯Å¸Ã§Â»â€žÃ©Â«ËœÃ¤ÂºÅ½Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã§â€¦Â§Ã§Â»â€žÃ¯Â¼Ë†<i>P</i>&lt;0.05Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¯Â¼â€ºÃ¤Â¸Â¤Ã§Â»â€žÃ¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¨â€šÂºÃ©â‚¬Å¡Ã¦Â°â€Ã¥Å Å¸Ã¨Æ’Â½Ã©Å¡Å“Ã§Â¢ÂÃ§Â¨â€¹Ã¥ÂºÂ¦Ã¥â€¡ÂÃ¨Â½Â»Ã¯Â¼Ë†<i>P</i>&lt;0.05Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â¸â€Ã¨Â§â€šÃ¥Â¯Å¸Ã§Â»â€žÃ¤Â¼ËœÃ¤ÂºÅ½Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã§â€¦Â§Ã§Â»â€žÃ¯Â¼Ë†<i>P</i>&lt;0.05Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â¸Â¤Ã§Â»â€žÃ¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¨â€šÂºÃ©Æ’Â¨Ã©ËœÂ´Ã¥Â½Â±Ã©ÂÂ¢Ã§Â§Â¯Ã¥Ââ€¡Ã§Â¼Â©Ã¥Â°ÂÃ¯Â¼Ë†<i>P</i>&lt;0.05Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â¸â€Ã¨Â§â€šÃ¥Â¯Å¸Ã§Â»â€žÃ¥Â°ÂÃ¤ÂºÅ½Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã§â€¦Â§Ã§Â»â€žÃ¯Â¼Ë†<i>P</i>&lt;0.05Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¨Â§â€šÃ¥Â¯Å¸Ã§Â»â€žÃ¥Â½Â±Ã¥Æ’ÂÃ¥Â­Â¦Ã¥ÂËœÃ¥Å’â€“Ã¦â€Â¹Ã¥â€“â€žÃ¤Â¼ËœÃ¤ÂºÅ½Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã§â€¦Â§Ã§Â»â€žÃ¯Â¼Ë†<i>P</i>&lt;0.05Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¨Â®ÂºÃ¯Â¼Å¡</b>Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ã¦Â â€¡Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã©â€¦ÂÃ§Â©Â´Ã¢â‚¬ÂÃ¦ÂÂ¿Ã©â€™Ë†Ã¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¨Æ’Â½Ã¦ËœÅ½Ã¦ËœÂ¾Ã¥â€¡ÂÃ¨Â½Â»Ã¦â€“Â°Ã¥Å¾â€¹Ã¥â€ Â Ã§Å Â¶Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦Â¯â€™Ã¨â€šÂºÃ§â€šÅ½Ã¦ÂÂ¢Ã¥Â¤ÂÃ¦Å“Å¸Ã¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã©Ââ€”Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã¥ÂÅ Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¦Å â€˜Ã©Æ’ÂÃ§Â²Â¾Ã§Â¥Å¾Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¦â€Â¹Ã¥â€“â€žÃ¨â€šÂºÃ©â‚¬Å¡Ã¦Â°â€Ã¥Å Å¸Ã¨Æ’Â½Ã£â‚¬â€š.","Luo, Wang, Zhang, Chen, Chen, Chen, Zhou, Gu, Li, Yan, Tian, Xu, Chen, Chen","https://doi.org/10.13703/j.0255-2930.20210406-0004","20220310","Biaoben acupoint compatibility; coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); recovery stage; sequela; thumb-tack needles","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28288,""
"Haitian and Haitian American experiences of racism and socioethnic discrimination in Miami-Dade county: At-risk and court-involved youth","We examine how juvenile justice-involved youth of Haitian descent in Miami-Dade County cope with structural racism and its impact on their mental health. Drawing on longitudinal ethnography, psychosocial assessment data, and a family-based clinical intervention funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, this article explores youth narratives of discrimination prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We use critical race theory and theory of practice to understand youths' perceptions as racialized bodies and stigmatized selves, highlighting the experiences and perspectives of a particular black immigrant group, ethnic beings caught up in the everyday practices of racialization, sociocultural marginalization, and racism. We frame these experiences as a variation of the complex continuum of structural racism and racial domination in the US. These experiences have caused anger, fear, anxiety, chronic anticipatory distress, and hopelessness among youth of Haitian descent. We conclude with some recommendations for therapeutic support that encourages youth to process their experiences, promotes their development of a positive self-concept, and provides them with mind-body techniques to attenuate the physical impacts of discriminatory events. The clinical trial registration number for this study intervention is NCT03876171.

"Trajectories and individual differences in pain, emotional distress, and prescription opioid misuse during the COVID-19 pandemic: A one-year longitudinal study","Recent studies suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic can serve as a unique psychosocial stressor that can negatively impact individuals with chronic pain. Using a large online sample in the U.S., the present study sought to investigate the impact of the pandemic on the trajectories of pain severity and interference, emotional distress (i.e., anxiety and depressive symptoms), and opioid misuse behaviors across one year. Potential moderating effects of socio-demographic factors and individual differences in pain catastrophizing, pain acceptance, and sleep disturbance on outcome trajectories were also examined. Adults with chronic pain were surveyed three times across one year (April/May 2020 [N=1,453]; June/July 2020 [N=878], and May 2021 [N=813]) via Amazon's Mechanical Turk online crowdsourcing platform. Mixed-effects growth models revealed that pain severity and interference, emotional distress, and opioid misuse behaviors did not significantly deteriorate across one year during the pandemic. None of the socio-demographic factors, pain catastrophizing, or sleep disturbance moderated outcome trajectories. However, individuals with higher pain acceptance reported greater improvement in pain severity (p&lt; .008, 95% CI: -.0002, -.00004) and depressive symptoms (p&lt; .001, 95% CI: -.001, -.0004) over time. Our findings suggest that the negative impact of the pandemic on pain, emotional distress, and opioid misuse behaviors is quite small overall. The outcome trajectories were also stable across different socio-demographic factors, as well as individual differences in pain catastrophizing and sleep disturbance. Nevertheless, interventions that target improvement of pain acceptance may help individuals with chronic pain be resilient during the pandemic.","Mun, Campbell, McGill, Wegener, Aaron","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpain.2022.02.005","20220310","COVID-19, chronic pain, depression; anxiety, pain acceptance, pain catastrophizing, sleep, opioid","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28290,""
"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health and Quality of Life An Exploratory Study During the First Outbreak in Italy","The coronavirus pandemic has been sweeping the world for more than a year. As physical health begins to stabilize in the western world, an increasing concern is related to the impact of the virus and its containment measures on people's mental health. This work aimed to explore the effect of demographic factors (age, gender, level of education, and socioeconomic status) and variables such as fear of COVID-19 and social support in predicting the quality of life and mental health of adults during the first wave of the pandemic in Italy. Through an online survey with 1087 Italian adults (M = 39.7, SD = 16.39; 74.4% women), gender and socioeconomic status emerged as crucial factors in determining differences regarding people's responses and reactions to the pandemic. In addition, the results highlighted the importance of perceived social support and a moderate fear of COVID-19 in predicting people's quality of life and mental health. The study suggests important guidelines for the development of interventions to support the population's well-being and mental health.","Cavazzoni, Pancake, Veronese","https://doi.org/10.1177/00332941211066259","20220310","anxiety; coping strategies; employment psychology and marketing; mental health; risk perception; social perceptions; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28291,""
"Psychological distress and burnout among healthcare worker during COVID-19 pandemic in India-A cross-sectional study","COVID-19 has inundated the entire world disrupting the lives of millions of people. The pandemic has stressed the healthcare system of India impacting the psychological status and functioning of health care workers. The aim of this study is to determine the burnout levels and factors associated with the risk of psychological distress among healthcare workers (HCW) engaged in the management of COVID 19 in India. A cross-sectional study was conducted from 1 September 2020 to 30 November 2020 by telephonic interviews using a web-based Google form. Health facilities and community centres from 12 cities located in 10 states were selected for data collection. Data on socio-demographic and occupation-related variables like age, sex, type of family, income, type of occupation, hours of work and income were obtained was obtained from 967 participants, including doctors, nurses, ambulance drivers, emergency response teams, lab personnel, and others directly involved in COVID 19 patient care. Levels of psychological distress was assessed by the General health Questionnaire -GHQ-5 and levels of burnout was assessed using the ICMR-NIOH Burnout questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with the risk of psychological distress. The third quartile values of the three subscales of burnout viz EE, DP and PA were used to identify burnout profiles of the healthcare workers. Overall, 52.9% of the participants had the risk of psychological distress that needed further evaluation. Risk of psychological distress was significantly associated with longer hours of work (Ã¢â€°Â¥ 8 hours a day) (AOR = 2.38, 95% CI(1.66-3.41), incomeÃ¢â€°Â¥20000(AOR = 1.74, 95% CI, (1.16-2.6); screening of COVID-19 patients (AOR = 1.63 95% CI (1.09-2.46), contact tracing (AOR = 2.05, 95% CI (1.1-3.81), High Emotional exhaustion score (EE Ã¢â€°Â¥16) (AOR = 4.41 95% CI (3.14-6.28) and High Depersonalisation score (DPÃ¢â€°Â¥7) (AOR = 1.79, 95% CI (1.28-2.51)). About 4.7% of the HCWs were overextended (EE&gt;18); 6.5% were disengaged (DP&gt;8) and 9.7% HCWs were showing signs of burnout (high on all three dimensions). The study has identified key factors that could have been likely triggers for psychological distress among healthcare workers who were engaged in management of COVID cases in India. The study also demonstrates the use of GHQ-5 and ICMR-NIOH Burnout questionnaire as important tools to identify persons at risk of psychological distress and occurrence of burnout symptoms respectively. The findings provide useful guide to planning interventions to mitigate mental health problems among HCW in future epidemic/pandemic scenarios in the country.","Menon, Yadav, Aggarwal, Singh, Kaur, Chakma, Periyasamy, Venkateswaran, Singh, Balachandar, Kulkarni, Grover, Mishra, Viray, Devi, Singh, Saha, Barde, Thomas, Suresh, A, Watson, Selvaraj, Xavier, John, Menon, Philip, Mathew, David, Vaman, Sushan, Singh, Jakhar, Ketharam, Prusty, Kishore, Venkatesh, Kumar, Kanungo, Sahoo, Swain, Lyngdoh, Diengdoh, Syiemlieh, Sarkar, Velhal, Kharnare, Nandanwar, Rao, Panda","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0264956","20220310","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28292,""
"Introduction to the PLOS ONE collection on 'Understanding and preventing suicide: Towards novel and inclusive approaches'","More than 700,000 people lose their lives to suicide each year and evidence suggests that the current COVID-19 pandemic is leading to increases in risk factors for suicide and suicide-related behaviour, in particular among young people. It is widely documented that some sectors of the population are over-represented in the suicide statistics. It is also well established that the pathways that lead someone to a suicidal crisis are complex and differ across regions and sectors of the population; as such a multi-faceted approach to prevention is required. Many of us would also argue that novel approaches, that combine broad population-based strategies with individual interventions, and approaches that capitalise on new technologies and methodologies are also required. For these reasons, when bringing together this collection, we deliberately sought studies that focused upon those groups who are over-represented in the suicide statistics yet under-represented in research. We also called for studies that reported on novel approaches to suicide prevention and for studies that reflected the voices of people with lived experience of suicide, also often unheard in research efforts.","Robinson, Kolves, Sisask","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0264984","20220310","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28293,""
"Tobacco Product Use and Associated Factors Among Middle and High School Students - National Youth Tobacco Survey, United States, 2021","Commercial tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable disease, disability, and death in the United States. Most tobacco product use begins during adolescence. In recent years, tobacco products have evolved to include various combusted, smokeless, and electronic products. 2021. The National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS) is an annual, cross-sectional, school-based, self-administered survey of U.S. middle school (grades 6-8) and high school (grades 9-12) students. A three-stage cluster sampling procedure is used to generate a nationally representative sample of U.S. students attending public and private schools. NYTS is the only nationally representative survey of U.S. middle and high school students that focuses exclusively on tobacco use patterns and associated factors. NYTS provides data to support the design, implementation, and evaluation of comprehensive youth tobacco use prevention and control programs and to guide tobacco regulatory activities. Since 2019, NYTS has been administered electronically via tablet computers. Because of emergency COVID-19 protocols that were in place across the United States during the 2021 NYTS fielding window (January 18-May 21, 2021), the 2021 survey was administered using a web URL to allow participation by eligible students learning under varying instructional models (in-person, distance/virtual, and hybrid). In total, 50.8% of student respondents reported completing the survey in a school building or classroom and 49.2% at home or some other place. CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) analyzed data from the 2021 NYTS to assess tobacco product use patterns and associated factors among U.S. middle and high school students. Overall, 20,413 students (out of 25,149 sampled students; student response rate: 81.2%) completed the questionnaire from 279 schools (out of 508 sampled schools; school response rate: 54.9%). The overall response rate, defined as the product of the student and school response rates, was 44.6%. The sample was weighted to represent approximately 11.97 million middle school students and 15.44 million high school students. Students with missing information about grade level were excluded from the school-level analyses (n = 135). In 2021, an estimated 34.0% of high school students (5.22 million) and 11.3% of middle school students (1.34 million) reported ever using a tobacco product (i.e., electronic cigarettes [e-cigarettes], cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco, hookahs, pipe tobacco, heated tobacco products, nicotine pouches, and bidis [small brown cigarettes wrapped in a leaf]). Current (past 30-day) use of a tobacco product was 13.4% for high school students (2.06 million) and 4.0% for middle school students (470,000). E-cigarettes were the most commonly currently used tobacco product, cited by 11.3% of high school students (1.72 million) and 2.8% of middle school students (320,000), followed by cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco, hookahs, nicotine pouches, heated tobacco products, and pipe tobacco. Current use of any tobacco product was reported by 14.2% of students identifying as lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) (versus 7.9% of heterosexual); 18.9% of students identifying as transgender (versus 8.2% of not transgender); and 14.2% of students reporting severe psychological distress (versus 5.5% with no distress). Among students who currently used each respective tobacco product, frequent use (on Ã¢â€°Â¥20 days of the past 30 days) ranged from 17.2% for nicotine pouches to 39.4% for e-cigarettes. Among current users of any tobacco product, 79.1% reported using a flavored tobacco product; by product, e-cigarettes were the most commonly used flavored tobacco product. Among current users of any tobacco product, the most commonly reported source of access was from a friend (32.8%). Among students who currently used e-cigarettes, 53.7% used a disposable device, 28.7% used a prefilled/refillable pod or cartridge device, 9.0% used a tank or mod system (a system that can be customized by the user), and 8.6% did not know the device type. Among students who had ever used e-cigarettes, the most common reason for first trying them was ""a friend used them"" (57.8%); among current e-cigarette users, the most commonly cited reason for current use was ""I am feeling anxious, stressed, or depressed"" (43.4%). Among all middle and high school students, 75.2% reported past-year recognition of any antitobacco public education campaign ads. Exposure to marketing or advertising for any tobacco product was reported by 75.7% of students who had contact with an assessed potential source of tobacco product advertisements or promotions (going to a convenience store, supermarket, or gas station; using the Internet; watching television or streaming services or going to the movies; or reading newspapers or magazines). Among students who reported using social media, 73.5% had ever seen e-cigarette-related content. Among all students, perceiving ""no"" or ""little"" harm from intermittent tobacco product use was highest for e-cigarettes (16.6%) and lowest for cigarettes (9.6%). Among students who currently used any tobacco product, 27.2% had experienced cravings during the past 30 days; 19.5% reported wanting to use a tobacco product within 30 minutes of waking. Moreover, 65.3% of students who currently used tobacco products were seriously thinking about quitting the use of all products, and 60.2% had stopped using all products for Ã¢â€°Â¥1 day because they were trying to quit during the past 12 months. In 2021, approximately one in 10 U.S. middle and high school students (9.3%) had used a tobacco product during the preceding 30 days. By school level, this represented more than one in eight high school students (13.4%) and approximately one in 25 middle school students (4.0%). E-cigarettes were the most commonly used tobacco product in 2021. Tobacco product use was higher among certain subpopulations, such as those identifying as LGB or transgender, or those reporting psychological distress. Importantly, approximately two thirds of students who currently used tobacco products were seriously thinking about quitting. However, factors that might continue to promote tobacco product use among U.S. youths, such as the availability of flavors, access to tobacco products, exposure to tobacco product marketing, and misperceptions about harm from tobacco product use, remained prevalent in 2021. The continued monitoring of all forms of youth tobacco product use and associated factors through surveillance efforts including NYTS is important to the development of public health policy and action at national, state, and local levels. The 2021 NYTS was successfully administered during the COVID-19 pandemic using a web URL to allow participation by eligible students learning under varying instructional models. As a result of these modifications to the fielding procedures, any comparison of results between 2021 NYTS findings with previous years, including the direct attribution of any potential changes in tobacco product use, is not possible. Parents, educators, youth advocates, and health care providers can help protect youths from the harms of tobacco products, including e-cigarettes. In addition, the comprehensive and sustained implementation of evidence-based tobacco control strategies, combined with FDA's regulation of tobacco products, is important for reducing all forms of tobacco product use among U.S. youths.","Gentzke, Wang, Cornelius, Park-Lee, Ren, Sawdey, Cullen, Loretan, Jamal, Homa","https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.ss7105a1","20220310","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28294,""
"Pandemic-Related Experiences and Stress Among Children's Hospital Staff Predict Psychosocial Risk","COVID-19 has imposed unique challenges for healthcare workers who have faced increased risk of exposure to the virus, heightened work demands, and disruptions in work-life balance. For some healthcare workers, these challenges may have contributed to increased stress, burnout, and psychosocial impairment, including symptoms of depression and anxiety. The current study addresses a knowledge gap of associations between pandemic-related experiences and psychosocial risk among medical and nonmedical pediatric healthcare staff. A sample of 369 staff (90% female) employed at an acute care, freestanding pediatric hospital in Connecticut completed an online survey. The survey assessed specific pandemic-related experiences and perceived impact with the Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory, and depression and anxiety risk with the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression screen and 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder screen, respectively. Enrollment and survey completion occurred over a 6-week period during the pandemic (summer 2020). High rates of adverse pandemic-related experiences included workplace experiences (e.g., inadequate support, interpersonal difficulties), home life (e.g., childcare difficulties, partner conflict), and experiences reflecting social isolation and quarantine, child and adult mental health difficulties, increased alcohol or substance use, and unhealthy lifestyle behaviors. Medical relative to nonmedical staff reported significantly more adverse and fewer positive experiences, and a significantly higher perceived negative impact of workplace experiences. A positive screen for depression or anxiety was significantly predicted by cumulative adverse workplace experiences (OR = 1.15), changes in emotional/physical health (OR = 1.35), and perceived negative impact of workplace experiences (OR = 1.32). The present study joins recent reports of increased adverse experiences and psychosocial outcomes among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings underscore the need for pediatric hospitals to innovate ways to reduce burden and connect staff to mental health services during similar public health crises. Such services might include (1) assisting healthcare staff to navigate disruptions in their home and social lives as a result of new challenges faced at work, (2) adapting the hospital environment and culture to mitigate stress experienced by staff because of these challenges, and (3) bolstering mental health screening and services to address exacerbated or emerging mental health symptoms, such as depression and anxiety.","Grasso, Lewin, Adams, Lapidus","https://doi.org/10.1097/JHM-D-21-00022","20220310","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28295,""
"[SOME ASPECTS OF THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON THE MENTAL STATE OF PEOPLE WITH THE HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS]","The purpose of this article is to study individual aspects of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental state of PLHIV. The study covered 146 patients with HIV-related diseases who attended the outpatient department of the communal enterprise ""Dnepropetrovsk Regional Center for Socially Significant Diseases of the Dnepropetrovsk Regional Council"" during September-October 2020. HIV-infected were interviewed using a self-developed questionnaire. We used integrative test of anxiety by A.P. Bizyuk to investigate anxiety. The frequency of increased anxiety over the past half year among respondents is 15.75%; frequency of insomnia, weight loss, eating disorders - 12.32%; In 10.42% (n=15) cases, PLHIV had episodes of acute feelings of fear, palpitations, shortness of breath, chest tightness, panic while watching news about COVID-19. A high level of average value of situational anxiety among PLHIV was revealed - 7.8 (1.3) stanins - M (SD), in the structure of which ""social defense reactions"", a phobic component and anxious assessment of prospects prevail. 74.6% of HIV-infected strictly adhered to additional protection against COVID-19; 63.01% - considered crowded places a threat to their health; 52.74% were afraid to get sick with COVID-19; 49.31% - had an increased interest of PLHIV in COVID-19 in Ukraine and the world. The respondents used the following additional methods of protection: self-isolation (60%), strict adherence to distance (75%), disinfection of their belongings and household items (10%). The mental state of PLHIV during the coronavirus pandemic indicates the presence of symptoms of distress: the manifestations of anxiety-depressive disorders, insomnia have increased, a fixation has appeared on their physical condition, social isolation and distancing have increased. Further research into the characteristics of the psychoemotional state of PLHIV will help improve the organization of medical and social assistance in the current situation of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ogorenko, Kyrychenko, Kornatsky, Gnenna, Tomakh","https://www.google.com/search?q=[SOME+ASPECTS+OF+THE+IMPACT+OF+THE+COVID-19+PANDEMIC+ON+THE+MENTAL+STATE+OF+PEOPLE+WITH+THE+HUMAN+IMMUNODEFICIENCY+VIRUS].","20220310","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28296,""

"The Biggest Challenges Resulting from the COVID-19 Pandemic on Gender-Related Work from Home in Biomedical Fields-World-Wide Qualitative Survey Analysis","(1) Background: This paper aims to present and discuss the most significant challenges encountered by STEM professionals associated with remote working during the COVID-19 lockdowns. (2) Methods: We performed a qualitative analysis of 921 responses from professionals from 76 countries to the open-ended question: ""What has been most challenging during the lockdown for you, and/or your family?"" (3) Findings: Participants reported challenges within the immediate family to include responsibilities for school, childcare, and children's wellbeing; and the loss of social interactions with family and friends. Participants reported increased domestic duties, blurred lines between home and work, and long workdays. Finding adequate workspace was a problem, and adaptations were necessary, especially when adults shared the same setting for working and childcare. Connectivity issues and concentration difficulties emerged. While some participants reported employers' expectations did not change, others revealed concerns about efficiency. Mental health issues were expressed as anxiety and depression symptoms, exhaustion and burnout, and no outlets for stress. Fear of becoming infected with COVID-19 and uncertainties about the future also emerged. Pressure points related to gender, relationship status, and ethnicities were also evaluated. Public policies differed substantially across countries, raising concerns about the adherence to unnecessary restrictions, and similarly, restrictions being not tight enough. Beyond challenges, some benefits emerged, such as increased productivity and less time spent getting ready for work and commuting. Confinement resulted in more quality time and stronger relationships with family. (4) Interpretation: Viewpoints on positive and negative aspects of remote working differed by gender. Females were more affected professionally, socially, and personally than males. Mental stress and the feeling of inadequate work efficiency in women were caused by employers' expectations and lack of flexibility. Working from home turned out to be challenging, primarily due to a lack of preparedness, limited access to a dedicated home-office, and lack of previous experience in multi-layer/multi-scale environments.","Bezak, Carson-Chahhoud, Marcu, Stoeva, Lhotska, Barabino, Ibrahim, Kaldoudi, Lim, Marques da Silva, Tan, Tsapaki, Frize","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19053109","20220310","COVID-19 impact; biomedical fields; gender; qualitative international survey analysis; working from home","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28298,""
"Prevalence and Risk Factors of Poor Sleep Quality in Collegiate Athletes during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has changed our lifestyle, sleep and physical activity habits. This study evaluated the prevalence of poor sleep quality, its disrupters, and the impact of the pandemic in collegiate athletes. We performed a cross-sectional study of collegiate athletes (N = 339, median age: 20 (IQR,19-21) years old, 48.5% female, 47% individual sports) who received a web-based questionnaire in April 2021. This survey included subject characteristics, chronotype, sleep disrupters, the changes due to the pandemic and sleep quality (Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]). A multivariate linear regression was performed to assess the relationship between sleep quality, gender, chronotype, sleep disrupters and the changes to training volume or sleep. Results showed a disrupted sleep quality in 63.7%. One in five students had a total sleep time under 6.5 h per night. Poor sleep quality was significantly correlated with nocturnal concerns related to the pandemic, evening chronotype, female gender, third year of study, caffeine consumption and lack of sleep routine (all <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05). To conclude, poor sleep quality is common in collegiate athletes. Sleep disrupters remain prevalent in the lifestyle habits of this population and may have been exacerbated by changes related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

"The Workplace and Psychosocial Experiences of Australian Senior Doctors during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Study","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had significant mental health impacts among healthcare workers (HCWs), related to resource scarcity, risky work environments, and poor supports. Understanding the unique challenges experienced by senior doctors and identifying strategies for support will assist doctors facing such crises into the future. A cross-sectional, national, online survey was conducted during the second wave of the Australian COVID-19 pandemic. Inductive content analysis was used to examine data reporting workplace and psychosocial impacts of the pandemic. Of 9518 responses, 1083 senior doctors responded to one or more free-text questions. Of the senior doctors, 752 were women and 973 resided in Victoria. Four themes were identified: (1) work-life challenges; (2) poor workplace safety, support, and culture; (3) poor political leadership, planning and support; and (4) media and community responses. Key issues impacting mental health included supporting staff wellbeing, moral injury related to poorer quality patient care, feeling unheard and undervalued within the workplace, and pandemic ill-preparedness. Senior doctors desired better crisis preparedness, HCW representation, greater leadership, and accessible, authentic psychological wellbeing support services from workplace organisations and government. The pandemic has had significant impacts on senior doctors.

"Changing Social Mentality among University Students in the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Five-Wave Longitudinal Study in China","(1) Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant shifts in university students' lives, which could be displayed by social mentality, a psychosocial conception at the individual and social levels. This five-wave longitudinal study aims to evaluate the changing social mentality of university students during the peak and preventive-order phases of the pandemic in China and investigate the trends and differences in social-demographic variables. (2) Methods: The Bi-Dimensional Structure Questionnaire of Social Mentality (B-DSMQ) was used to collect data from March 2020 to January 2021. Five-wave surveys were administered to 1319 students from five universities using online questionnaires. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the changes in social mentality over time and covariate groups. Linear mixed models were used to explore the associations of overall social mentality with time and covariates. Post hoc analysis was implemented within subgroups, including university, major, grade, parenting style, and the harmonious degree of parents. (3) Results: Students' social mentality changed significantly from Waves 1 to 5 (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). It fell to its lowest in the third survey, increased in the fourth survey, and peaked in the fifth survey. In all of the subgroups, the changing social mentality differed significantly over time (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). The <i>p</i>-values between groups suggested that changing social mentality was significantly different regarding gender, residence, university, major, grade, student cadre, graduates, nuclear family, economic status, parenting styles, and the harmonious degree of parents' relationship (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). (4) Conclusions: Social mentality among university students decreased during the peak of the pandemic before increasing in the contained-risk period. It was the lowest in June when students began to return to the pandemic-preventive campus from quarantined homes. Students living in provinces (except for Shandong) who were from high-level universities in 2016 and 2017 and who majored in medicine displayed a more negative social mentality. Students who were female, student cadres, non-graduates, and enjoying high socioeconomic status displayed a more positive social mentality. Further research is needed on the relationship between mental health and social mentality, specifically the associates and interventions for positive social mentality.","Zhao, Yan, Fan, Zhang, Oguz, Wang, Xi","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19053049","20220310","longitudinal study; mental health; pandemic; social mentality; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28301,""
"Work-Related Stress of Work from Home with Housemates Based on Residential Types","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on work environments. Many workers have been requested or instructed to work from home (WFH). This study aimed to clarify the work-related stress of WFH regarding housemates based on residential types during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a web-based questionnaire survey of 500 workers living with housemates in Osaka Prefecture. The WFH environments were analyzed on the basis of high-stress workers (HSWs), which accounted for 17.4% of all subjects, according to three major types of residences in Japan. The main finding is that HSWs with housemates had problems related to noise regardless of the type of residence. This study of workers living with housemates in an urban area contrasts with the findings of preceding study, which found that satisfaction with noise in the environment was higher at home than in the office. HSWs in detached houses and condominium apartments had problems with the levels of noise created by their housemates. The residents living in these types of residences were found to be relatively older, thus potentially having older children who would require a certain level of privacy. WFH workers with insufficient privacy were unable to adapt to WFH environments and suffered from high stress.","Natomi, Kato, Matsushita","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19053060","20220310","COVID-19; built environment; housemate; mental health; noise; privacy; remote work; telework; the Brief Job Stress Questionnaire (BJSQ); workÃ¢â‚¬â€œlife boundary","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28302,""
"Impacts of Emergency Remote Teaching on College Students Amid COVID-19 in the UAE","With the aim of appraising the impact of Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT) amidst the COVID-19 pandemic on college students, an online survey was conducted in December 2020 on a total of 588 undergraduate students at the American University of Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates. The purpose of the study was to probe into the perceptions of college students regarding their learning process and its influence on their mental health with the abrupt transition from face-to-face classes to ERT in the Spring 2020 semester. A comprehensive analysis was performed using structural equation modeling and other statistical techniques to reveal crucial results associated with the factors that have an effect on the students' psychological distress, such as quality of courses, academic performance, and readiness for future work or studies. Findings suggest that the students' perceived quality of courses under ERT has a significant impact on their academic performance and readiness for future work or studies. Moreover, they indicate that these factors serve as a vital mediating role in provoking psychological distress among the students. The study also shows that gender, previous history of anxiety/distress, education being at risk due to financial issues caused by COVID-19, and year of study significantly affect the students' distress levels.

"The Impact of Online Learning on Physical and Mental Health in University Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Higher education organizations have been influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. During school closures, online teaching and learning has become a new routine that may lead to changes in lifestyles and adversely affect university students' health. Therefore, this study was to understand the potential impact of online learning on physical and mental health by investigating the differences in physical activity, psychological distress, and student life stress in Taiwanese university students between the in-class learning and online learning periods. A total of 181 students were recruited from a local university. All participants were requested to complete an online survey and self-report physical activity, psychological distress, and life stress in the in-class learning and online learning periods, respectively. The results indicated a significant reduction in physical activity of various intensities (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05). Specifically, male university students showed a greater decrease in vigorous physical activity compared to their female peers. Yet, there was no significant increase in psychological distress and life stress from the in-class learning period to the online learning period. In summary, physical activity drastically reduces during the online learning period in Taiwanese university students. Notably, male students may be at greater risk of insufficient participation in vigorous physical activity.","Chu, Li","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19052966","20220310","COVID-19; emerging adults; learning; physical activity; psychological distress; student life stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28304,""
"Impact on Sleep Quality, Mood, Anxiety, and Personal Satisfaction of Doctors Assigned to COVID-19 Units","The SARS-CoV-2 health emergency has led to a restructuring of health care systems and the reassignment of medical specialists from their usual duties to attend COVID-19 patients. The aim of this paper is to describe the levels of insomnia, anxiety, depression, and the impact on quality of life of doctors who were on the frontline of COVID-19 during the first two waves of the pandemic. Self-report surveys were conducted on said physicians during both waves, with 83 and 61 responses in the first and second waves, respectively. The reported presence of insomnia was frequent (71.8%), although it decreased in the second survey. Anxiety was moderate, decreasing from 57.1% to 43.1% between measurements. Overall, depression rates decreased between the two surveys. Substance use was found to have an indirect correlation with personal and professional satisfaction. In the light of the unforeseeable evolution of the pandemic and the medium- to long-term repercussions on professionals, we believe the adaptation of health resources is crucial to meet the new unpredictable mental health needs of this group.","AndrÃƒÂ©s-Olivera, GarcÃƒÂ­a-Aparicio, Lozano LÃƒÂ³pez, Benito SÃƒÂ¡nchez, MartÃƒÂ­n, MaciÃƒÂ¡-Casas, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-SÃƒÂ¡nchez, Marcos, Roncero","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19052712","20220310","COVID-19 pandemic; doctors; mental health impact","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28305,""
"Emotional Situation of Children and Adolescents during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Germany: Results from the COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring Study (COSMO)","The COVID-19 pandemic led to numerous restrictions in daily life that had a significant impact on the well-being and mental health of the population. Among others, children and adolescents were particularly affected, being a vulnerable group at risk. The aim of this study was to assess the emotional situation of children and adolescents during different phases of the pandemic and to identify modifying factors. Data from the serial cross-sectional COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring (COSMO) survey in Germany were used for this study. The survey waves 12 (19th/20th May 2020) and 21 (15th/16th September 2020) were investigated as examples of two different pandemic phases. The psychosocial and emotional situation and well-being of children were measured with the emotional subscale of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) assessed by parents. Descriptive analyses and logistic regressions were calculated. In total, a third of the participating parents in wave 12 and in wave 21 reported having children and adolescents with emotional symptoms. Especially children with younger parents seemed to be more affected by emotional symptoms. Sociodemographic aspects, such as household language, showed a significant association with reported emotional symptoms in children (Wave 12: OR = 2.22; 95% CI: 1.20-4.09). Reported prevalences of emotional symptoms in children did not differ between the pandemic phases. In conclusion, the pandemic had negative influences on the emotional symptoms of children and adolescents in COVID-19 pandemic waves in 2020, indicating a forecasted reoccurrence and need for preventive measures for upcoming waves and other pandemics in the future.","Rathgeb, Schillok, Voss, Coenen, Schulte-KÃƒÂ¶rne, Merkel, Eitze, Jung-Sievers, On Behalf Of The Cosmo Study Team","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19052698","20220310","COVID-19; SDQ; children and adolescents; emotional situation; mental health; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28306,""
"Signifying the Relationship between Fear of COVID-19, Psychological Concerns, Financial Concerns and Healthcare Employees Job Performance: A Mediated Model","The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has undoubtedly created immense health problems in the global healthcare sector. Apart from its impact on physical health, it has devastatingly affected the psychological well-being of individuals. Based on Affective Events Theory (AET), the current study aims to contemplate the relationship between Fear of COVID-19 (CVF), psychological concerns (PC), and financial concerns (FC) while considering the impact on the healthcare employees' job performance (JP). Moreover, this study investigates the mediating role of job anxiety (ANX), stress (ST), and depression (DEP). The data were collected through an online structured questionnaire (Google Forms) from 489 employees working in the healthcare centers of Pakistan. The structured equation modeling (partial least square) approach is adopted for data analysis. The study results showed that Fear of COVID-19, psychological and financial concerns positively and significantly affect healthcare workers' job performance. Depression, anxiety, and stress mediated the relationship between Fear of COVID-19, psychological concerns, financial concerns, and job performance.

"Preschool Teachers' Psychological Distress and Work Engagement during COVID-19 Outbreak: The Protective Role of Mindfulness and Emotion Regulation","COVID-19 has dramatically affected the mental health and work environment of the educational sector. Our primary aim was to investigate preschool teachers' psychological distress and work engagement during the COVID-19 outbreak, while examining the possible protective role of participating in a mindfulness-based intervention geared to foster compassion (Call2Care-Israel for Teachers; C2C-IT) and emotion regulation. The prevalence of emotional distress, work engagement, and COVID-19 concerns were evaluated in 165 preschool teachers in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak in Israel through questionnaires. The findings showed that preschool teachers experienced increased emotional distress. Teachers who had participated in the C2C-IT intervention six months before the pandemic outbreak (N = 41) reported lower emotional distress, higher use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies, and higher work engagement, compared to their counterparts that had not participated in the intervention (N = 124). Emotion regulation strategies mediated the link between participating in CTC-IT intervention and emotional distress and work engagement. Teaching is a highly demanding occupation, especially during a pandemic, thus making it important to invest resources in empowering this population. The findings here suggest that the implementation of a mindfulness-based intervention during the school year can enhance teachers' well-being, even during stressful events such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Keleynikov, Benatov, Berger","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19052645","20220310","COVID-19; emotion regulation; emotional distress; mindfulness; teachers; work engagement","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28308,""
"Risk Perception among Psychiatric Patients during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The fear of the new coronavirus infection has driven many non-COVID-19 patients away from essential healthcare. Our study aimed to investigate the perception of risk and feelings of danger for the contagion in a sample of Italian psychiatric patients. We conducted a cross-sectional observational study during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown in Italy. The risk perception and risk-related variables were assessed in a sample of 150 consecutive patients with a previous diagnosis of major depression (50), bipolar I disorder (50), and schizophrenia seeking ambulatory care using a questionnaire previously administered to the general Italian population. Our results showed that patients were more concerned about economic, psychological, and interpersonal consequences of COVID-19 pandemic, rather than about their own health. At the multiple regression analysis, the likelihood of COVID-19 resolution was positively influenced by the diagnosis of schizophrenia, the increased perceived effectiveness, and the presence of positive emotions. Indeed, positive emotions and uncertainty positively influenced interpersonal risk. Our study highlights the need to provide more support to psychiatric patients during emergency events to prevent them from engaging in risky behaviors.","Natale, Concerto, Rodolico, Birgillito, Bonelli, Martinez, Signorelli, Petralia, Infortuna, Battaglia, Aguglia","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19052620","20220310","COVID-19 pandemic; psychiatric patients; risk perception","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28309,""
"Changes in Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Swedish Population Study","Governments have enforced measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 with varying degrees of success, which could affect people's physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior. This study aimed to examine changes in PA levels, types of PA, and sedentary behavior in the Swedish population before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Associations between changed PA levels and demographical and behavioral determinants were also investigated. In December 2020, 1035 individuals (18-79 years old) completed a survey about their PA and sedentary behavior before and during the pandemic. Factors influencing their PA were also explored. Fifty-one percent of the sample reported reduced total PA, 18% had no change, and 31% increased their PA. Overall, organized PA decreased the most and sedentary behavior increased. The youngest and oldest age groups reported the greatest reduction in PA, while middle-aged groups reported the most increased PA. Men reported a larger increase in sedentary behavior than women. Mental and physical capability was associated with change in PA. In conclusion, this study indicates that, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of the Swedish population have decreased PA levels with a concurrent increase in sedentary behavior, which may have negative health consequences. Interventions are recommended to address both PA and sedentary behavior, specifically to strengthen people's ability to perform PA and focusing on the youngest and oldest age groups.","ElvÃƒÂ©n, Kerstis, Stier, HellstrÃƒÂ¶m, von Heideken WÃƒÂ¥gert, Dahlen, Lindberg","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19052558","20220310","COVID-19; behavior change; physical activity; sedentary behavior","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28310,""
"<i>Adolescer</i> in Time of COVID-19's Pandemic: Rationale and Construction Process of a Digital Intervention to Promote Adolescents' Positive Development","The coronavirus pandemic has severely impacted children's and adolescents' lives due to policies and regulations implemented to slow the virus from spreading, which led to a loss of routine, structure, academic support, and social contacts. Literature also reports a lack of outdoor activity, inappropriate diet, and disruption of sleeping habits as affecting children's and adolescents' lifestyles and well-being. Remarkably, these consequent psychological, behavioral, and emotional changes can compromise their self-esteem, sense of self-efficacy, and self-concept, affecting their immune systems. These maladaptive coping strategies and associated effects may emerge as a failure to access some of the sources of support that might help them cope. Facing this crisis, we aimed at promoting well-being, growth, and the positive development of Portuguese adolescents through an intervention focused on positive coping strategies. We developed ""<i>Adolescer</i> in time of COVID-19-A good practices Guide for adolescents in social distancing"" as a digital document to be quickly disseminated online, answering the emergent needs of Portuguese youth between 13 and 18 years old during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Oncofertility and COVID-19: At the Crossroads between Two Time-Sensitive Fields","COVID-19 infection has dominated our lives and left its mark on it. The impact on fertility is major, and the long-term consequences may be disastrous. When we talk about oncofertility, we are talking about those patients worried about the delay in receiving medical services (possible cancelation of surgery, decreased availability of medical services, reorientation of medical resources) due to COVID-19. Finally, patients' worsening biological and reproductive statuses, associated with high levels of anxiety and depression, are closely related to social restrictions, economic impact, reorientation of medical resources, health policies, and fears of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We reviewed the current literature on fertility during the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on cancer patients. Specifically, how cancer treatment can affect fertility, the options to maintain fertility potential, and the recovery options available after treatment are increasingly common concerns among cancer patients. A systematic literature search was conducted using two main central databases (PubMed<sup>Ã‚Â®</sup>/MEDLINE, and Web of Science) to identify relevant studies using keywords SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, oncofertility, young cancer patient, cryopreservation, assisted reproductive techniques (ART), psychosocial, telemedicine. In the present study, 45 papers were included, centered on the six main topics related to COVID-19. Fertility preservation (FP) should not be discontinued, but instead practiced with adjustments to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients requires screening for COVID-19 before FP procedures, among both patients and medical staff in FP clinics, to prevent infection that would rapidly worsen the condition and lead to severe complications.","Varlas, BorÃˆâ„¢, Pop, NÃ„Æ’sui, Bacalbasa, BohÃƒÂ®lÃˆâ€ºea, VlÃ„Æ’dÃ„Æ’reanu, Manolea","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11051221","20220310","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; assisted reproductive techniques; cryopreservation; oncofertility; psychosocial; telemedicine; young cancer patient","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28312,""
"What has changed in the experiences of people with mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic: a coproduced, qualitative interview study","We sought to understand how the experiences of people in the UK with pre-existing mental health conditions had developed during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. In September-October 2020, we interviewed adults with mental health conditions pre-dating the pandemic, whom we had previously interviewed 3 months earlier. Participants had been recruited through online advertising and voluntary sector community organisations. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted by telephone or video-conference by researchers with lived experience of mental health difficulties, and, following principles of thematic analysis, were analysed to explore changes over time in people's experience of the pandemic. We interviewed 44 people, achieving diversity of demographic characteristics (73% female, 54% White British, aged 18-75) and a range of mental health conditions and service use among our sample. Three overarching themes were derived from interviews. The first theme ""spectrum of adaptation"" describes how participants reacted to reduced access to formal and informal support through personal coping responses or seeking new sources of help, with varying degrees of success. The second theme describes ""accumulating pressures"" from pandemic-related anxieties and sustained disruption to social contact and support, and to mental health treatment. The third theme ""feeling overlooked"" reflects participants' feeling of people with mental health conditions being ignored during the pandemic by policy-makers at all levels, which was compounded for people from ethnic minority communities or with physical health problems. In line with previous research, our study highlights the need to support marginalised groups who are at risk of increased inequalities, and to maintain crucial mental and physical healthcare and social care for people with existing mental health conditions, notwithstanding challenges of the pandemic.","Shah, Hardy, Birken, Foye, Rowan Olive, Nyikavaranda, Dare, Stefanidou, Schlief, Pearce, Lyons, Machin, Jeynes, Chipp, Chhapia, Barber, Gillard, Pitman, Simpson, Johnson, Lloyd-Evans","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-022-02254-6","20220310","COVID-19; Mental health; Pandemic; Qualitative","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28313,""
"Affect and alcohol consumption: An ecological momentary assessment study during national lockdown","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-related lockdown provided an opportunity to examine the relationship between affect and alcohol consumption in a historically unique context. To shed light on mixed findings regarding the interplay between affective states and alcohol consumption, the present study examined how affective states and affect fluctuations impact drinking during confinement of people to their homes. It also examined the extent to which the social context moderated the affect-consumption relationship. Having preregistered study protocols, methods, and hypotheses, 87 U.K. participants (34% male, <i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 29.33) used their smartphones to respond to thrice daily prompts, recording their affective states, alcohol consumption, and social context over 1 week. Multilevel modeling suggested that being with someone (vs. alone) was associated with increased alcohol consumption. Increased drinking on the previous day was associated with increased next day negative affect, and the number of household occupants was associated with decreased negative affect. Preconsumption affect was not associated with subsequent drinking. These findings point to a complex relationship between alcohol consumption, social context, and negative affect. The opportunity to interact with others during lockdown was generally associated with decreased negative affect in the moment. However, the presence of others was associated with increased consumption which, in turn, predicted elevated next-day negative affect.

"Post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety symptoms in COVID-19 outpatients with different levels of respiratory and ventilatory support in the acute phase undergoing three months follow up","The well-known COVID-19 pandemic totally transformed people's lives, paving the way to various psychopathological symptoms. In particular, patients may experience a short- and long-term decreasing in their wellbeing. In this vein, the aim of this paper is to assess the COVID-19 patients' psychopathological profile (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, distress, anxiety and depression symptoms), detecting possible differences linked to the ventilatory treatments. Outpatients who recovered from COVID-19 were asked to provide socio-demographic and clinical information, and to complete a brief psychological screening evaluation (Impact of Event Scale-Revised - IES-R, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale - DASS-21). Overall, after informed consent, 163 Italian patients took part in this research. Of them, 31,9% did not undergo any ventilatory therapy, 27,6% undertook oxygen therapy; 28,2% underwent noninvasive mechanical ventilation and 12.3% received invasive mechanical ventilation. Although no statistically significant differences were revealed among patients stratified by spontaneous breathing or ventilatory therapies, they reported statistically significant more depression (4.5+5.2 vs 3.5+3.2; p=.017) and anxiety (4.3+4.5 vs 2.4+2.6; p&lt;.00001) symptoms than normative groups. Moreover, patients experiencing COVID-19 disease as a trauma, complained statistically significant higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms than who did not describe a clinically relevant traumatic experience (p&lt;0.001). Thus, this study suggests to healthcare professionals to consider COVID-19 experience as a potential real trauma for patients and underlines the necessity to define patients' psychopathological profile in order to propose tailored and effective preventive and supportive psychological interventions.","Ferraris, Maffoni, DE Marzo, Pierobon, Sommaruga, Barbara, Porcile, Russo, Ghio, Clavario, Porto","https://doi.org/10.23736/S0026-4806.22.07847-8","20220310","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28315,""
"Growth in emergency department self-harm or suicidal ideation presentations in young people: Comparing trends before and since the COVID-19 first wave in New South Wales, Australia","Self-harm presentations in children and young people have increased internationally over the last decade. The COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to worsen these trends. To describe trends in emergency department self-harm or suicidal ideation presentations for children and young people in New South Wales before and since the COVID-19 pandemic. We studied presentations for self-harm or suicidal ideation by 10- to 24-year-olds to New South Wales emergency departments, using interrupted time series analysis to compare annualised growth before COVID (2015 to February 2020) and since COVID (March 2020 to June 2021). Subgroup analyses compared age group, gender, triage category, rurality and disadvantage. Time series decomposition via generalised additive models identified long-term, seasonal and short-term trends. Self-harm or suicidal ideation presentations by young people in New South Wales increased by 8.4% per annum pre-COVID. Growth accelerated since COVID, to 19.2% per annum, primarily due to increased presentations by females aged 13-17Ã¢â‚¬â€°years (47.1% per annum since COVID, from 290 per 10,000 in 2019 to 466 per 10,000 in 2021). Presentations in males aged 10-24Ã¢â‚¬â€°years did not increase since COVID (105.4 per 10,000 in 2019, 109.8 per 10,000 in 2021) despite growing 9.9% per annum before COVID. Presentation rates accelerated significantly in socio-economically advantaged areas. Presentations in children and adolescents were strongly linked to school semesters. Emergency department self-harm or suicidal ideation presentations by New South Wales young people grew steadily before COVID. Understanding the sustained increase remains a priority. Growth has increased since COVID particularly for adolescent females, but not among adolescent males. Surprisingly, the largest post-COVID increases in annual growth occurred in socio-economically advantaged and urban regions. The COVID-19 pandemic appears to have added new challenges, particularly in females in the developmentally critical early adolescent and teenage years.","Sara, Wu, Uesi, Jong, Perkes, Knight, O'Leary, Trudgett, Bowden","https://doi.org/10.1177/00048674221082518","20220310","COVID; Self-harm; emergency department; suicide; young people","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28316,""
"Distress, loneliness, and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: Test of the extension of the Evolutionary Theory of Loneliness","COVID-19 restrictions such as lockdowns or quarantines may increase the risk for social isolation and perceived loneliness. The mechanisms can be modeled by Cacioppo's Evolutionary Theory of Loneliness (ETL), which predicts that a lack of perceived social connectedness may lead, in the long-term, to mental and physical health consequences. However, the association between COVID-19 pandemic distress, mental health, and loneliness is not sufficiently understood. The present longitudinal study examined the relationship between distress and depression, and the mediating effects of anxiety and loneliness in a German rehabilitation sample (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°403) at two timepoints (Ã¢â€°Â¤6Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks pre-rehabilitation; Ã¢â€°Â¥12Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks post-rehabilitation; mean time between T1 and T2 wasÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°52Ã¢â‚¬â€°days). Change scores between T1 and T2 were examined for the variables COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI), anxiety, loneliness, and depression. The results of the serial mediation analysis indicated that anxiety and loneliness were able to explain the relationship between distress and depression with 42% of variance in depression accounted for. Findings extend research on the relationship between COVID-19 and mental health by considering anxiety and loneliness as sustaining factors of depressive symptoms, thus, successfully applying the ETL. Results stress the necessity to consider anxiety and loneliness in the treatment or prevention of depression.","Keller, Derksen, KÃƒÂ¶tting, Dahmen, Lippke","https://doi.org/10.1111/aphw.12352","20220310","anxiety; depressive symptoms; psychosomatic rehabilitation patients; serial mediation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28317,""
"Living through lockdown: A qualitative exploration of individuals' experiences in the UK","In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the British government introduced a lockdown resulting in country wide restrictions on movement and socialisation. This research sought to explore individuals' experience of the first lockdown in the UK. A qualitative online survey was conducted between April and June 2020. Using a convenience sample, 29 individuals participated in the study. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Four themes were identified: 'health and well-being', 'social connectedness and belonging', 'employment and finances' and 'personal and collective values'. Participants' experiences involved both challenges and opportunities. Participants reported challenges to their physical health, mental health, sense of connection to others as well as their employment and finances. However, they also viewed the lockdown as an opportunity to reassess their goals and values, and define a 'new normal' for society. Lockdown restrictions threatened individuals' well-being on many aspects of their lives. As anxiety, loneliness and a compromised grieving process may lead to severe mental health issues, early interventions are needed to prevent these and promote well-being. Interventions may include traditional therapies (e.g. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy), or focus specifically on developing social networks and social support (e.g. mutual help groups). These interventions may also be conducive to the experience of growth reported by some participants.","Taylor, Lafarge, Cahill, Milani, GÃƒÂ¶rzig","https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.13772","20220310","COVID-19; anxiety; lockdown; loneliness; psychosocial experiences; qualitative research; thematic analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28318,""
"Evaluating Pediatric Families' Understanding of and Reactions to COVID-19 Visitor Restrictions","The COVID-19 pandemic led to changes in hospital visitor policies and little is known about the impact on patients and their families. This study evaluated families' understanding of and reactions to COVID-19-related visitor restriction policy at an academic children's hospital.

Parents (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°73) completed a survey assessing communication, understanding of and satisfaction with visitor policies, strategies of coping with illness, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) scores. Descriptive analyses were performed to summarize data. Associations between outcomes and participant characteristics were examined. A majority (88%) of respondents reported hospital visitor restrictions were explained, usually in-person (94%), and understood the policy ""very well"" (68%), but none correctly identified all reasons for visitation restrictions. Eighty-five percent reported other family/friends would have visited, however minority families were more likely to report they would have had fewer visitors if restrictions were not in place (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0385). A majority (69%) were satisfied with how the hospital handled visitor polices, and parents of older children were more satisfied (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.0001). HADS scores were consistent with anxiety or depression in about half of respondents. Forty percent of respondents believed restrictions affected their own and their child's ability to cope during hospitalization. Parents expressed satisfaction with and understanding of visitor policies but did not understand the rationale for visitor restrictions. Visitor restrictions may impact parental and child coping and mental health outcomes.","Hyczko, Fu, Graf, Perkowski, Whyte-Nesfield, Zhou, Zurca","https://doi.org/10.1177/23743735221077547","20220310","COVID-19; communication; patient perspectives/narratives; patient satisfaction; pediatrics; visitor restrictions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28319,""
"Self-help cognitive behavioural therapy for anxiety in pulmonary hypertension: pilot randomised controlled trial","People with pulmonary hypertension (PH) are at an increased risk of experiencing anxiety disorders. This study developed and tested the acceptability, feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a cognitive behavioural self-help intervention for anxiety in adults with PH using a pilot randomised control trial design. Individuals with PH recruited from pulmonary hypertension associations were randomised to either receive a newly developed self-help intervention (n=37) or a wait-list condition (n=40). Acceptability was explored using mixed-methods questionnaires. A 2Ãƒâ€”3 repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to explore anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), health-related quality of life (emPHAsis-10), dyspnoea (D-12), self-mastery (Self-Mastery Scale) and mood-related cognitions and behaviours (CBP-Q) at baseline, post-intervention and 1-month follow up. A mediation analysis was performed to examine potential mechanisms of change. Dropout was low at 15.6%. All participants would recommend the intervention to another person with PH and felt it had helped with their anxiety. Participants in the intervention group reported a reduction in anxiety, depression and cognitive and behavioural processes linked with mood disorders, compared to the control group. Change in unhelpful cognitions and behaviours mediated the relationship between intervention condition and change in anxiety and depression. The intervention was found to be acceptable, feasible and safe. Anxiety at baseline was higher than previously observed, which could be associated with the additional burden caused by COVID-19 as the intervention was trialled during the pandemic. Findings add to the growing evidence supporting the use of psychological therapies, including cognitive behavioural therapy, in this clinical group.","Rawlings, Beail, Armstrong, Thompson","https://doi.org/10.1183/23120541.00526-2021","20220310","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28320,""
"Paediatric pneumonia research priorities in the context of COVID-19: An eDelphi study","Pneumonia remains the leading cause of infectious deaths in children under-five globally. We update the research priorities for childhood pneumonia in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and explore whether previous priorities have been addressed. We conducted an eDelphi study from November 2019 to June 2021. Experts were invited to take part, targeting balance by: gender, profession, and high (HIC) and low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). We followed a three-stage approach: 1. Collating questions, using a list published in 2011 and adding newly posed topics; 2. Narrowing down, through participant scoring on importance and whether they had been answered; 3. Ranking of retained topics. Topics were categorized into: prevent and protect, diagnosis, treatment and cross-cutting. Overall 379 experts were identified, and 108 took part. We started with 83 topics, and 81 further general and 40 COVID-19 specific topics were proposed. In the final ranking 101 topics were retained, and the highest ranked was to <i>""explore interventions to prevent neonatal pneumonia"".</i> Among the top 20 topics, epidemiological research and intervention evaluation was commonly prioritized, followed by the operational and implementation research. Two COVID-19 related questions were ranked within the top 20. There were clear differences in priorities between HIC and LMIC respondents, and academics vs non-academics. Operational research on health system capacities, and evaluating optimized delivery of existing treatments, diagnostics and case management approaches are needed. This list should act as a catalyst for collaborative research, especially to meet the top priority in preventing neonatal pneumonia, and encourage multi-disciplinary partnerships.","King, Baker, Richardson, Wharton-Smith, Bakare, Jehan, Chisti, Zar, Awasthi, Smith, Greenslade, Qazi","https://doi.org/10.7189/jogh.12.09001","20220310","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28321,""

"Older Women's Loneliness and Depression Decreased by a Reminiscence Program in Times of COVID-19","The confinement caused by the current COVID-19 pandemic protects physical health, but in turn, has a long-lasting and far-reaching negative psychosocial impact; anxiety, stress, fear and depressive symptoms. All of these have a particular impact on vulnerable older people, putting them at serious risk of loneliness. Women report feeling lonelier than men, affecting women to a greater extent. The present study aims to analyze the efficacy of an integrative reminiscence intervention in older women living in nursing homes to reduce the effects of loneliness and depression after COVID-19. 34 older women living in nursing homes are included into study and were divided into intervention group (<i>N</i> = 14) and control group (<i>N</i> = 20). Results showed a significant reduction in perception of loneliness, depression and better positive affects, after the intervention. The pandemic has not yet finished and the most affected group has been the people living in nursing homes. These results show the need for evidence of interventions that can help the recovery of these people who have been so affected.

"COVID-19 Related Stress and Mental Health Outcomes 1 Year After the Peak of the Pandemic Outbreak in China: the Mediating Effect of Resilience and Social Support","COVID-19 outbreak have a long-term negative impact on mental health. Meanwhile, it may also provide opportunities for positive outcomes (e.g., post-traumatic growth). Resilience and social support could serve as psychological resources to protect individuals against the detrimental effects of the COVID-19 crisis and enable people to develop positive changes during challenging times. By testing the roles of resilience and social support in the relationship between COVID-19 related stress and negative mental health outcomes (depression and anxiety), as well as the relationship between COVID-19 related stress and positive mental health outcomes (post-traumatic growth, PTG), this study aimed to investigate the psychological mechanisms involved in different mental health outcomes induced by COVID-19. An online survey was conducted 1 year after the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak (from April to August 2021) in China. The survey includes demographic questionnaires and six scales: the Impact of Event Scale-Revised for COVID-19 (IES-RC), the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10), the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS), the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) and the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI). The structural equation model (SEM) was used to evaluate the relations and mechanisms between COVID-19 related stress and resilience, social support in depression, anxiety, and PTG. A total of 771 Chinese subjects completed the questionnaire, including 416 (54%) females. COVID-19 related stress was associated with anxiety (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), PTG (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), and depression (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). Resilience was related to depression (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), anxiety (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), and PTG (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). Social support was associated with depression (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), anxiety (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), and PTG (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). Under SEM analysis, resilience mediated the effects of COVID-19 related stress on depression and post-traumatic growth. Social support mediated the impacts of COVID-19 related stress on post-traumatic growth, depression, and anxiety. The path coefficients of the mediation effects were statistically significant. The current findings suggest that COVID-19 related stress has a double-edged effect on mental health. Depression, anxiety, and PTG coexist in Chinese individuals 1 year after the peak of the pandemic. Resilience and social support serve as important protective factors of mental health, safeguard people from the negative mental health outcomes of the COVID-19, and promote PTG.","Hu, Huang, Liu, Zheng, Xu, Zhou, Wang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.828379","20220310","COVID-19; mental health; resilience; social support; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28324,""
"Healthcare Workers and COVID-19-Related Moral Injury: An Interpersonally-Focused Approach Informed by PTSD","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a still-unfolding series of novel, potentially traumatic moral and ethical challenges that place many healthcare workers at risk of developing moral injury. Moral injury is a type of psychological response that may arise when one transgresses or witnesses another transgress deeply held moral values, or when one feels that an individual or institution that has a duty to provide care has failed to do so. Despite knowledge of this widespread exposure, to date, empirical data are scarce as to how to prevent and, where necessary, treat COVID-19-related moral injury in healthcare workers. Given the relation between moral injury and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), we point here to social and interpersonal factors as critical moderators of PTSD symptomology and consider how this knowledge may translate to interventions for COVID-19-related moral injury. Specifically, we first review alterations in social cognitive functioning observed among individuals with PTSD that may give rise to interpersonal difficulties. Drawing on Nietlisbach and Maercker's 2009 work on interpersonal factors relevant to survivors of trauma with PTSD, we then review the role of perceived social support, social acknowledgment and social exclusion in relation to potential areas of targeted intervention for COVID-19-related moral injury in healthcare workers. Finally, building on existing literature (e.g., Phoenix Australia-Centre for Posttraumatic Mental Health and the Canadian Centre of Excellence-PTSD, 2020) we conclude with individual and organizational considerations to bolster against the development of moral injury in healthcare workers during the pandemic.","D'Alessandro, Ritchie, McCabe, Lanius, Heber, Smith, Malain, Schielke, O'Connor, Hosseiny, Rodrigues, McKinnon","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.784523","20220310","COVID-19; healthcare workers; interpersonal factors; moral injury; post-traumatic stress disorder; social cognition","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28325,""
"Mental Health Profiles in a Sample of Moroccan High School Students: Comparison Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Adolescent high school students may be particularly susceptible to suffering from the effect of isolation, physical distancing restrictions, and school closures imposed during the COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019) pandemic. Given the biological and psychological changes that occur during this period of development, adolescents' experiences of these pandemic measures could significantly threaten their mental health and cause long-term consequences. The main objectives of the study were to determine the impact of confinement because of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions on the psychological distress of Moroccan adolescents and identify the risk and protective factors that could influence their mental health. The participants in this study were Moroccan high school students who were recruited at two different times-before the COVID-19 pandemic (350 students, mean age: 16.55 years; 53.71% female; data collected in 2014/2015) and after the announcement of the pandemic (457 students, mean age: 16.84; 64.1% female; data collected in 2020). Students responded to an anonymous survey that included several validated instruments, such as the Brief Symptom Inventory and the Godin-Shephard Leisure-Time Physical Activity questionary, and elicited information about the students' psychosocial environment, gender, and age. The scores on the Brief Symptom Inventory dimensions from the pre-pandemic period and during 2020 were compared. A comparison between the scores of the two genders of the 2020 sample was also carried out. In addition, binary regression analysis was performed to predict the associations between gender, frequency of physical activity, the presence of the number of negative psychosocial factors, and those dimensions of the Brief Symptom Inventory that significantly changed between the samples. Female students reported higher psychological distress than male students in both data collection periods. During the COVID-19 pandemic, students scored significantly (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) higher in depression and paranoid ideation, and they scored significantly (<i>p</i> = 0.01) lower in hostility and anxiety compared with the pre-pandemic period. Female gender and the experience of physical or psychological abuse significantly increased the risk of reporting higher scores in depression and paranoid ideation symptoms during 2020. Moderate and frequent physical activities were significantly and negatively associated with depression (<i>p</i> = 0.003 and <i>p</i> = 0.004; respectively). This study confirms the stressful impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Moroccan high school students, who reported more symptoms of depression and paranoid ideation compared with the pre-COVID-19 period. Female students reported higher psychological distress than male students did. The experience of physical /psychological abuse during the pandemic worsened mental health, while moderate/frequent physical activity improved it.","Mzadi, Zouini, Kerekes, Senhaji","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.752539","20220310","Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI); COVID-19 pandemic; gender; physical activity; physical and/or psychological abuse; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28326,""

"[Factors influencing changes in daily life due to the state of emergency among older adults living in Akita Prefecture]","The present study is assessed the effects of COVID-19 on the mental and physical function after the declaration of an emergency situation, which included the request that residents refrain from going out, in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19 infection. The investigation was conducted from 2019 to 2020. Our samples consisted of 506 older adults (332 people in 2019 and 174 people in 2020), whose physical, cognitive, depression, and independence in daily and social activities were measured annually. Furthermore, a questionnaire survey (COVID-19 questionnaire) on the impact of the spread of COVID-19 infection on respondents' daily lives (reduction in social interaction, going out, exercise, and sleep time) was conducted among participants in 2020. According to a statistical analysis, the UWS (Usual Walking Speed) was significantly faster in 2020 than it had been in 2019 (p&lt;0.000). However, no significant differences were found in other items. A correlation analysis, revealed a significant association between the reduction in sleep time and GDS-15 (Geriatric Depression Scale) score (r=0.200, p=0.019) and between the COVID-19 questionnaire total score and body mass index (r=0.282, p=0.001).These results suggest that the decline in the physical and mental function might not have been evident in older adults in Akita Prefecture, where the number of infected people is small, although a more detailed long-term follow-up is needed.

"Prevalence of depression in China during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study in an online survey sample","We aimed to determine (1) the prevalence of depression during the COVID-19 pandemic among Chinese adults and (2) how depression prevalence varied by province and sociodemographic characteristics. Cross-sectional study. National online survey in China. We conducted a cross-sectional online survey among adults registered with the survey company KuRunData from 8 May 2020 to 8 June 2020. We aimed to recruit 300-360 adults per province (n=14 493), with a similar distribution by sex and rural-urban residency as the general population within each of these provinces. Participants completed the Patient Health Questionaire-9 (PHQ-9). We calculated the prevalence of depression (defined as a PHQ-9 score Ã¢â€°Â¥10) nationally and separately for each province. Covariate-unadjusted and covariate-adjusted logistic regression models were used to examine how the prevalence of depression varied by adults' sociodemographic characteristics. All analyses used survey sampling weights. The survey was initiated by 14 493 participants, with 10 000 completing all survey questions and included in the analysis. The prevalence of depression in the national sample was 6.3% (95% CI 5.7% to 6.8%). A higher odds of depression was associated with living in an urban area (OR 1.50; 95% CI 1.18 to 1.90) and working as a nurse (OR 3.06; 95% CI 1.41 to 6.66). A lower odds of depression was associated with participants who had accurate knowledge of COVID-19 transmission prevention actions (OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.51 to 0.98), the knowledge that saliva is a main transmission route (OR 0.80; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.99) and awareness of COVID-19 symptoms (OR, 0.82; 95% CI 0.68 to 1.00).

"Italian intersociety consensus on management of long covid in children","Two sequelae of pediatric COVID-19 have been identified, the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and the long COVID. Long COVID is much less precisely defined and includes all the persistent or new clinical manifestations evidenced in subjects previously infected by SARS-CoV-2 beyond the period of the acute infection and that cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. In this Intersociety Consensus, present knowledge on pediatric long COVID as well as how to identify and manage children with long COVID are discussed. Although the true prevalence of long COVID in pediatrics is not exactly determined, it seems appropriate to recommend evaluating the presence of symptoms suggestive of long COVID near the end of the acute phase of the disease, between 4 and 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks from this. Long COVID in children and adolescents should be suspected in presence of persistent headache and fatigue, sleep disturbance, difficulty in concentrating, abdominal pain, myalgia or arthralgia. Persistent chest pain, stomach pain, diarrhea, heart palpitations, and skin lesions should be considered as possible symptoms of long COVID. It is recommended that the primary care pediatrician visits all subjects with a suspected or a proven diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection after 4Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks to check for the presence of symptoms of previously unknown disease. In any case, a further check-up by the primary care pediatrician should be scheduled 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°months after the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection to confirm normality or to address emerging problems. The subjects who present symptoms of any organic problem must undergo a thorough evaluation of the same, with a possible request for clinical, laboratory and / or radiological in-depth analysis in case of need. Children and adolescents with clear symptoms of mental stress will need to be followed up by existing local services for problems of this type. Pediatric long COVID is a relevant problem that involve a considerable proportion of children and adolescents. Prognosis of these cases is generally good as in most of them symptoms disappear spontaneously. The few children with significant medical problems should be early identified after the acute phase of the infection and adequately managed to assure complete resolution. A relevant psychological support for all the children during COVID-19 pandemic must be organized by health authorities and government that have to treat this as a public health issue.","Esposito, Principi, Azzari, Cardinale, Di Mauro, Galli, Gattinara, Fainardi, Guarino, Lancella, Licari, Mancino, Marseglia, Leonardi, Nenna, Zampogna, Zona, Staiano, Midulla","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13052-022-01233-6","20220310","COVID-19; Long COVID; Mental health; Pediatric infectious diseases; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28331,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on illicit drug supply, drug-related behaviour of people who use drugs and provision of drug related services in Georgia: results of a mixed methods prospective cohort study","This study examines the effects of COVID-19 related restrictions on the supply of illicit drugs, drug-use behaviour among people who use drugs (PWUD) regularly (at least weekly), and drug-related service provision in Tbilisi, Georgia. In this mixed methods study, a cohort of 50 Georgian PWUD recruited through a snow-ball sampling participated in a bi-weekly online survey in April-September, 2020. They also took part in the qualitative telephone interviews at 12- and 24-week follow-up time points. In addition, four key informants (field experts) were interviewed monthly to assess their perceptions of changes in the illicit drug market and drug service delivery. Mean age in the sample was 36 (range 18-60); 39 (78%) were males. Perceived availability of drugs was reduced during the lockdown, and many PWUD switched to alternative substances when preferred drugs were not available. On average, participants used significantly fewer substances over the course of the study, from 3.5 substances in the preceding 14Ã‚Â days to 2.1 (aOR 0.92; 95% CI 0.90-0.94). Consumption of cannabis products declined significantly (aOR 0.89; 95% CI 0.84-0.95), likewise alcohol (aOR 0.94; 95% CI 0.88-1.0), diverted medicinal methadone (aOR 0.85; 95% CI 0.8-0.9) and diverted medicinal buprenorphine (aOR 0.91; 95% CI 0.84-0.99). PWUD cited fewer contacts with drug dealers, the lack of transportation, and the lack of conventional recreational environment as the main reasons for these changes. When access to sterile injection equipment was limited, PWUD exercised risk-containing injection behaviours, such as buying drugs in pre-filled syringes (aOR 0.88; 95% CI 0.80-0.96). Harm reduction and treatment programs managed to adopt flexible strategies to recover services that were affected during the initial stage of the pandemic.

"Lived experiences of Palestinian patients with COVID-19: a multi-center descriptive phenomenological study of recovery journey","Exploring lived experiences of recovered COVID-19 patients might have scientific, social, and policy relevance that can apply to the healthcare infrastructure. This multi-center descriptive phenomenological study was conducted to explore lived experiences of Palestinian patients who recovered from COVID-19.Ã¢â‚¬Æ’ METHODS: This was a descriptive phenomenological study. A purposive sampling technique was used to recruit the study participants. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with patients who recovered from COVID-19 (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°20). The interviews were transcribed verbatim. The transcripts were analyzed using Colaizzi's phenomenological approach which consisted of the following steps: 1) familiarization, 2) identification of significant statements, 3) formulation of the meanings, 4) clustering the themes, 5) development of an exhaustive description of the phenomenon, 6) production of the fundamental structure, and 7) verification of the fundamental structure. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 14 male and 6 female patients who recovered from COVID-19. The total duration of the interview time was 998Ã¢â‚¬â€°min (16.6Ã¢â‚¬â€°h). The qualitative data collected during the interviews were categorized into 5 major themes and 16 subthemes that exhaustively described the phenomenon. The major themes were relevant to: 1) emotions after learning about the infection, 2) experiencing social exclusion and stigma, 3) the experienced symptoms, 4) supportive treatments, herbs, rituals, and social support, 5) and life after recovery. The interviewees recounted experiencing negative emotions, social exclusion, and stigma because of their infection. It may be important for mental health promotion to be an integral part of the care plan for patients with COVID-19. More studies are still needed to investigate if introducing mental healthcare providers to the care team of patients with COVID-19 can improve the experiences of the patients.","Alkaissi, Zaben, Abu-Rajab, Alkony","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-12868-9","20220310","COVID-19; Coping; Experiences; Palestine; Quarantine; SARS-CoV-2; Stigma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28333,""
"A home-based exercise program during COVID-19 pandemic: Perceptions and acceptability of juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus and juvenile idiopathic arthritis adolescents","To investigate the perceptions and acceptability of a home-based exercise intervention in systemic lupus erythematosus (JSLE) and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) adolescent patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to explore the effects of the intervention on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), sleep quality, and mental health conditions parameters. This was a randomized controlled trial of a 12-week, home-based exercise training program conducted between October and December 2020. During this period, social distancing measures were in place in Brazil to contain the spread of COVID-19. Adolescent patients diagnosed with JSLE and JIA participated in the study. Health-related qualitative and quantitative data were collected before and after the follow-up. 21 JSLE patients and 30 JIA patients were analyzed. Six themes emerged from patients' feedback: 1) Suitability of the home-based format; 2) Appropriate trainer supervision, 3) Motivators and facilitators for the program; 4) Barriers to the program; 5) Health benefits; 6) Patients' suggestions to improve the program. Overall, data indicated that the intervention showed good acceptability and elicited improvements in the perceived HRQoL and fatigue in JIA and JSLE patients during the pandemic. However, further quantitative analyses with validated HRQoL, sleep quality, and mental health conditions instruments did not capture these benefits (p&gt;0.05). Our main findings based on in-depth qualitative assessments suggest that a home-based exercise training program was suitable and well-accepted by adolescents with JSLE and JIA during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, adherence was not high, particularly among JIA patients, suggesting that facilitators and barriers identified in the current study should be explored to improve the quality of new home-based exercise programs implementation, particularly in a future emerging crisis.","Sieczkowska, Astley, Marques, Iraha, Franco, Ihara, Martins Lavorato, Lindoso, Demitrol Setoue, Tanigava, Campos, Pereira, Aikawa, Roschel, Queiroz, Polanczyk, Silva, Gualano","https://doi.org/10.1177/09612033221083273","20220310","pediatric rheumatic diseases; physical activity; physical training; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28334,""
"Psychological factors of diet quality among rural populations of Latin America during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study","This study aimed to determine the relationship between symptoms of anxiety and/or anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure) and diet quality during confinement due to COVID-19 in rural populations in Latin America. This was a multicentric, cross-sectional study. An online survey was applied, which included the Beck Anxiety Inventory, Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale for assessing the presence of anhedonia, the Food Intake Questionnaire and sociodemographic questions. The study included 10 552 people from 11 countries; 708 participants were living in rural areas. More than half of the participants were quarantined at the time of the survey. Diet quality was inversely associated with anhedonia (p&lt;0.001) and anxiety (p=0.003). In addition, a healthier diet was associated with being female (p=0.030), having a higher level of education (p=0.008) and country of residence (p=0.001). Among the rural population during the COVID pandemic, this study found a worse diet quality was associated with symptoms of anhedonia and anxiety, as well as lower level of education and being male.

"Nonfatal opioid overdoses before and after Covid-19: Regional variation in rates of change","The Covid-19 pandemic and its accompanying public-health orders (PHOs) have led to (potentially countervailing) changes in various risk factors for overdose. To assess whether the net effects of these factors varied geographically, we examined regional variation in the impact of the PHOs on counts of nonfatal overdoses, which have received less attention than fatal overdoses, despite their public health significance. Data were collected from the Overdose Detection Mapping Application Program (ODMAP), which recorded suspected overdoses between July 1, 2018 and October 25, 2020. We used segmented regression models to assess the impact of PHOs on nonfatal-overdose trends in Washington DC and the five geographical regions of Maryland, using a historical control time series to adjust for normative changes in overdoses that occurred around mid-March (when the PHOs were issued). The mean level change in nonfatal opioid overdoses immediately after mid-March was not reliably different in the Covid-19 year versus the preceding control time series for any region. However, the rate of increase in nonfatal overdose was steeper after mid-March in the Covid-19 year versus the preceding year for Maryland as a whole (B = 2.36; 95% CI, 0.65 to 4.06; p = .007) and for certain subregions. No differences were observed for Washington DC. The pandemic and its accompanying PHOs were associated with steeper increases in nonfatal opioid overdoses in most but not all of the regions we assessed, with a net effect that was deleterious for the Maryland region as a whole.","Burgess-Hull, Smith, Panlilio, Schriefer, Preston, Alter, Yeager, Chizmar, Delbridge, Zamore, Beeson, Epstein","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263893","20220309","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28337,""
"A longitudinal approach to understanding risk factors for problem alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic","We conducted a longitudinal study to examine person-centered heterogeneity in problem drinking risk during the 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. We aimed to differentiate high- from low-risk subgroups of drinkers during the pandemic, to report on the longitudinal follow-up of the baseline sample reported in Wardell et al. (Alcohol Clin Exp Res, 44, 2020, 2073), and to examine how subgroups of drinkers differed on coping-related and pre-pandemic alcohol vulnerability factors. Canadian alcohol users (N = 364) were recruited for the study. Participants completed surveys at four waves (spaced 3Ã‚Â months apart), with the first being 7 to 8Ã‚Â weeks after the COVID-19 state of emergency began in Canada. The data were analyzed using a parallel process latent growth class analysis followed by general linear mixed models analysis. We found evidence for three latent classes: individuals who increased drinking (class 1; nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 23), low-risk drinkers (class 2; nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 311), and individuals who decreased drinking (class 3; nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 30). Participants who increased (vs. those who decreased) problem drinking during the pandemic struggled with increasing levels of social disconnection and were also increasingly more likely to report drinking to cope with these issues. Those in the increasing class (relative to low-risk drinkers) reported increasing levels of depression during the study. Relative to low-risk drinkers, participants in the increasing class had higher pre-pandemic AUDIT scores, greater frequency of solitary drinking, and higher alcohol demand. Interestingly, participants in the decreasing class had the highest pre-pandemic AUDIT scores. We examined longitudinal data to identify subgroups of drinkers during the pandemic and to identify factors that may have contributed to increased problem drinking. Findings suggest that while most of the sample did not change their alcohol use, a small portion of individuals escalated use, while a small portion decreased their drinking. Identifying the vulnerability factors associated with increased drinking could aid in the development of preventative strategies and intervention approaches.","Baptist Mohseni, Morris, Vedelago, Kempe, Rapinda, Mesmer, Bilevicius, Wardell, MacKillop, Keough","https://doi.org/10.1111/acer.14774","20220309","COVID-19; alcohol; longitudinal; problematic drinking; risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28338,""

COVID-19 media exposure predicted engagement in relevant safety behaviors, which negatively impacted quality of life, which in turn predicted increased internalizing problems. COVID-19 family conversations predicted social distancing fears, which negatively impacted quality of life, which then in turn also predicted increased internalizing problems.

"Implementation of Safe Supply Alternatives During Intersecting COVID-19 and Overdose Health Emergencies in British Columbia, Canada, 2021","<b>Objectives.</b> To explore the implementation and effectiveness of the British Columbia, Canada, risk mitigation guidelines among people who use drugs, focusing on how experiences with the illicit drug supply shaped motivations to seek prescription alternatives and the subsequent impacts on overdose vulnerability. <b>Methods.</b> From February to July 2021, we conducted qualitative interviews with 40 people who use drugs in British Columbia, Canada, and who accessed prescription opioids or stimulants under the risk mitigation guidelines. <b>Results.</b> COVID-19 disrupted British Columbia's illicit drug market. Concerns about overdose because of drug supply changes, and deepening socioeconomic marginalization, motivated participants to access no-cost prescription alternatives. Reliable access to prescription alternatives addressed overdose vulnerability by reducing engagement with the illicit drug market while allowing greater agency over drug use. Because prescriptions were primarily intended to manage withdrawal, participants supplemented with illicit drugs to experience enjoyment and manage pain. <b>Conclusions.</b> Providing prescription alternatives to illicit drugs is a critical harm reduction approach that reduces exposure to an increasingly toxic drug supply, yet further optimizations are needed.

"Well-being of Canadian Armed Forces members during the COVID-19 pandemic: the influence of positive health behaviours","The COVID-19 pandemic has been linked to increased depression, anxiety and other adverse mental health outcomes. Understanding the behaviours that positively influence health is important for the development of strategies to maintain andimprove well-being during the pandemic. This study focussed on Canadian Armed Forces Regular Force members (N = 13 668) who participated in the COVID-19 Defence Team Survey, administered between April and May 2020. The use of positive health behaviours and the extent to which such behaviours were associated with anxiety, depression and self-reported change in health and stress levels compared to before the pandemic were examined. Depression and anxiety were experienced by 14% and 15% of the sample, respectively, while 36% reported that their mental health had gotten worse since the pandemic started, and close to half reported worse physical health and stress levels. The most common behaviours respondents reported engaging in to maintain or improve their health were exercising outdoors, healthy eating and connecting with loved ones. Although most behaviours were associated with better health outcomes, meditation and connecting with loved ones showed associations with worse health. Engaging in behaviours such as exercise and healthy eating was generally associated with better health outcomes. Unexpected relationships of meditation and connecting with loved ones are discussed in terms of their use in stressful times among those with mental health issues, past research on coping strategies and impacts of the pandemic and physical distancing on social connections. The findings may have implications for strategies to promote healthy behaviours during the remainder of the pandemic and similar crises in the future.

"Trials and tribulations among members of Canada's Defence Team early in the pandemic: key insights from the COVID-19 Defence Team Survey","Due to the unprecedented impact of COVID-19, there is a need for research assessing pandemic-related challenges and stressors. The current study aimed to assess key concerns and general well-being among members of Canada's Defence Team, including Canadian Armed Forces personnel and members of the Department of National Defence (DND) Public Service. The COVID-19 Defence Team Survey was administered electronically to Defence Team staff in April and May of 2020 and was completed by 13 688 Regular Force, 5985 Reserve Force and 7487 civilian DND Public Service personnel. Along with demographic information, the survey included assessments of work arrangement, pandemic-related concerns, general well-being and social and organizational support. Weighted data (to ensure representation) were used in all analyses. The majority of respondents were working from home, with a small minority unable to work due to restrictions. Though many concerns were endorsed by a substantial proportion of respondents, the most prevalent concerns were related to the health and well-being of loved ones. The majority of respondents reported their partner, family, supervisors, friends, colleagues and children provided general support. Half of the civilian defence staff and one-third of military respondents reported a decline in mental health. Women, younger respondents, those with dependents and, in some cases, those who were single without children were at risk of lower well-being. The pandemic has negatively impacted a substantial portion of the Defence Team. When responding to future crises, it is recommended that leaders of organizations provide additional supports to higher-risk groups and to supervisors who are ideally positioned to support employees during challenging times.

Le sondage de lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ãƒâ€°quipe de la DÃƒÂ©fense sur la COVID-19 a ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© soumis par voie ÃƒÂ©lectronique au personnel de lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ãƒâ€°quipe de la DÃƒÂ©fense en avril et mai 2020, et 13 688 membres de la Force rÃƒÂ©guliÃƒÂ¨re, 5 985 membres de la Force de rÃƒÂ©serve et 7 487 employÃƒÂ©s civils de la fonction publique du MDN y ont rÃƒÂ©pondu. Outre le recueil de donnÃƒÂ©es sociodÃƒÂ©mographiques, le sondage visait Ãƒ ÃƒÂ©valuer les modalitÃƒÂ©s de travail, les prÃƒÂ©occupations liÃƒÂ©es Ãƒ la pandÃƒÂ©mie, le bien-ÃƒÂªtre gÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©ral et le soutien social et organisationnel. Des donnÃƒÂ©es pondÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ©es ont ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© utilisÃƒÂ©es dans toutes les analyses (pour garantir une juste reprÃƒÂ©sentation des diffÃƒÂ©rents groupes). La majoritÃƒÂ© des rÃƒÂ©pondants travaillaient depuis leur domicile et une petite minoritÃƒÂ© nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ©tait pas en mesure de travailler en raison des restrictions. Les principales prÃƒÂ©occupations parmi les nombreuses prÃƒÂ©occupations communes Ãƒ une proportion importante de rÃƒÂ©pondants ÃƒÂ©taient liÃƒÂ©es Ãƒ la santÃƒÂ© et au bien-ÃƒÂªtre de leurs proches.

La moitiÃƒÂ© du personnel civil du ministÃƒÂ¨re de la DÃƒÂ©fense nationale et un tiers du personnel militaire ont fait ÃƒÂ©tat dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢une dÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ©rioration de leur santÃƒÂ© mentale. Les femmes, les rÃƒÂ©pondants plus jeunes, les rÃƒÂ©pondants ayant des personnes Ãƒ charge et, dans certains cas, les cÃƒÂ©libataires sans enfants risquaient davantage un faible degrÃƒÂ© de bien-ÃƒÂªtre. La pandÃƒÂ©mie a eu des effets nÃƒÂ©gatifs sur une grande partie du personnel de lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ãƒâ€°quipe de la DÃƒÂ©fense. Lors de futures crises, les dirigeants dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢organismes devraient fournir un soutien accru aux groupes les plus exposÃƒÂ©s et aux superviseurs, qui sont trÃƒÂ¨s bien placÃƒÂ©s pour soutenir les employÃƒÂ©s en pÃƒÂ©riode difficile. Top concerns reported by all groups centred on the health and well-being of loved ones, with civilian Defence Team personnel reporting higher levels of concern compared to Regular and Reserve Force personnel. Over 75% of all participants agreed that their spouse/partner provided them with significant support. Family members, supervisors and friends were also commonly perceived as providing significant support (57%Ã¢â‚¬â€œ66%). A decline in mental health was reported by almost half of civilian Defence Team personnel and approximately one-third of military personnel. Women, younger respondents and those with dependents appear to be at risk for lower levels of wellbeing during the pandemic.

There are a number of challenges involved in conducting longitudinal research in an applied military setting during a global public health crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic. These challenges include but are not limited to a sudden transition to a distributed remote work environment, tight timelines, the need to obtain approvals from different agencies and departments, having to prioritize multiple study objectives, and survey fatigue. To overcome these challenges in future public health crises, it is important to (1) develop and maintain collaborative networks across government, academia and industry; (2) develop a standard set of pre-deployment demographic and health indicators to establish a baseline; and (3) use mixed methods approaches for a richer understanding of mental health trajectories following stressful events.

"Subjective psychological impacts during COVID-19 lockdown on older people, risk profiles and coping strategies: Results of an online survey in Spain","This study explores the psychological impacts of lockdown among older people during the coronavirus disease 2019Ã‚Â pandemic in Spain, and identifies risk profiles and adaptative behaviors. A cross-sectional online survey was disseminated by social networks through snowball sampling (April-June 2020). The survey included ad-hoc questions about psychological impacts on subjective cognitive functioning, emotional distress, and loneliness. Open end-questions were coded according to Lazarus and Folkman's coping strategies framework. Of the 2010 respondents, 76% experienced impact in at least one cognitive function (11% reporting severe effects), 78% frequent sadness and 13% frequent loneliness. Age 80+, women and low education increased the risk of loneliness and severe impact in memory and processing speed. Living alone was an additional risk factor for loneliness and sadness. Lockdown is associated with cognitive impacts, emotional distress, and lonelinessÃ‚Â being risk profiles related to inequality axes. Coping strategies should inform aging policies to prevent psychological impacts during the lockdown.","DomÃƒÂ©nech, Blancafort-Alias, Rojano, SalvÃƒÂ , RoquÃƒÂ©, Coll-Planas","https://doi.org/10.1002/jcop.22833","20220309","COVID-19; cognitive aspects; coping skills; emotional aspects; loneliness; older adults; risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28348,""
"Oropharyngeal Microbiome Profiled at Admission is Predictive of the Need for Respiratory Support Among COVID-19 Patients","The clinical course of infection due to respiratory viruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), the causative agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is thought to be influenced by the community of organisms that colonizes the upper respiratory tract, the oropharyngeal microbiome. In this study, we examined the oropharyngeal microbiome of suspected COVID-19 patients presenting to the Emergency Department and an inpatient COVID-19 unit with symptoms of acute COVID-19. Of 115 enrolled patients, 74 were confirmed COVID-19+ and 50 had symptom duration of 14 days or less; 38 acute COVID-19+ patients (76%) went on to require respiratory support. Although no microbiome features were found to be significantly different between COVID-19+ and COVID-19-patients, when we conducted random forest classification modeling (RFC) to predict the need of respiratory support for the COVID-19+ patients our analysis identified a subset of organisms and metabolic pathways whose relative abundance, when combined with clinical factors (such as age and Body Mass Index), was highly predictive of the need for respiratory support (F1 score 0.857). Microbiome Multivariable Association with Linear Models (MaAsLin2) analysis was then applied to the features identified as predicative of the need for respiratory support by the RFC. This analysis revealed reduced abundance of <i>Prevotella salivae</i> and metabolic pathways associated with lipopolysaccharide and mycolic acid biosynthesis to be the strongest predictors of patients requiring respiratory support. These findings suggest that composition of the oropharyngeal microbiome in COVID-19 may play a role in determining who will suffer from severe disease manifestations. The microbial community that colonizes the upper airway, the oropharyngeal microbiome, has the potential to affect how patients respond to respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV2, the causative agent of COVID-19. In this study, we investigated the oropharyngeal microbiome of COVID-19 patients using high throughput DNA sequencing performed on oral swabs. We combined patient characteristics available at intake such as medical comorbidities and age, with measured abundance of bacterial species and metabolic pathways and then trained a machine learning model to determine what features are predicative of patients needing respiratory support in the form of supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation. We found that decreased abundance of some bacterial species and increased abundance of pathways associated bacterial products biosynthesis was highly predictive of needing respiratory support. This suggests that the oropharyngeal microbiome affects disease course in COVID-19 and could be targeted for diagnostic purposes to determine who may need oxygen, or therapeutic purposes such as probiotics to prevent severe COVID-19 disease manifestations.","Bradley, Zeamer, Bucci, Cincotta, Salive, Dutta, Mutaawe, Anya, Tocci, Moormann, Ward, McCormick, Haran","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.02.28.22271627","20220309","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28349,""
"Temporal trends of suicide-related non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest characteristics and outcomes with the COVID-19 pandemic","Jurisdictions have reported COVID-19-related increases in the incidence and mortality of non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). We hypothesized that changes in suicide incidence during the COVID-19 pandemic may have contributed to these changes. We investigated whether the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with changes in the: (1) incidence of suicide-related OHCA, and (2) characteristics and outcomes of such cases. We used the provincial British Columbia Cardiac Arrest Registry, including non-traumatic emergency medical system (EMS)-assessed OHCA, to compare suicide-related OHCA (defined as clear self-harm or <i>a priori</i> communication of intent) one-year prior to, and one year after, the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 15, 2020). We calculated differences in incidence (with 95% CI), overall and within subgroups of mechanism (hanging, suffocation, poisoning, or unclear mechanism), and in case characteristics and hospital-discharge favourable neurological outcomes (CPC 1-2). Of 13,785 EMS-assessed OHCA, we included 274/6430 (4.3%) pre-pandemic and 221/7355 (3.0%) pandemic-period suicide-related cases. The median age was 43 years (IQR 30-57), 157 (32%) were female, and 7 (1.4%) survived with favourable neurological status. Suicide-related OHCA incidence decreased from 5.4 pre-pandemic to 4.3 per 100 000 person-years (-1.1, 95% CI -2.0 to -0.28). Hanging-related OHCA incidence also decreased. Patient characteristics and hospital discharge outcomes between periods were similar. Suicide-related OHCA incidence decreased with the COVID-19 pandemic and we did not detect changes in patient characteristics or outcomes, suggesting that suicide is not a contributor to increases in COVID-related OHCA incidence or mortality. Overall outcomes in both time periods were poor.","Yap, Scheuermeyer, van Diepen, Barbic, Straight, Wall, Asamoah-Boaheng, Christenson, Grunau","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resplu.2022.100216","20220310","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28350,""
"Does Socioeconomic status mediate the relationship between income loss and depression scores? Evidence from South Africa","This paper examines the role of socioeconomic status (SES) in mediating the effect of job and household income loss on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. We note that even though job loss will invariably reduce household income, the relationship between these factors and mental health may be mediated by SES. Specifically, in the context of COVID-19 induced shock, job loss may not be a threat to survival for an individual with relatively high SES, while this is not the case for individuals with low SES. Our empirical analysis uses threshold regression under the assumption that the relationship between depressive symptoms and pandemic induced job/ income loss has a threshold effect. We find that job loss (but not the decline in household income) is a stronger predictor of poor mental health for individuals that live in households above a certain SES threshold. This suggests that the psychological trauma of job loss due to loss of identity and purpose outweighs the financial loss for individuals with higher SES. On the other hand, a decrease in household income (as against the loss of individual income) is a stronger predictor of poor mental health for individuals with lower SES. We argue that these findings are related to high-income inequality in South Africa. The results highlight the different implications of job loss and income loss for depressive symptoms in the context of high socioeconomic inequality.","Oyenubi, Kollamparambil","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-02963-w","20220310","COVID-19; Depression; Labour Economics; Mental Health; Social Assistance; South Africa","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28351,""
"The COVID-19 Pandemic and Psychopathological symptoms in pregnant women in Spain","During the COVID-19 pandemic, pregnant women are exposed to potentially harmful stressors that might affect their health. The direct consequences that SARS-CoV-2 may have on perinatal mental health are still unknown. The present study aimed to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychopathological symptoms in a sample of Spanish pregnant women. A sample of 186 pregnant women was assessed using the revised Symptoms Check List-90 during the first lockdown in Spain. The results showed clinical scores on the obsession and compulsion, anxiety and phobic anxiety subscales, as well as on the severity indexes. Phobic anxiety was the only variable that was inversely correlated with age and the number of previous miscarriages. A linear regression model showed that age was inversely associated with phobic anxiety scores. A younger age was associated with higher levels of phobic anxiety symptoms. Our results indicated that younger pregnant women and women in the first trimester of pregnancy were more vulnerable to the effects of stress and concerns about COVID-19.","Garcia-Leon, Martin-Tortosa, Cambil-Ledesma, Caparros-Gonzalez","https://doi.org/10.1080/02646838.2022.2047623","20220309","COVID-19; anxiety; pregnancy; psychopathology; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28352,""
"Mental health in individuals with severe mental disorders during the covid-19 pandemic: a longitudinal investigation","Research on the long-term mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across mental disorders is limited, and information on the impact of public health policy measures with varying strictness is missing. This study therefore aimed at investigating psychological distress among residents of Tyrol (Austria) and South Tyrol (Italy) at the early stages of the pandemic and 5 months thereafter and examined how sociodemographic, protective, and risk factors relate to change over time. One hundred and fifteen people with severe mental illness (SMI; schizophrenia spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder with psychotic features) or major depressive disorder without psychotic features (MDD) and 481 community controls without mental disorders participated in an online survey. Next to the collection of sociodemographic and COVID-19 related variables, the Brief Symptom Checklist, the Resilience Scale, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, the Three-Item Loneliness Scale, and the Multidimensional State Boredom Scale-Short Form were used to assess psychological distress, resilience, perceived social support, loneliness, and boredom. Levels of psychological symptoms and the prevalence of psychological distress were significantly higher in individuals with MDD compared to the other two groups, and Italian participants were more prone to anxiety than those from Austria. Psychological distress was predicted by a lower degree of both resilience and perceived social support as well as loneliness and boredom. Notably, the prevalence of clinically relevant psychological symptoms remained unchanged among each group over time. These results underscore the relevance of tailored prevention and mitigation strategies to meet the specific needs of people both with and without mental disorders.","Hofer, Kachel, Plattner, Chernova, Conca, Fronthaler, Haring, Holzner, Huber, Marksteiner, Miller, Pardeller, Perwanger, Pycha, Schmidt, Sperner-Unterweger, Tutzer, Frajo-Apor","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41537-022-00225-z","20220309","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28353,""
"Disentangling Emotions during the Coronavirus Outbreak in Spain: Inner Emotions, Descriptive Feeling Rules and Socioemotional Conventions","For constructionism, language is the link among different levels of analysis of emotional events, from individual to interpersonal and macrosocial. The interaction among these emotional levels allows us to construe an emotional episode and label it with an emotion word, coordinate with the emotions perceived in others, and represent events as a society. Across two studies, we found similarities and differences among inner emotions experienced (individual level), emotions perceived in others (descriptive feeling rules, interpersonal level) and emotions shared on the internet (socioemotional conventions, macrosocial level), with all these emotional targets focused on the COVID-19 outbreak. The results indicate a similarity between the emotional meaning of COVID-19 in society and the descriptive feeling rules, whereas the reported inner emotions were clearly distinct: Joy was irrelevant at the interpersonal and macrosocial levels but clearly important at the individual level. A mismatch also appeared for fear and hope. While fear was the most predominant emotion at the interpersonal and macrosocial levels during most of the phases, it was moderately predominant at the individual level. Hope followed the opposite pattern, being the most relevant emotion at the individual level but less relevant at the interpersonal and macrosocial levels. Each level might have different consequences: Mixed emotions at the individual level might promote resilience; fear perceived in other people might motivate protective behaviors; and sadness socially shared during Christmas might generate greater empathy. These results support the complexity of emotional concepts and the suitability of exploring them at different levels of analysis.","Caballero, Villar, FernÃƒÂ¡ndez, Sevillano, GavilÃƒÂ¡n, Carrera","https://doi.org/10.1017/SJP.2022.7","20220310","COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€œ19; emotional levels; language; multilevel perspective; psychological constructionism; COVID-19; Disease Outbreaks; Emotions; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Spain","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28354,""

HRP group was enrolled during hospitalization for high-risk pregnancy. Participants filled out Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Moreover, only COVID-19 group answered an open-ended question about the impact of restriction on pregnancy experience. HRP women reported higher levels of depressive symptoms than LRP. No difference emerged for COVID (before/during) but an interaction effect between COVID-19 and obstetric condition was found. The qualitative results showed the impact of restrictions on emotions and concerns. Respect to the previous period, LRP women during COVID-19 presented an increased risk for depressive symptoms than HRP. The HRP women during COVID-19 seemed to use hospitalization as a resource to find a social support network with other pregnant women and to be reassured on the clinical ongoing of pregnancy.","Smorti, Gemignani, Bonassi, Mauri, Carducci, Ionio","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-022-04515-3","20220309","COVID-19 restrictions; Depressive symptoms; High-risk pregnancy; Hospitalization; Low-risk pregnancy; Open-ended question","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28355,""
"It Is a Hoax: Attitude of South-eastern Nigerian Toward COVID-19 and Vaccine: The Need for Social Workers","Different behavioral shifts have been observed among the country's population against the COVID-19 pandemic since its emergence in February 2020 in Nigeria. At first, people were scared of the pandemic and this was reinforced by their response to the National Center for Disease Control measures. As days go by and with the increasing number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Nigeria. To reduce the high burden of the pandemic, efforts were made by scientists to produce the COVID-19 vaccine, and Nigeria received about 4 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine in 2021. Thus, it becomes important to investigate the attitude of Nigerians toward COVID-19 and vaccination against COVID-19. To conduct this study, data were sourced using six focus group discussions involving 30 males and females, respectively. Findings revealed that Nigerians have lackadaisical attitude toward COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccine owing to insincerity on the part of the government, poverty, belief system, low-level of awareness among others. To change the negative attitude of Nigerians toward COVID-19 and the vaccine, social worker interventions are recommended.","Onalu, Atama, Ebimgbo, Nwachukwu, Idowu, Nwafor","https://doi.org/10.1080/19371918.2022.2048936","20220309","Attitudes; COVID-19; South-East Nigerian; pandemic; social workers; vaccine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28356,""
"Depression risk among community-dwelling older people is associated with perceived COVID-19 infection risk: effects of news report latency and focusing on number of infected cases","Awareness of COVID-19 infection risk and oscillation patterns ('waves') may affect older people's mental health. Empirical data from populations experiencing multiple waves of community outbreaks can inform guidance for maintaining mental health. This study aims to investigate the effects of COVID-19 infection risk and oscillations on depression among community-dwelling older people in Hong Kong. A rolling cross-sectional telephone survey method was used. Screening for depression risk was conducted among 8,163 older people (age Ã¢â€°Â¥ 60) using the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) from February to August 2020. The relationships between PHQ-2, COVID-19 infection risk proxies - change in newly infected cases and effective reproductive number (R<sub>t</sub>), and oscillations - stage of a 'wave' reported in the media, were analysed using correlation and regression. 8.4% of survey respondents screened positive for depression risk. Being female (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = .08), having a pre-existing mental health issue (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = .21), change in newly infected cases (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = .05), and screening during the latency period before the media called out new waves (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = .03), contributed to higher depression risk (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = .06, all <i>p</i> &lt;.01). While depression risk does not appear alarming in this sample, our results highlight that older people are sensitive to reporting of infection, particularly among those with existing mental health needs. Future public health communication should balance awareness of infection risks with mental health protection.","Liu, Peng, Au, Wong, Kwok, Yin, Lum, Wong","https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2022.2045562","20220309","COVID-19 infected cases; Depression screening; oscillation pattern","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","",28357,""
