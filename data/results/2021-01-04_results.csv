"Burden of predominant psychological reactions among the healthcare workers and general during COVID-19 pandemic phase: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Aim: Present systematic review and meta-analysis examined the burden of psychological reactions predominantly anxiety, depression, stress and insomnia during novel COVID-19 pandemic phase among the frontline healthcare, non-frontline healthcare and general. Methodology: PubMed, EMBASE and SCOPUS were searched for studies between Jan 1, 2020 to May 25, 2020. Brief protocol of the systematic review was registered with the PROSPERO database, (CRD42020186229).Any study that reported the burden of at least one of psychological reactions including anxiety or depression or stress or insomnia was eligible. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2 statistic and results were synthesized using random effect meta-analysis. Results: Out of 52eligible studies, 43 reported anxiety, 43 reported depression, 20 reported stress and 11 reported insomnia. Overall prevalence for anxiety, depression, stress and insomnia were 26.6%, 26.2%,26.2% and 34.4% respectively. Anxiety and depression were found highest among the COVID-19 patients (43.3% and 51.75 respectively). Apart from COVID-19 patients, prevalence of anxiety, depression, stress and insomnia were found highest among the frontline healthcare (27.2%, 32.1%,55.6% and 34.4% respectively) as compared to general healthcare workers (26.9%, 15.7%, 7.0% and 34.0% respectively) and general population (25.9%, 25.9%,25.4% and 29.4% respectively). Conclusion: Anxiety and depression were found highest among the COVID-19 patients. Apart from COVID-19 patients, the anxiety, depression, stress and insomnia were more prevalent among frontline healthcare workers compared to general. Such increased prevalence is prompting towards the global mental health emergency. Therefore a call of urgent attention and pan-region effective mental-health intervention are required to mitigate these psychological reactions.","Bhaskar Thakur; Mona Pathak","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.02.21249126","20210104","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-04","",8860,""
"Non-medical COVID-19-related personal impact in medical ecological perspective: A global multileveled, mixed method study","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread public health measures to reduce transmission, morbidity, and mortality attributed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. While much research and focus surrounds COVID-19 vaccine development, testing, and supportive management, little is known about the determinants of non-medical, personal impact of COVID-19 prevention policies. We aimed to understand determinants of non-medical COVID-19 impact and to account for its multileveled, intersectional nature of associations.

MethodsThis cross-sectional, multi-level, convergent mixed-methods study assessed a range of beliefs, practices, and experiences relating to COVID-19. We recruited a global sample (n=7,411) using both Facebook and Amazon mTURK platforms. We constructed a novel data-driven non-medical COVID-19 Impact Score and four subcomponents (""Personal Action,"" ""Supply-related,"" ""Cancellations,"" and ""Livelihood"" impacts). We used generalized estimating equation models with identity link functions to determine concomitant association of individual, household, and country-level variables on the impact scores. We also classified 20,015 qualitative excerpts from 6859 respondents using an 80-code codebook.

ResultsTotal and component impact scores varied significantly by region with Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean observing the highest impact scores. Multilevel modeling indicated that individual-level sociocultural variables accounted for much of this variation with COVID-related worry, knowledge, struggles in accessing food and supplies, and worsening mental health most strongly associated with non-medical impact. Family responsibilities, personal COVID medical experience, and health locus of control - in addition to country-level variables reflecting social and health challenge - were also significantly and independently associated with non-medical impact.

DiscussionNon-medical personal impact of COVID-19 affects most people internationally, largely in response to shutdowns, implementing prevention requirements, and through economic consequences. In the context where most of the worlds population does not have direct medical experience with COVID-19, this phenomena of non-medical impact is profound, and likely impacts sustainability of public health interventions aimed at containing COVID-19.","Timothy De Ver Dye; Brooke Levandowski; Shazia Siddiqi; Jose G.

"Quality of life under the COVID-19 quarantine","COVID-19 has spread rapidly throughout the world, causing thousands of illnesses and deaths. To fight this pandemic, almost all governments and health authorities have focused on prevention. In March or April, most countries' officials imposed home quarantine and lockdown measures nationwide. This study sought to assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and anxiety levels among people in Portugal under mandatory home quarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The results were compared to the general Portuguese population's HRQoL before the COVID-19 outbreak. This research also aimed to understand the factors that can influence the respondents' HRQoL. A sample of Portugal's population quarantined at home (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°904) filled in an online survey comprising the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item and the EQ-5D-5L and other questions about sociodemographic characteristics, feelings, duties and activities during the quarantine. The sample was weighted to mirror the general population's gender, age and education. Descriptive analyses and correlation coefficients were used to evaluation the respondents' anxiety and HRQoL. Generalised linear models were estimated to identify determinants of HRQoL during the COVID-19 quarantine. The results show that individuals quarantined at home reported higher anxiety and lower HRQoL levels and that people with more anxiety tended to have a lower HRQoL. Females and elderly individuals experienced the highest levels of anxiety and poorest HRQoL. In addition, HRQoL during the quarantine can be explained by various occupational and attitudinal variables, as well as sociodemographic variables. Individuals' mental health should be taken into consideration during pandemics or other emergency situations. Anxiety and other factors can decrease people's HRQoL, in conjunction with the pandemic's social and economic consequences.","Ferreira, Pereira, da FÃƒÂ© BrÃƒÂ¡s, Ilchuk","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11136-020-02724-x","20210103","Anxiety; COVID-19; EQ-5D-5L; GAD-7; Pandemic; Quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-04","",8863,""
"The Association Between Positive Religious Coping, Perceived Stress, and Depressive Symptoms During the Spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19) Among a Sample of Adults in Palestine: Across Sectional Study","The current study was designed to investigate the relationship between positive religious coping, perceived stress, and depressive symptoms among Palestinian adults in response to the emergence of coronavirus (COVID-19), and the quarantine system implemented in the city of Tulkarem, Palestine. A correlational study was conducted to examine the relationship between study variables. Participants were 400 Palestinian adults, involving 172 males and 228 females, living in the city of Tulkarem, Palestine, during the spread of coronavirus. Participants were selected using convenience and snowball sampling techniques. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to test the relationship between positive religious coping, depressive symptoms, and perceived stress. Findings revealed a statistically significant negative correlation between positive religious coping and depressive symptoms (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã‚Â .17, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01). Results also indicated a statistically significant negative correlation between positive religious coping and perceived stress (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã‚Â .15, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01). The regression analysis for predicting depressive symptoms found that both positive religious coping (BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã‚Â .21, SEÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05, ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã‚Â .18) and perceived stress (BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.41, SEÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05, ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.35) were statistically significant toward explaining variance in depressive symptoms. The importance of developing intervention programs that take into consideration religious/spiritual struggles and positive religious strategies may help improve resilience and well-being among affected populations. With the recent spread of COVID-19, findings of this current study have presented important practical implications for improving the mental health and well-being among Palestinians, especially since Palestinian society continues to face different types of stressors, such as illegal occupation. Further studies are recommended to test the relationship between current study variables and other related variables.","Mahamid, Bdier","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10943-020-01121-5","20210103","COVID-19; Depressive symptoms; Palestine; Perceived stress; Positive religious coping","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-04","",8864,""

"The evolution of the changes in the clinical course: a multicenter survey-related impression of the ophthalmologists at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey","The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has become a difficult pandemic to control worldwide. The high transmission risk and mortality rates of COVID-19 cause serious concerns in ophthalmologists and may cause disruptions in clinical functioning. This study aims to identify changes in the clinical approaches of ophthalmologists, understand their anxiety levels, and exhibit how patients' follow-up processes progress during the pandemic. A questionnaire that including demographic information, ophthalmology clinical activity scale, and Beck anxiety scale was sent to ophthalmologists in Turkey. Google Forms was used as a survey platform in this study. A total of 121 ophthalmologists participated in the study. The participants stated that they could not continue routine interventional diagnosis and treatment practices during the outbreak. It was clearly stated that there were changes in their clinical approach and decreased patient examination quality. For this reason, 14.9% of physicians said to missed the diagnosis in this process. Physicians who encounter infected patients state that it is more difficult to provide ophthalmological services and their clinical approaches are affected more negatively. Anxiety levels of physicians who could access personal protective equipment (PPE) and show positive solidarity with their colleagues in the process were found to be lower. Our study revealed that ophthalmologists, like other healthcare professionals, were severely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. Accordingly, healthcare managers should provide adequate PPE for ophthalmologists, organize the clinical operation, and support the mental health of ophthalmologists.","Erdem, Gok, Bostan","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10792-020-01681-1","20210103","Anxiety; COVID-19; Ophthalmologist; Pandemic; Survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-04","",8866,""

"Impact of COVID-19 on the psychological health of university students in Spain and their attitudes toward Mobile mental health solutions","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had an impact on several aspects of life, including university students' mental health. Mobile mental care applications (apps) comprise a form of online mental care that enables the delivery of remote mental care. This study aimed to explore the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of university students in Spain and to explore their attitudes toward the use of mobile mental care apps. Respondents answered a survey, which comprised two sections. The first included the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) that was employed to assess the students' mental health. The second section included six questions developed by the authors to explore the students' attitudes toward mental care apps. The results showed that the students suffered from anxiety and depression as well as social dysfunction. Further, 91.3 % of the students had never used a mobile app for mental health, 36.3 % were unaware of such apps, and 79.2 % were willing to use them in the future. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the psychological health of university students.

"A longitudinal study of psychological distress in the United States before and during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused financial stress and disrupted daily life more quickly than any prior economic downturn and on a scale beyond any prior natural disaster. This study aimed to assess the impact of the pandemic on psychological distress and identify vulnerable groups using longitudinal data to account for pre-pandemic mental health status. Clinically significant psychological distress was assessed with the Kessler-6 in a national probability sample of adults in the United States at two time points, February 2019 (T1) and May 2020 (T2). To identify increases in distress, psychological distress during the worst month of the past year at T1 was compared with psychological distress over the past 30-days at T2. Survey adjusted logistic regression was used to estimate associations of demographic characteristics at T1 (gender, age, race, and income) and census region at T2 with within-person increases in psychological distress. The past-month prevalence of serious psychological distress at T2 was as high as the past-year prevalence at T1 (10.9% vs. 10.2%). Psychological distress was strongly associated across assessments (X<sup>2</sup><sub>(4)</sub>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯174.6, pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.0001). Increase in psychological distress above T1 was associated with gender, age, household income, and census region. Equal numbers of people experienced serious psychological distress in 30-days during the pandemic as did over an entire year prior to the pandemic. Mental health services and research efforts should be targeted to those with a history of mental health conditions and groups identified as at high risk for increases in distress above pre-pandemic levels.","Breslau, Finucane, Locker, Baird, Roth, Collins","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2020.106362","20210103","COVID-19 pandemic; Longitudinal study; Mental health; Psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-04","",8870,""

"Impact of a shelter-in-place order during the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of opioid overdoses","Since the beginning of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in the United States, there have been concerns about the potential impact of the pandemic on persons with opioid use disorder. Shelter-in-place (SIP) orders, which aimed to reduce the spread and scope of the virus, likely also impacted this patient population. This study aims to assess the role of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of opioid overdose before and after a SIP order. A retrospective review of the incidence of opioid overdoses in an urban three-hospital system was conducted. Comparisons were made between the first 100Ã‚Â days of a city-wide SIP order during the COVID-19 pandemic and the 100Ã‚Â days during the COVID-19 pandemic preceding the SIP order (Pre-SIP). Differences in observed incidence and expected incidence during the SIP period were evaluated using a Fisher's Exact test. Total patient visits decreased 22% from 46,078 during the Pre-SIP period to 35,971 during the SIP period. A total of 1551 opioid overdoses were evaluated during the SIP period, compared to 1665 opioid overdoses during the Pre-SIP period, consistent with a 6.8% decline. A Fisher's Exact Test demonstrated a pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.0001, with a corresponding Odds Ratio of 1.20 with a 95% confidence interval (1.12;1.29).

Retrospective cohort study. We identified the proportion of normal, mild, moderate, and severe symptoms of depression and anxiety before and during the social distancing restrictions in adults from southern Brazil. An online, self-administered questionnaire was delivered for residents within the state of Rio Grande do Sul. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were examined by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Most of the participants (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2314) aged between 31 and 59 years (54.2%), were women (76.6%), White (90.6%) with a university degree (66.6%). Moderate-to-severe symptoms of depression and anxiety were reported in 3.9% and 4.5% of participants, respectively, before COVID-19. During the pandemic (June-July, 2020), these proportions increased to 29.1% (6.6-fold increase) and 37.8% (7.4-fold increase), respectively. Higher rates of depressive and anxiety symptoms were observed among women, those aged 18-30 years, diagnosed with chronic disease and participants who had their income negatively affected by social restrictions. Remaining active or becoming physically active during social distancing restrictions reduced the probability of aggravated mental health disorders. Depressive and anxiety symptoms had a 6.6- and 7.4-fold increase since the COVID-19 pandemic.

"The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on community mental health: A psychometric and prevalence study in Turkey","COVID-19, which is characterised by life-threatening symptoms, difficulty in breathing, and pneumonia symptoms and requires global emergency intervention, may cause psychological problems such as phobia, fear and anxiety. This study aims to examine the psychometric properties of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) in Turkish people and to determine the level of fear of COVID-19 among Turkish people. The research was carried out between March and April 2020. A Personal Information Form and the FCV-19S were used to collect the research data. In the validity and reliability stage, 84 people were contacted randomly for data collection. After the validity and reliability analyses of the scale, a total of 431 Turkish people volunteered to participate in the study and answered the questions in the online questionnaire form using a convenience and snowball sampling method. Confirmatory factor analysis, item-total correlation and Cronbach's alpha coefficient were calculated for psychometric evaluation. Bivariate analysis was applied to determine the level of fear of COVID-19. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.89, which is stated to have high reliability. FCV-19S scores of participants were determined to be 21.47Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 6.28. FCV-19S scores of females were determined as 20.48Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 6.33 and FCV-19S scores of males were determined as 19.78Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 7.34 according to the bivariate analysis (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .05). Age, marital status, having children and living alone or with others, tobacco use and anxiety about going to the hospital during the pandemic did not affect on fear of COVID-19 (pÃ‚Â &gt;Ã‚Â .05).

"Tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19: predictors and clinical features","Around 20% of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 need mechanical ventilation (MV). MV may be prolonged, thus warranting tracheostomy. Observational cohort study enrolling patients admitted due to COVID-19. Demographic and clinical data at hospital and ICU admission were collected. The primary endpoint was to identify parameters associated with a need for tracheostomy; secondary endpoints were to analyze the clinical course of patients who needed tracheostomy. 118 patients were enrolled; 37 patients (31.5%) were transferred to ICU, of which 11 (29.72%) needed a tracheostomy due to prolonged MV. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score at ICU admission (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.47-0.92, p 0.015) was the only variable found to be associated with increased risk of the need for tracheostomy, with a cut-off point of 4.5 (sensitivity 0.72, specificity 0.73, positive predictive value 0.57 and negative predictive value 0.85).

"Medical Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic","All aspects of medical education were affected by the Novel Coronavirus Infectious Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. Several challenges were experienced by trainees and programs alike due to the economic repercussions of the pandemic, how social distancing affected the delivery of medical education, testing and interviewing, how the surge of patients affected redeployment of personnel, potential compromise in core training and the overall impact on the wellness and mental health of trainees and educators. The ability of medical teams and researchers to peer review, conduct clinical research and keep up with literature was similarly challenged by the rapid growth in peer-review and pre-print literature. We review these challenges and share strategies that institutions, educators and learners adopted, adapted and developed to provide quality education during these unprecedented times.","Kaul, Gallo de Moraes, Khateeb, Greenstein, Winter, Chae, Stewart, Qadir, Dangayach","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2020.12.026","20210103","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-04","",8878,""
"Change in Physical Activity During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Lockdown in Norway: The Buffering Effect of Resilience on Mental Health","Imposition of lockdown restrictions during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was sudden and unprecedented and dramatically changed the life of many people, as they were confined to their homes with reduced movement and access to fitness training facilities. Studies have reported significant associations between physical inactivity, sedentary behavior, and common mental health problems. This study investigated relations between participants' reports of change in physical activity (PA; i.e., Reduced PA, Unchanged PA, or Increased PA) and levels of anxiety and depression symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in Norway in the time period from March 12, 2020 to June 15, 2020. The relations between age and gender and levels of anxiety and depression symptoms as well as how different levels of resilience influenced the relation between changes in PA and levels of anxiety and depression symptoms were also investigated. A cross-sectional survey design was used. Participants (<i>N</i> = 1,314; females = 31%) were members of an endurance sports organization aged between 18 and 81 years (<i>M</i> = 49 years; <i>SD</i> = 11.50 years). Participants completed the Resilience Scale for Adults and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and reported their changes in PA after lockdown restrictions were implemented on March 12, 2020. Regression analysis, independent samples <i>t</i>-test, and two-way multivariate analysis of variance were conducted. Reduced PA was associated with a higher risk of anxiety and depression symptoms. Younger participants in Reduced PA and Unchanged PA subgroups scored significantly higher on levels of anxiety symptoms and significantly higher on depression symptoms in Unchanged PA subgroup. Females in Unchanged PA and Increased PA subgroups scored significantly higher on levels of anxiety symptoms, whereas no gender differences were found for depression symptoms. The main and interaction effects of change in PA and resilience were significantly associated with depression symptoms. For anxiety symptoms, only the main effect of resilience, but not PA, and the interaction effect were significant. Results further showed that resilience was an important factor that influenced the levels of change in PA. High levels of resilience were associated with lower anxiety and depression symptoms in Reduced, Unchanged, and Increased PA subgroups during the COVID-19 lockdown. Promoting PA while boosting resilience factors such as confidence in own ability and drawing on the social support of even reduced social networks or connections while under lockdown can protect against common mental health problems.","Anyan, Hjemdal, Ernstsen, Havnen","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.598481","20210102","COVID-19; age; anxiety and depression symptoms; confinement; gender; physical activity; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-04","",8879,""
"Depressive Symptoms, Anxiety Disorder, and Suicide Risk During the COVID-19 Pandemic","This study reviews the existing literature on psychiatric interventions for individuals affected by the COVID-19 epidemic. My article cumulates previous research on how extreme stressors associated with COVID-19 may aggravate or cause psychiatric problems. The unpredictability of the COVID-19 epidemic progression may result in significant psychological pressure on vulnerable populations. Persons with psychiatric illnesses may experience worsening symptoms or may develop an altered mental state related to an increased suicide risk. The inspected findings prove that psychological intervention measures for patients affected by the epidemic should be designed and personalized adequately. Preventive measures seek to decrease infection rates and cut down the risk of the public healthcare system to eventually be overburdened. Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, people with psychiatric illnesses may confront a decrease in mental health services. As limitations in the current review, by focusing only on articles published in journals indexed in Web of Science, Scopus, and ProQuest, I inevitably disregarded other valuable sources. Subsequent research directions should clarify the effectiveness of online mental health services in providing remote psychiatric interventions to individuals affected by the COVID-19 epidemic.","Pera","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.572699","20210102","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; suicide; symptom","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-04","",8880,""
"Acceleration of Anxiety, Depression, and Suicide: Secondary Effects of Economic Disruption Related to COVID-19","The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has contributed to increasing levels of anxiety, depression and other symptoms of stress around the globe. Reasons for this increase are understandable in the context of individual level factors such as self-isolation, lockdown, grief, survivor guilt, and other factors but also broader social and economic factors such as unemployment, insecure employment and resulting poverty, especially as the impacts of 2008 recession are still being felt in many countries further accompanied by social isolation. For those who are actively employed a fear of job and income loss and those who have actually become ill and recovered or those who have lost family and friends to illness, it is not surprising that they are stressed and feeling the psychological impact. Furthermore, multiple uncertainties contribute to this sense of anxiety. These fears and losses are major immediate stresses and undoubtedly can have long-term implications on mental health. Economic uncertainty combined with a sense of feeling trapped and resulting lack of control can contribute to helplessness and hopelessness where people may see suicide as a way out. Taking a macro view, we present a statistical model of the impact of unemployment, and national income declines, on suicide, separately for males and females over the life cycle in developed countries. This impact may reflect a potent combination of social changes and economic factors resulting in anomie. The governments and policymakers have a moral and ethical obligation to ensure the physical health and well-being of their populations. While setting in place preventive measures to avoid infections and then subsequent mortality, the focus on economic and social recovery is crucial. A global pandemic requires a global response with a clear inter-linked strategy for health as well as economic solutions. The models we have constructed represent predictions of suicide rates among the 38 highly industrialized OECD countries over a period of 18 years (2000-2017). Unemployment has a major effect on increasing suicide, especially in middle-aged groups. However, the impact of economic decline through losses of national income (GDP per capita) are substantially greater than those of unemployment and influence suicide throughout the life course, especially at the oldest ages.","Brenner, Bhugra","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.592467","20210102","COVID-19; Great Recession; depression; economy; national income loss; recession; suicide; unemployment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-04","",8881,""
"Insomnia in the Italian Population During Covid-19 Outbreak: A Snapshot on One Major Risk Factor for Depression and Anxiety","<b>Objectives:</b> One of the largest clusters of Covid-19 infections was observed in Italy. The population was forced to home confinement, exposing individuals to increased risk for insomnia, which is, in turn, associated with depression and anxiety. Through a cross-sectional online survey targeting all Italian adult population (Ã¢â€°Â¥18 yrs), insomnia prevalence and its interactions with relevant factors were investigated. <b>Methods:</b> The survey was distributed from 1st April to 4th May 2020. We collected information on insomnia severity, depression, anxiety, sleep hygiene behaviors, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, circadian preference, emotion regulation, cognitive flexibility, perceived stress, health habits, self-report of mental disorders, and variables related to individual difference in life changes due to the pandemic's outbreak. <b>Results:</b> The final sample comprised 1,989 persons (38.4 Ã‚Â± 12.8 yrs). Prevalence of clinical insomnia was 18.6%. Results from multivariable linear regression showed that insomnia severity was associated with poor sleep hygiene behaviors [ÃŽÂ² = 0.11, 95% CI (0.07-0.14)]; dysfunctional beliefs about sleep [ÃŽÂ² = 0.09, 95% CI (0.08-0.11)]; self-reported mental disorder [ÃŽÂ² = 2.51, 95% CI (1.8-3.1)]; anxiety [ÃŽÂ² = 0.33, 95% CI (0.25-0.42)]; and depression [ÃŽÂ² = 0.24, 95% CI (0.16-0.32)] symptoms. <b>Conclusion:</b> An alarming high prevalence of clinical insomnia was observed.

"#Everything Will Be Fine Duration of Home Confinement and &quot;All-or-Nothing&quot; Cognitive Thinking Style as Predictors of Traumatic Distress in Young University Students on a Digital Platform During the COVID-19 Italian Lockdown","On March 10, 2020, Italy announced its lockdown caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, and home confinement exposed individuals to a stressful situation of unknown duration. Our study aimed to analyze the emotional and cognitive experiences and the psychopathological symptoms of young Italian University students seeking help from our University student Counseling and Consultation Service during the COVID-19 lockdown. Also, our study aimed to identify the predictors of traumatic psychological distress, investigating variables that could influence the students' well-being, related to their socio-demographic and clinical condition, to the &quot;exposition&quot; to the social distancing, and related to their cognitive thinking style. One-hundred and three University students were included in our study. The traumatic impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). A digital platform was used in our study, focused on narrative dimensions analyses. Our results showed that 21.4% of our help-seeking students experienced lockdown as a traumatic experience. The main stressful factors reported by students were: adjustment to the new academic activities (23.3 %), lack of autonomy (19.4%), and conflicts with family members (6.8%). The three main areas impaired were: changes in the sleeping pattern (68%), difficulty in concentration (67%), and loss of energy (58.6%). Furthermore, 36% of our student sample reported being suffering from anxiety symptoms, whereas 26% showed depressive symptomatology. Students having previous psychological and psychiatric contacts with mental health services (23%) showed a more severe traumatic and depressive symptomatology. The problematic thinking style &quot;all or nothing&quot; was predominantly associated with psychological distress, anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic symptoms. &quot;Everything Will Be Fine&quot; could be identified by the &quot;optimistic style&quot; (27.2%), inversely correlated with the psychopathological measures and concentration problems. The results of the logistic regression analysis indicated that the length of home confinement (second month) seemed to increase by over 3 times the likelihood of experience posttraumatic symptomatology, and a thinking style &quot;all or nothing&quot; was the final strongest predictor increasing the risk by over 5 times. The implementation of psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable young subgroups to contain the structuring of psychopathological profiles represent a fundamental challenge.","Giusti, Salza, Mammarella, Bianco, Ussorio, Casacchia, Roncone","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.574812","20210102","COVID-19 outbreak; digital platform; narrative psychiatry; online psychological intervention; predictors; thinking styles; traumatic impact; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-04","",8883,""
"The Psychological Pressures of Breast Cancer Patients During the COVID-19 Outbreak in China-A Comparison With Frontline Female Nurses","<b>Objective:</b> During the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in China, breast cancer (BC) patients and healthcare workers faced several challenges, resulting in great psychological stress. We measured the psychological status of BC patients and female nurses and compared the severity within the two groups at the peak time-point of the COVID-19 outbreak. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 207 BC patients and 684 female nurses were recruited from Wuhan. They completed an anonymous questionnaire online using the most popular social media software in China, WeChat. The psychological status of BC patients and of female nurses was measured using the Chinese versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) for evaluation of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The differences between the two groups were analyzed. <b>Results:</b> The scores of BC patients and frontline female nurses for the four scales were significantly higher than those of non-frontline female nurses (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). There were similar scores between BC patients and frontline female nurses for PHQ-9, GAD-7, and IES-R (<i>P</i> = 0.789, <i>P</i> = 0.101, <i>P</i> = 0.158, respectively). Notably, the scores of BC patients for ISI were significantly higher than those of the frontline female nurses (<i>P</i> = 0.016). A considerable proportion of BC patients reported symptoms of depression (106/207, 51.2%), anxiety (130/207, 62.8%), insomnia (106/207, 51.2%), and PTSD (73/207, 35.5%), which was more severe than that of female nurses. <b>Conclusions:</b> BC patients experienced great psychological pressure during the COVID-19 outbreak. The incidents of symptomatic anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, and PTSD were significantly comparable to that of frontline female nurses, and episodes of insomnia among BC participants were more serious than for frontline female nurses.","Cui, Cai, Li, Liu, Sun, Chen, Wang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.559701","20210102","COVID-19; anxiety; breast cancer; depression; female nurses; insomnia; post-traumatic stress disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-04","",8884,""
"Epidemic area contact history and sleep quality associated with posttraumatic stress symptoms in the first phase of COVID-19 outbreak in China","The impact of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak on mental health was of widespread concern recently. The present study aimed to exam sleep quality and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and potential influence factors in the first phases of COVID-19 massive outbreak in China. A snowball sampling technique was used and a total of 2027 Chinese participated in the present study. Demographic information, epidemic area contact history, sleep quality and PTSS data were collected with an internet-based cross-sectional survey. Results suggested that 59.7% participants were not fully satisfied with their sleep quality, and 50.9% participants had various degrees of short sleep duration problems. 44.1% and 33.0% participants had sleep disturbance and sleep onset latency problems. Also, the prevalence of PTSS reached 4.7% in the self-rating survey. Epidemic area contact history affected PTSS and latency onset of sleep under the influence of COVID-19. Epidemic area contact history and sleep quality had interaction effects on PTSS. The present study was one of the first to evaluate acute psychological responses and possible risk factors during the peak of COVID-19 in China and results indicate that keeping good sleep quality in individuals with pandemic exposure experiences is a way to prevent PTSS.","Zhang, Shang, Ma, Jia, Sun, Guo, Wu, Sun, Zhou, Wang, Liu, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-80649-8","20210103","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-04","",8885,""
"Depressive symptoms in response to COVID-19 and lockdown: a cross-sectional study on the Italian population","The COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown orders adopted to prevent the spread of the disease had a huge impact on a personal, social, and economic level for the world population. In Europe, Italy was one of the frontrunner countries dealing with an emergency that significantly affected people's lives. Previous research on the psychological impact of the pandemic revealed an increase in anxiety, depression, and feelings of distress; however, these studies were conducted on non-representative samples of the population reached through social media channels, a method that is likely to lead to many forms of statistical and methodological bias. For the first time to our knowledge, we assessed the psychological impact of COVID-19 on 6700 Italian individuals, representative of the Italian population in terms of age, gender, and geographical areas revealing higher scores of depressive symptoms in females, younger adults, people reporting professional uncertainty and lower socio-economic status. A positive correlation was also found for individuals living alone, those who could not leave home for going to work, and people with a case of COVID-19 in the family, whereas the region of residence was not a significant predictor of depressive symptoms. These findings underline the importance of considering the psychological effects of COVID-19 and providing support to individuals seeking mental health care.","Delmastro, Zamariola","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-79850-6","20210102","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-04","",8886,""
"Measuring the Outcomes of Maternal COVID-19-related Prenatal Exposure (MOM-COPE): study protocol for a multicentric longitudinal project","COVID-19 is a highly infectious respiratory disease that rapidly emerged as an unprecedented epidemic in Europe, with a primary hotspot in Northern Italy during the first months of 2020. Its high infection rate and rapid spread contribute to set the risk for relevant psychological stress in citizens. In this context, mother-infant health is at risk not only because of potential direct exposure to the virus but also due to high levels of stress experienced by mothers from conception to delivery. Prenatal stress exposure associates with less-than-optimal child developmental outcomes, and specific epigenetic mechanisms (eg, DNA methylation) may play a critical role in mediating this programming association. We present the methodological protocol for a longitudinal, multicentric study on the behavioural and epigenetic effects of COVID-19-related prenatal stress in a cohort of mother-infant dyads in Northern Italy. The dyads will be enrolled at 10 facilities in Northern Italy. Saliva samples will be collected at birth to assess the methylation status of specific genes linked with stress regulation in mothers and newborns. Mothers will provide retrospective data on COVID-19-related stress during pregnancy. At 3, 6 and 12 months, mothers will provide data on child behavioural and socioemotional outcomes, their own psychological status (stress, depressive and anxious symptoms) and coping strategies. At 12 months, infants and mothers will be videotaped during semistructured interaction to assess maternal sensitivity and infant's relational functioning.

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and well-being of communities: an exploratory qualitative study protocol","The COVID-19 pandemic has certainly resulted in an increased level of anxiety and fear in communities in terms of disease management and infection spread. Due to fear and social stigma linked with COVID-19, many individuals in the community hide their disease and do not access healthcare facilities in a timely manner. In addition, with the widespread use of social media, rumours, myths and inaccurate information about the virus are spreading rapidly, leading to intensified irritability, fearfulness, insomnia, oppositional behaviours and somatic complaints. Considering the relevance of all these factors, we aim to explore the perceptions and attitudes of community members towards COVID-19 and its impact on their daily lives and mental well-being.

"Perceptions and Experiences of the University of Nottingham Pilot SARS-CoV-2 Asymptomatic Testing Service: A Mixed-Methods Study","We aimed to explore student and staff perceptions and experiences of a pilot SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic testing service (P-ATS) in a UK university campus setting. This was a mixed-method study comprised of an online survey, and thematic analysis of qualitative data from interviews and focus groups conducted at the mid-point and end of the 12-week P-ATS programme. Ninety-nine students (84.8% female, 70% first year; 93.9% P-ATS participants) completed an online survey, 41 individuals attended interviews or focus groups, including 31 students (21 first year; 10 final year) and 10 staff. All types of testing and logistics were highly acceptable (<i>virus</i>: swab, saliva; <i>antibody</i>: finger prick) and 94.9% would participate again. Reported adherence to weekly virus testing was high (92.4% completed Ã¢â€°Â¥6 tests; 70.8% submitted all 10 swabs; 89.2% completed Ã¢â€°Â¥1 saliva sample) and 76.9% submitted Ã¢â€°Â¥3 blood samples. Students tested to &quot;keep campus safe&quot;, &quot;contribute to national efforts to control COVID-19&quot;, and &quot;protect others&quot;. In total, 31.3% had high anxiety as measured by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) (27.1% of first year). Students with lower levels of anxiety and greater satisfaction with university communications around P-ATS were more likely to adhere to virus and antibody tests. Increased adherence to testing was associated with higher perceived risk of COVID-19 to self and others. Qualitative findings revealed 5 themes and 13 sub-themes: &quot;emotional responses to COVID-19&quot;, &quot;university life during COVID-19&quot;, &quot;influences on testing participation&quot;, &quot;testing physical and logistical factors&quot; and &quot;testing effects on mental wellbeing&quot;. Asymptomatic COVID-19 testing (SARS-CoV-2 virus/antibodies) is highly acceptable to students and staff in a university campus setting. Clear communications and strategies to reduce anxiety are likely to be important for testing uptake and adherence.

"Do knowledge and attitudes matter for preventive behavioral practices toward the COVID-19? A cross-sectional online survey among the adult population in Bangladesh","The Government of Bangladesh has adopted several non-therapeutic measures to tackle the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2. However, the curve of COVID-19 positive cases has not significantly flattened yet, as the adoption of preventive measures by the general population is predominantly a behavioral phenomenon that is often influenced by people's knowledge and attitudes. This study aimed to assess the levels of knowledge, attitudes, and preventive behavioral practices toward COVID-19 and their interrelationships among the population of Bangladesh aged 18 years and above. This study adopted a web-based cross-sectional survey design and collected data from 1056 respondents using the online platform Google Form. We employed the independent sample t-test, one-way ANOVA, Pearson's product-moment correlation, and Spearman rank-order correlation to produce the bivariate level statistics. We also run multiple linear and logistic regression models to identify the factors affecting knowledge, attitudes, and preventive behavioral practices toward COVID-19. The respondents had an average knowledge score of 17.29 (Standard Deviation (SD) = 3.30). The average score for attitude scale toward COVID-19 was 13.6 (SD = 3.7). The respondents had excellent preventive behavioral practices toward COVID-19 (mean 7.7, SD = 0.72). However, this study found that knowledge and attitudes did not matter for preventive behavioral practices toward COVID-19. Instead, education appeared as a sole predictor for preventive behavioral practices toward COVID-19; that means preventive behavioral practices toward COVID-19 was lower among the less educated respondents. This study suggests increasing education as a long-term strategy and taking immediate action to increase knowledge and decrease negative attitudes toward COVID-19 through targeted health education initiatives as a short-term strategy.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05799","20201201","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-04","",8891,""

"The Social and Psychological Changes of the First Months of COVID-19","The initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the lives of people across the globe. The current research sought to understand how the pandemic affected peopleâ€™s social and psychological states during the first three months after the first U.S. death was reported. How did peopleâ€™s emotions, thought patterns, and social lives change as the pandemic unfolded? The Reddit language of 200,000+ people across 18 cities in the U.S. was analyzed along with surveys from 11,000+ people in the U.S. and Canada. Overall, large psychological shifts were found that reflected three distinct phases. As the first COVID warnings emerged but prior to the shelter-in-place directives, peopleâ€™s attentional focus switched to the impending threat. Anxiety levels surged, and positive emotion and anger dropped. In parallel, peopleâ€™s thinking became more immediate and intuitive rather than analytic. When cities began lockdowns, anxiety levels spiked and sadness increased, and language shifted in ways that revealed peopleâ€™s attempts to make sense of the situation. Six weeks after the onset, peopleâ€™s psychological states stabilized but the COVID-produced changes had not abated. Converging evidence from survey responses and natural language analysis indicated that peopleâ€™s ties with family strengthened but that social ties to broader groups (friends, city, and country) weakened. The psychological shifts were amplified on days when the countryâ€™s and citiesâ€™ COVID infection growth rates were higher, marking the link between the pandemic and the observed psychological patterns. Together, the study underscores the large psychological impacts across the country during the first three months of the crisis.","Ashwini Ashokkumar et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460EE-872-756","20210103","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Well-being; temporal change; language; pandemic; epidemic; collective upheaval; covid-19; covid","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-04","",8893,""

Our study is based on two online surveys of 2195 HCWs from different regions of Russia during spring and autumn epidemic outbreaks revealed the rates of anxiety, stress, depression, emotional exhaustion and depersonalization and perceived stress as 32.3%, 31.1%, 45.5%, 74.2%, 37.7% ,67.8%, respectively. Moreover, 2.4% of HCWs reported suicidal thoughts. The most common risk factors include: female gender, nurse as an occupation, younger age, working for over 6 months, chronic diseases, smoking, high working demands, lack of personal protective equipment, low salary, lack of social support, isolation from families, the fear of relatives getting infected. These results demonstrate the need for urgent supportive programs for HCWs fighting COVID-19 that fall into higher risk factors groups.","Ekaterina Mosolova et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46230-990-0D6","20210102","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; suicide; health care workers; covid-19; burnout; anxiety; stress; depression","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-04","",8894,""
