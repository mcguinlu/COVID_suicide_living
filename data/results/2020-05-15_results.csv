"Anxiety, depression, attitudes, and internet addiction during the initial phase of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic: A cross-sectional study in Mexico","Abstract Objectives: To describe the prevalence and distribution of anxiety and depression among Mexican population, and to examine its association with internet addiction during the COVID-19 outbreak. Design: A web-based cross-sectional study. Setting: General population in Mexico. Participants: 561 subjects were recruited (71% female, mean age of was 30.7 {+/-} 10.6 years). Interventions: An online survey to assess personal attitudes and perceptions towards COVID-19, sleep-disorders related, the Mexican version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Internet Addiction Test (IAT) was applied. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Prevalence of anxiety, depression, internet addiction and sleep disorders and associated factors. Also, prevalence for anxiety and depression were compared to an historic control group. Results: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic the prevalence for anxiety and depression was 50% (95% CI, 45.6% to 54.1%) and 27.6%, (95% CI 23.8% to 31.4%), respectively. We found a 51% (33% to 50%) increase in anxiety and up to 86% increase in depression uring the initial weeks of the lock-down compared to the control group. According to the IAT questionnaire, 62.7% (95% CI 58.6% to 68.8%) of our population had some degree of internet addiction. Odds ratio for development of anxiety symptoms was 2.02 (95% CI1.56-2.1, p=0.0001) and for depression was 2.15 (95% CI 1.59-2.9, p=0.0001). In the multivariate analysis, younger age (p=0.006), sleep problems (p=0.000), and internet addiction ( p=0.000) were associated with anxiety and depression. Conclusions: Our study provides valuable information on the psychological impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the Mexican population. As in other parts of the globe, in Mexico, fear of SARS-CoV-2 infection has had devastating consequences on mental health, such as anxiety, depression and sleeping disturbances. Internet abuse and the consequent overexposure to rapidly spreading misinformation (infodemia) are associated to anxiety and depression.","Garcia-Priego, B. A.; Triana-Romero, A.; Pinto-Galvez, S.

"Psychological Distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in France: a national assessment of at-risk populations","Introduction More than 2.5 billion people in the world are currently in lockdowns to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Psychological Distress (PD) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder have been reported after traumatic events, but the specific effect of pandemics is not well known. The aim of this study was to assess PD in France, a country where COVID-19 had such a dramatic impact that it required a country-wide lockdown. Patients and methods We recruited patients in 4 groups of chatbot users followed for breast cancer, asthma, depression and migraine. We used the Psychological Distress Index (PDI), a validated scale to measure PD during traumatic events, and correlated PD risk with patients characteristics in order to better identify the one who were the most at-risk. Results The study included 1771 participants. 91.25% (1616) were female with a mean age of 32.8 years (SD=13,71), 7.96% (141) were male with a mean age of 28.0 years (SD=8,14). In total, 38.06% (674) of the respondents had psychological distress (PDI [&ge;]15). An ANOVA analysis showed that sex (p=0.00132), unemployment (p=7.16x10-6) and depression (p=7.49x10-7) were significantly associated with a higher PDI score. Patients using their smartphone or computer more than one hour a day also had a higher PDI score (p=0.02588). Conclusion Prevalence of PD in at-risk patients is high. These patients are also at increased risk to develop Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Specific steps should be implemented to monitor and prevent PD through dedicated mental health policies if we want to limit the public health impact of COVID-19 in time.","Chaix, B.; Delamon, G.; Guillemasse, A.; Brouard, B.; Bibault, J.-E.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.10.20093161v1?rss=1""","20200515","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-15","",1013,""
"Depression and anxiety during 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic in Saudi Arabia: a cross-sectional study","Background: COVID 19 outbreak in 2020 was associated with a high rate of depression and anxiety among individuals in the affected countries. The aim of this study is to explore the influence of the COVID 19 epidemic on the psychological distress of residents of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Methods: A cross sectional study using an online survey was conducted in Saudi Arabia between 27th of March and 27th of April 2020. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ 9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD 7) were used to assess depression and anxiety. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of depression and anxiety. Results: The prevalence of depression and anxiety among the entire study participants was 9.4% and 7.3%, respectively. Non-Saudi residents, aged 50 years and above, divorced, retired, university students, and those with income (2000 to 10,000 RS) were at higher risk of developing depression. Saudi individuals, married, unemployed, and those with high income (> 10,000 RS) were at higher risk of developing anxiety. Conclusions: There is a wide range of the Saudi residents who are at higher risk of mental illness during COVID 19 pandemic. Policymakers and mental healthcare providers are advised to provide continuous monitoring of the psychological consequences during this pandemic, and provide mental support.","Alyami, H.

"A one-year hospital-based prospective CVOID-19 open-cohort in the Eastern Mediterranean region: The Khorshid COVID Cohort (KCC) study","The COVID-19 is rapidly scattering worldwide, and the number of cases in the Eastern Mediterranean Region is rising, there is a need for immediate targeted actions. We designed a longitudinal study in a hot outbreak zone to analyze the serial findings between infected patients for detecting temporal changes from February 2020. In a hospital-based open-cohort study, patients are followed from admission until one year from their discharge (the 1st, 4th, 12th weeks, and the first year). The measurements included demographic, socio-economics, symptoms, health service diagnosis and treatment, contact history, and psychological variables. The signs improvement, death, length of stay in hospital were considered as primary, and impaired pulmonary function and psychotic disorders were considered as main secondary outcomes. Notably, In the last two follow-ups, each patient attends the hospital to complete the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21). Moreover, clinical symptoms and respiratory functions are being determined in such follow-ups. Among the first 600 COVID-19 cases, a total of 490 patients with complete information (39% female; the average age of 57 {+/-} 15 years) were analyzed. Seven percent of these patients died. The three main leading causes of admission were: fever (77%), dry cough (73%), and fatigue (69%). The most prevalent comorbidities between COVID-19 patients were hypertension (35%), diabetes (28%), and ischemic heart disease (14%). The percentage of primary composite endpoints (PCEP), defined as death, the use of mechanical ventilation, or admission to an intensive care unit was 18%. The following comorbidities were significantly different in the positive and negative PCEP groups: acute kidney disease (p=0.008) and diabetes (p=0.026). For signs and symptoms, fatigue (p=0.020) and sore throat (p=0.001) were significantly different. This long-term prospective Cohort may support healthcare professionals in the management of resources following this pandemic.","Sami, R.; Soltaninejad, F.; Amra, B.; Naderi, Z.; Haghjooy Javanmard, S.; Iraj, B.; Haji Ahmadi, S.; Shayganfar, A.; Dehghan, M.; Khademi, N.; Sadat Hosseini, N.; Mortazavi, M.; Mansourian, M.; Mananas, M.
