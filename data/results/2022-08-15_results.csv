"No relationships between self-reported Instagram use or type of use and mental well-being: A study using a nationally representative online sample of UK adults","The effect of using social networking sites (SNSs) on well-being is actively debated both in academic research and in wider society. Instagram has grown rapidly in the last decade, but the effects of Instagram use on well-being are still unclear. The aim of this study was to examine the associations between Instagram use and levels of anxiety, depression and loneliness. An online sample of 498 UK adults were recruited using Prolific. The participants were selected to be nationally representative by age and gender. Age ranged from 19 to 82 years (M = 49.15, SD = 15.53), with 52% female and 47% male. Participants stated whether or not they used Instagram and were asked about their frequency of Broadcast, Interaction and Browsing Instagram use. Participants also completed the Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. A genetic matching algorithm was used to match Instagram users (n= 372) and non-Instagram users (n = 100) on age, gender, education and nationality. There were no significant differences between users versus non-users of Instagram in levels of anxiety, depression or loneliness. There were also no significant associations between type of Instagram use (Broadcast, Interaction or Browsing) and levels of anxiety, depression or loneliness. Overall, these results suggest that for a representative sample of UK adults, there are no significant associations between Instagram use and levels of anxiety, depression or loneliness. This research adds to recent findings suggests that the overall effect of SNSs on well-being may be small to non-existent.","Sam G. B.
