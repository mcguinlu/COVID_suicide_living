"Impact of COVID-19 on mental health according to prior depression status: A mental health survey of community prospective cohort data","Objective We aimed to investigate the mental health impact of COVID-19 on a demographically well-characterized population cohort by gender and previous depression status. Methods Among people who participated in a community cohort study between 2013 and 2018 with previous depression measurement, a total of 1928 people without quarantine experience (680 men and 1249 women) were included after responding to an online survey in March 2020. In the 2020 survey, people were queried about daily needs supply, social support, risk perception, change during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as mental health indices measuring loneliness, anxiety symptoms, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depression. Separate analyses by gender were conducted to assess the association between COVID-19-related experiences and each mental health index, using multivariable logistic regressions with additional adjustment and stratification with pre-existing depression status. Results We could not observe significant gender differences for depression, anxiety, PTSD, and loneliness at 55Â days after the start of the COVID-19 outbreak. Most external support, including daily needs supply and social support, protected men and women from experiencing severe anxiety (for life supply, ORÂ =Â 0.92 (95%CI 0.88â€“0.97) (men) and ORÂ =Â 0.95 (95% CI 0.91â€“0.99) (women); for social support, ORÂ =Â 0.92(both for men and women, pÂ <Â 0.01)). The results were similar for depression and PTSD. External support showed a larger reduction in the likelihoods for anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic among people with pre-existing depression compared to previously healthy people, and it was more prominent in men. Conclusion COVID-19 significantly affected the mental health of both men and women in the early period of the pandemic. Having enough supply of daily needs and social support seems important, especially for people with previous depression.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2021.110552","20210901","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-28","",15365,""
"Application of Deep Learning on Student Engagement in e-learning environments","The drastic impact of COVID-19 pandemic is visible in all aspects of our lives including education. With a distinctive rise in e-learning, teaching methods are being undertaken remotely on digital platforms due to COVID-19. To reduce the effect of this pandemic on the education sector, most of the educational institutions are already conducting online classes. However, to make these digital learning sessions interactive and comparable to the traditional offline classrooms, it is essential to ensure that students are properly engaged during online classes. In this paper, we have presented novel deep learning based algorithms that monitor the studentâ€™s emotions in real-time such as anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. This is done by the proposed novel state-of-the-art algorithms which compute the Mean Engagement Score (MES) by analyzing the obtained results from facial landmark detection, emotional recognition and the weights from a survey conducted on students over an hour-long class. The proposed automated approach will certainly help educational institutions in achieving an improved and innovative digital learning method.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compeleceng.2021.107277","20210701","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-28","",15366,""
