"Child and caregiver mental health during 12 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia: findings from national repeated cross-sectional surveys","BackgroundThere are calls for research into the mental health consequences of living through the COVID-19 pandemic. Australiaâ€™s initial, effective suppression of COVID-19 offers insights into these indirect impacts in the relative absence of the disease. We aimed to describe the mental health experiences of Australian caregivers and children over 12 months, reporting differences related to demographic, socioeconomic and lockdown characteristics.MethodsData were from Australiaâ€™s only nationally representative, repeated cross-sectional survey of caregivers with children (0â€“17 years). N=2020 caregivers participated in June 2020, N=1434 in September 2020 and N=2508 in July 2021. Caregivers reported their mental health (poor vs not, Kessler-6), and perceived impacts of the pandemic on theirs and their childrenâ€™s mental health (negative vs none/positive). Data were weighted to approximate population distributions of caregiver age, gender, sole caregiving, number and ages of children, state/territory and neighbourhood-level disadvantage.ResultsPerceived impacts on mental health were more frequently negative for female (vs male) caregivers and older (vs younger) children. Poor caregiver mental health (Kessler-6) was more common for families experiencing socioeconomic adversity (especially financial), while perceived impacts were more frequently negative for more socially advantaged groups. Caregivers who experienced the least total lockdown reported similar mental health over time. Otherwise, poor mental health and perceived negative impacts increased over time with increasing total length of lockdown.ConclusionDespite Australiaâ€™s low infection rates, the negative mental health experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic are real and concerning. Addressing poor mental health must be central to ongoing pandemic recovery efforts for families and children.","Price, Anna M.

"The cost of intersectionality: Motherhood, mental health, and the state of the country","The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and society's overdue racial awakening (Worland, 2020) have created distinct needs for mothers, especially mothers of Color (MOC) in the United States (US) (Breman etÂ al., 2021;Liu etÂ al., 2021). Prior to the double pandemic (see Addo, 2020), expectations that mothers devote themselves entirely to their children may support increases in mental health symptomology within this population (Rahman etÂ al., 2013). Based on systemic inequities that reside at the foundation of many institutions (e.g., healthcare, law, education) within the US, MOC experience increased worry, anxiety, stress, and fear during the double pandemic (Liu etÂ al., 2021). In addition, MOC engage in mothering practices (e.g., racial socialization) that are unique to raising children who identify as Black, Indigenous, and Persons of Color (BIPOC) (Hughes & Chen etÂ al., 1997). Based on these facts, the authors investigate the sociocultural forces that impact MOC's mental health during the context of the double pandemic through a review of existent literature on this topic. The authorsâ€™ analysis and incorporation of intersectionality theory and Black feminist thought uncovers the ways in which these forces may influence the experiences of MOC. Finally, the authors utilize an intersectional-based policy analysis framework (Hankivsky etÂ al., 2014) to provide recommendations for social policy, education and training, and directions for future research. These recommendations acknowledge the influence of power and privilege in the US while building upon the protective factors that support MOC.

"Allowing Access to Parents into COVID-19 Hospitalization Areas Does Not Increase Infections among Hospital Workers in a Pediatric Hospital","Background At the beginning of the current COVID-19 pandemic, it became critical to isolate all infected patients, regardless of their age. In the case of hospitalized children, isolation imposes a significant, negative impact on the well-being of isolated infants and their parents, in addition to the deleterious effect that the clinical condition and hospitalization by itself inflicts on patients and their families;this negative effect must be weighed against the potential risk that visitation might have on COVID-19 dissemination, mostly among hospital workers. Method Parents were gradually allowed during supervised, restricted visit time, progressively increasing the visitation time, and carefully monitoring for the presence of COVID-19 symptoms among healthcare workers (HCW) in the COVID-19 area, who were also tested for the infection when clinically justified. Family members were interrogated about symptoms and signs suggestive of COVID-19 infection, or positive PCR testing within 14 days of hospital stay. Results We found that, when safely implemented, allowing parents to spend time with their hospitalized COVID-19 children does not increase the contagion risk for hospital workers. The percentage of COVID-19 cases among HCW decreased after parents were allowed to visit their children in the COVID-19 areas. The percentage dropped from 27.78% to 12.77% (p=0.022). The rate of workers with COVID-19 for every 1000 shifts per worker was reduced after the parents were allowed to visit, although no statistically significant differences were found. Only 6 out of 129 parents (4.65%), that visited their children, were infected and there is no guarantee that they got infected within the hospital. Conclusion With proper training, parents do not increase the risk of infection among healthcare workers or among themselves. To develop and implement policies to permit the children to be accompanied during their suffering should be a standard in the context of an epidemic and out of it.","Guerrero-DÃ­az, Ana Carmen","https://doi.org/10.1093/jpids/piac041.032","","Database: CINAHL; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society; 11:S9-S9, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36198,""
"Anxiety and the Onset of COVID-19: Examining Concerns of Historically Excluded Scholars","The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic increased uncertainty, leading to questions about how it spread, how long it would last, and its long-term effects. In academia, many scholars worried about their positions and career advancement. Our research focuses on how different groups within academia coped during the initial period of the pandemic, with particular attention paid to the role of anxiety. We argue that vulnerable groups, such as historically excluded individuals, graduate students, and women, felt even higher levels of anxiety. We use original survey data collected from international relations and political science scholars during May 2020. We content analyze open-ended responses to illustrate the impacts of the pandemic on our participants' work life, including research productivity, the job market, promotion, and tenure. These analyses reveal not only what different groups of scholars are concerned about, but also the different ways in which they discuss the pandemic. Our research aims to highlight the social and mental health effects of the pandemic, with an eye toward addressing inequalities in academia.

"Introducing the Scale of Perceived Affect Response to Online Worship (SPAROW): a psychometric assessment of ritual innovation during the pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic led to an increase in the use of online platforms for Christian worship and emphasised the need for a simple psychometric instrument that is sufficiently general to assess affect responses to a range worship services. This paper reports on the development of the six-item Scale of Perceived Affect Response to Online Worship (SPAROW) during the third UK pandemic lockdown in 2021. The scale items were included in an online survey completed from January to July 2021 by 2,017 Anglicans living in England and 1713 Roman Catholics from the UK or the Republic of Ireland. Exploratory Factor Analysis (principal components extraction and varimax rotation) in the Anglican sample indicated a single-dimensional scale that had excellent internal consistency reliability for those who accessed pre-recorded services (a = .90, n = 1238) and live-streamed services (a = .91, n = 1492). Confirmatory Factor Analysis on the Roman Catholic sample using a Structural Equation Model showed a good fit to a single-dimensional scale.

"Nonverbal immediacy cues and impression formation in video therapy","The increased use of video-mediated communication (VMC) due to the COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread acceptance of mediated healthcare appointments. Mental health care is one area in which researchers might examine the effects of VMC. Therefore, the current study employed an experiment to test the relative influence of video therapistsâ€™ eye contact and gesture on a patient. Each participant was assigned to one of the four possible video conditions using a 2 (Gestures present versus absent) x 2 (Eye contact present versus absent) factorial design. Study participants (n=Â 359) rated actors portraying themselves as video therapists on items related to impression formation (i.e. likable, warm, understanding). Findings suggest that participants in the eye contact condition reported more positive impressions than in the no eye contact condition. Similarly, participants in the gesture condition reported more positive impressions than in the no gesture condition. However, gestures had a larger effect on impression formation than eye contact, and there was no interaction effect considering the combined impact of gestures and eye contact. These results contribute to understanding how nonverbal cues impact health outcomes in VMC. .

"Understanding a young adult diabetes service's accessibility: have virtual appointments helped?","Diabetes mellitus is characterised by hyperglycaemia, requiring strict management regimens to avoid associated health complications. Diagnosis and/or management of diabetes during young adulthood can be particularly challenging, potentially contributing to significant psychological distress and struggles with management, culminating in poor physical and mental health outcomes.This service evaluation sought feedback from young adult patients (19â€“25 years old) on diabetes service accessibility and to understand the impact of offering virtual appointments during the COVID-19 pandemic.All young adult patients (n=101) were invited to complete an online questionnaire about their experience of service accessibility and offered the opportunity to discuss their feedback in a telephone interview. Data were collected from 15 patients.Analysis using content and thematic analyses revealed three main themes regarding service accessibility: practical barriers, psychological barriers, and patientsâ€™ relationship with the diabetes team.Recommendations are made for several service developments concerning appointment scheduling, appointment set-up, and developments around service provision more widely. Further research is needed to gain a wider range of feedback to inform future developments and should prioritise patient involvement to increase patient response rate.

"FACTORS DETERMINING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE HEALTH CARE IN THE FACE OF A PANDEMIC","The COVID-19 pandemic quickly covered the entire world. Over the course of two years, millions of people have been sick and dying as a result of mutated variants of coronavirus infection. Despite the fluctuating rates of hospitalized patients in the country, an alarming fact remains the increasing number of sick medical professionals. Daily faced with the challenge of making adequate and timely care of a high standard, they have to be able to cope with the resulting problems of emotional experiences due to increased mortality. The aim of this study is to identify the main factors determining the effectiveness of care provided, as well as their impact on the psycho-emotional state of health care professionals in pandemic conditions. Material and methods: An anonymous survey of 152 health care professionals was conducted on the territory of Sofia between February and May 2021. The demographic characteristics of the surveyed persons provide information about age, marital status/cohabitation, dependent people, work experience and experience in the treatment of infection. According to 71.71% of specialists, the shortage of nurses is a factor in the effectiveness of care, and fear for health (76.97%) and uncertainty for loved ones (68.42%) are the most reported negative emotions affecting the work process. Conclusion: An early assessment of the mental resilience of pandemic professionals should determine the level of their moral and emotional stability. Timely psychological support can be a major resource for preventing or alleviating post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression among healthcare professionals.

"Psychological impact of COVID-19 on mental health and life quality in healthy individuals: a review","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its complications have spread throughout the world. The overall mortality rate appears to be similar to the pandemic flu. As a result of the worldwide spread of the COVID-19 epidemic, which was triggered by a coronavirus infection that caused an acute respiratory disease (SARS-CoV-2) in the Chinese city of Wuhan, a socioeconomic disaster and significant psychological suffering occurred. During the COVID-19 crisis, several psychological disorders and serious psychological effects, such as stress, depression, anguish, and anxiety, progressively evolved. This review examines some of the existing research on the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of the general population. A comprehensive assessment of scientific articles on the psychological impact of COVID-19 on mental health outcomes was conducted. The roles of risk and preventative factors in susceptible people's productivity to acquire developmental disorders, as well as the many elements of behavior related to the COVID-19 pandemic, have also been investigated. This review evaluates some of the existing research findings on the impact of COVID-19 disease on the mental health of the general population. COVID-19 isolation has long been recognized as one of the most significant emotional responses to a COVID-19 pandemic among the general public.

"Challenges and opportunities in the provision of mental health care services during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond","The provision of services to people with mental health problems and their families has been substantially affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Often face-to-face clinical work had to be replaced with telehealth, in line with COVID-19 regulations of social distancing. Currently, different types of online services have been implemented to meet the mental health needs of the population. This change from face-to-face to online service provision has been disruptive to many South Africans and at times resulted in people not being able to access these services. Aim: This chapter aims to describe specifically the use of online psychological service delivery pre-COVID-19 and during the lockdown. Method: We conducted a literature review exploring the delivery of psychological services through online channels pre-COVID-19 and during the lockdown. We highlight lessons learned and opportunities for psychological service provision beyond the pandemic. Conclusion: We conclude that online service platforms can increase access to psychological services and identify strategies that can be adopted to strengthen service provision.","Ngcobo-Sithole, Magnolia B.; Mabusela, Thabisa E.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Challenges+and+opportunities+in+the+provision+of+mental+health+care+services+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic+and+beyond","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Lessons from COVID-19;: 241-262, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36210,""
"Solidarity, not charity: Learning the lessons of the COVID-19 pandemic to reconceptualise the radicality of mutual aid","The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly ruptured our global society. We have seen health care systems, governments and commerce buckle under the strain of disease, lockdowns and unrest, but the rupture has also created space for radical (and anarchist) politics of mutual aid, as societal organising principles, to move into a more prominent position (and offers potential for this shift to remain after the crisis has subsided). However, in the short time since mutual aid has been thrust into the limelight, we have seen a multiplicity and spectrum of geographies, applications and approaches. Indeed, we have also seen its appropriation by government(s) that takes advantage of mutual aid's rallying cry of â€œsolidarity not charityâ€;absolving the state's responsibilities to sufficiently fund social welfare when good neighbours will do it for free. In this paper we map out how mutual aid has been enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic by charity, contributory and radical groups to address specific and novel forms of vulnerabilities, and the opportunities and challenges this offers for the future. In particular we highlight potential tensions between the enacting of mutual aid practices and the political activism (or not) of the mutual aid actors. Our contribution is to reconceptualise mutual aid to (i) show where the real â€œmutualismâ€ of mutual aid is, and (ii) create a better understanding of how mutual aid can be mobilised in future emergencies which will inevitably arise in the current climate emergency. This paper maps out how mutual aid has been enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic by charity, contributory and radical groups;but brings this together with a specific understanding of vulnerability as a site of possibility rather than passivity to forward a reconceptualisation of mutual aid that is based far more on solidarity, than charity.","Mould, Oli, Cole, Jennifer, Badger, Adam, Brown, Philip","https://www.google.com/search?q=Solidarity,+not+charity:+Learning+the+lessons+of+the+COVID-19+pandemic+to+reconceptualise+the+radicality+of+mutual+aid","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Transactions (Institute of British Geographers : 1965);2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36211,""
"Elucidating Impacts, Navigating the New Normal in a Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic and its Delta, Omicron, Deltacron, and additional variants have upended reality and transformed society. Since tracking began in March 2020 through April 2022, there have been 80,476,479 COVID-19 cases and 986,123 deaths (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (2022b)). From the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers and health experts (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (2022a,c)) named older populations and those with underlying medical conditions at increased risk for severity of COVID-19 and death but stopped short of acknowledging the racial and the ethnic disparities in those populations. According to Gawthrop at the AMP Research Lab, White people died from COVID-19 at a rate of 1:319 or 313 deaths per 100,000 people and Black people died from COVID-19 at a rate of 1:303 or 330 deaths per 100,000 people.

"A Survey of Survival Status of 601 Hemophilia Patients in Guangdong Region during COVID-19 Pandemic: Investigation and Implications","Objective:Investigation the survival status of patients with hemophilia in Guangdong during the COVID-19 pandemic, and exploring the effectiveness of coping strategies to provide some experience and inspiration for the management of rare chronic diseases such as hemophilia during public health emergencies. Methods:Retrospective analysis of the disease characteristics, lifestyle, treatment, psychological, EQ-5D life quality assessment, as well as participation and effectiveness of local response measure participation and effectiveness of 601 cases of hemophiliac patients in Guangdong area before and after the COVID-19 pandemic (October 23, 2019 to April 22, 2020). Results:The 601 patients were all males, Including 22.46% patients under 6 years old, 22.96% among 7-12 years old, 13.98% among 13-20 years old , 40.44% among 21-60 years old and 0.17% over 60 years old. Hemophilia A accounted for 86.52% (520 cases) and hemophilia B 13.48% (81 cases). There were 352 cases (58.57%) of severe hemophilia (F<U+2167>&lt;1%), 219 cases (36.44%) of medium (F<U+2167> 1~5%), 17 cases (2.83%) of 13 cases (F<U+2167> 5~40%), and 13 cases (F<U+2167> 2.16%) is not clear. There were 50 patients had inhibitors. Before the COVID-19 epidemic, 54.58% of the patients had been working or studying at home for a long time. During the epidemic, the patientâ€™s outing activities decreased. During the 3 months of the epidemic, the frequency of hospital visit was 3.40Â±4.09 times per month, which was significantly lower than 4.14Â±4.05 times per month in the 3 months before the epidemic (P=0.000)<U+3002>6.00Â±8.34 clinical bleeding events developed during 3 months of the epidemic, which is significantly increased from 5.47Â±8.09 times 3 months before the epidemic (P=0.000). The patientâ€™s self-assessment score about healthy decreased significantly (70.67Â±23.76 points vs 75.01Â±22.28 points,P=0.000). 74.71% of patients were able to maintain the original treatment, the changes in treatment were generally different (P=0.030), and 152 patients switched treatments. Only 34 (5.66%) patients often develop symptoms of anxiety. In the EQ-5D assessment, the proportions with no difficulty in mobility, self-care, and daily life were 55.57%, 73.88%, and 56.57%;the proportions without pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression were 35.27% and 44.26%, the proportion of patients with difficulty and severe pain and anxiety is not high. Regarding the participation of our response measures, 34.28~48.25% patients chose to use the â€œnetwork platformâ€ for diagnosis and treatment, and the number of patients increased significantly during the epidemic (P=0.000);the number of patients benefited from the medical insurance policy also increased (9.65% vs 13.48%,P=0.023). During the epidemic, the patientâ€™s awareness of hemophilia knowledge (7.59Â±2.16 points) was significantly improved (P=0.000) compared to that of 3 months ago (7.17Â±2.34 points). Conclusion:The COVID-19 epidemic had a certain impact on the condition of hemophilia patients in Guangdong. Various measures by the Guangdong Hemophilia Center and the government, especially â€œthe online diagnosis and treatment modelâ€, and the â€œlong prescriptionâ€ medical insurance reimbursement policy has a positive effect on hemophilia patients in the region, make the disease generally controllable, and may bring long-term profound benefits for management of such rare disease in future.

"Effect of Loneliness and Stress among Afghan Students in India during COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic impacted almost everyone in the world. So, to prevent the virus Ã­rom spreading as people were encouraged to self-quarantine in their homes. The lockdown had serious consequences on the mental health of people, causing issues such as stress, frustration, and depression. The psychological reactions of the people have a key role in influencing both the transmission of the disease and the occurrence of emotional anguish and social disorder during and after an infectious disease outbreak. Despite this, adequate resources are rarely provided to manage or mitigate the consequences of pandemics on mental health and well-being. Maladaptive behaviors, emotional distress, and defensive responses are all psychological responses to pandemics. Particularly those are more at risk who are genetically inclined to mental disease. According to surveys, the COVID-19 epidemic has influenced the state of friendship among many adults in the United States. Nearly 60% of young women said they lost contact with a few acquaintances during the pandemic, while 16% said they lost contact with most or all of their pals (Cherry, 2022). The mental health of people has suffered greatly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The unprecedented level of uncertainty connected with the pandemic could contribute to stress and anxiety, particularly among people who have a high tolerance for uncertainty (Rettie & Daniels, 2021). The current study examined the experiences faced by students in higher education during the COVID-19 pandemic. To explore the effect of Loneliness and Stress among Afghan students in India during COVID-19 Pandemic a correlational study was conducted. 156 Afghan students (Bachelor's, Master's, & Ph.D. students) from age (18-25) years old living in India participated in this study. 7-item COVID-19 Student Stress Questionnaire (CSSQ) and UCLA Loneliness Scale (Version 3) were used in this study. Correlational analysis showed that there is a significant relationship between loneliness and stress. It was found that the level of stress among Afghan students living in India during a COVID-19 pandemic was moderate. Students reported rising mental health problems related to isolation, anxiety of social gatherings, and changes in connections with teachers and peers. And there was a high positive correlation between the three dimensions (isolation, relationship & academic life, & fear of contagion) of the 7-item COVID-19 Student Stress Questionnaire. It was also found that students were suffering from loneliness and isolation at a moderate level because, on the internet, students were no more able to reveal their ""real"" or inner self to others than they were in face-to-face settings. Therefore, situational factors like moving to a new place, physical isolation, and divorce can all cause loneliness in this context (David, 2015).","Mansoor, Lida, Nehabala, Yagyima","https://www.google.com/search?q=Effect+of+Loneliness+and+Stress+among+Afghan+Students+in+India+during+COVID-19+Pandemic","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Education and Management Studies; 12(2):150-154, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36214,""

Determining the psychological effects of this situation and the compliance with public health measures will be a guide both in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and possible epidemics in the future. This two-group, cross-sectional descriptive study aimed to determine compliance with public health measures against COVID-19 and to evaluate the levels of fear, depression, anxiety, and stress by analysing individuals who experienced and did not experience COVID-19. Method: The study sample consisted of a total of 636 participants. Of these participants, 328 had a positive Polymerase Chain Reaction test and 308 had a negative test. Data was collected using the Diagnostic Form, Questionnaire for the Compliance with Public Health Measures Against the COVID-19, Fear of COVID-19 Scale, and the Short Form Depression Anxiety Stress Scale in our online database. Results: Although the participants' compliance with public health measures regarding the use of masks is high, their compliance with the measures related to physical distance is low. Moreover, fear of COVID-19, anxiety, stress, and depression levels are higher in individuals who experienced COVID-19 than those who did not experience COVID-19. Also, both groups have high levels of fear, anxiety, stress, and depression.

"Relationships among burnout, job dissatisfaction, psychosocial work conditions and minor mental disorders of precarious employment in Taiwan","Background: Precarious employment is a major determinant of mental health outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic and development of digital economic platforms have enhanced the ratio of precarious employment relationship. The aim of this study was to explore the relationships among burnout, job dissatisfaction, psychosocial work conditions and minor mental disorders of precarious employment. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted, using the questionnaire from a national survey of employees in 2013. Minor mental disorder was measured using the five-item brief symptom rating scale (BSRS-5). 1909 males and 1499 females, with a total of 3408 nonstandard employees aged 20 to 65, including short-term and temporary precarious employment, have been analyzed. Also obtained were participants' sex, age, type of industry, status of shift work, job dissatisfaction, burnout as well as psychosocial work conditions. Results: The prevalence of minor mental disorders among precarious work condition in man and women were 16.08% and 19.35%, respectively. When we adjusted age and status of shift work, associations between minor mental disorders and female, job dissatisfaction, increased scores in burnout, and high psychological demand of work was noticed. When we further categorized by sex, it was found that job dissatisfaction and increased scores in burnout were significantly related with an increased risk for minor mental disorders in both male and female workers. The odds of minor mental disorders was significantly related with an increased scores in psychological demand of work among female precarious workers. Conclusions: This research study provides directions for future researches.","Chen, Chieh-Jan, Chen, Albert, Chen, Po-Han, Peng, Tsu-Te, Chen, Sheryl, Hsieh, Ching-Mei","https://doi.org/10.31083/j.jomh1807146","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Men's Health; 18(7), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36225,""
"Original Mixed Methods Research Experiences, Service Needs, and Impacts of Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB) processes on injured and ill workers: evidence from the city and district of Thunder Bay (Ontario, Canada)","Introduction: Individuals experience negative physical, social and psychological ramifications when they are hurt or become ill at work. Ontarios Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB) is intended to mitigate these effects, yet the WSIB process can be difficult. Supports for injured workers can be fragmented and scarce, especially in underserved areas. We describe the experiences and mental health needs of injured and ill Northwestern Ontario workers in the WSIB process, in order to promote system improvements. Methods: Community-recruited injured and ill workers (n=40) from Thunder Bay and District completed an online survey about their mental health, social service and legal system needs while involved with WSIB. Additional Northwestern Ontario injured and ill workers (n=16) and community service providers experienced with WSIB processes (n=8) completed interviews addressing similar themes. Results: Northwestern Ontario workers described the impacts of workplace injury and illness on their professional, family, financial and social functioning, and on their physical and mental health. Many also reported incremental negative impacts of the WSIB processes themselves, including regional issues such as ""small town"" privacy concerns and the cost burden of travel required by the WSIB, especially during COVID-19. Workers and service providers suggested streamlining and explicating WSIB processes, increasing WSIB continuity of care, and region-specific actions such as improving access to regional support services through arms-length navigators. Conclusion: Northwestern Ontario workers experienced negative effects from workplace injuries and illness and the WSIB process itself. Stakeholders can use these findings to improve processes and outcomes for injured and ill workers, with special considerations for the North.","Noel, C.; Scharf, D.; Hawkins, J.; Lund, J.; Kozik, J.; Kone, A.

"Splanchnic Nerve Block as a Bridge Therapy in Painful Chronic Pancreatitis During COVID 19 Pandemic: A Case Report","Agonizing and debilitating pain is what most patients with chronic pancreatitis endure. Chronic pain often leads to depression and poor quality of life. Surgical decompression can result in permanent pain relief by reducing intraductal hypertension. Elective surgical procedures had to be postponed during the Covid-19 pandemic as the resources, including oxygen supplies, workforce, and ventilators, were dedicated to the service of Covid-19 patients. We present a case of 20 year-old-male suffering from severe abdominal pain due to chronic pancreatitis refractory to analgesic medications. Given the refractory pain and inability to proceed with surgery due to the pandemic, we subjected him to undergo splanchnic nerve block (SNB) with local anesthetic and steroid. SNB provided adequate analgesia and enabled the patient to tide over the crisis. To our knowledge, no case has been reported using a combination of local anesthetic and steroid in SNB for a patient with chronic pancreatitis.","Krishnagopal, V.; Krishnakumar, S.; Ramamurthy, P.; Subramaniam, S.","https://doi.org/10.22037/jcma.v7i3.37495","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Cellular and Molecular Anesthesia; 7(3):191-194, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36227,""
"Coping Mechanisms and Emotional Distress for Young People and Adults in Pandemic Context","The COVID-19 pandemic context put to test all adaptive skills of human beings around the world. In this disruptive context, a sample of 401 respondents (173 male and 228 female), aged between 19 and 65 yens old, were assessed using the Unconditional Self -Acceptance Questionnaire (USAQ), the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ), the Emotional Distress Profile (PDE) and the Autonomy Questionnaire, from Cognitrom Assessment System. The main objectives of the study aimed at identifying the significant differences in emotional distress, coping mechanisms, autonomy and self-acceptance based on gender and age as grouping variables, and the significant relationships between all these variables. Statistics show differences in behavioural and emotional autonomy between male and female, differences related to catastrophizing and blaming others as resilience mechanisms between male and female, differences in self-acceptance and positive assessment (as coping mechanism) between young people and adults, and significant negative correlations between emotional distress and all types of autonomy (value, cognitive, behavioural and emotional), significant positive correlation with coping mechanisms like blaming others, catastrophizing, self-blame and acceptance, and significant negative correlation with positive assessment and refocusing on planning.

"Emotion and sleep quality of adolescents and youth groups in the period of work and school resumption after COVID-19","Objective: To understand the emotion and sleep state of youths and adolescents who returned to school during the mild period of COVID-19. Methods: A total of 1621 subjects were investigated using the self-made information questionnaire, SAS, SDS and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Nvivo12.0 and SPSS23.0 were used to analyze the data. Results: The subjects reported boredom, worry, nervousness. There were significant differences in sleep quality index in terms of gender, residence status, time of reading news of COVID-19, and time of communicating with parents (P&lt;0.01). The sleep quality index (4.67Â±3.12) of college students was lower than the norm (5.8Â±2.4) (P&lt;0.001), the SAS score (42.87Â±9.94) of teenagers was higher than the norm (29.78Â±10.07) (P&lt;0.001), and the SDS score (47.64Â±11.34) of youths and teenagers was higher than the norm (33.46Â±8.55) (P&lt;0.001). During this period, PSQI was significantly positively correlated with SAS score and SDS score, and effectively predicted SAS score and SDS score. Conclusion: During the stage of work and school resumption, the emotional state of youths and teenagers was still affected, but presented positive characteristics, with a variety of positive emotions. Compared with the general state, youths and teenagers showed higher depression and anxiety, but sleep quality of college students was better than that in the general state.","Wu, M.; Hu, W.","https://doi.org/10.7652/jdyxb202204002","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Xi'an Jiaotong University (Medical Sciences); 43(4):489-495, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36233,""
"Neuroscientific techniques applied to audiovisual stimuli: cognitive-emotional analysis of Heineken advertisements during COVID-19","Using neuroscience techniques applied to the analysis of audiovisual content, four Heineken brand advertisements produced during the COVID-19 pandemic are studied. The main objective is to detect what cognitive and emotional responses the different stimuli elicit in thirty subjects and to assess whether the narrative construction of the advertisements works in conveying their advertising messages through images and sounds. For this purpose, after a preliminary textual analysis, tools are used to record facial micro-expressions and eye tracking, and the research is completed with a recall test. The results indicate the predominance of the emotions of joy and surprise, as well as the presence of other emotions (disgust, contempt, sadness) at specific moments. In turn, it was found that the types of images that most capture the viewer's attention are those that include eye-catching, exciting, descriptive actions of the pandemic (mask, social distance greeting, etc.) or which include written text on the screen. Likewise, it is observed that the Heineken product in its various forms (bottle, tap, logo, etc.) is only prominently perceived in the frame if there is a dramatic action to accompany or underline it. In contrast, the human figure (the eyes, above all) is the visual component on which the subjects' gaze is predominantly focused. Finally, the results of the recall test coincide with the rest of the analyses with respect to the intensity of the emotions produced by the stimuli.","Fernandez, M. R.; Martin, L. S.; Tiralaso, H.

"Mental health of university students during the pandemic Threats to their mental health and proposals for university student support in Poland","Purpose: The article is an application report. It focuses on the mental health difficulties currently experienced by university students in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have a significant impact on the study process. The work also presents examples of support implemented at higher education institutions during the pandemic, aimed at maintaining and strengthening students' mental health. Views: Mental health is closely related to physical/somatic health, among other things, in terms of health behaviour and immunological processes. Thus, any physical, life-threatening and therefore life-altering illness has a potentially negative impact on an individual's overall mental health. A pandemic such as COVID-19 in 2020 is a potential additional risk factor for mental health that is not yet well understood. Pandemic-related changes such as remote learning, reduced interpersonal contact, the uncertainty surrounding this pandemic of unknown magnitude, as well as its dynamic and often surprising course may have an impact on the functioning of young people and their daily activities, including studying. Conclusions: It is essential to monitor mental health in different population groups, including students-young adults, specifically in relation to the threat of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection, prevention activities and the treatment of COVID-19 patients. It is important to introduce parallel activities to support students' mental health, in line with the sanitary regime, e.g. by using new technologies.","Zablocka-Zytka, L.","https://doi.org/10.5114/ppn.2022.117931","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Postepy Psychiatrii i Neurologii; 31(2):95-101, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36235,""
"Peculiarities of psychological assistance in overcoming the consequences of COVID-19: a resilience approach","Introduction: The urgency of the study is due to the appearance of an emergency caused by an extremely dangerous outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Every emergency, especially one which threatens health, is characterized by increased anxiety and depression among the population, causes chronic emotional disorders and requires provision of psychological and psychosocial assistance to the individual. In this regard, this article aims to describe and summarize theoretical and empirical research that will help identify the factors that shape the appropriate resource strategies for the development of resilience in overcoming the consequences of COVID-19. At the same time, this study revealed the role of resilience as a potential protective factor for mental health during an outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Material and methods: The leading method of research is theoretical and methodological analysis, comprehension, comparison, classification and generalization of the main content of bibliographic sources that are relevant to the problem and purpose of the study. Results: The article presents the factors influencing resilience in the individual overcoming the consequences of COVID-19 taking into account the world experience. The main approaches to providing psychological assistance to a person in difficult life circumstances caused by the pandemic are identified. Conclusions: The factors influencing the resilience of a person during the COVID-19 pandemic are substantiated and singled out.

"Attitudes towards Vaccines, Intent to Vaccinate and the Relationship with COVID-19 Vaccination Rates in Individuals with Schizophrenia","Schizophrenia patients are at high risk of developing severe COVID-19 outcomes but recent evidence suggests that they are under-vaccinated. This study explored the role of potential attitudinal barriers by comparing schizophrenia patients with participants from the general population regarding COVID-19 vaccination rates, general attitudes towards vaccines, and willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine. We conducted a cross-sectional study between April 2021 and October 2021. A total of 100 people with schizophrenia and 72 nonclinical controls were recruited. In our study, individuals with schizophrenia were under-vaccinated, despite similar general attitudes towards vaccination and higher willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19 compared to nonclinical participants. In patients, negative attitudes toward vaccines were related to higher levels of negative psychotic symptoms and higher levels of paranoid ideation. As a whole, participants with more negative attitudes towards vaccines were less likely to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and had lower levels of trust in institutions. Vaccine hesitancy does not appear to be a major barrier for COVID-19 vaccine uptake amongst people with schizophrenia. This study suggests that disparities in COVID-19 vaccination rates in schizophrenia do not seem related to attitudinal but rather structural barriers.","Raffard, StÃ©phane, Bayard, Sophie, Eisenblaetter, Margot, Attal, JÃ©rÃ´me, Andrieu, Christelle, Chereau, Isabelle, Fond, Guillaume, Leignier, Sylvain, Mallet, Jasmina, Tattard, Philippe, Urbach, Mathieu, Misdrahi, David, Laraki, Yasmine, Capdevielle, Delphine","https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10081228","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Vaccines; 10(8):1228, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36238,""

"The Invisible Suffering of Young People during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Spain and the Collateral Impact of Social Harm","This article seeks to demonstrate how the lack of institutional involvement with young people during the pandemic had negative effects, stemming from a lack of clear and precise rules for the adolescent population. The consequences manifested themselves in such important areas as social relations, physical and mental health, affective&ndash;sexual relations, self-image and overexposure to social media. We present the results of two complementary pieces of research that provided us with insight into the behaviour of young people during lockdown. The young people were divided into two groups based on age: (1) middle adolescents aged 13 to 18 and (2) late adolescents aged 18 to 23. We adopted an integrative methodological approach based on surveys, digital ethnography and focus groups to extract the results, which produced the following findings: (1) an increase in social inequalities due to the technology gap;(2) a growth in mental health risks stemming from hyperconnectivity and overexposure to social media in order to avoid social isolation;and (3) an assimilation of anti-normative behaviours as valid in the absence of any points of reference.","Cordero Verdugo, Raquel Rebeca, Silva Esquinas, Antonio, PÃ©rez SuÃ¡rez, Jorge Ramiro","https://doi.org/10.3390/socsci11080335","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Social Sciences; 11(8):335, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36240,""

The questionnaire consists of socio-demographic characteristics, an assessment of anxiety levels with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), which also assessed trait and state anxiety, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) to evaluate the condition of depressive severity, and, finally, the Impact of Event Scale&ndash;Revised (IES&ndash;R), which was administered in order to quantify the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among the participants. (3) Results: A total of 770 Italian healthcare workers were enrolled in this study. Of these, 95 (12.30%) were physicians and 675 (87.70%) were nurses. By considering PTSD, anxiety, and depression levels between the physicians and nurses recruited, a significant difference was reported in the STAI-1 assessment, as both physicians and nurses reported slight and moderate levels (p = 0.033). (4) Conclusions: Physicians and nurses, who have been subjected to physical impoverishment, with the infinite physical forces spent to support the pace of work at the limits of the possible, but above all mental capacity, with the anxiety of having to face an unknown enemy, such as COVID-19. This has resulted in a significant increase in anxiety, depression, post-traumatic symptoms, and sleep disturbances, with possible repercussions not only on the quality of life of the physicians and nurses but also on the quality of assistance provided.","Lupo, Roberto, Botti, Stefano, Rizzo, Alessandra, Lezzi, Alessia, CalabrÃ², Antonino, Conte, Luana, Petrelli, Cosimo, Longo, Cosimo, Vitale, Elsa","https://doi.org/10.3390/psych4030036","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psych; 4(3):465-474, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36241,""
"Challenges and Implications of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health: A Systematic Review","The measures put in place to contain the rapid spread of COVID-19 infection, such as quarantine, self-isolation, and lockdown, were supportive but have significantly affected the mental wellbeing of individuals. The primary goal of this study was to review the impact of COVID-19 on mental health. An intensive literature search was conducted using PsycINFO, PsyciatryOnline, PubMed, and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases. Articles published between January 2020 and June 2022 were retrieved and appraised. Reviews and retrospective studies were excluded. One hundred and twenty-two (122) relevant articles that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were finally selected. A high prevalence of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and post-traumatic stress disorders was reported. Alcohol and substance abuse, domestic violence, stigmatization, and suicidal tendencies have all been identified as direct consequences of lockdown. The eminent risk factors for mental health disorders identified during COVID-19 include fear of infection, history of mental illness, poor financial status, female gender, and alcohol drinking. The protective factors for mental health include higher income levels, public awareness, psychological counseling, social and government support. Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a number of mental disorders in addition to economic hardship. This strongly suggests the need to monitor the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health.","Rabiu Abubakar, Abdullahi, Tor, Maryam Abba, Ogidigo, Joyce, Sani, Ibrahim Haruna, Rowaiye, Adekunle Babajide, Ramalan, Mansur Aliyu, Najib, Sani Yahaya, Danbala, Ahmed, Adamu, Fatima, Abdullah, Adnan, Irfan, Mohammed, Kumar, Santosh, Etando, Ayukafangha, Rahman, Sayeeda, Sinha, Susmita, Haque, Mainul","https://doi.org/10.3390/psych4030035","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psych; 4(3):435-464, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36242,""
"Indicators of Mental Health Disorder, COVID-19 Prevention Compliance and Vaccination Intentions among Refugees in Kenya","Background and Objectives: COVID-19 remains a major development challenge in many developing countries. This study analysed the effect of mental health disorder and indicators of COVID-19 preventive practices on vaccination intentions among refugees in Kenya. Materials and Methods: The data were the fourth and fifth waves of the High Frequency Phone Surveys on the impacts of COVID-19 that were collected by the Kenyan National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) between May 2020 and June 2021. The data were collected from Kakuma, Kalobeyei, Dadaab and Shona camps using the stratified random sampling method. The data were analysed with random effects instrumental variable Probit regression model. Results: The results showed that 69.32% and 93.16% of the refugees were willing to be vaccinated during the 4th and 5th waves, respectively. The fear of dying was reported by 85.89% and 74.19% during the 4th and 5th waves, respectively. COVID-19 contact prevention and immune boosting indicators were differently influenced by some demographic and anxiety index variables, while being endogenous influenced vaccine hesitancy along with urban residence, age, knowing infected persons, days of depression, days of anxiety, days of physical reactions, members losing job, searching for jobs, accepting job offers and being employed. Conclusions: It was concluded that efforts to promote COVID-19 vaccination should address mental health disorder and compliance with existing COVID-19 contact and immune boosting behaviour with a focus on urban residents and youths.","Oyekale, Abayomi Samuel","https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina58081032","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Medicina; 58(8):1032, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36243,""
"Visiting Peri-Urban Forestlands and Mountains during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Empirical Analysis on Effects of Land Use and Awareness of Visitors","This research analyzed the status of visiting peri-urban forestlands and mountains during the first COVID-19 emergency period in Japan using a large-scale online questionnaire-based survey. We identified and examined the factors that correlated with visits to such areas, including respondents' social-economic attributes, environmental conditions (such as the land use patterns of their residential areas), and awareness of the functions of forestlands. The results suggest that environmental conditions are a major factor encouraging residents to visit peri-urban forestlands and mountains during the pandemic. Peri-urban areas with forestlands have such environmental conditions, and residents who visited peri-urban forestlands and mountains tended to live in peri-urban areas. Residents' expectations regarding forest functions were also strong factors influencing them to visit those places. Those who visited forests and mountains expected these areas to have mental health and educational functions. Especially, female respondents tended to be aware of forestlands as spaces for mental and physical relaxation, and respondents who have one or more children tended to be aware of the educational functions of forests. These findings imply that policy should consider the role of environmental conditions, awareness, and expectations about the function of forests and mountains, and prior interactions with nature in encouraging residents to visit such places for their health during the pandemic. These factors could also play a role in addressing the social and environmental disparities that exist between residents of different socio-economic statuses regarding access to nature. In future research, the detailed relationships between residents' environmental conditions and expectations/awareness of the functions of peri-urban forestlands and mountains need to be explored.","Uchiyama, Yuta, Kohsaka, Ryo","https://doi.org/10.3390/land11081194","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Land; 11(8):1194, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36244,""
"Visualizing Social Media Research in the Age of COVID-19","During the last three years, numerous research papers have been reported which use social media data to explore several issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Bibliometric methods in this work are used to analyze 1427 peer-reviewed documents from the last three years extracted from the Web of Science database. The results of this study show that there was high growth in publications in open access journals with an annual rate reaching 19.3% and they also identify the top cited journals and research papers. The thematic analysis of papers shows that research topics related to social media for surveillance and monitoring of public attitudes and perceptions, mental health, misinformation, and fake news are important and well-developed, whereas topics related to distance-learning education with social media are emerging.

"The 'Mask Effect';of the Emotional Factor in Nurses' Adaptability to Change: Mental Health in a COVID-19 Setting","During healthcare catastrophes, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, nurses are exposed to highly stressful situations derived from their work and personal activity. Development of coping strategies for such situations can improve nurses' physical and mental health. This study analyzed nurses' adaptability to change, with attention to socio-demographic variables in a COVID-19 setting, and identified the repercussions on their health. This quantitative, observational and cross-sectional study had a sample of 351 nurses aged 22 to 64 with a mean age of 40.91 (SD = 10.98). The instruments used for the study were the ADAPTA-10 questionnaire and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28). It was observed that age, sex, and having a stable partner significantly influenced scores on the emotional, cognitive&ndash;behavioral, and adaptation to change factors. Finally, the emotional factor mediated between positive COVID-19 in someone close and the presence of health problems. Understanding the elements that help adapt better to change and adversity enable effective interventions to be developed for improving emotional health of nurses, especially for those in whom there are positive cases of COVID-19 in their personal or work environment.","GÃ¡zquez Linares, JosÃ© JesÃºs, Molero Jurado, MarÃ­a del Mar, PÃ©rez-Fuentes, MarÃ­a del Carmen, Herrera-Peco, Ivan, Martos MartÃ­nez, Ãfrica, BarragÃ¡n MartÃ­n, Ana BelÃ©n","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10081457","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(8):1457, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36246,""
"Patient Management in the Emergency Department during a COVID-19 Pandemic","In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, international action has been taken to prevent the spread of the disease. The aim of this study is to establish the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on emergency department utilization patterns in Poland. It was established that age (among COVID-19 positive patients) has a large influence on the occurrence of a mental illness or disorder. It has been proven that the older the person (patients diagnosed with U07.1), the more often mental diseases/disorders are diagnosed (p = 0.009&ndash;0.044). Gender decides the course of hospitalization to the disadvantage of men (p = 0.022). Men diagnosed with U07.1 stay much longer in specialized long-term care units. Lower-aged patients have a shorter hospitalization time (up to the age of 29;p = 0.017). The COVID-19 pandemic has placed healthcare systems, their staff, and their patients in an unprecedented situation. Our study showed changes in the number and characteristics of patients visiting the ED during COVID-19. Despite the shift in the center of gravity of health system functioning to the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, care must be taken to ensure that uninfected patients have access to treatment for cardiovascular, mental health, oncological, and other diseases.","Robakowska, Marlena, Tyranska-Fobke, Anna, Pogorzelczyk, Katarzyna, Synowec, Joanna, Slezak, Daniel, Robakowski, Piotr, Rzonca, Patryk, Predkiewicz, Pawel","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10081456","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(8):1456, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36247,""
"Work Stress and Willingness of Nursing Aides during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Objectives: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, nursing aides (NAs) experienced greater work stress than they do typically because they worked in highly contagious environments. This may have influenced their work morale and willingness to work, which can reduce patient satisfaction, influence their physical and mental health, and even endanger patient safety or cause medical system collapse. Design: A cross-sectional survey with a structured self-report questionnaire was conducted. Setting and Participants: 144 NAs from a medical center in Central Taiwan participated. Methods: We recruited NAs through convenience sampling to discuss their work stress, willingness to work, and patients' satisfaction with them during the COVID-19 pandemic. Result: Of the 144 recruited NAs, 115 (79.9%) were women and 29 (20.1%) were men, and 89 (61.8%) had completed COVID-19 training courses. NAs with different work tenure lengths exhibited significant differences in work stress (p = 0.022), willingness to work (p = 0.029), and patient satisfaction (p = 0.029) scores during the pandemic. Conclusion: The study findings provide crucial data for the management of NAs during pandemics to prevent them from neglecting patients due to excessive work stress or losing their willingness to work, which may cause the medical system to collapse.","Chang, Ting-Shan, Chen, Li-Ju, Hung, Shu-Wen, Hsu, Yi-Min, Tzeng, Ya-Ling, Chang, Ying","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10081446","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(8):1446, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36248,""
"Associations between Physical Activity Level and Mental Health in the Spanish Population: A Cross-Sectional Study","Physical inactivity and sedentary lifestyles appear to be critical factors in developing mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, and other diseases in developed societies. This study analysed the associations between physical activity level (PAL) and mental health using the Goldberg General Health Questionnaire (GHQ12) in the Spanish population before the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional design, based on data from the Spanish National Health Survey (ENSE 2017), the last health survey before the pandemic, was carried out with 17,641 participants. Data did not follow a normal distribution, so non-parametric tests were used to analyse intergroup differences, differences at baseline and post hoc, and correlations between variables. Associations were found between the PAL, mental health and all its dimensions. The groups that performed moderate and intense PAL showed lower values in the GHQ12 questionnaire than those who walked or were inactive. Thus, higher PAL was associated with better mental health indicators, including successful coping, self-esteem and stress. This study provides a framework to compare outcomes between the pre- and post-pandemic periods, as the ENSE is performed every five years.","Denche-Zamorano, Ãngel, Barrios-Fernandez, Sabina, GÃ³mez-GalÃ¡n, Rafael, Franco-GarcÃ­a, Juan Manuel, Carlos-Vivas, Jorge, Mendoza-MuÃ±oz, MarÃ­a, Rojo-Ramos, Jorge, Vega-MuÃ±oz, Alejandro, Contreras-Barraza, NicolÃ¡s, Gianikellis, Konstantinos, MuÃ±oz-Bermejo, Laura","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10081442","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(8):1442, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36249,""
"Association between Quality of Life and Physical Functioning in a Gardening Intervention for Cancer Survivors","Purpose: To examine potential factors associated with maintaining or improving self-reported physical function (PF) among older cancer survivors participating in a gardening intervention impacted by the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods: Thirty cancer survivors completed a home-based gardening intervention to encourage a healthier diet and a more active lifestyle. Device-based measures of physical activity (PA) and surveys to evaluate quality of life (QOL;PROMIS-57 questionnaire) were administered at baseline, mid-intervention (6 months), and post-intervention (9 months). Results: Depression, fatigue, and sleeplessness at baseline were significantly associated with worse average PF scores across follow-up (2.3 to 4.9 points lower for every decrease of 5 points in the QOL score;p-values &lt; 0.02). Worsening of these QOL domains during the intervention was also associated with an additional decrease of 2.1 to 2.9 points in PF over follow-up (p values &lt; 0.01). Better social participation and PA at baseline were significantly associated with better average PF scores during the intervention (2.8 to 5.2 points higher for every 5-point increase in social participation or 30 min more of PA;p values &lt; 0.05). Every 5-point increase in pain at baseline, or increases in pain during the intervention, was associated with decreases of 4.9 and 3.0 points, respectively, in PF. Conclusions: Worse QOL scores before and during the intervention were significantly associated with worse PF over follow-up. Encouraging social participation and PA through interventions such as home-based gardening may improve long-term health among older cancer survivors.","Sharma, Harsh, Pankratz, Vernon S.; Demark-Wahnefried, Wendy, Pestak, Claire R.; Blair, Cindy K.","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10081421","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(8):1421, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36250,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Utilization of Inpatient Mental Health Services in Shanghai, China","(1) Purpose: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on mental health and the utilization of hospital-based inpatient mental health care worldwide. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of this pandemic on the utilization of this service in Shanghai by comparison with hospital-based health care records during the preceding 4 years. (2) Methods: The medical records were provided by the Shanghai Municipal Health Insurance Bureau. Diagnostic coding was based on International Classification of Diseases-10th revision (ICD-10), and inpatients with codes from F00 to F99 were examined. (3) Results: Inpatients were compared according to gender, age, pandemic stage, and type of mental disease. Utilization of psychiatric inpatient care in Shanghai during each of the four stages of the pandemic (1 January 2016 to 21 January 2020;22 January 2020 to 9 February 2020;10 February 2020 to 1 March 2020;2 March 2020 to 31 July 2020) was analyzed. Before the lockdown, the utilization of psychiatric inpatient care had an overall upward trend;after the lockdown, the number of inpatients dropped sharply;as of 31 July 2020, it has not been restored. The utilization of this service for most types of mental disease declined rapidly during the pandemic;for vascular dementia (VAD, F01), it was relatively steady. The observed number of inpatient patients was about 51.07% lower than the predicted number in 2020. (4) Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic led to the implementation of prevention and control measures that reduced the utilization of psychiatric inpatient care in Shanghai. The use of inpatient services for categories F20&ndash;F29 had the greatest decline, and VAD (F01) had the smallest change during the pandemic. This service consequence of COVID-19 is apparent;to assure access to adequate service during a pandemic, health care professionals should pay close attention to changes in the utilization of different mental health services.","Li, Hao, Chen, Xiaoli, Pan, Jinhua, Li, Mengying, Wang, Meng, Wang, Weibing, Wang, Ying","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10081402","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(8):1402, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36251,""
"Impact of Confinement on Coping Strategies and Psychosocial Factors among University Students","The pandemic has had psychological effects on the university population. Factors such as emotional intelligence, coping strategies and levels of anxiety, depression and stress have been affected by the situation generated by COVID-19. This study aims to analyze how EI, coping strategies and levels of anxiety, depression and stress have been affected by the situation generated by the pandemic in a population of 567 students from the University of Ja&eacute;n (Spain). For this purpose, we administered three instruments: the Wong and Law emotional intelligence scale (WLEIS), the Spanish version of the coping strategies inventory (CSI) and the depression anxiety stress scales (DASS-21). At the same time, we asked students to describe their personal circumstances during confinement and their tendency to follow the measures and recommendations promoted by the Ministry of Health. The results obtained showed a positive relationship between EI and coping strategies and a negative relationship with levels of depression, anxiety and stress. A positive relationship was also found between coping and levels of anxiety, depression and stress. It was also found that the circumstances in which students experienced the period of confinement also modulated their levels of EI, coping strategies and their levels of depression, anxiety and stress.","GutiÃ©rrez-Lozano, Carla, GarcÃ­a-MartÃ­nez, Inmaculada, Augusto-Landa, JosÃ© MarÃ­a, LeÃ³n, Samuel P.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ejihpe12080067","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: European Journal of Investigation in Health, Psychology and Education; 12(8):933-944, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36252,""
"Reshaping Sustainable University Education in Post-Pandemic World: Lessons Learned from an Empirical Study","The outbreak of COVID-19 has affected people all around the world. Governments had no choice but to put people in self-isolation to stop the spread of the virus. As a result, all companies and educational institutions switched to working or studying from home. The purpose of the study is to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on student teaching and learning in the context of Malm&ouml;university. Furthermore, the study proposes recommendations for sustainable post-pandemic education at Malm&ouml;University. The study includes ten semi-structured interviews with students followed by a workshop with ten senior lecturers teaching bachelor's and master's courses. The study uses snowball sampling to select students for the interviews and senior lecturers for the workshop. A qualitative data analysis technique, thematic analysis, is used for data analysis on the data collected from interviews with students and the workshop with senior lecturers. The results from the study suggested that online education leads to several benefits for students, such as better time management, higher lecture attendance, flexibility, and discipline in their studies. However, the shift to online education has caused a communication deterioration between students and teachers. Less social interaction with other students leads to depression, anxiety, and stress. The recommendations for post-pandemic education include the unified selection of digital learning tools across courses, a designated budget for digital learning tools, training support, and hybrid learning methods. In conclusion, the study proposes blended and hybrid learning to improve higher education at the university, requiring digital tools to minimize students' communication barriers.","Munir, Hussan","https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci12080524","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Education Sciences; 12(8):524, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36253,""
"Pediatric Primary Care Perspectives of Mental Health Services Delivery during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Due to a national shortage of child and adolescent psychiatrists, pediatric primary care providers (PCPs) are often responsible for the screening, evaluation, and treatment of mental health disorders. COVID-19 pandemic stay-at-home orders decreased access to mental health care and increased behavioral and emotional difficulties in children and adolescents. Despite increased demand upon clinicians, little is known about mental health care delivery in the pediatric primary care setting during the pandemic. This focus group study explored the experiences of pediatric PCPs and clinical staff delivering mental health care during the pandemic. Transcripts from nine focus groups with San Francisco Bay Area primary care practices between April and August 2020 were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. Providers expressed challenges at the patient-, provider-, and system-levels. Many providers reported increased patient mental health symptomatology during the pandemic, which was often intertwined with patients' social determinants of health. Clinicians discussed the burden of the pandemic their own wellness, and how the rapid shift to telehealth primary care and mental health services seemed to hinder the availability and effectiveness of many resources. The findings from this study can inform the creation of new supports for PCPs and clinical staff providing mental health care.","Lee, Chuan Mei, Lutz, Jessica, Khau, Allyson, Lin, Brendon, Phillip, Nathan, Ackerman, Sara, Steinbuchel, Petra, Mangurian, Christina","https://doi.org/10.3390/children9081167","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Children; 9(8):1167, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36254,""
"Investigating Children's Ability to Express Internal States through Narratives and Drawings: Two Longitudinal Studies during Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic emergency has challenged children's socio-affective and cognitive development. It is essential to capture the modulation of their emotional experience through ecological and children-friendly tasks, such as written narratives and drawings. This contribution investigates the impact of pandemic experience (2020&ndash;2021 waves) on the internal states and emotions of the primary school age children, according to a longitudinal research approach through narratives (study 1 n = 21) and drawing tasks (study 2 n = 117). 138 Italian children were examined during COVID-19 three (study 1) or two waves (study 2). Children's written narratives were codified on the basis of narrative competence and psychological lexicon. Children's drawings were codified based on social/emotional, physical, and environmental elements. Results of narrative texts showed a lower psychological lexicon relating to positive emotions and a greater psychological lexicon relating to negative emotions only in the study sample group during the first lockdown compared to the previous and subsequent periods. Children's drawings of themselves showed a decrease of negative emotions during the third pandemic wave in comparison to the first pandemic wave.

"Depressive Anxiety Symptoms in Hospitalized Children with Chronic Illness during the First Italian COVID-19 Lockdown","COVID-19 is continuing to spread around the world, having a direct impact on people's daily lives and health. Although the knowledge of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in the general population is now well established, there is less information on its effect on specific and vulnerable populations, such as children with chronic illness (CI). We conducted a multi-centered cross-sectional study among pediatric patients in six public children's hospitals in Italy during the first lockdown, with the aim of assessing the proportion of children with CI presenting anxiety and depressive symptoms, and the clinical and demographic characteristics affecting such symptomatology. We included children with at least one chronic condition, with no cognitive delay, aged between 11 and 18 years. Brief standardized questionnaires were administered during medical scheduled visits to screen anxiety and depressive symptoms. We found a very high proportion of children showing mild to severe depressive and anxiety symptomatology (approximately 68% and 63%, respectively). Our results highlight the need of ensuring tailored psychological interventions to protect children with CI from the effect of the pandemic (and related restrictive measures such as quarantine and social distancing), with the final aim of promoting mental health and psychological well-being in this vulnerable population.","Correale, Cinzia, Falamesca, Chiara, Tondo, Ilaria, Borgi, Marta, Cirulli, Francesca, Truglio, Mauro, Papa, Oriana, Vagnoli, Laura, Arzilli, Cinzia, Venturino, Cristina, Pellegrini, Michele, Manfredi, Valentina, Sterpone, Rossella, Grimaldi Capitello, Teresa, Gentile, Simonetta, Cappelletti, Simona","https://doi.org/10.3390/children9081156","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Children; 9(8):1156, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36256,""
"No Health without Mental Health: Taking Action to Heal a World in Distressâ€”With People, Places, and Planet â€˜in Mindâ€™","The unprecedented global rise in mental anguish is closely linked with the erosion of our social fabric, economic and political systems, and to our natural environments. We are facing multiple new large-scale threats to health, safety, and security, with a growing lack of trust in others and in authorities. Pervasive stress, anxiety, depression, and uncertainty are of a nature and scale we have never seen beforeâ€”manifesting in surging violence, community breakdown, domestic abuse, opioid and other drug overdoses, social isolation, and suicidesâ€”with alarming new mental health trends in children and young people. This has been made worse by the COVID-19 pandemic and amplified by an exponential increase in the amount and immediacy of information propagated through electronic mediaâ€”often negative with manipulative intent aimed at dividing opinions through anger and fear. At the same time, there has been progressive erosion of kindness, civility, compassion, and social supports. Here, in this report from a â€œcampfireâ€ meeting held by the Nova Institute for Health, we discuss the importance of understanding the complexity of these interrelated threats which impact individual and collective mental health. Our dialog highlighted the need for efforts that build both individual and community resilience with more empowering, positive, and inspiring shared narratives that increase purpose and belonging. This includes placing greater value on positive assets that promote awareness and resilience, including creativity, spirituality, mindfulness, and nature connectionâ€”recognizing that â€˜innerâ€™ transitions contribute to shifts in mindsets for â€˜outwardâ€™ transformation in communities and the world at large. Ultimately, these strategies also encourage and normalize mutualistic values that are essential for collectively improving the health of people, places, and the planet, by overcoming the destructive, exploitative worldviews which created so many of our current challenges in the first place.","Prescott, Susan L.; Greeson, Jeffrey M.; El-Sherbini, Mona S.; Health, The Planetary Health Community Convened by the Nova Institute for","https://doi.org/10.3390/challe13020037","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Challenges; 13(2):37, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36257,""
"Teachers' Mental Health and Their Involvement in Educational Inclusion","Teaching is one of the most stressful work contexts, psychologically affecting professionals. The objective of this study is to analyse the effect of the frustration of NPB basic psychological needs, resilience, emotional intelligence and inclusion from the perspective of teachers in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study is carried out with 542 teachers of therapeutic pedagogy and special educational needs using the Psychological Need Thwarting Scale PNTS questionnaires as a research method, the Resilience Scale (RS-14), the Trait Meta Mood Scale 24 (TMMS-24), the Maslach Burnout Inventory, and the Index for Inclusion. The results revealed positive correlations, on the one hand, between the factors of frustration among themselves and with burnout and, on the other hand, the positive correlation between emotional intelligence, resilience and the inclusion index. In conclusion, the resilience of teachers plays a protective role in the inclusion of students with SEN in the face of emotional exhaustion and the frustration of psychological needs.","Salinas-Falquez, Silvia, Roman-Lorente, Carlos, Buzica, Mirela, Ãlvarez, JoaquÃ­n, GutiÃ©rrez, Nieves, Trigueros, RubÃ©n","https://doi.org/10.3390/bs12080261","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Behavioral Sciences; 12(8):261, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36258,""
"Development of a Scale for COVID-19 Stigma and Its Psychometric Properties: A Study among Pregnant Japanese Women","Background: Stigma towards COVID-19 may negatively impact people who suffer from it and those supporting and treating them. Objective: To develop and validate a scale to assess 11-item COVID-19&ndash;related stigma. Methods: A total of 696 pregnant women at a gestational age of 12 to 15 weeks were surveyed using an online survey with a newly developed scale for COVID-19 stigma and other variables. The internal consistency of the scale was calculated using omega indices. We also examined the measurement invariance of the scale. Results: Exploratory factor analyses (EFAs) of the scale items were conducted using a halved sample (n = 350). Confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) among the other halved sample (n = 346) compared the single-, two-, three-, and four-factor structure models derived from the EFAs. The best model included the following three-factor structure (&chi;2/df = 2.718, CFI = 0.960, RMSEA = 0.071): Omnidirectional Avoidance, Attributional Avoidance, and Hostility. Its internal consistency was excellent (all omega indices &gt; 0.70). The three-factor structure model showed configuration, measurement, and structural invariances between primiparas and multiparas, and between younger (less than 32 years) and older women (32 years or older). Fear of childbirth, mother&ndash;fetal bonding, obsessive compulsive symptoms, depression, adult attachment self-model, and borderline personality traits were not significantly correlated with the Omnidirectional Avoidance subscale but correlated with the Attributional Avoidance and Hostility subscales (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: The findings suggested that our scale for COVID-19 stigma was robust in its factor structure, as well as in construct validity.","Kitamura, Toshinori, Matsunaga, Asami, Hada, Ayako, Ohashi, Yukiko, Takeda, Satoru","https://doi.org/10.3390/bs12080257","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Behavioral Sciences; 12(8):257, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36259,""
"Functional status and quality of life in nonhospitalized COVID-19 survivors","Background: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 can have persistent symptoms a medium term. However, it is unknown the consequences a long term of survivors none hospitalized. The aim of this study was to describe the functional state and the quality of life in COVID-19 survivors that did not require hospitalisation. After this, physical activity, dyspnoea, disability and anxiety/ depression was evaluated and relationship between them. Methods: A multicentre cross-sectional study with Primary Care patients was carried out. By means of an interview, status functional was valued with Post-COVID-19 Functional Status Scale (PCFS) and the 1-Minute-Sit-to-Stand (1MSTS) test. Health-Related Quality of life was measured with EuroQol (EQ-5D-5L). Level of physical activity was quantified with International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Dyspnoea was valued with Modified Medical Research Council scale (mMRC). Disability was measured with General Activity Limitation Indicator (GALI). And, anxiety/depression was calculated with Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS). Results: The study included 120 patients with an evolution time of 6.33 +/- 3.15 months. According to PCFS scale, 2.5% of patients showed severe functional limitations, 31.7% moderate and 16.7% slight. 45.8% had a score in 1-MSTS test lower for percentile 25 and 63,3% showed decline of quality of life. 43.3% showed a low physical activity level and 50% moderated. 57.5% had dyspnoea, 24.2% suffer from anxiety/depression and 46.6% claimed that they felt limited. Conclusion: Results suggest that people who had suffered from mild COVID-19, who have not required hospitalisation, they show functional limitations and a decrease in Health-Related Quality of life.","Sacristan-Galisteo, C.; Lopez-de-Uralde-Villanueva, I.; del Corral, T.; Martin-Casas, P.","https://doi.org/10.3306/AJHS.2022.37.04.58","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: MEDICINA BALEAR; 37(4):58-64, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36260,""
"When â€œTime Is Not Your Ownâ€: Experiences of Mothering Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic","As COVID-19 reached pandemic levels in March 2020, schools shifted to remote learning. Student parents in higher education had to adapt to their own remote learning and assume responsibility for childcare and their children?s education. Few studies have explored the impact of COVID-19 on mothers who are also full-time students. This study utilized a phenomenological approach to understand the lived experiences of mothering students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Student mothers were recruited from a large, public, Hispanic-serving university in a Southern state. We conducted interviews with 15 student mothers who had at least one child under the age of 18 during the first six months of the pandemic. Three main themes emerged from the analyses: (1) successfully meeting educational requirements;(2) dealing with the mental health impact of the pandemic;and (3) changing the institutional structure. The first theme captured strategies mothering students implemented to ensure their own or their children?s educational goals were met. The second theme encompassed how mothers handled the stress caused by the pandemic. The third theme explored ways that mothers resisted gendered expectations and norms around care. Implications for policy and social work practice include changing institutional structures to enhance support for mothering students.","LaBrenz, Catherine A.; Robinson, Erica D.; Chakravarty, Sreyashi, Vasquez-Schut, Gladis, Mitschke, Diane B.; Oh, Sehun","https://doi.org/10.1177/08861099221115721","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: Affilia;: 08861099221115721, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36261,""
"COVID-19 pandemic: Does musicianship matter?","The COVID-19 pandemic negatively influenced mental health and the music industry. The present study examined the relationship of between personality traits and emotional regulation with emotional problems and compared this relationship across three groups of individuals living in TÃ¼rkiye during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample consisted of 542 participants (238 musicians, 97 artists excluding musicians, and 207 participants who engaged in no form of art). The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale-Brief Form (DERS-16), and Basic Personality Traits Inventory were used. Findings showed that difficulties in emotion regulation were positively associated with stress, depression, and anxiety in all groups. The pattern of the relationship between personality traits and outcome measures was similar across musicians and participants who engaged in no form of art, whereas that of difficulties in emotional regulation with personality traits was almost the same across the three groups. Except for the personality traits of extraversion and openness, group comparisons showed no differences across different measures. These findings suggest that difficulties in emotional regulation need to be a target for psychological interventions to reduce emotional problems for all three groups. Being a musician did not make any difference in terms of emotional regulation or the experience of psychological problems.","Krespi Ulgen, Margorit Rita, Kupana, M.

"Promoting well-being in the face of a pandemic: the role of sense of coherence and ego-resilience in the relationship between psychological distress and life satisfaction","COVID-19 has impacted negatively on the lives and academic activities of university students. This has contributed to increasing levels of psychological distress among this population group. Intrinsic and contextual factors can mediate the psychological impact of the pandemic. The study focuses on sense of coherence and ego-resilience as potential protective factors on indices of psychological distress and life satisfaction. Participants were undergraduate students (N?=?337) at a South African university who completed six self-report questionnaires, namely, the Beck Hopelessness Scale, the University of California Los Angeles Loneliness Scale, the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, the Sense of Coherence Scale, the Ego-Resilience Scale, and the Satisfaction with Life Scale. To examine the direct and mediating effects of sense of coherence and ego-resilience on psychological distress, structural equation modeling was used. Compared to previous research, greater psychological distress was found in the current sample. Moreover, while the hopelessness?life satisfaction relationship was only partially mediated by protective factors, the depression?life satisfaction relationship was fully mediated by sense of coherence and ego-resilience. The direct association between ego-resilience as well as sense of coherence and life satisfaction was significant, suggesting that these factors have a health-sustaining role.","Padmanabhanunni, Anita, Pretorius, Tyrone B.","https://doi.org/10.1177/00812463221113671","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: South African Journal of Psychology;: 00812463221113671, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36263,""

"EMOTION REGULATION AS PROTECTIVE FACTOR ON HEALTHCARE WORKERS' MENTAL HEALTH DURING THE COVID-19: A LONGITUDINAL STUDY","Introduction Healthcare workers usually deal with several risk factors that make them prone to some psychological problems, such as anxiety, depression, burnout, or even PSTD. During the COVID-19 pandemic, this situation worsened, so many studies were conducted to highlight the impact of the pandemic on healthcare professionals' mental health. However, just a few of them focused on vulnerability and protective factors. The present study aimed to explore the role of emotion regulation processes on healthcare workers' mental health. Methods A longitudinal study was conducted with Spanish healthcare workers sample (n=57). Data were collected two times: t1 was assessed during the first wave of COVID-19 in Spain (April-May, 2020), and t2, two months later. Symptoms of depression, PSTD, and emotional exhaustion were assessed as symptomatology, whereas demographics, job conditions, and trait and state emotion regulation variables were collected as predictive factors. Results Regression analyses showed that participants with dysfunctional beliefs about sharing and expressing emotions, higher self-criticism, suppression, negative emotions, lower levels of self-acceptance and reassuring toward themselves, and a lack of the ability to relax in their leisure time in t1 experienced higher levels of depression, PSTD and emotional exhaustion in t2, controlling for baseline levels. Moreover, results also pointed out a significant decrease over time in self-support and reappraisal and a significant increase in lack of empathy and having a distant attitude toward others. Discussion Our results suggest that some emotion regulation processes, such as acceptance, self-reassuring, and being able to relax in leisure time could be relevant in the prevention of psychological problems among healthcare professionals. Practical implications of the results will be discussed as these results may help to design psychological intervention programs and promote healthy job conditions that enhance better mental health not only in a critical context but also in their daily work.","Vilte, L.

"Hospitalisations related to psychoactive substance intoxication in young adults during and after the first lockdown in Bordeaux Teaching Hospital","Introduction: Incidence of hospitalisations related to psychoactive substance intoxication (H-SPA) might have been differently impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic according to age-groups. This study aimed to describe (i) the incidence of H-SPA during and after the first 2020 lockdown in adults aged 18-29 years or 30+ then (ii) their characteristics specifically associated with the pandemic period by comparing 2020 with 2017-2019 baseline period. Material and methods: This historical cohort study was conducted in adults admitted to the University Hospital of Bordeaux with main or secondary diagnosis codes of intoxication with benzodiazepine, methadone, buprenorphine, codeine, morphine, heroin, cocaine, ecstasy and alcohol. Data were collected locally through the discharge database. Incidence and characteristics of H-SPA were described according to patients age, in 2020 before (01/01-16/03), during (17/03-10/05), and after the first lockdown (11/05-31/07). Results: Among the 5824 stays included over the study period, SPA most involved were alcohol and benzodiazepines. Compared to baseline, the decrease in H-SPA's incidence was more important in young adults (-40%;nbaseline = 450) in comparison to those aged 30+ (-18%;nbaseline = 1,101) during the pandemic period, especially during the lockdown compared to 2017 (-59%;n2017 = 145 vs-35%;n2017 = 166) with far decrease in alcohol and ecstasy intoxications. Seriousness of hospitalization indications was increased regardless of age during the pandemic. Particularly in young adults, the proportion of suicides increased during lockdown compared to the baseline period (almost 50% vs 29%) and the proportion of accidents in context of intoxication (3.5 vs 0.7%) after lockdown. Discussion/Conclusion: The period following lockdown should be considered at risk for hospitalizations due to accident in context of SPA use. Strong decrease in the incidence of H-SPA in young adult during the lockdown highlights the health burden of recreational use of alcohol and ecstasy in this population and the need for prevention.","Perino, J.; Ramaroson, H.; Ong, N.; Lancelot, V.; Bezin, J.; Gilleron, V.; Daveluy, A.; Tournier, M.","https://doi.org/10.1111/fcp.12787","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Fundamental and Clinical Pharmacology; 36:65-66, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36266,""
"Increase of overdose and deaths related to methadone during COVID-19 epidemic","Introduction: Following COVID-19 epidemic, a reinforced monitoring has been set up by the French addictovigilance network from March 16th to June 30th, 2020 due to the risk of overdoses increase (changes in health organization and rules for renewing prescriptions;risk of higher drugs consumption due to stress). Methadone was the first substance reported. In this context, a specific study has been managed in order to analyze overdoses in 2020 compared to 2019. Material and methods: Overdoses and deaths related to methadone and reported in the French pharmacovigilance database in 2019 and 2020 were analyzed. Results: A total of 332 cases were analyzed (193 occurred in 2019 and 139 in 2020). First, this study revealed a time lag between the date of reports and the date of occurrence in particularly in deaths (77% of deaths occurring in 2019 were reported in 2020). In this context, we have taken into account only cases that occurred and reported the same year. Secondly, there were more cases in 2020 compared to 2019: 1.2 times more overdoses (98 versus 79) and 2.2 times more deaths (41 versus 19). In 2020, a greater number of cases were observed in April and May for overdoses and in May for deaths. Overdoses and deaths occurred during occasional methadone use and also in subjects with opioid substitution therapy and resulted from different factors: overconsumption, multiple drug use with depressants drugs or cocaine, injection, consumption for sedative, recreational purposes or voluntary drug poisoning. There was low mention of ""take home"" naloxone use and methadone was obtained from prescription, street market or from entourage. Discussion/Conclusion: All these data show an increase of morbidity and mortality related to methadone during COVID-19 epidemic. In this context, the French addictovigilance network has disseminated several information on methadone overdose risk.","Frauger, E.; FouilhÃ© Sam-LaÃ¯, N.; Lacroix, C.; Micallef, J.","https://doi.org/10.1111/fcp.12786","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Fundamental and Clinical Pharmacology; 36:38-39, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36267,""
"EXPLORING THE IMPACT OF ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND FEAR OF COVID-19ON OVERDOSE AND SEXUAL RISK BEHAVIORS","Purpose: Risky overdose behaviors, such as using drugs by oneself, and risky sexual behaviors, such as engaging in unprotected sex, can lead to serious health outcomes, including experiencing a drug overdose and contracting HIV. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen alarming increases in depression and anxiety, as well as COVID-19 fears and worries. A better understanding of how mental health symptoms and fears surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted risk behaviors is crucial to remedying the growing public health concern of increasing overdoses and HIV infections. The goal of this project is to measure the potential impact of anxiety, depression, and COVID-19 fears on overdose and sexual risk behaviors. Brief statement of methods used: Adults (n = 214) who resided in Texas and reported regular use of illicit drugs were considered eligible for a longitudinal study assessing mental health among PWUD during COVID-19. For this secondary analysis, we used measures of anxiety (GAD-7), depression (CES-D), fear of COVID-19 (FCV-19), overdose risk behavior, and HIV and sexual risk behavior. We performed Fisher's odds ratio tests to determine whether scoring above the clinical cutoffs for anxiety, depression, or fear of COVID-19 significantly affected the risk of engaging in certain overdose or HIV and sexual risk behaviors. Summary of results: In regard to overdose risk behaviors, we found that high scores of anxiety and depression significantly increased the likelihood of using opioids and alcohol at the same time. Higher levels of anxiety also significantly raised the odds of using opioids alone or witnessing an overdose. Concerning HIV risk behaviors, high scores of anxiety significantly increased the odds of injecting drugs. On the contrary, high scores of COVID-19 fear significantly decreased the odds of engaging in sexual activity with someone who did not know their HIV status. Statement about conclusion: These results showed that individuals experiencing high levels of anxiety or depression are at a greater risk of engaging in risky behaviors that may lead to experiencing an overdose, while fear of COVID-19 may act as a protective factor against sexual risk behaviors. Harm reduction resources and safer drug use education should be made available to those most vulnerable.","Ogle, K.; Conway, F.; Shifflet, S.; Ramos, T.; Brinkley, K.; Claborn, K.","https://doi.org/10.1111/acer.14848","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research; 46:310A, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36268,""
"Association Between State Medicaid Expansion Status and Health Outcomes During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Objective To assess post-COVID-19 changes in insurance coverage, health behaviors, and self-assessed health among low-income, non-elderly adults by state Medicaid expansion status. Data sources We used nationally representative survey data from the 2016 through 2020 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The sample was restricted to adults aged 19-64 with household income below 138 percent of the federal poverty level (N=179,135). Study design We examined a broad set of outcomes related to coverage, health behaviors, and self-assessed health available in the BRFSS. We used a difference-in-differences model to compare changes in outcomes for individuals living in the 35 states and DC that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to those in the 15 non-expansion states before and after the COVID-19 pandemic commenced in March 2020. Data collection/extraction methods N/A Principal findings We found that the expansions provided some protection for low-income people during the pandemic. In 2020, relative to earlier years, people in expansion states were more likely to report very good or excellent health (0.049 percentage points, 95%CI=0.022,0.076;p&lt;0.01) and physical health (-0.393?days of poor physical health in the past month, 95%CI=-0.714,-0.072;p&lt;0.05), lower rates of smoking (-1.9 percentage points, 95%CI=-0.041,0.004;p&lt;0.10) and heavy drinking (-1.4 percentage points, 95%CI=-0.025,-0.004;p&lt;0.01), and higher flu vaccination rates (2.8 percentage points, 95%CI=0.005,0.051;p&lt;0.05) than those in non-expansion states. These benefits were particularly salient for Black and Hispanic individuals. We found no significant differences in insurance coverage, exercise, obesity, and self-assessed mental health between expansion and non-expansion states for the overall low-income sample. However, the expansion was associated with greater insurance coverage for Hispanic adults during the pandemic. Conclusions Investments in public health through expanding Medicaid may shield low-income populations from some of the health ramifications of public health emergencies.","Rakus, Alexandra, Soni, Aparna","https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-6773.14044","","Database: Wiley; Publication type: article; Publication details: Health Services Research; n/a(n/a), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36269,""

Their psychological well-being is necessary for the effective management of the health crisis. Objectives This study aims to assess the psychological state and worries of frontline doctors while dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, the various coping skills employed by them for maintaining their mental health, and the knowledge about illness and related myths and misinformation among them. A further objective is to compare the above between two groups of frontline doctors: the consultants and the junior residents (JR) working in the hospital. Materials and Methods A total of 164 participants (76 consultants and 88 JRs) were cross-sectionally evaluated online using a prevalidated questionnaire within a period of 3 months after obtaining institutional ethics approval Statistical Analysis The study sample and results were described using descriptive analysis. The association between the categorical variables was measured using chi-squared test. Results Most participants frequently updated themselves through reliable sources (consultants = 92%, JR = 73.9%) predominantly from the hospital task force and university. Overall, 71% of consultants and 58% of JRs were worried about being infected. JRs were significantly more worried about the spread of infection due to faulty sterilization of the protective equipment as compared to the consultants ( p = 0.031). Most participants were worried about their families getting infected (consultants = 79%, JR =89.8%). Both consultants (18.4%) and JRs (35.2%) had sleep disturbances. Although most did not have syndromal depressive features and COVID-19-related anxiety, tiredness (45.1%) and worrying too much (47.5%) were the most common psychological symptoms. Almost all participants (consultants = 76.3%, JR = 80.7%) used multiple coping styles, such as avoiding thinking about COVID-19, listening to music, and physical activities. Conclusion Frontline doctors overall reported higher worries regarding their family being infected and protective equipment-related issues, whereas they had less core depressive and anxiety symptoms. They had adequate COVID-19-related awareness and used multiple coping skills.","Apurva, Mittal, Kumar, Shishir, Prabhu, Santosh, Bhat U, Shrinivasa","https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0042-1751067","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Health and Allied Sciences NU;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36271,""
"A Preliminary Survey of the Postacute Symptoms of COVID-19 among Hospital-Discharged Patients and a Proposed Quantitative Framework for Assessment","Background Following a massive outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a significant number of survivors are still suffering from residual symptoms and complications. We designed a preliminary study to evaluate such symptom spectra in COVID-19 patients who had been discharged from the hospital. Methods A telephone interview was conducted with 100-randomly chosen hospital-discharged COVID-19 survivors from the electronic patient record. The interview structure and method were developed by a panel of experts. A specially trained group conducted the interviews and data collection. The statistical analysis was performed in accordance with the data type (continuous and categorical). Group comparisons were also done between intensive care unit (ICU) versus general ward admission, and patients discharged between 3 and 12 weeks versus more than 12 weeks. Additionally, world clouds were used for better visualization of various prevalent symptoms. Results Eighty-two participants were finally included for interview after preliminary screening. Fifty-three patients (64.6%) were male participants;74.4% had at least one symptom. In general, fatigue, cough, insomnia, and shortness of breath were the most common persistent symptoms. Symptoms were more prevalent among the patients discharged from ICU compared with those discharged from the general ward. Cough, loss of appetite, depression, and incoherence were more common in patients after 12 weeks of hospital discharge. Conclusion There is a wide range of persistent symptoms in the COVID-19 survivors who have been discharged from the hospital. Some symptoms arise or persisted even after 12 weeks. Based on the study results, available literature, and expert consensus, an assessment form has been developed that could be used for further research and clinical assessment of similar problems. Large-scale epidemiological study (longitudinal and cross-sectional) is needed to understand the nature and prevalence of the postacute phase of COVID-19 at the country level. The results of this study could inform the stakeholders and policymakers for taking necessary steps toward a further decision.","Dutta, Abhijit, Mitra, Subhasis, Mitra, Dalia","https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0042-1749182","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Health and Allied Sciences NU;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36272,""
"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on medical students: a scoping review protocol","The COVID-19 pandemic has spread globally and has been reported in every known country. The effects can be felt in universities and schools, shifting their learning to online platforms. However, medical schools bear the burden of protecting students and ensuring the continuation of the education process. The rapid transition to online learning, coupled with the lack of preparation from the educational system, leads to stresses that affect students' academic performance, mental health and social life. Nevertheless, no review tried to synthesise the complete picture of the pandemic's effects. Therefore, this scoping review aims to identify and explore the available literature on the effects or impacts of the pandemic on medical students without limiting it to specific dimensions. This review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews and the Joanna Briggs Institute manual for evidence synthesis. We examine articles reporting data from any country. However, only articles written in English will be included. For studies to be included, they must report any form of impact on medical students, qualitatively or quantitatively. Furthermore, the impact must occur within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Searches will be done on Medline, EMBASE, ERIC, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL and PsycInfo. After data extraction, we will narratively synthesise the data and explore the types of impacts COVID-19 has on medical students. No formal ethical approval is required. The scoping review will be published in peer-reviewed journals and as conference presentations and summaries, wherever appropriate.","Sanjaya, Edwin, Supantini","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-061852","20220818","COVID-19; MEDICAL EDUCATION &amp; TRAINING; MENTAL HEALTH","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36273,""
"Changes over time in anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms among healthcare workers in French emergency departments during the first COVID-19 outbreak","Assess the changes in anxiety, depression, and stress levels over time and identify risk factors among healthcare workers in French emergency departments (EDs) during the first COVID-19 outbreak. A prospective, multicenter study was conducted in 4 EDs and an emergency medical service (SAMU). During 3Ã¢â‚¬Â¯months, participants completed fortnightly questionnaires to assess anxiety, depression, and stress using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression and the Chamoux-Simard scale. The changes in anxiety, depression, and stress levels over time were modelled by a linear mixed model including a period effect and a continuous time effect within periods. A total of 211 respondents (43.5Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%) completed the survey at inclusion. There was a decrease in mean anxiety (from 7.33 to 5.05, pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001), mean depression (from 4.16 to 3.05, pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.009), mean stress at work (from 41.2 to 30.2, pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.008), and mean stress at home (from 33.0 to 26.0, pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.031) at the beginning of each period. The mean anxiety level was higher for administrative staff (+0.53) and lower for paramedics (-0.61, pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.047) compared to physicians. The anxiety level increased with the number of day and night shifts (0.13/day, pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001, 0.12/night, pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.025) as did stress at work (1.6/day, pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001, 1.1/night, pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.007). Reassigned healthcare workers were at higher risk of stress particularly compared to SAMU workers (stress at work: pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.015, at home: pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.021, in life in general: pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.018). Although anxiety, depression, and stress decreased over time, anxiety was higher among physicians and administrative staff.

"Chronic sequelae complicate convalescence from both dengue and acute viral respiratory illness","Long Covid has raised awareness of the potentially disabling chronic sequelae that afflicts patients after acute viral infection. Similar syndromes of post-infectious sequelae have also been observed after other viral infections such as dengue, but their true prevalence and functional impact remain poorly defined. We prospectively enrolled 209 patients with acute dengue (n = 48; one with severe dengue) and other acute viral respiratory infections (ARI) (n = 161), and followed them up for chronic sequelae up to one year post-enrolment, prior to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Baseline demographics and co-morbidities were balanced between both groups except for gender, with more males in the dengue cohort (63% vs 29%, p&lt;0.001). Except for the first visit, data on symptoms were collected remotely using a purpose-built mobile phone application. Mental health outcomes were evaluated using the validated SF-12v2 Health Survey. Almost all patients (95.8% of dengue and 94.4% of ARI patients) experienced at least one symptom of fatigue, somnolence, headache, concentration impairment or memory impairment within the first week of enrolment. Amongst patients with at least 3-months of follow-up, 18.0% in the dengue cohort and 14.6% in the ARI cohort experienced persistent symptoms. The median month-3 SF-12v2 Mental Component Summary Score was lower in patients who remained symptomatic at 3 months and beyond, compared to those whose symptoms fully resolved (47.7 vs. 56.0, p&lt;0.001), indicating that patients who self-reported persistence of symptoms also experienced functionally worse mental health. No statistically significant difference in age, gender distribution or hospitalisation status was observed between those with and without chronic sequelae. Our findings reveal an under-appreciated burden of post-infection chronic sequelae in dengue and ARI patients. They call for studies to define the pathophysiology of this condition, and determine the efficacy of both vaccines as well as antiviral drugs in preventing such sequelae.","Kalimuddin, Teh, Wee, Paintal, Sasisekharan, Low, Sheth, Ooi","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0010724","20220818","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36275,""
"Impact of prolonged PPE use on Canadian health professionals","To explore the impact that prolonged use of personal protective equipment (PPE) has on the skin integrity of Canadian health professionals. A descriptive, pan-Canadian, cross-sectional, online survey was carried out to explore the type and prevalence of PPE-related skin injury among Canadian health professionals. Convenience sampling was used to disseminate the online survey link to health professionals. There were responses from 757 health professionals. Masks worn included surgical masks (90%), a combination of surgical or N95/KN95 masks (7.7%) and an N95/KN95 mask alone (2.7%). Responses showed 84.6% of providers always wear a mask while at work with 38.5% wearing the same mask all shift; 90% of participants wore protective eye wear. Complications included soreness or pressure injuries behind the ears (70%), new or worsening acne (52%), a runny nose or sneezing (45%), itching (39%), and dry skin (37%). Hand issues included dry skin (53%), red skin (30%), itching (26%), broken skin (20%), rash (16%), and dermatitis (11%) - 51% of respondents did not moisturise their hands. Complications related to gown use included itching (6%), moisture-associated skin damage (5.5%), feeling claustrophobic (4.5%), and new or worsening acne (3%). Increased perspiration due to PPE was experienced in 87.5% of respondents. Some 43% of respondents noted their mental health became worse due to wearing PPE for prolonged periods. These findings should be used in the development of guidelines to prevent and manage PPE-related skin injuries among health professionals. Education for professionals should focus on skin protection, prevention of PPE-related skin complications and support for mental health issues.","LeBlanc, Woo, Wiesenfeld, Bresnai-Harris, Heerschap, Butt, Chaplain, Wiesenfeld","https://doi.org/10.12968/bjon.2022.31.15.S30","20220818","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Dermatitis; Device-related pressure injury; Personal protective equipment; Skin damage","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36276,""
"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic related stressors on patients with anxiety disorders: A cross-sectional study","The COVID-19 pandemic and related containment measures are affecting mental health, especially among patients with pre-existing mental disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the first wave and its aftermath of the pandemic in Germany (March-July) on psychopathology of patients diagnosed with panic disorder, social anxiety disorder and specific phobia who were on the waiting list or in current treatment at a German university-based outpatient clinic. From 108 patients contacted, forty-nine patients (45.37%) completed a retrospective survey on COVID-19 related stressors, depression, and changes in anxiety symptoms. Patients in the final sample (n = 47) reported a mild depression and significant increase in unspecific anxiety (d = .41), panic symptoms (d = .85) and specific phobia (d = .38), while social anxiety remained unaltered. Pandemic related stressors like job insecurities, familial stress and working in the health sector were significantly associated with more severe depression and increases in anxiety symptoms. High pre-pandemic symptom severity (anxiety/depression) was a risk factor, whereas meaningful work and being divorced/separated were protective factors (explained variance: 46.5% of changes in anxiety and 75.8% in depressive symptoms). In line with diathesis-stress models, patients show a positive association between stressors and symptom load. Health care systems are requested to address the needs of this vulnerable risk group by implementing timely and low-threshold interventions to prevent patients from further deterioration.","Langhammer, Peters, Ertle, Hilbert, Lueken","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0272215","20220818","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36277,""
"Real world effectiveness of digital mental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic created an unprecedented need for mental health services that can be remotely delivered. Digital mental health services that offer personalized care recommendations hold promise to efficiently expand service, but evidence of the effectiveness of digitally delivered mental health care in real-world settings remains limited. A retrospective cohort of adults (N = 1,852) receiving care through a digital mental health platform with elevated depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic was analyzed to estimate changes in subjective well-being and clinical improvement in depressive symptoms (using the World Health Organization-Five [WHO-5] Well-Being Index), as well as compare the relative effectiveness and cost of different care utilization patterns. The average improvement in WHO-5 score was 10.1 points (CI: 9.3-10.9, p&lt;0.001) at follow-up, which constituted a medium effect size (d = 0.73). The odds of clinical improvement in depressive symptoms were significantly greater among those who utilized telecoaching (aOR = 2.45, 95%CI: 1.91-3.15, p &lt; .001), teletherapy (aOR = 2.01, 95%CI: 1.57-2.57, p &lt; .001), and both services (aOR = 2.28, 95%CI: 1.67-3.11, p &lt; .001) compared to those who only utilized assessments, adjusting for baseline WHO-5 score, age, sex, and number of days between baseline and follow-up assessments. The average estimated cost of care for telecoaching was $124 per individual, which was significantly less than teletherapy ($413) or both services ($559). Digitally delivered care with a therapist and/or coach was effective in improving subjective well-being and clinical improvement in depressive symptoms. Although clinical outcomes were similar across utilization patterns, the cost of care was lowest among those utilizing telecoaching.","Prescott, Sagui-Henson, Welcome Chamberlain, Castro Sweet, Altman","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0272162","20220818","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36278,""
"Social Media Use and Well-being With Bipolar Disorder During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Path Analysis","Reliable and consistent social support is associated with the mental health and well-being of persons with severe mental illness, including bipolar disorder (BD). Yet the COVID-19 pandemic and associated social distancing measures (eg, shelter in place) reduced access to regular social contacts, while social media use (SMU) increased concomitantly. Little is currently known about associations between the well-being of adults with BD and different types of SMU (eg, passive and active). For this study, we had two goals. First, we report descriptive information regarding SMU by persons with BD during COVID-19 (all platforms). Specific to Facebook, we next developed and tested a hypothesized model to identify direct and indirect associations between BD symptoms, social support, loneliness, life satisfaction, and SMU. Responses were collected during the global spread of the Delta variant and prior/concurrent with the Omicron variant, 20 months after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. Over 8 weeks, we obtained responses from an international sample of 102 adults with BD using the Qualtrics online platform. Most had previously participated in the BADAS (Bipolar Affective Disorders and older Adults) Study (n=89, 87.3%); the remainder were recruited specifically for this research (n=13, 2.7%). The subsamples did not differ in age (t<sub>100</sub>=1.64; P=.10), gender (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup><sub>2</sub>=0.2; P=.90), socioeconomic status (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup><sub>6</sub>=9.9; P=.13), or time since BD diagnosis (t<sub>97</sub>=1.27; P=.21). Both were recruited using social media advertising micro-targeted to adults with BD. On average, participants were 53.96 (SD 13.22, range 20-77) years of age, they had completed 15.4 (SD 4.28) years of education, and were diagnosed with BD 19.6 (SD 10.31) years ago. Path analyses were performed to develop and test our hypothesized model. Almost all participants (n=95, 93.1%) reported having both Facebook and LinkedIn accounts; 91.2% (n=93) reported regular use of either or both. During the pandemic, most (n=62, 60.8%) reported accessing social media several times a day; 36.3% (n=37) reported using social media more often since the emergence of COVID-19. Specific to Facebook, the model we hypothesized differed somewhat from what emerged. The resulting model suggests that symptoms of depression predict loneliness and, inversely, social support and life satisfaction. Social support predicts social Facebook use, whereas passive Facebook use predicts life satisfaction. Symptoms of depression emerged as indirect predictors of SMU via social support. Our findings suggest that the operational definition of passive-active SMU requires further analysis and refinement. In contrast to theory, passive Facebook use appears positively associated with well-being among certain populations. Longitudinal data collection over multiple points is required to identify associations between BD symptoms, SMU, and well-being over time.","Pollock Star, Bachner, Cohen, Haglili, O'Rourke","https://doi.org/10.2196/39519","20220818","COVID-19; Facebook; advertisement; advertising; bipolar disorder; depression; depressive; hypo/mania; life satisfaction; loneliness; mania; manic; mental disorder; mental health; mental illness; social media; social media advertising; social media use; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36279,""
"Prevalence and pattern of intimate partner violence during COVID-19 pandemic among Nigerian adults","Our objectives were to determine the prevalence, pattern, and associated sociodemographic, psychosocial, and COVID-19-related factors associated with intimate partner violence (IPV) during the COVID-19 pandemic among Nigerian adults. We conducted an online survey among Nigerian adults (<i>n</i> = 994, aged 18-72 years) who completed the HARK questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Perceived Social Support Scale, and factors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Logistic regression was carried out with presence or absence of IPV as the outcome variable. Prevalence of IPV among women was 57.5%, while it was 42.5% among men, during the COVID-19 pandemic. IPV was significantly associated with younger age; having no children; increased threat of income due to COVID-19; anxiety; depression; reduced frequency of accessing COVID-19 updates via TV, radio, and news outlet; self-isolation due to COVID-19 symptoms; and self-reported impact of COVID-19 on recreation. A high monthly income, presence of anxiety and depressive symptoms, threat of COVID-19 to income, and self-reported impact of COVID-19 on recreation increased the odds of experiencing IPV. Our findings indicate that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the experience of IPV among adult Nigerians. The implications of our findings are that both men and women were affected by IPV during the COVID-19 pandemic. Modalities for reducing IPV and its aftermath among this population should include online psychosocial support measures, which may offer anonymity and reduced stigma.

"Post-COVID: effects of physical exercise on functional status and work ability in health care personnel","Post-COVID fatigue significantly limits recovery and return-to-work in COVID-19 survivors. We aimed to assess the effects of physical exercising on post-COVID-19-symptoms, physical/mental capacities and workability within a workplace-health-promotion project in health-care personnel. Thirty-two HCWs were enrolled in two groups based on Post-COVID-Functional Scale (PCFS) scores: (1) severe (SSG, <i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°11) and (2) mild (MSG, <i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°21) symptoms. The participants underwent an eight week exercise intervention program consisting of two supervised resistance exercise sessions per week plus individual aerobic exercise recommendations. Primary outcome-parameter for physical fitness was VO<sub>2</sub>peak. Further, physical function (6MWT, 30Ã¢â‚¬â€°s sit-to-stand test (30secSTS)), mental health (anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), stress (PSS-10), fatigue (BFI), resilience (BRS)), cognitive capacity (MoCA) and workability (WAI) were assessed at baseline, after 4Ã‚Â weeks and after completion of exercise intervention. VO<sub>2</sub>peak improved significantly in the SSG by 2.4Ã¢â‚¬â€°ml/kg/min (95% CI [1.48; 3.01], adj.<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and non-significantly in the MSG by 1.27Ã¢â‚¬â€°ml/kg/min (adj.<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.096). Both groups significantly improved their 30secSTS (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0236) and 6MWT (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0252) outcomes in both follow-ups (4Ã‚Â weeks and 8Ã‚Â weeks after inclusion). The SSG improved more than the MSG in VO<sub>2</sub>peak and 6MWT both after 4 and 8Ã‚Â weeks, respectively, although not statistically significant; findings were vice versa for the 30secSTS. 30secSTS outcomes correlated significantly with mental health outcomes and workability. Post-COVID exercise intervention improved physical fitness, psychological outcomes and workability in HCWs. Cases with severe fatigue showed higher benefit levels compared to those with mild symptoms. The safe and highly feasible 30secSTS correlated well with physical and mental outcomes and better workability in COVID-19 survivors.Implications for rehabilitationPhysical exercising showed to be an effective intervention method in the rehabilitation of COVID-19 survivors suffering from post-COVID syndrome by positively affecting both physical and mental health.In health care workers suffering from post-COVID syndrome, increases in physical performance are directly related to improvements in work ability.The 30Ã¢â‚¬â€°s sit-to-stand test (30secSTS) showed promising results as clinical assessment tool.The results of this study indicate that physical exercising will need to play a large and substantial role over the next years in the rehabilitation of COVID-19 survivors suffering from post-COVID-19-syndrome as it positively affects both physical and mental dimensions of the post-COVID-19-syndrome as well as work ability.","Hasenoehrl, Palma, Huber, Kastl, Steiner, Jordakieva, Crevenna","https://doi.org/10.1080/09638288.2022.2111467","20220818","COVID-19 rehabilitation; Health care workers; aerobic exercise; fatigue; medical exercise therapy; mental health; resistance exercise; workability","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36281,""
"A qualitative exploration of university student perspectives on mindfulness-based stress reduction exercises via smartphone app in Bangladesh","Mental health problems are proliferating, and access to mental health care is difficult due to barriers imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic in low-income countries such as Bangladesh. University students are susceptible to mental health concerns, given their unique stressors (i.e., academic pressure, new social environment). Mindfulness techniques can promote mental health , yet their acceptability has not been examined among Bangladeshi university students. These techniques can be used on a digital app, to decrease barriers to use.Qualitative methods were used to examine the acceptability of mindfulness among university students in Bangladesh. In-depth interviews (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 12) were conducted to examine student reactions to linguistically (Bangla) and culturally adapted mindfulness exercises. Thematic analysis generated three themes (1) previous experience with mindfulness (2) positive responses to and (3) improvements to mindfulness exercises. The results showed favourable attitudes towards the mindfulness content; students expressed positive psychological and physiological reactions. Students welcomed the concept of using these exercises on an app and felt it could overcomepast barriers to help-seeking. This evidence suggests the value of exploring the acceptability of an app with mindfulness exercises for mental health promotion through a larger-scale pilot study in university students in Bangladesh.","Sifat, Tasnim, Stoebenau, Green","https://doi.org/10.1080/17482631.2022.2113015","20220818","Bangladesh; Mindfulness; app; digital health; global mental health; mental health promotion; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36282,""
"""At First It Wasn't so Bad"": How Adults Aged 60 and Older Feel About Social Distancing During COVID-19","We conducted an exploratory study to describe the emotional experience of adults aged 60 and older in the United States practicing social distancing during COVID-19. The survey asked respondents how they were feeling during social distancing. Responses (n=673) were coded into segments by affect and then specific emotional states. A large portion of respondents reported negative emotions (e.g. anxiety, loneliness). A smaller portion reported positive emotions (e.g. optimism, gratitude). Younger respondents (aged 60-70) reported more feelings of anxiousness and fear compared to older respondents (71+). Older respondents were more likely to report negative feelings towards the government. For both age groups, female respondents were significantly more likely to report feeling afraid and having negative feelings about their own health. We conclude that many older adults are vulnerable to negative emotional outcomes during the pandemic. This highlights the importance of interventions targeting vulnerable older adults.","Emerson, Kim, Mois, Beer","https://doi.org/10.1080/01634372.2022.2111741","20220818","mental health; older adults; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36283,""
"Evaluation of Anxiety, Depression, and Work-Related Strain Inventory of Code Blue Teams in Turkey During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Survey Study","This study aimed to evaluate the anxiety, depression, and work-related strain inventory with a cross-sectional electronic questionnaire in code blue teams during the coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic in Turkey. A web-based electronic questionnaire was sent to healthcare workers registered in the database of the Turkish Society of Anaesthesiology and Reanimation and the Turkish Resuscitation Council who are in the code blue teams of the hospital where they work. An electronic questionnaire including the hospital anxiety-depression scale and the work-related strain inventory was sent to healthcare professionals. A total of 259 participants who answered the questionnaire were included in the study. It was determined that 41.3% (n=107) of all participants were at risk in terms of anxiety and 64.1% (n=166) were at risk in terms of depression by taking above the threshold value. The mean work-related strain inventory score of the participants was found to be 41.19 Ã‚Â± 6.31. The mean work-related strain inventory values of the participants who received above-threshold values from both the anxiety and depression subscales were also found to be statistically significantly higher than the participants who received below-threshold values (P &lt;.001). It was determined that approximately half of the code blue teams were at risk for anxiety and two-thirds of them for depression.","Ãƒâ€“zdemir, BirbiÃƒÂ§er, Doruk, SagÃƒÂ¼n","https://doi.org/10.5152/TJAR.2021.21423","20220818","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36284,""
"Demoralization during the Italian quarantine due to 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic: prevalence and association with psychological well-being and coping strategies","The aims of the study were to investigate demoralization in a sample of Italian citizens during the Italian quarantine due to COVID-19 pandemic and to explore its associations with psychological well-being, coping strategies, participants' socio-demographic characteristics and COVID-19-related factors. Italian citizens aged over 18 and quarantined in Italy were recruited. A cross-sectional online survey was launched through a snow-ball sampling and 1123 surveys were collected. Participants answered ad hoc questions and completed the Psychological General Well-Being Index, the Demoralization Scale, and the Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced-New Italian Version. Disheartenment, dysphoria, and sense of failure were the subdimensions of demoralization with higher scores. Demoralization was associated with depressed mood, positive well-being, self-control, general health, vitality, problem-solving, and avoidance and religious coping strategies. Individuals who were female, older, without children and not working during quarantine had higher demoralization. Quarantine-related changes can elicit demoralization that is associated to lower psychological well-being. Problem-solving and religious coping can protect against demoralization, while avoidant coping strategies can exacerbate it. Assessing and treating demoralization, especially in the categories of citizens most at risk of developing it, could be useful to provide adequate care against COVID-19-related distress.","Botto, Galante, Miniotti, Leombruni","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2022.2113104","20220818","COVID-19; coping strategies; demoralization; pandemic; psychological well-being; quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36285,""
"Shared sources and mechanisms of healthcare worker distress in COVID-19: a comparative qualitative study in Canada and the UK","<b>Background:</b> COVID-19 has had a significant impact on the wellbeing of healthcare workers, with quantitative studies identifying increased stress, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and PTSD in a wide range of settings. Limited qualitative data so far has offered in-depth details concerning what underlies these challenges, but none provide comprehensive comparison across different healthcare systems. <b>Objective:</b> To explore qualitative findings relating to healthcare worker distress from two different countries to understand the nuanced similarities and differences with respect to the sources and impact of distress relating to COVID-19. <b>Method:</b> A comparative interpretive thematic analysis was carried out between two qualitative data sets examining healthcare workers' experiences of distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from Canada and the UK were collected in parallel and analyzed in an iterative, collaborative process. <b>Results:</b> A number of sources of distress cut across both study settings including concerns about safety and patient care, challenges at home or in one's personal life, communication issues, work environment, media and public perception, and government responses to the pandemic. These sit on a spectrum from individual to institutional sources and were mutually reinforcing. Our analysis also suggested that common mechanisms such as exacerbations in uncertainty, hypervigilance, and moral injury underpinned these sources, which contributed to how they were experienced as distressing. <b>Conclusion:</b> This is the first international collaboration utilising qualitative data to examine this pressing issue. Despite differences in the political, social, health service, and pandemic-related context, the sources and mechanisms of distress experienced by healthcare workers in Canada and the UK were remarkably similar. <b>HIGHLIGHTS</b> This international comparative qualitative study explores how mechanisms that lead to distress are shared across different geographies and cultures, even as the local context shapes the sources of distress themselves. <b>Antecedentes:</b> La COVID-19 ha tenido un impacto significativo en el bienestar de los trabajadores de la salud, con estudios cuantitativos que identifican un aumento del estrÃƒÂ©s, la ansiedad, la depresiÃƒÂ³n, el insomnio, y el TEPT en una amplia variedad de entornos. Hasta ahora, los datos cualitativos son limitados y han ofrecido un profundo detalle sobre lo que subyace a estos desafÃƒÂ­os, pero ninguno proporciona una comparaciÃƒÂ³n exhaustiva entre los diferentes sistemas de atenciÃƒÂ³n de salud.<b>Objetivo:</b> Explorar los hallazgos cualitativos relacionados con la angustia de los trabajadores de la salud de dos paÃƒÂ­ses diferentes para comprender las sutiles similitudes y diferencias con respecto a las fuentes y el impacto de la angustia relacionada con la COVID-19.<b>MÃƒÂ©todo:</b> Se llevÃƒÂ³ a cabo un anÃƒÂ¡lisis temÃƒÂ¡tico interpretativo comparativo entre dos conjuntos de datos cualitativos que examinaron las experiencias de angustia de los trabajadores de la salud durante la pandemia de la COVID-19. Los datos de CanadÃƒÂ¡ y el Reino Unido se recopilaron en paralelo y se analizaron en un proceso colaborativo iterativo.<b>Resultados:</b> Una serie de fuentes de angustia atraviesan ambos entornos de estudio, incluidas las preocupaciones sobre la seguridad y el cuidado del paciente, los desafÃƒÂ­os en el hogar o en la vida personal, los problemas de comunicaciÃƒÂ³n, el entorno laboral, la percepciÃƒÂ³n pÃƒÂºblica y de los medios de comunicaciÃƒÂ³n, y las respuestas gubernamentales a la pandemia. Estos se ubican en un espectro desde fuentes individuales hasta institucionales y se reforzaron mutuamente. Nuestro anÃƒÂ¡lisis tambiÃƒÂ©n sugiriÃƒÂ³ que mecanismos comunes como las exacerbaciones de la incertidumbre, la hipervigilancia, y el daÃƒÂ±o moral sustentaban estas fuentes, lo que contribuyÃƒÂ³ a que se experimentaran como angustiosas.<b>ConclusiÃƒÂ³n:</b> Esta es la primera colaboraciÃƒÂ³n internacional que utiliza datos cualitativos para examinar este apremiante problema. A pesar de las diferencias en el contexto polÃƒÂ­tico, social, de servicios de salud y relacionado con la pandemia, las fuentes y los mecanismos de angustia experimentados por los trabajadores de la salud en CanadÃƒÂ¡ y el Reino Unido fueron notablemente similares. <b>Ã¨Æ’Å’Ã¦â„¢Â¯Ã¯Â¼Å¡</b>COVID-19 Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ§Å¡â€žÃ§Â¦ÂÃ§Â¥â€°Ã¤ÂºÂ§Ã§â€Å¸Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¥Â¤Â§Ã¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â®Å¡Ã©â€¡ÂÃ§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¥Ââ€˜Ã§Å½Â°Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¥Â¹Â¿Ã¦Â³â€ºÃ§Å¡â€žÃ§Å½Â¯Ã¥Â¢Æ’Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¦Â¿â‚¬Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¦Å â€˜Ã©Æ’ÂÃ£â‚¬ÂÃ¥Â¤Â±Ã§Å“Â Ã¥â€™Å’ PTSD Ã¥Â¢Å¾Ã¥Å Â Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¨Â¿â€žÃ¤Â»Å Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ¦Â­Â¢Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¦Å“â€°Ã©â„¢ÂÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â®Å¡Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¦â€¢Â°Ã¦ÂÂ®Ã¦ÂÂÃ¤Â¾â€ºÃ¤Âºâ€ Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¨Â¿â„¢Ã¤Âºâ€ºÃ¦Å’â€˜Ã¦Ë†ËœÃ¨Æ’Å’Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¨Â¯Â¦Ã§Â»â€ Ã¤Â¿Â¡Ã¦ÂÂ¯Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â½â€ Ã¦Â²Â¡Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¦ÂÂÃ¤Â¾â€ºÃ¨Â·Â¨Ã¤Â¸ÂÃ¥ÂÅ’Ã¥Å’Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¤Â¿ÂÃ¥ÂÂ¥Ã§Â³Â»Ã§Â»Å¸Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Â»Â¼Ã¥ÂË†Ã¦Â¯â€Ã¨Â¾Æ’Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§â€ºÂ®Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¯Â¼Å¡</b>Ã¦Å½Â¢Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¦ÂÂ¥Ã¨â€¡ÂªÃ¤Â¸Â¤Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ¤Â¸ÂÃ¥ÂÅ’Ã¥â€ºÂ½Ã¥Â®Â¶Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸Å½Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ§â€”â€ºÃ¨â€¹Â¦Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â®Å¡Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¨Â§Â£ COVID-19 Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã§â€”â€ºÃ¨â€¹Â¦Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂºÂÃ¥â€™Å’Ã¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ¦â€“Â¹Ã©ÂÂ¢Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Â»â€ Ã¥Â¾Â®Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¤Â¼Â¼Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥Â·Â®Ã¥Â¼â€šÃ£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â³â€¢Ã¯Â¼Å¡</b>Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¤Â¸Â¤Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ¨â‚¬Æ’Ã¦Å¸Â¥COVID-19 Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ§â€”â€ºÃ¨â€¹Â¦Ã§Â»ÂÃ¥Å½â€ Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â®Å¡Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¦â€¢Â°Ã¦ÂÂ®Ã©â€ºâ€ Ã¤Â¹â€¹Ã©â€”Â´Ã¨Â¿â€ºÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¦Â¯â€Ã¨Â¾Æ’Ã¨Â§Â£Ã©â€¡Å Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¤Â¸Â»Ã©Â¢ËœÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ£â‚¬â€šÃ¦ÂÂ¥Ã¨â€¡ÂªÃ¥Å Â Ã¦â€¹Â¿Ã¥Â¤Â§Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¨â€¹Â±Ã¥â€ºÂ½Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦â€¢Â°Ã¦ÂÂ®Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã¨Â¡Å’Ã¦â€Â¶Ã©â€ºâ€ Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ¨Â¿Â­Ã¤Â»Â£Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¥ÂÂÃ¤Â½Å“Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¨Â¿â€¡Ã§Â¨â€¹Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¨Â¿â€ºÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã¯Â¼Å¡</b>Ã¤Â¸Â¤Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã§Å½Â¯Ã¥Â¢Æ’Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã©Æ’Â½Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¨Â®Â¸Ã¥Â¤Å¡Ã¥â€ºÂ°Ã¦â€°Â°Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂºÂÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Å’â€¦Ã¦â€¹Â¬Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¥Â®â€°Ã¥â€¦Â¨Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¦Å Â¤Ã§Ââ€ Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦â€¹â€¦Ã¥Â¿Â§Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¥Â®Â¶Ã¥ÂºÂ­Ã¦Ë†â€“Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ¤ÂºÂºÃ§â€Å¸Ã¦Â´Â»Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦Å’â€˜Ã¦Ë†ËœÃ£â‚¬ÂÃ¦Â²Å¸Ã©â‚¬Å¡Ã©â€”Â®Ã©Â¢ËœÃ£â‚¬ÂÃ¥Â·Â¥Ã¤Â½Å“Ã§Å½Â¯Ã¥Â¢Æ’Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¥Âªâ€™Ã¤Â½â€œÃ¥â€™Å’Ã¥â€¦Â¬Ã¤Â¼â€”Ã¨Â®Â¤Ã§Å¸Â¥Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã¥ÂÅ Ã¦â€Â¿Ã¥ÂºÅ“Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥ÂÂÃ¥Âºâ€Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¨Â¿â„¢Ã¤Âºâ€ºÃ©ÂÂÃ¥Â¸Æ’Ã¤Â»Å½Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ¤ÂºÂºÃ¥Ë†Â°Ã¦Å“ÂºÃ¦Å¾â€žÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¦ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂºÂÃ¨Â°Â±Ã§Â³Â»Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã¤Â¸â€Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¤Âºâ€™Ã¥Â¢Å¾Ã¥Â¼ÂºÃ£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Ë†â€˜Ã¤Â»Â¬Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ¨Â¿ËœÃ¨Â¡Â¨Ã¦ËœÅ½Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â¸ÂÃ§Â¡Â®Ã¥Â®Å¡Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¥Å Â Ã¥â€°Â§Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ©Â«ËœÃ¨Â­Â¦Ã¨Â§â€°Ã¥â€™Å’Ã©Ââ€œÃ¥Â¾Â·Ã¤Â¼Â¤Ã¥Â®Â³Ã§Â­â€°Ã¥Â¯Â¼Ã¨â€¡Â´Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¤Â»Â¬Ã¦â€žÅ¸Ã¥Ë†Â°Ã§â€”â€ºÃ¨â€¹Â¦Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¸Â¸Ã¨Â§ÂÃ¦Å“ÂºÃ¥Ë†Â¶Ã¦ËœÂ¯Ã¨Â¿â„¢Ã¤Âºâ€ºÃ¦ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂºÂÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¥Å¸ÂºÃ§Â¡â‚¬Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¨Â®ÂºÃ¯Â¼Å¡</b>Ã¨Â¿â„¢Ã¦ËœÂ¯Ã§Â¬Â¬Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¦Â¬Â¡Ã¥Ë†Â©Ã§â€Â¨Ã¥Â®Å¡Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¦â€¢Â°Ã¦ÂÂ®Ã¦ÂÂ¥Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¨Â¿â„¢Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã§Â´Â§Ã¨Â¿Â«Ã©â€”Â®Ã©Â¢ËœÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¥â€ºÂ½Ã©â„¢â€¦Ã¥ÂË†Ã¤Â½Å“Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Â°Â½Ã§Â®Â¡Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¦â€Â¿Ã¦Â²Â»Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ§Â¤Â¾Ã¤Â¼Å¡Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¥ÂÂ«Ã§â€Å¸Ã¦Å“ÂÃ¥Å Â¡Ã¥â€™Å’Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¨Æ’Å’Ã¦â„¢Â¯Ã¤Â¸â€¹Ã¥Â­ËœÃ¥Å“Â¨Ã¥Â·Â®Ã¥Â¼â€šÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Å Â Ã¦â€¹Â¿Ã¥Â¤Â§Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¨â€¹Â±Ã¥â€ºÂ½Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¦â€°â‚¬Ã§Â»ÂÃ¥Å½â€ Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§â€”â€ºÃ¨â€¹Â¦Ã¦ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂºÂÃ¥â€™Å’Ã¦Å“ÂºÃ¥Ë†Â¶Ã©ÂÅ¾Ã¥Â¸Â¸Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¤Â¼Â¼Ã£â‚¬â€š.","Berkhout, Billings, Abou Seif, Singleton, Stein, Hegarty, Ondruskova, Soulios, Bloomfield, Greene, Seto, Abbey, Sheehan","https://doi.org/10.1080/20008066.2022.2107810","20220818","COVID-19; distress; healthcare workers; mental health; trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36286,""
"Legacy of neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with past COVID-19 infection: A cause of concern","Although primarily affecting the respiratory system, growing attention is being paid to the neuropsychiatric consequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. Acute and sub-acute neuropsychiatric manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease and their mechanisms are better studied and understood currently than they had been when the pandemic began; however, many months or years will be necessary to fully comprehend how significant the consequences of such complications will be. In this editorial, we discuss the possible long-term sequelae of the COVID-19 pandemic, deriving our considerations on experiences drawn from past coronaviruses' outbreaks, such as the SARS and the middle east respiratory syndrome, and from the knowledge of the mechanisms of neurotropism and invasiveness of SARS-CoV-2. Acknowledging the global spread of COVID-19 and the vast number of people affected, to date amounting to many millions, the matter of this pandemic's neuropsychiatric legacy appears concerning. Public health monitoring strategies and early interventions seem to be necessary to manage the possible emergence of a severe wave of neuropsychiatric distress among the survivors.","De Berardis, Di Carlo, Di Giannantonio, Pettorruso","https://doi.org/10.5498/wjp.v12.i6.773","20220818","COVID-19; Depression; Mental health; Neuropsychiatric sequelae; Neuropsychiatric symptoms; Post-traumatic stress disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36287,""
"Adolescent social emotional skills, resilience and behavioral problems during the COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal study in three European countries","The consequences of long-lasting restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic have become a topical question in the latest research. The present study aims to analyze longitudinal changes in adolescents' social emotional skills, resilience, and behavioral problems. Moreover, the study addresses the impact of adolescents' social emotional learning on changes in their resilience and behavioral problems over the course of seven months of the pandemic. The Time 1 (T1) and Time 2 (T2) measuring points were in October 2020 and May 2021, characterized by high mortality rates and strict restrictions in Europe. For all three countries combined, 512 questionnaires were answered by both adolescents (aged 11-13 and 14-16 years) and their parents. The SSIS-SEL and SDQ student self-report and parent forms were used to evaluate adolescents' social emotional skills and behavioral problems. The CD-RISC-10 scale was administered to adolescents to measure their self-reported resilience. Several multilevel models were fitted to investigate the changes in adolescents' social emotional skills, resilience, and behavioral problems, controlling for age and gender. Correlation analysis was carried out to investigate how changes in the adolescents' social emotional skills were associated with changes in their resilience and mental health adjustment. Comparing T1 and T2 evaluations, adolescents claim they have more behavioral problems, have less social emotional skills, and are less prosocial than perceived by their parents, and this result applies across all countries and age groups. Both informants agree that COVID-19 had a negative impact, reporting an increment in the mean internalizing and externalizing difficulties scores and reductions in social emotional skills, prosocial behavior, and resilience scores. However, these changes are not very conspicuous, and most of them are not significant. Correlation analysis shows that changes in adolescents' social emotional skills are negatively and significantly related to changes in internalized and externalized problems and positively and significantly related to changes in prosocial behavior and resilience. This implies that adolescents who experienced larger development in social emotional learning also experienced more increase in resilience and prosocial behavior and a decrease in difficulties. Due to its longitudinal design, sample size, and multi-informant approach, this study adds to a deeper understanding of the pandemic's consequences on adolescents' mental health.","Martinsone, Stokenberga, Damberga, Supe, SimÃƒÂµes, Lebre, Canha, Santos, Santos, Fonseca, Santos, Gaspar de Matos, Conte, Agliati, Cavioni, Gandellini, Grazzani, Ornaghi, Camilleri","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.942692","20220818","COVID-19; adolescents; behavioral problems; longitudinal research; mental health; multi-informant approach; social emotional learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36288,""
"Risk perception and mental health among college students in China during the COVID-19 pandemic: A moderated mediation model","Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, it has spread on a large scale around the world, seriously affecting people's physical and mental health. In China, almost all schools have postponed semesters, suspended offline classes, and implemented closed-off management, which has brought significant challenges to the study and life of college students. The study aimed to explore the relationship between risk perception, perceived stress, perceived control, and mental health among Chinese college students. This cross-sectional study was conducted among 1,856 college students. The results showed that risk perception was positively correlated with mental health. After adding the mediating variable of perceived stress, risk perception still significantly predicted mental health. In addition, the interaction term of perceived stress and perceived control significantly negatively predicted mental health. Specifically, perceived stress significantly affected mental health in the low-perceived control group. In contrast, in the high-perceived control group, the predictive effect of perceived stress on mental health disappeared. The present study showed that perceived stress partially mediated the relationship between risk perception and mental health; perceived control moderated the relationship between perceived stress and mental health, and high perceived control could buffer the effect of perceived stress on mental health.","Li, Cao, Yang, Yan, Wang, Ma","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.955093","20220818","coronavirus disease; mental health; perceived control; perceived stress; risk perception","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36289,""

"The role of the industrial psychologist in managing the psychological impact of COVID-19 in the workplace","Recently, the world experienced dramatic changes due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Working remotely led to employees feeling isolated and experiencing fatigue and depression. The responsibility of addressing the psychological wellbeing of employees lies with industrial psychology practitioners. They support line management by counseling employees experiencing social and psychological problems. The objective of the present study was to explore the role of the industrial psychology practitioner in managing the psychological impact of COVID-19 on employees. Using a homogeneous sampling technique, a qualitative research design was employed based on social constructivism. Semi-structured interviews and a qualitative survey were utilized to gather the data from industrial psychology practitioners (<i>n</i> = 22) registered as psychologists and interns. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze the data. Most participants believed that the onset of COVID-19 led to accelerated change in the workplace. The findings suggest that an industrial psychology practitioner's role in the changing world of work enables organizations to be prepared for the changes by providing multi-level interventions. Recommendations are made to organizations to implement interventions to facilitate support for employees in their attempt to deal with the psychological impact of COVID-19 on employees.","Moralo, Graupner","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.920894","20220818","COVID-19; industrial psychology; mental health; psychological impact; workplace counseling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36291,""
"The role of psychosocial factors in explaining sex differences in major depression and generalized anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic","Understanding how pandemics differentially impact on the socio-protective and psychological outcomes of males and females is important to develop more equitable public health policies. We assessed whether males and females differed on measures of major depression and generalized anxiety during the COVID-19 the pandemic, and if so, which sociodemographic, pandemic, and psychological variables may affect sex differences in depression and anxiety. Participants were a nationally representative sample of Irish adults (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1,032) assessed between April 30<sup>th</sup> to May 19<sup>th</sup>, 2020, during Ireland's first COVID-19 nationwide quarantine. Participants completed self-report measures of anxiety (GAD-7) and depression (PHQ-9), as well as 23 sociodemographic pandemic-related, and psychological variables. Sex differences on measures of depression and anxiety were assessed using binary logistic regression analysis and differences in sociodemographic, pandemic, and psychological variables assessed using chi-square tests of independence and independent samples t-tests. Females were significantly more likely than males to screen positive for major depressive disorder (30.6% vs. 20.7%; Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> (1)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°13.26, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001, ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.69 [95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.27, 2.25]), and generalised anxiety disorder (23.3% vs. 14.4%; Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> (1)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°13.42, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001, ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.81 [95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.31, 2.49]). When adjusted for all other sex-varying covariates however, sex was no longer significantly associated with screening positive for depression (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.80, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.51, 1.25) or GAD (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.97, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.60, 1.57). Observed sex-differences in depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of Ireland are best explained by psychosocial factors of COVID-19 related anxiety, trait neuroticism, lower sleep quality, higher levels of loneliness, greater somatic problems, and, in the case of depression, increases in childcaring responsibilities and lower trait consciousnesses. Implications of these findings for public health policy and interventions are discussed.","ValliÃƒÂ¨res, Murphy, McBride, Shevlin, Gilmore, Travers, Nolan, Butter, Karatzias, Bentall, Hyland","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-13954-8","20220817","Anxiety; COVID-19 pandemic; Depression; Sex-differences","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36292,""
"Increased cannabis intake during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with worsening of depression symptoms in people with PTSD","Some evidence suggests substance use affects clinical outcomes in people with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, more work is required to examine links between mental health and cannabis use in PTSD during exposure to external stressors such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This study assessed mental health factors in individuals with self-reported PTSD to: (a) determine whether stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms were associated with changes in cannabis consumption across the pandemic, and (b) to contrast the degree to which clinically significant perceived symptom worsening was associated with changes in cannabis intake. Data were obtained as part of a larger web-based population survey from April 3rd to June 24th 2020 (i.e., first wave of the pandemic in Canada). Participants (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°462) with self-reported PTSD completed questionnaires to assess mental health symptoms and answered questions pertaining to their cannabis intake. Participants were categorized according to whether they were using cannabis or not, and if using, whether their use frequency increased, decreased, or remained unchanged during the pandemic. Findings indicated an overall perceived worsening of stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms across all groups. A higher-than-expected proportion of individuals who increased their cannabis consumption reached threshold for minimal clinically important worsening of depression, X<sup>2</sup>(3)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°10.795, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.013 (Cramer's VÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.166). Overall, those who increased cannabis use during the pandemic were more prone to undergo meaningful perceived worsening of depression symptoms. Prospective investigations will be critical next steps to determine the directionality of the relationship between cannabis and depressive symptoms.","Murkar, Kendzerska, Shlik, Quilty, Saad, Robillard","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-04185-7","20220817","Anxiety; COVID-19; Cannabis; Depression; PTSD; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36293,""
"Synergy Between Public and Private Health Care Organizations During COVID-19 on Twitter: Sentiment and Engagement Analysis Using Forecasting Models","Social media platforms (SMPs) are frequently used by various pharmaceutical companies, public health agencies, and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) for communicating health concerns, new advancements, and potential outbreaks. Although the benefits of using them as a tool have been extensively discussed, the online activity of various health care organizations on SMPs during COVID-19 in terms of engagement and sentiment forecasting has not been thoroughly investigated. The purpose of this research is to analyze the nature of information shared on Twitter, understand the public engagement generated on it, and forecast the sentiment score for various organizations. Data were collected from the Twitter handles of 5 pharmaceutical companies, 10 US and Canadian public health agencies, and the World Health Organization (WHO) from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2021. A total of 181,469 tweets were divided into 2 phases for the analysis, before COVID-19 and during COVID-19, based on the confirmation of the first COVID-19 community transmission case in North America on February 26, 2020. We conducted content analysis to generate health-related topics using natural language processing (NLP)-based topic-modeling techniques, analyzed public engagement on Twitter, and performed sentiment forecasting using 16 univariate moving-average and machine learning (ML) models to understand the correlation between public opinion and tweet contents. We utilized the topics modeled from the tweets authored by the health care organizations chosen for our analysis using nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF): c<sub>umass</sub>=-3.6530 and -3.7944 before and during COVID-19, respectively. The topics were chronic diseases, health research, community health care, medical trials, COVID-19, vaccination, nutrition and well-being, and mental health. In terms of user impact, WHO (user impact=4171.24) had the highest impact overall, followed by public health agencies, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; user impact=2895.87), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH; user impact=891.06). Among pharmaceutical companies, Pfizer's user impact was the highest at 97.79. Furthermore, for sentiment forecasting, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous factors (SARIMAX) models performed best on the majority of the subsets of data (divided as per the health care organization and period), with the mean absolute error (MAE) between 0.027 and 0.084, the mean square error (MSE) between 0.001 and 0.011, and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) between 0.031 and 0.105. Our findings indicate that people engage more on topics such as COVID-19 than medical trials and customer experience. In addition, there are notable differences in the user engagement levels across organizations. Global organizations, such as WHO, show wide variations in engagement levels over time. The sentiment forecasting method discussed presents a way for organizations to structure their future content to ensure maximum user engagement.","Singhal, Baxi, Mago","https://doi.org/10.2196/37829","20220818","Twitter; content analysis; health care; natural language processing; pharmaceutical; public engagement; public health; sentiment forecasting; social media; user engagement","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36294,""
"Examining the Relationship Between Pediatric Behavioral Health and Parent Productivity Through a Parent-Reported Survey in the Time of COVID-19: Exploratory Study","Pediatric behavioral health needs skyrocketed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Parents and caregivers lacked access to well-established tools to identify risk and protective factors while also experiencing decreased access to treatment options to meet their families' behavioral health needs. The aim of this study is to investigate the associations of known pediatric behavioral health risk factors and parents' reports of workplace productivity. A clinical research team at Brightline-a virtual, pediatric behavioral health solution-drew on standardized instruments to create a survey designed to understand pediatric behavioral health conditions, child stress, and family resilience and connection during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multivariable linear regression was used to characterize the relationship between these variables and parents' reports of workplace productivity. Participants (N=361) completed the survey between October 2020 and November 2021. In the multivariable model, higher pediatric stress and time spent managing children's behavioral health needs were associated with greater productivity loss among working parents, whereas higher family connection was associated with lower productivity loss. COVID-19 diagnoses among parents and dependents, financial impact of COVID-19 on households, and family resilience were not associated with parents' workplace productivity. This survey captured child stress, family connection, and productivity as reported by parents and caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Exploratory studies are the first step in understanding the relationship between these variables. The results from this study can empower parents by providing insights to help manage their child's behavioral health concerns and identify pediatric behavioral health services to aid working parents who are caregivers.","Grodberg, Bridgewater, Loo, Bravata","https://doi.org/10.2196/37285","20220818","COVID-19; adolescent; behavioral health; child, family health; mental health; productivity; protective factors; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-19","",36295,""
