"Relationship between COVID-19 infection and neurodegeneration: Computational insight into interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the monoamine oxidase enzymes","Although COVID-19 has been primarily associated with pneumonia, recent data show that its causative agent, the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, can infect many vital organs beyond the lungs, including the heart, kidneys and the brain. The literature agrees that COVID-19 is likely to have long-term mental health effects on infected individuals, which signifies a need to understand the role of the virus in the pathophysiology of brain disorders that is currently unknown and widely debated. Our docking and molecular dynamic simulations show that the affinity of the spike protein from the wild type (WT) and the South African B.1.351 (SA) variant towards the MAO enzymes is comparable to that for its ACE2 receptor. This allows for the WT/SA***MAO complex formation, which changes MAO affinities for their neurotransmitter substrates, thus consequently impacting the rates of their metabolic conversion and misbalancing their levels. Knowing that this fine regulation is strongly linked with the etiology of various brain pathologies, these results are the first to highlight the possibility that the interference with the brain MAO catalytic activity is responsible for the increased neurodegenerative illnesses following a COVID-19 infection, thus placing a neurobiological link between these two conditions in the spotlight. Since the obtained insight suggests that a more contagious SA variant causes even larger disturbances, and with new and more problematic strains likely emerging in the near future, we firmly advise that the presented prospect of the SARS-CoV-2 induced neurological complications should not be ignored, but rather requires further clinical investigations to achieve an early diagnosis and timely therapeutic interventions.","Lucija Hok; Hrvoje Rimac; Janez Mavri; Robert Vianello","https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.30.458208","20210831","","bioRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-31","",17514,""
"The COVID-19 Pandemic and Mental Health Concerns on Twitter in the United States","Background: Mental health illness is a growing problem in recent years. During the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health concerns (such as fear and loneliness) have been actively discussed on social media. Objective: In this study, we aim to examine mental health discussions on Twitter during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States and infer the demographic composition of Twitter users who had mental health concerns. Methods: COVID-19 related tweets from March 5th, 2020 to January 31st, 2021 were collected through Twitter streaming API using COVID-19 related keywords (e.g., ""corona"", ""covid19"", ""covid""). By further filtering using mental health keywords (e.g., ""depress"", ""failure"", ""hopeless""), we extracted mental health-related tweets from the US. Topic modeling using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model was conducted to monitor users' discussions surrounding mental health concerns. Demographic inference using deep learning algorithms (including Face++ and Ethnicolr) was performed to infer the demographic composition of Twitter users who had mental health concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: We observed a positive correlation between mental health concerns on Twitter and the COVID-19 pandemic in the US. Topic modeling showed that ""stay-at-home"", ""death poll"" and ""politics and policy"" were the most popular topics in COVID-19 mental health tweets. Among Twitter users who had mental health concerns during the pandemic, Males, White, and 30-49 age group people were more likely to express mental health concerns. In addition, Twitter users from the east and west coast had more mental health concerns. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has a significant impact on mental health concerns on Twitter in the US. Certain groups of people (such as Males, White) were more likely to have mental health concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Senqi Zhang; Li Sun; Daiwei Zhang; Pin Li; Yue Liu; Ajay Anand; Zidian Xie; Dongmei Li","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.23.21262489","20210830","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-31","",17515,""
"Effects of Social Distancing on Diabetes Management in Older Adults during COVID-19 Pandemic","On March 22, 2020, intense social distancing (SD) was implemented in Korea to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). This study examined the impact of SD on diabetes control in older adults with diabetes. Adults aged 60 to 90 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were physically and mentally independent were recruited. Participants who had complete blood chemistry data from April to July 2019 (pre-SD era) and April to July 2020 (SD era) were enrolled. Data were obtained about physical activity, nutrition, sarcopenia, and psychological and mental health from questionnaires in April to July 2020. Calf circumference was measured. In total, 246 people (100 men, 146 women; mean age, 73.8Ã‚Â±5.7 years) participated in this study. The levels of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c, 7.4%Ã‚Â±1.0% vs. 7.1%Ã‚Â±0.8%, P&lt;0.001), fasting glucose (142.2Ã‚Â±16.7 mg/dL vs. 132.0Ã‚Â±27.7 mg/dL, P&lt;0.001), and body weight (62.6Ã‚Â±9.4 kg vs. 61.8Ã‚Â±10.1 kg, P&lt;0.01) were higher in the SD era than in the pre-SD era. Total physical activity was lower in the SD era (2,584.6Ã‚Â±2,624.1 MET-min/week-1 vs. 1,987.3Ã‚Â±2,295.0 MET-min/week-1, P&lt;0.001). A larger increase in HbA1c level was associated with increased body weight and decreased physical activity. SD had negative effects on diabetes management in older adults with diabetes. Fasting glucose and HbA1c levels and body weight increased during the SD era. Participants with reduced physical activity gained more weight and had higher blood glucose levels. Given that the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, health professionals and diabetes educators should monitor changes in lifestyle factors in older adults with diabetes.","Shin, Oh, Choi, Jang","https://doi.org/10.4093/dmj.2021.0096","20210830","Aged; COVID-19; Diabetes mellitus, type 2; Physical distancing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-31","",17516,""
"Domestic violence and psychological problems in married women during COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown: A community-based survey","Following the declaration of Coronavirus disease-2019 as a pandemic, a nation-wide lockdown was announced in India. This led to increase in psychological problems, especially in women. To assess the prevalence of psychological problems and domestic violence (DV) in married women during the pandemic and lockdown in a panchayat in Southern India and to study the association of socio-demographic and clinical variables with psychological problems. A cross-sectional study was undertaken in 209 married women of 18-55 years residing in a village panchayat of northern Kerala, India. Socio-demographic variables and clinical variables, like depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, perceived stress and DV, among others, were evaluated. The participants were interviewed by trained community health workers in the post-lockdown period. The prevalence of depressive symptoms was found to be 10.0 %, anxiety symptoms 7.2 % and perceived stress 66.0 %. Severe DV was reported by 6.2 %; but at least one form of DV was experienced by 25.8 % of the women. Significant positive correlation was observed for DV with depression and anxiety. DV was also found to be a significant predictor of depression (adjusted OR [aOR]Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.26, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.006) and anxiety (aOR=4.34, P=0.02).

"Psychological impact on COVID-19 patients during the outbreak in China: A case-control study","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused widespread panic due to its highly infectious and pandemic transmission. We aimed to evaluate the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on infected subjects in China. This case-control, survey-based study assessed the psychological status of COVID-19 patients and non-infected controls from February 10 to March 18, 2020, in China. Sex, age, education years, marital status, jobs, annual household income, living status, and geographic origin were matched between the two groups. The main outcome measures included anxiety, depression, insomnia, help-seeking behaviors, and treatment for mental problems. A total of 326 patients and 1304 (1:4 ratio) matched non-infected controls were enrolled. Compared with controls, patients had higher scores on the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) (all p&lt;0.01). Patients had higher rate of any mental problems (62.6% vs 42.5%, p&lt;0.01), anxiety (27.3% vs 12.2%, p&lt;0.01), depression (26.7% vs 14.6%, p&lt;0.01), suicidal ideation (16.0% vs 10.7%, p&lt;0.01), and insomnia (57.7% vs 36.7%, p&lt;0.01). Among the subjects with mental problems, the proportion of seeking help (15.2% vs 6.9%, p&lt;0.01) and receiving treatment (11.3% vs 4.3%, p&lt;0.01) was higher in patients than controls.

"A systematic review of questionnaires assessing the psychological impact of COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a number of complications in everyday life, greatly affecting public health. Estimating its impact on mental health constitutes a priority issue. The current study aims to summarize the scales that have been specifically developed for this reason and are not adaptations of already existing scales.

A quality appraisal of the identified scales was made by three reviewers using the COSMIN checklist for methodological issues and the Terwee criteria for measurement properties. Our search strategy yielded a total of 855 results. Of these, 832 articles were excluded according to exclusion criteria, 23 were assessed for eligibility and 10 were finally included. These are presented in the text with additional useful information found separately. The identified scales tended to be quite short and examine stress, anxiety or fear.

"Index Case of COVID-19 Myocarditis Requiring BiV-ICD for Primary Prevention of Sudden Cardiac Death","The severity of clinical presentation of COVID-19 myocarditis ranges from incidental identification of depressed left ventricular ejection fraction, cardiogenic shock requiring percutaneous mechanical circulatory support, to fatal fulminant myocarditis. In previously reported cases, surviving patients experienced improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction with the use of glucocorticoids and antivirals (+/- intravenous immunoglobulin/ convalescent plasma). We report the first case of COVID-myocarditis in a surviving patient where a persistently depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (less than 35 percent) despite optimal therapy prompted implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death. A previously healthy 67-year-old man, diagnosed with mild COVID-19 pneumonia five days prior, presented to the emergency department with suspected STEMI (hypoxia, substernal chest pain and known left bundle branch block). Left heart catheterization showed patent coronary arteries. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed severely depressed ejection fraction (15-20 percent). CT showed bilateral infiltrates: treatment was started with dexamethasone, remdesivir and convalescent plasma for acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 pneumonia. After a four-day hospitalization, guideline-directed medical therapy at maximum tolerated doses over three months did not improve left ventricular ejection fraction.

"Effects of COVID-19 lockdown on eating disorders and obesity: A systematic review and meta-analysis","This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine: the pooled prevalence of symptomatic behaviours and mental health deterioration amongst individuals with eating disorders (EDs) and obesity during the COVID-19 confinement. Moreover, we examined changes in EDs and distress before and during the confinement, and the association between psychosocial factors and EDs symptoms. A systematic search was carried out in biomedical databases from January 2020 to January 2021. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies that used quantitative measures of ED symptoms and psychological distress during and after the COVID-19 confinement were included. A total of 26 studies met inclusion criteria (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 3399, 85.7% female). The pooled prevalence of symptomatic deterioration in EDs was 65% (95% CI[48,81], kÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 10). The pooled prevalence of increased weight in obesity was 52% (95% CI[25,78], kÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 4). More than half of the participants experienced depression and anxiety. Moreover, at least 75% of the individuals with EDs reported shape and eating concerns, and increased thinking about exercising. However, the pooled analyses of longitudinal studies showed no significant differences from pre-pandemic levels to the first lockdown phase in Body Mass Index and ED symptoms, whereas only few studies suggested increased distress, particularly among individuals with anorexia nervosa. The majority of individuals with EDs and obesity reported symptomatic worsening during the lockdown. However, further longitudinal studies are needed to identify vulnerable groups, as well as the long-term consequences of COVID-19.","Sideli, Lo Coco, Bonfanti, Borsarini, Fortunato, Sechi, Micali","https://doi.org/10.1002/erv.2861","20210830","COVID-19; distress; eating disorders; meta-analysis; obesity; systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-31","",17521,""
"Admission of a minor to a psychiatric hospital under Polish law Part I","Within the scope of mental health protection, numerous practical problems arise concerning the issue of providing health services to a minor. Admission of a minor to a psychiatric hospital is associated in practice with numerous doubts. This part of the article describes the conditions of admission to hospital with the consent of the patient. It distinguishes and accurately describes situations where a minor is under or over 16 years of age. In addition, it explains situations where there is a contradiction of declarations of will by legal guardians in relation to admission, their inability to perform legal acts, or a contradiction of the statements of the minor and guardian.

An e-mail was sent to all T1DM patients under the care of a diabetes clinic with information about the possibility of online consultation with a psychologist / psychiatrist, with a set of psychological tests attached. The study included 49 patients with T1DM who responded within the first month and agreed to participate in the study. 38 people from the control group were randomly recruited. Each person completed a set of psychological tools. In both groups, the level of stress was higher than typical for the general population in the situation without stressor. T1DM patients who have been ill for over 10 years more often cope with stress through a task-oriented approach. Patients who have been ill for less than 10 years use avoidance strategies. In the first phase of the epidemic,women with T1DM used avoidance strategies. Patients with diabetes and mental disorders react more anxiously and thus require special care in coping with diabetes.

"Determination of specific life changes on psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic might affect many aspects of the community and a range of psychiatric risk factors due to life changes, including people's behaviors and perceptions. In this study, we aim to identify specific life changes that correlate with psychological distress within the social context of the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. In July 2020, workers (company employees and civil servants) in Japan were recruited from local institutions that had not had any confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as neighborhoods that had only a few cases. Participants completed a COVID-19 mental health survey (N = 609; 66.9% male). Psychological distress was identified based on Kessler-6 scores (Ã¢â€°Â¥13). Life changes were assessed by an open-ended question about life changes in participants and their family, workplace, and community due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A convergent mixed-method approach was used to compare the context of perceived life changes in participants with psychological distress and those without. As a result, 8.9% of participants had psychological distress, and sex and age categories were different between those with psychological distress and those without. Among the participants who responded to the open-ended question, the biggest life change was ""staying at home,"" and the next biggest life changes were ""event cancellations"" and ""increased workload"" in participants with psychological distress, and ""no changes"" and ""mask-wearing"" in those without psychological distress, respectively. Regarding emotional/perceptual changes, ""stress,"" ""fear,"" and ""anger"" were more frequently reported by participants with psychological distress than those without (P &lt;0.001). By integrating these findings, we identified themes focusing on vulnerable characteristics related to psychological distress.

To develop and psychometrically investigate a pandemic-specific version of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-PAN) that measures stress related to the pandemic. Factor structure as well as convergent and divergent validity of the 10-item PSS-PAN were examined on the data set of an online survey (n = 1164; mean age: 38.57 years; standard deviation: 6.27 years; 84.2% women). A one-factor structure for the PSS-PAN was confirmed. The scale correlated significantly with scores on the Shortened Beck Depression Inventory (r = 0.41; n = 1164; p&lt;0.001), the 4-item Perceived Stress Scale (r = 0.46; n = 1164; p&lt;0.001), and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (r = -0.29; n = 1164; p&lt;0.001). Women's PSS-PAN scores were significantly higher than men's (t(1162) = -7.135; p&lt;0.001) but this difference was trivial (Cohen's d = 0.06). Further, scale scores did not differ significantly across educational attainment (F(6;1157) = 2.035; p = 0.06; ÃŽÂ·2 = 0.01). Lower middle class participants' mean scores were significantly higher than those of middle-class respondents according to the post hoc test (F(4;1159) = 3.461; p = 0.01; ÃŽÂ·2 = 0.01). PSS-PAN scores did not correlate significantly with age (r = -0.04; n = 1164; p = 0.13). Cronbach's alpha was 0.89 indicating excellent internal consistency. The PSS-PAN has a single-component structure. Moderately strong and weak correlations with other scales support its convergent and divergent validity and indicate that it is a distinct indicator of pandemic-related perceived stress. Its total score was not or not strongly associated with gender, age, education level, or socioeconomic status. The PSS-PAN is a proper instrument to measure pandemic-specific perceived stress.

"Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Depressive Symptoms among Pakistani Population during the Second Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Regression Analysis","Over a span of 1 year, with millions infected, COVID-19 has spread to every part of the world and now poses a health threat to each and every one of us. The outbreak has consequently resulted in multiple health problems such as stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia, panic, and denial globally. Several factors have contributed to this rising number of psychiatric consults all over the world. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of Pakistani population during the second wave of the pandemic in this region. We conducted an online web-based cross-sectional survey comprising 500 participants. The questionnaire assessed the demographic information, attitude, and knowledge concerning COVID-19 outbreak in addition to generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) utilizing the GAD-7 scale and depressive symptoms using the Center for Epidemiology Scale for Depression (CES-D) scale. The response rate of the study was 90.9%. The results of the survey indicated a prevalence of 25.4% of GAD, and 18.8% of depressive symptoms. Furthermore, nearly 34.8% of participants feared contracting COVID-19, 62.8% obtained constant critical updates regarding COVID-19, while 17.6% did not understand the knowledge regarding COVID-19. In the multivariate regression models, GAD was significantly associated with gender, age, and checking constantly of critical updates regarding COVID-19. Similarly, participants under 30 years had a higher risk of developing depressive symptoms than those above (&gt; 30 years). Lastly, participants with no formal education were also found to be more prone to developing depression. We identified a potential threat to mental health during the pandemic.","Yasmin, Dapke, Khalid, Naz, Naz, Admani, Asghar, Awan, Phadke, Saleem","https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.21-0380","20210830","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-31","",17527,""
"Effects of an Internet-based machine-guided stress management program based on cognitive behavioral therapy applying artificial intelligence technologies on improving depression among workers: a protocol for a randomized controlled trial","The effect of an unguided Internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy-based (iCBT) stress management program on depression may be enhanced by applying artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to guide participants studying the program. The aim of this study is to describe a research protocol to investigate the effect of a newly developed iCBT stress management program adopting AI technologies on improving depression among healthy workers under the COVID-19 epidemic. This study is a two-arm, parallel randomized control trial. Participants (N = 1,400) will be recruited and those who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomly allocated to the intervention or control (treatment as usual) group. A six-week, six-module Internet-based stress management program, SMART-CBT, has been developed that includes machine-guided exercises to help participants acquire CBT skills, applying machine learning and deep learning technologies. The intervention group will participate in the program for 10 weeks. The primary outcome, depression, will be measured using the Beck Depression Inventory II at baseline and in 3- and 6-month follow-up surveys. A mixed model repeated measures analysis will be used to test the intervention effect (group Ãƒâ€” time interactions) in the total sample (universal prevention), on an intention-to-treat basis. The study was at the stage of recruitment of the participants at the time of submission. The data analysis related to the primary outcome will start in January 2022, and the results could be published in 2022 or 2023. This is the first study to investigate the effectiveness of a fully-automated, machine-guided iCBT program for improving subthreshold depression among workers using a RCT design. The study will explore the potential of a machine-guided stress management program that can be disseminated online to a large number of workers with minimal cost in the post-COVID-19 era. Trial registration number: UMIN000043897 (May 31, 2021).","Kawakami, Imamura, Watanabe, Sekiya, Sasaki, Sato","https://doi.org/10.2196/30305","20210830","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-31","",17528,""
"Sense of purpose in life, cognitive function, and the phenomenology of autobiographical memory","There are individual differences in the phenomenological re-experiencing of autobiographical memories. We examine whether sense of purpose in life and cognitive function are associated with the phenomenology of a recent memory related to the coronavirus pandemic. Participants reported on their sense purpose and completed tasks that measured processing speed and visuospatial ability before the pandemic in January-February 2020 and subsequently retrieved and rated a memory related to the pandemic in July 2020 (<i>N</i>=796; <i>M</i><sub>age</sub>=58.05, <i>SD</i>=14.14, range 19-85). Participants with a greater sense of purpose reported memories that were more phenomenologically rich (e.g., more vivid, coherent, accessible), whereas cognitive function was primarily related to greater perceived accessibility of the memory but not to most other aspects of phenomenology. The pattern of associations was similar when accounting for depressive symptoms, and none of the associations was moderated by age. The present research suggests that individuals with a higher sense of purpose in life have autobiographical memories with richer phenomenology. To the extent that memories function to sustain well-being, social connections, and cognitive health, rich phenomenology may be one pathway through which purpose leads to these better outcomes.","Sutin, Luchetti, Aschwanden, Stephan, Terracciano","https://doi.org/10.1080/09658211.2021.1966472","20210830","Memory phenomenology; processing speed; purpose in life; visuospatial reasoning; vividness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-31","",17529,""
"[Dynamics of psychopathological symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in Russia]","The results of the analysis of psychopathological symptom dynamics during the COVID-19 pandemic in Russia are presented. The study uses the data of the Internet survey, which included a block of sociodemographic questions and the SCL-90-R symptomatic questionnaire. Nine hundred and eight responses received from 22.03.20 to 22.06.20 were analysed. The change in the responses over time was assessed: 3 periods of time were allocated, associated with the change in countermeasures to the pandemic in Russia. In addition, the change in the values of the SCL-90 parameters was assessed depending on the existence of respondent's acquaintances infected with the coronavirus. It was shown that SCL-90 symptoms (Somatization, Depression, Obsession, all integral parameters, including the Global Severity Index) increased from 22.03.20 to 22.06.20. With infected people appearing in the respondent's environment psychopathological symptoms increase. The growth of hostility, sensitivity and anxiety is associated with a personal experience of a danger of the pandemic, which intensifies when infected persons appear in the immediate environment. The increase in psychopathological symptoms after the mitigation or cancellation of the quarantine restrictions suggests the persistence of long-term consequences.

"THE IMPORTANCE OF MENTAL RESILIENCE AGAINST LONELINESS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN DIALYSIS PATIENTS","The pandemic crisis of COVID-19 has caused anxiety and depressive symptoms to increase in many people worldwide. Yet, difficult situations may not only lead to various types of disorders, fears, anxieties and feelings of loss. They can also lead to positive changes, even to development or growth after experienced trauma, to positive adaptation, to changes in self-perception, changes in interpersonal relations or philosophy of life. Patients with chronic kidney disease, especially those on renal replacement therapy, often experience severe psychological problems such as anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, or difficulties related to coping with excessive stress. The aim of our review is to disscus the appropriatness of mental health screening tools in patients with chronic kidney disease, including those on dialyses, during COVID-19 pandemic. Recently published studies indicate the limited available data evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of screening tools for mental status in patients with chronic kidney disease. This, it seems reasonable to stress the mental health associations with situational stress in this group of patients during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. It is also worth pointing out the need to research the impact of the mental disorders in this population on morbidity and mortality, taking into account other organ complications and the quality of life of patients not only during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. It is worth to to make every effort to reduce the severity of the anxiety and feelings of hopelessness in dialysis patients, to cope with the pandemic.","OÃ…â€šdakowska-Jedynak, RyÃ…â€º, Sztajerwald, Malyszko","https://www.google.com/search?q=THE+IMPORTANCE+OF+MENTAL+RESILIENCE+AGAINST+LONELINESS+DURING+THE+COVID-19+PANDEMIC+IN+DIALYSIS+PATIENTS.","20210830"," end-stage renal disease;  mental health;  pandemic during COCID-19;  renal replacement therapy ","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-31","",17531,""
"EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS AND SLEEP DISTURBANCES IN PARAMEDICS IN THE ERA OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Infectious diseases have accompanied mankind for centuries, and the effects of their dramatic course are felt on many levels of everyday life. The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus infection carries a tremendous psychological burden for both those infected and health care workers. Particularly vulnerable to psychological strain are paramedics who have direct contact with and caring for patients infected with coronavirus. From a review of the literature, it is known that Emergency Medical Team members, as a result of the stress experienced during a pandemic, manifest symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances. In order to limit the adverse impact of the pandemic on the mental condition of this professional group, it is necessary to create appropriate conditions for solitary rest, relaxation and satisfaction of basic needs such as: food, sleep and protective clothing. An important role is also played by unrestricted access to psychological support in the broad sense of the word and often also to psychiatric care.","Marczewski, Piegza, Gospodarczyk, Pudlo, Sosada","https://www.google.com/search?q=EMOTIONAL+PROBLEMS+AND+SLEEP+DISTURBANCES+IN+PARAMEDICS+IN+THE+ERA+OF+THE+COVID-19+PANDEMIC.","20210830"," COVID -19 pandemic;  anxiety;  depression;  paramedics;  sleep disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-31","",17532,""
"Supporting mental health during COVID-19 using a digital behaviour change intervention: an open-label, single-arm, pre-post intervention research study","COVID-19 is taking its toll on people's mental health, particularly as people are advised to adhere to social distancing, self-isolation measures and government-imposed national lockdowns. Digital health technologies have an important role to play in keeping people connected and supporting mental health and wellbeing. Even before COVID-19, mental health and social services were already stretched. Our objective was to evaluate the 12-week outcomes of the digitally delivered Gro Health platform, a holistic digital behaviour change intervention for self-management of mental wellbeing, sleep, activity, and nutrition. The study used a quasi-experimental research design consisting of an open-label, single-arm, pre-post intervention engagement using a convenience sample. Adults who had joined the Gro Health platform (intervention) and had a complete baseline dataset (GAD-7 Anxiety Test Questionnaire, Perceived Stress Scale, PHQ-9 Patient Health Questionnaire), were followed up at 12 weeks (N=273), including 33 (12.1%) who reported a positive COVID-19 diagnosis during the study period. User engagement with the Gro Health platform was tracked by measuring total minutes of app engagement. Paired t-tests were used to compare pre- and post-intervention scores and linear regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship between minutes of active engagement with Gro Health and changes in scores across the different mental health measures. Of the 347 study participants, 273 (78.67%) completed both baseline and follow up surveys. Change in scores for anxiety, perceived stress and depression was predicted by app engagement with the strongest effect being seen in change perceived stress scores F(1,271)=251.397, p&lt;0.001, with an R2 of .479. A digital behaviour change platform that provides remote mental wellbeing support can be effective in managing depression, anxiety, and perceived stress during times of crisis such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. The outcomes of this paper may also support the implementation of remote digital health apps supporting behaviour change and support for low levels of mental health in the community.","Summers, Wu, Taylor","https://doi.org/10.2196/31273","20210830","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-31","",17533,""

"Mental health in patients with rheumatic diseases related to COVID-19 pandemic: Experience in a tertiary care center in Latin America","To determine the factors associated with anxiety, depression, and concern within the COVID-19 pandemic in a population with autoimmune diseases. A telephonic survey was conducted during the early stages of the pandemic in a tertiary care center, which included patients with systemic autoimmune diseases. Mental health variables were assessed with Patient Health Questionnaire 2, General Anxiety Disorder 7 scores, and pandemic-related concern questions. Sociodemographic aspects were also evaluated. Of the total 334 participants, 291 (87.1%) were women, with a median age of 46Ã‚Â years; systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was the most frequent diagnosis (144, 43.2%); 44 patients (13.2%) showed depression and 32 (9.6%) anxiety. The variables associated with depression were all the pandemic concern items, body mass index, anxiety, and a higher COVID-19 symptom score. Anxiety was associated with depression, all pandemic concern items, and a higher COVID-19 symptom score. Women presented higher scores in all concern items. The SLE group presented higher scores in concern questions and difficulty finding medication.

"Improvement to the subjective well-being of pet ownership may have positive psychological influence during COVID-19 epidemic","The COVID-19 epidemic and government intervention measures may have adverse effects on people's mental health. To explore the influence of pets on the intervention of people's psychological problems during the COVID-19 epidemic, an online survey was carried out between April 9 and April 29, 2020. A total of 756 participants replied to this questionnaire. Mental health variables were assessed, and the comparison of behavior changes among pet owners and pets on positive mental well-being during COVID-19 epidemic. Comparative analysis was performed; compared with individuals without pets (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°575), pet owners (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°181) had a higher prevalence of insomnia (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.006).

Dog owners exhibited lower than average scores of insomnia and uncertainty of infection than cat owners (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.004). People with more than one pet exhibited lower than average scores of depression than having one pet (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.040). For analysis of psychological effects of pets on people, the role of pets in subjective feeling and positive psychological changes of pet owner was significantly different.

"An iterative approach to promoting departmental wellbeing during COVID-19","Addressing wellbeing among learners, faculty, and staff during the COVID-19 pandemic is a challenge for many clinical departments. Continued and systemic supports are needed to combat the pandemic's impact on mental health and wellbeing. This article describes an iterative approach to conducting a needs assessment and implementing a COVID-19-related wellness initiative in a psychiatry department. Development of the initiative followed the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) quality improvement cycle and was informed by Shanafelt and colleagues' framework for supporting healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Key features included the establishment of a Wellness Working Group, the curation of relevant resources on the Department's website, and the deployment of regular, monthly surveys that informed the creation of further supports, such as a weekly online drop-in support group. Survey response rates ranged from 22% to 32% (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 90-127) throughout our initiative. Across multiple surveys, approximately 80% of respondents reported feeling supported or very supported by the Department, and 90% were satisfied or very satisfied with the quantity and quality of information provided. Our support group and resources page were accessed by nearly one-quarter and one-third of respondents, respectively, with satisfaction rates of 81% or higher. Consistent with the Department's mandate, ensuring equity was a key focus of the Working Group throughout its operations. There is potential for this model to be scaled to create a faculty-wide, institution-wide, or regional approach to addressing wellbeing. Other departments may also wish to adopt similar approaches to supporting their members during this challenging time.","Acai, Gonzalez, Saperson","https://doi.org/10.1111/jep.13601","20210830","evaluation; health services research; healthcare; medical research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-31","",17539,""
"Cumulative Risk Exposure and Social Isolation as Correlates of Carer and Child Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Online Study with Families from Various Europeans Countries","This study adopted a cumulative risk approach to examine the relations between various domains of risk factors (i.e., social isolation and home confinement, other pandemic-related risk factors, and pre-existing psychosocial risk factors) and carers' and children's mental health during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. The sample consisted of 1475 carers of 6- to 16-year-old children and adolescents residing in five European countries (Portugal, United Kingdom, Romania, Spain, and The Netherlands) who completed an online survey. The results showed that each of the three domains of adversity accounted for unique variation in carers' and children's mental health outcomes. Also, the results indicated that pre-existing psychosocial risk factors moderated the relationship between pandemic-related risk factors and children and carers' anxiety and between social isolation and confinement and carers' well-being. Simple slopes analysis suggested a stronger relationship between these domains of adversities and mental health outcomes in already more vulnerable families. It is important to consider the implications of social isolation measures and confinement for families' mental health, paying special attention to families with pre-existing psychosocial vulnerabilities.","Pereira, Muris, Roberto, Stallard, Garcia-Lopez, Tulbure, Podina, Simon, Sousa, Barros","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10578-021-01233-3","20210830","COVID-19; Children, adolescents, and carers; Mental health; Pre-existing psychosocial risks; Social isolation and home confinement","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-31","",17540,""
"Monitoring Depression Trends on Twitter During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Observational Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected people's daily lives and has caused economic loss worldwide. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the pandemic has increased depression levels among the population. However, systematic studies of depression detection and monitoring during the pandemic are lacking. This study aims to develop a method to create a large-scale depression user data set in an automatic fashion so that the method is scalable and can be adapted to future events; verify the effectiveness of transformer-based deep learning language models in identifying depression users from their everyday language; examine psychological text features' importance when used in depression classification; and, finally, use the model for monitoring the fluctuation of depression levels of different groups as the disease propagates. To study this subject, we designed an effective regular expression-based search method and created the largest English Twitter depression data set containing 2575 distinct identified users with depression and their past tweets. To examine the effect of depression on people's Twitter language, we trained three transformer-based depression classification models on the data set, evaluated their performance with progressively increased training sizes, and compared the model's tweet chunk-level and user-level performances. Furthermore, inspired by psychological studies, we created a fusion classifier that combines deep learning model scores with psychological text features and users' demographic information, and investigated these features' relations to depression signals. Finally, we demonstrated our model's capability of monitoring both group-level and population-level depression trends by presenting two of its applications during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our fusion model demonstrated an accuracy of 78.9% on a test set containing 446 people, half of which were identified as having depression. Conscientiousness, neuroticism, appearance of first person pronouns, talking about biological processes such as eat and sleep, talking about power, and exhibiting sadness were shown to be important features in depression classification. Further, when used for monitoring the depression trend, our model showed that depressive users, in general, responded to the pandemic later than the control group based on their tweets (n=500). It was also shown that three US states-New York, California, and Florida-shared a similar depression trend as the whole US population (n=9050). When compared to New York and California, people in Florida demonstrated a substantially lower level of depression. This study proposes an efficient method that can be used to analyze the depression level of different groups of people on Twitter. We hope this study can raise awareness among researchers and the public of COVID-19's impact on people's mental health. The noninvasive monitoring system can also be readily adapted to other big events besides COVID-19 and can be useful during future outbreaks.","Zhang, Lyu, Liu, Zhang, Wang, Luo","https://doi.org/10.2196/26769","20210830","COVID-19; Twitter; data mining; depression; mental health; natural language processing; social media; transformers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-31","",17541,""
"Reddit Users' Experiences of Suicidal Thoughts During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Analysis of r/Covid19_support Posts","<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic is having considerable impacts on population-level mental health, with research illustrating an increased prevalence in suicidal thoughts due to pandemic stressors. While the drivers of suicidal thoughts amid the pandemic are poorly understood, qualitative research holds great potential for expanding upon projections from pre-pandemic work and nuancing emerging epidemiological data. Despite calls for qualitative inquiry, there is a paucity of qualitative research examining experiences of suicidality related to COVID-19. The use of publicly available data from social media offers timely and pertinent information into ongoing pandemic-related mental health, including individual experiences of suicidal thoughts. <b>Objective:</b> To examine how Reddit users within the <i>r/COVID19_support</i> community describe their experiences of suicidal thoughts amid the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> This study draws on online posts from within <i>r/COVID19_support</i> that describe users' suicidal thoughts during and related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected from creation of this subreddit on February 12, 2020 until December 31, 2020. A qualitative thematic analysis was conducted to generate themes reflecting users' experiences of suicidal thoughts. <b>Results:</b> A total of 83 posts from 57 users were included in the analysis. Posts described a range of users' lived and living experiences of suicidal thoughts related to the pandemic, including deterioration in mental health and complex emotions associated with suicidal thinking. Reddit users situated their experiences of suicidal thoughts within various pandemic stressors: social isolation, employment and finances, virus exposure and COVID-19 illness, uncertain timeline of the pandemic, news and social media, pre-existing mental health conditions, and lack of access to mental health resources. Some users described individual coping strategies and supports used in attempt to manage suicidal thoughts, however these were recognized as insufficient for addressing the multilevel stressors of the pandemic. <b>Conclusions:</b> Multiple and intersecting stressors have contributed to individuals' experiences of suicidal thoughts amid the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring thoughtful and complex public health responses. While ongoing challenges exist with self-disclosure of mental health challenges on social media, Reddit and other online platforms may offer a space for users to share suicidal thoughts and discuss potential coping strategies.","Slemon, McAuliffe, Goodyear, McGuinness, Shaffer, Jenkins","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.693153","20210830","COVID-19; mental health; qualitative research; reddit; self-disclosure; social media; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-31","",17542,""

"Mental health of older people in social isolation: the role of physical activity at home during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic involves a new coronavirus characterized by a respiratory disease resulting from an infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome by coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The severity and fatality of COVID-19 are directly related to age and immunocompromised states, with older adults making up the vast majority of cases. The elderly with a higher risk of serious complications due to COVID-19 and deaths are also the group most susceptible to the damage of social isolation, impacting on mental health, resulting in a more sedentary lifestyle, and health problems due to several causes, implying need for greater attention, care and protection. Physical activity has shown excellent results for mental health, being used in different treatments and populations, when considering the elderly, one of the ways to mitigate this impact on mental health is the practice of physical activity. Here, we discuss the impacts of social isolation on mental health and the role of physical activity and exercise in the homes of the elderly as a way to protect the spread of other diseases from all causes during the COVID-19 pandemic period.

"The Impact of the COVID-19 Epidemic During the Lockdown on Children With the Pediatric Acute-Onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (PANDAS/PANS): The Importance of Environmental Factors on Clinical Conditions","<b>Introduction:</b> In March 2020, SARS-CoV-2 declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Restrictive isolation measures have also brought psychological distress to the pediatric population. Building on the syndrome's characteristics, the present study explored the impact of lockdown on the clinical course of young people with PANDAS/PANS. The initial hypothesis considered both the reduced exposure to viral agents and the strategies of the parents and other containment actions as protective factors against the worsening of symptoms. <b>Methods:</b> One hundred and eight children, adolescents, and young adults were recruited according to the multicenter PANDAS/PANS research program. Parents participated in a web-based survey. Results: contrary to our hypothesis, the study results show an increase in symptoms during the block in 71% of the sample. Psychometric analyzes allowed us to exclude a relationship between the main symptoms of PANDAS and the increase in symptoms or the presence of symptoms before the block and their increase over time. The increase in symptoms is best explained by the presence of sleep disturbances and emotional lability. The exacerbation also appears to be linked to the onset of new symptoms in children and adolescents with depressed moods and eating problems. Furthermore, irritability and oppositionality are significant predictors of acute exacerbation. Equally statistically significant is the factor linked to the effects of pandemic stress, such as the fear of contracting the virus. No significant associations for symptom reduction have been identified between parental strategies or other parent-initiated actions, but the study demonstrates that caregiver perceived efficacy on the strategies used can reduce the risk of exacerbation. <b>Conclusion:</b> This preliminary study highlights the importance of studying the causes of increased symptoms in children with PANDAS/PANS. Life events can exacerbate the clinical condition or generate new symptoms in young patients. In particular, environmental, family, and social changes in the course of clinical symptoms in PANDAS/PANS patients should be investigated. It highlights the importance of emotional and behavioral management, which can be improved by enhancing coping strategies in young people with PANDAS/PANS and their caregivers through a combination treatment in which CBT and PMT are included, in line with guidelines. <b>Limits:</b> An experimental proxy-report questionnaire not yet standardized and validated on the PANS/PANDAS pediatric clinical sample was used for the exploratory study. There is also a small sample size (<i>N</i> = 108) and the absence of a control group (pre-lockdown or children without PANDAS/PANS).

"Depressed and Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Mothers' Progression Into a Randomized Controlled Mobile Mental Health and Parenting Intervention: A Descriptive Examination Prior to and During COVID-19","Infants of low-income and depressed mothers are at high risk for poor developmental outcomes. Early parenting mediates infant experiences from birth, and early intervention can support sensitive and responsive parent practices that optimize infant outcomes via promoting developmental competencies. However, low-income and depressed mothers experience substantial challenges to participating in early intervention. They also have extremely limited access to interventions targeting depression. Interventions targeting maternal depression and parent practices can improve maternal and infant outcomes. Mobile internet-based interventions overcome numerous barriers that low-resource mothers face in accessing home-based interventions. Pandemic-related stressors likely reduce family resources and exacerbate distress of already heavily-burdened mother-infant dyads. During crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, evidence-based remote coaching interventions are paramount. This article reports on a mobile intervention for improving maternal mood and increasing parent practices that promote infant development. An ongoing randomized controlled trial study provided a unique opportunity to monitor progression from referral to intervention initiation between two groups of depressed mothers: those prior to the pandemic and during the pandemic. The study also examines mother and infant characteristics at baseline. The sample consisted primarily of Black mothers experiencing extreme poverty who self-referred to the study in a large southern city, which is one of the most income disparate in the United States. Prior to the pandemic, 97% of study participants successfully progressed from consent to intervention, as compared to significantly fewer-86%-during the pandemic. Mother-infant dyads during COVID-19, as compared to those prior to COVID-19, displayed similar pre-intervention demographic characteristics and intrapersonal characteristics.","Baggett, Davis, Mosley, Miller, Leve, Feil","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.719149","20210830","COVID-19; infant; maternal depression; mobile intervention; parenting; remote coaching","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-31","",17548,""
"Coronavirus Disease 2019-Related Stigma in China: A Descriptive Study","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) tremendously impacts the physical and mental health of humans worldwide. Consequently, studies on COVID-19 remain extensive. However, most of them were mainly focused on the pathological mechanisms and treatment methods from medical perspectives. Various reports have indicated that COVID-19 is closely related to stigma and discrimination, but little statistical information has been integrated quantitatively to describe the situation in China. Thus, this study investigated the COVID-19-related stigma of individuals. We collected the online survey data from 1,920 Chinese participants from October to December 2020. Findings showed that 306 (15.94%), 285 (14.84%), 265 (13.80%), and 100 (5.21%) participants endorsed stigma toward individuals in high-risk areas, recovered patients with COVID-19, families of recovered patients with COVID-19, and frontline healthcare providers, respectively. To understand the possible factors that could impact the COVID-19-related stigma, knowledge about COVID-19 was investigated. Generally, knowledge about COVID-19 was negatively associated with COVID-19-related stigma in general, while no significant relationship existed between the knowledge about COVID-19 and the COVID-19-related stigma in the groups who had held COVID-19-related stigma. Ultimately, individuals showed COVID-19-related stigma toward recovered patients and their families, individuals in high-risk areas, and frontline healthcare providers to some extent. The results of this study can provide reference to nations, governments, and organizations in addressing the stigma issues raised by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zhao, Wang, Guan, Shen, Zhao, Zuo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.694988","20210830","COVID-19; China; descriptive study; knowledge; stigma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-31","",17549,""
"Negative Emotion Differentiation Attenuates the Within-Person Indirect Effect of Daily Stress on Nightly Sleep Quality Through Calmness","The ability to differentiate between negative emotional states [negative emotion differentiation (NED)] has been conceptualized as a trait that facilitates effective emotion regulation and buffers stress reactivity. In the present research, we investigated the role of NED in within-person processes of daily affect regulation and coping during times of stress (the first COVID-19-related pandemic lockdown in April 2020). Using intensive longitudinal data, we analyzed whether daily stress had an indirect effect on sleep quality through calmness in the evening, and we tested whether NED moderated this within-person indirect effect by buffering the link between daily stress and calmness in the evening. A non-representative community sample (<i>n</i> = 313, 15-82 years old) participated in a 21-day ambulatory assessment with twice-daily surveys. The results of multilevel mediation models showed that higher daily stress was related to within-day change in calmness from morning to evening, resulting in less calmness in the evening within persons. Less calmness in the evening, in turn, was related to poorer nightly sleep quality within persons. As expected, higher NED predicted a less negative within-person link between daily stress and calmness in the evening, thereby attenuating the indirect effect of daily stress on nightly sleep quality through calmness. This effect held when we controlled for mean negative emotions and depression. The results provide support for a diathesis-stress model of NED, and hence, for NED as a protective factor that helps to explain why some individuals remain more resilient during times of stress than others.","Lischetzke, Schemer, Glombiewski, In-Albon, Karbach, KÃƒÂ¶nen","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.684117","20210830","COVID-19; calmness; daily stress; multilevel mediation analysis; negative emotion differentiation; negative emotional granularity; sleep quality; stress reactivity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-31","",17550,""
"A Short, Multimodal Activity Break Incorporated Into the Learning Context During the Covid-19 Pandemic: Effects of Physical Activity and Positive Expressive Writing on University Students' Mental Health-Results and Recommendations From a Pilot Study","Physical inactivity, sedentary behavior and mental ill health, due to high levels of perceived stress or self-reported depressive symptoms, are highly prevalent among university students. There are concerns that these behaviors and mental symptoms have significantly increased during the current Covid-19 pandemic, partly because academic life has changed considerably from face-to-face communication to e-learning and studying at home. Self-regulation and physical activity are hard to maintain during pandemic lockdowns. Short activity breaks could be helpful to avoid physical inactivity and sustain mental health. The breaks should comprise short and easy-implementable physical activity exercises that can be integrated into the learning context. Moreover, cognitive interventions, such as writing about positive events and feelings might help as coping strategy for self-regulation during study breaks. This study investigated and compared the effects of a physical activity intervention and a cognitive intervention (positive expressive writing) on mental health among university students. Both interventions are particularly suitable for use at home. <i>N</i> = 20 university students, studying in Germany, were assigned to a physical activity group or a cognitive intervention group. The physical activity intervention consisted of a mix of physical exercises including endurance exercises, muscular strength, relaxation, and ballroom dance movements. The interventions were carried out guided, once a week, for 5-10 mins at the beginning of classes. The effects of <i>group</i> Ãƒâ€” <i>time</i> showed no significant interaction on self-reported perceived stress, mood, quality of life (QoL) assessed online and compared at the beginning of the term before the intervention (T0) and at the end of the term after the intervention (T3). However, the physical activity group reported a similar physical activity level per day over time, while the cognitive intervention group showed a decrease in physical activity from T0 to T3. Low-dose, short physical activity interventions as well as cognitive interventions consisting of positive expressive writing could buffer university students' perceived stress, mood, and QoL across the term. Moreover, both interventions seem to be promising in buffering the negative side effects of stress during the Covid-19 pandemic.","Marschin, Herbert","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.645492","20210830","Covid-19; cognitive intervention; mental health; physical activity program; physical inactivity; positive expressive writing; stress; university","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-31","",17551,""
"Anxiety Regarding COVID-19 Is Related to Attentional Control: The Mediating Role of Anxiety Sensitivity","<b>Background:</b> As an emergent public health event, COVID-19 has had a significant impact on mental health, particularly causing anxiety. Some cognitive-affective related studies have demonstrated that attentional control is related to levels of anxiety. More specifically, recent research has shown that anxiety sensitivity is uniquely associated with mental health responses to COVID-19. The aim of the current study was to investigate the role of anxiety sensitivity during COVID-19 outbreak period, especially physical and cognitive concerns, in relation to attentional control and anxiety. <b>Methods:</b> It is a questionnaire study. A total of 464 participants were recruited through online sampling between February and March, 2020. They were surveyed by the Attentional Control Scale (ATTC), Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (ASI-3) and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and correlation analysis. We also tested the mediating effect. <b>Results:</b> The results showed that attentional control is negatively correlated with physical concern, cognitive concern and anxiety. And results support that physical and cognitive concerns play a mediating role between attentional control and anxiety. <b>Conclusions:</b> Anxiety sensitivity plays a mediating role between attentional control and anxiety. These findings can help effective prevention and intervention of anxiety.","Guo, Yang, Elhai, McKay","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.713279","20210830","COVID-19; anxiety; anxiety sensitivity; attentional control; cognitive-affective factor","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-31","",17552,""
"Unknown Enemy and Psychopathological Responses: A Cross-Sectional Nationwide Study Assessing the Knowledge About COVID-19","There is evidence that a lack of appropriate knowledge regarding global changes might be associated with various psychopathological responses. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that knowledge about COVID-19 correlates with the severity of psychopathological symptoms as measured by standardized questionnaires. The questionnaires were obtained using the Computer Assisted Web Interviews (CAWI) method during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland using the original COVID-19 knowledge questionnaire and the General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28). A series of bivariate tests and linear regression analyses were performed with a <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05. All analyses were performed in Statistica 13.3. We enrolled 1,002 respondents. The rate of correct answers in the original questionnaire ranged from 44.6 to 84.1%, and the average was 60.1%. Four hundred and twenty participants (42%) met the criterion for the presence of relevant psychopathological symptoms. A significant negative correlation was found between the number of points obtained in the COVID-19 knowledge questionnaire and the GHQ-28 scores, both in relation to the total score and all its subscales. The following factors in the linear regression model were correlated with severity of somatic symptoms: knowledge about the COVID-19 pandemic (<i>B</i> = -0.12, <i>P</i> = 0.000), sex (<i>B</i> = 0.12, <i>P</i> = 0.000), use of psychiatric or psychological care (<i>B</i> = 0.20, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.000) and chronic diseases (<i>B</i> = 0.09, <i>P</i> = 0.002). In this study, we observed a negative correlation between the knowledge about the COVID-19 pandemic and the severity of psychopathological symptoms. The results clearly indicate that the complexity of the global problem of the current pandemic is related to the development of psychopathological symptoms. However, longitudinal studies are needed to identify the direction of causality.","Maciaszek, Lenart, Misiak, Grzebieluch, GawÃ…â€šowski, CiuÃ…â€škowicz, Ã…Âuc, SzczeÃ…â€ºniak, Rymaszewska","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.704558","20210830","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; anxiety; disease knowledge; infodemic; mental health; pandemic; somatic symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-31","",17553,""
"Covid-fatigued? A longitudinal study of Norwegian older adults' psychosocial well-being before and during early and later stages of the COVID-19 pandemic","As the pandemic continues, many older adults are facing prolonged isolation and stress while having less access to traditional ways of coping. There is widespread concern that the situation is increasingly taking its toll on older adults' psychological and social well-being. We use linear mixed models to examine psychosocial impacts and predictors thereof among older Norwegians in early and later stages of the pandemic. Longitudinal data were collected online in the Norwegian Counties Public Health Survey right before the pandemic and in June and November-December 2020 in two counties (baseline <i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4,104; age 65-92). Outcomes include loneliness (single item, UCLA3), psychological ill-being (worried, anxious, depressed), and psychological well-being (satisfied, engaged, happy). From before to three months into the pandemic men's psychosocial well-being remained stable, whereas women's slightly declined. Five months later we observe broad and substantial declines in psychosocial well-being. These impacts disproportionately affect women (all outcomes) and single and older individuals (loneliness only) and are not moderated by educational level, urbanicity, or whether self or partner are reported ""at risk"" due to health problems. Pre-pandemic low social support and high psychological distress predict relatively improved psychosocial well-being. Older Norwegians seemed to manage the pandemic's early stage without clear psychosocial impacts. However, we observe notably compromised well-being during the second wave of COVID-19 in late 2020. Lessons learned about the nature and distribution of the psychosocial impacts of prolonged health-threats and social distancing provide valuable knowledge for intervention design during this and future pandemics.","Hansen, Sevenius Nilsen, Knapstad, Skirbekk, Skogen, Vedaa, Nes","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10433-021-00648-0","20210830","COVID-19; Loneliness; Longitudinal analysis; Norway; Older adults; Psychosocial well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-31","",17554,""
"Depression and loneliness of older adults in Europe and Israel after the first wave of covid-19","Epidemic control measures that aim to introduce social distancing help to decelerate the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, their consequences in terms of mental well-being might be negative, especially for older adults. While existing studies mainly focus on the time during the first lockdown, we look at the weeks afterward in order to measure the medium-term consequences of the first wave of the pandemic. Using data from the SHARE Corona Survey, we include retired respondents aged 60 and above from 25 European countries plus Israel. Combining SHARE data with macro-data from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker allows us to include macro-indicators at the country level, namely the number of deaths per 100,000 and the number of days with stringent epidemic control measures, in addition to individual characteristics. The findings show that both macro-indicators are influential for increased feelings of sadness/depression, but that individual factors are crucial for explaining increased feelings of loneliness in the time after the first lockdown. Models with interaction terms reveal that the included macro-indicators have negative well-being consequences, particularly for the oldest survey participants. Additionally, the results reveal that especially those living alone had a higher risk for increased loneliness in the time after the first COVID-19 wave.

"Psychometric Validation of the Indonesian Version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale: Personality Traits Predict the Fear of COVID-19","The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global health crisis that has generated fear and negative psychological consequences. The present study evaluated the validity and factor structure of Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) among a sample from the general Indonesian population. The English version of the FCV-19S was translated and back-translated into Indonesian language, followed by a pilot study. Using convenience sampling method, a total of 728 participants completed an online survey distributed on various social media platforms. The survey included the FCV-19S, personality traits (neuroticism and extraversion), Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The Indonesian FCV-19S had very good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha and McDonald's omega) and composite reliability (alphaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.88, omegaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.86, composite reliabilityÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.87).

As for criterion-related validity, the FCV-19S score positively correlated with the score on PHQ-9, GAD-7, negative affect, and neuroticism and negatively correlated with extraversion. Negative affect was identified as the most important predictor of the fear of COVID-19. Personality traits also predicted the fear of COVID-19.

"The Impact of the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Patients' Perceptions of Chronic Pain","On 10 March 2020, Greece entered an increasingly restrictive 42-day lockdown, in order to contain the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. All scheduled appointments and activities of the pain clinics around the country were postponed indefinitely. The aim of this prospective study was to assess the perceived impact of the first wave of the pandemic on pain, quality of life, and access to treatment, during the first austere lockdown in Greece. In this cross-sectional study, 101 patients suffering from chronic pain completed a structured questionnaire. Levels of depression, anxiety, stress, personal wellbeing, optimism and personality traits were also evaluated, using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS42), the Ten Item Personality Index (TIPI), the Life Orientation Test-Revised (GrLOT-R) and the Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI). Despite the dramatic decrease in health care visitations before, during and after the imposed lockdown, most patients did not feel that access to pain physicians and medication was significantly affected. Higher levels of stress, anxiety, depression, neuroticism, openness to experience and general satisfaction with life seemed to be important determinant factors in how patients experienced their level, intensity and duration of pain, quality of life and response to medication. The effects of the lockdown had a more severe impact on patients than the pandemic itself. For most, the level of their pain was not affected by the pandemic and was affected only slightly by the lockdown. Quality of life, however, was affected formost participants. Both the necessity and the complications of introducing the use of telemedicine to Greek chronic pain patients became evident during the study.","Smyrnioti, Lyrakos, Meindani, Matsota, Kostopanagiotou, Batistaki","https://doi.org/10.2147/JPR.S323568","20210830","COVID-19 psychosocial implications; healthcare access; quality of life; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-31","",17559,""

"Design of Nucleic Acid Biosensors Based on CRISPR/Cas Systems and Reporter Split Proteins","Highly sensitive, specific, rapid, and easy-to-use diagnostic methods for the detection of nucleic acids of pathogens are required for the diagnosis of many human, animal, and plant diseases and environmental monitoring. The approaches based on the use of the natural ability of bacterial CRISPR/Cas9 systems to recognize DNA sequences with a high specificity under isothermal conditions are an alternative to the polymerase chain reaction method, which requires expensive laboratory equipment. The development of the methods for signal registration with the formation of a DNA/RNA/Cas9 protein complex is a separate bioengineering task. In this work, a design was developed and the applicability of a biosensor system based on the binding of two dCas9 proteins with target DNA sequences (without their cutting) and detection of their colocalization using reporter systems based on split enzymes was studied. Using the methods of molecular modeling, possible mutual positions of two dCas9 proteins at a detectable locus of genomic DNA, allowing the split enzyme domains attached to them to interact in an optimal way, were determined. The optimal distances on DNA between binding sites of dCas9 proteins in different orientations were determined, and the dependence of the complex structure on the distance between the binding sites of dCas9 proteins was modeled. Using the methods of bioinformatics, the genomes of a number of viruses (including SARS-CoV-2) were analyzed, and the presence of genomic loci unique to the species, allowing the possibility of landing pairs of dCas9 proteins in optimal positions, was demonstrated. The possibility of a combined use of dCas9 proteins from different bacteria to expand the spectrum of detected loci was analyzed. The results of the work indicate a fundamental possibility of the creation of highly specific nucleic acid biosensors based on a combination of CRISPR/Cas9 technologies and split enzymes.","Novikov, Gribkova, Kacher, Zaytsev, Armeev, Gluhov, Shaytan","https://doi.org/10.3103/S0096392521020036","20210830","CRISPR/Cas; beta-lactamase; biosensors; genomic analysis; molecular modeling; nucleic acids; split proteins","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-31","",17562,""

Owing to the onset of the pandemic, subsequent visits were completed through telehealth with a developmental-behavioral pediatrician, psychologist, behavioral clinician, and social workers who developed a collaborative plan of care. Billy was diagnosed with global developmental delay, significant tantrums, and impulsivity but did not meet the criteria for autism spectrum disorder.Billy lives with his parents and 2 sisters in a rural area, 3 hours from the DBP clinic. Both of his parents have been treated for depression in the past and reported that school was difficult for them. His sisters, ages 5 and 6 years, receive speech/language therapy but have not required additional special education services. His family has endured recent stressors including a flooding event that caused significant damage to their home, financial difficulties, and the recent unexpected death of a close family member. Billy's disruptive behaviors have resulted in difficulty finding and maintaining child care, further contributing to parental stress and dysfunction in the home.Despite assistance from the social worker, additional developmental and behavioral support services near the family's home were not identified. Therefore, services were offered to Billy and his parents through telehealth. Billy's parents began behavioral parent training with a clinician embedded within the DBP clinic and, with direct support from his parents, Billy began receiving supplemental speech/language and occupational therapies through telehealth. Through recurrent engagement with Billy's parents and frequent communication among the behavioral clinician, developmental-behavioral pediatrician, psychologist, and social worker, Billy was able to make significant developmental progress, and his parents reported improved ability to manage his difficult behaviors.How can telehealth be used to help families navigate complex systems and obtain optimal care and support?","Barnhardt, Steingass, Levine, Jurbank, Piercefield, Nyp","https://doi.org/10.1097/DBP.0000000000000997","20210830","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-31","",17563,""
"COVID-19 Inventory and Mental Health: Preliminary Analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic imposed a set of drastic worldwide changes to and restrictions on daily life. Despite predictions of the harmful impacts of the pandemic on mental health, empirical data are lacking. This study sought to examine the relationship between individuals' perceptions about COVID-19 and scores on mental health indexes. In this cross-sectional study, 183 individuals answered self-report questionnaires. A new inventory based on the health belief model (HBM) developed in Portugal was explored with a factor analysis, which revealed two significant factors: COVID-19 anxiety and perceived severity of the disease. Results showed that anxiety about COVID-19 was positively correlated with psychological distress, somatization, and paranoid ideation and was negatively correlated with psychological well-being. COVID-19 anxiety mediated the relationship between symptomatology and mental health. Perceptions about COVID-19 seem to play pivotal roles in mental health. These results may inform interventions focused on reducing psychological distress and symptomatology and on increasing psychological well-being.","Faustino, Vasco, Delgado, Farinha-Fernandes, Guerreiro, Matos","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.psychotherapy.20210004","20210830","COVID-19 Inventory; Psychological Distress; Psychological Well-being; Symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-31","",17564,""
"Practical strategies and the need for psychological support: recommendations from nurses working in hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic","Nurses working during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have reported elevated levels of anxiety, burnout and sleep disruption. Hospital administrators are in a unique position to mitigate or exacerbate stressful working conditions. The goal of this study was to capture the recommendations of nurses providing frontline care during the pandemic. Semi-structured interviews were conducted during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, with 36 nurses living in Canada and working in Canada or the United States. The following recommendations were identified from reflexive thematic analysis of interview transcripts: (1) The nurses emphasized the need for a leadership style that embodied visibility, availability and careful planning. (2) Information overload contributed to stress, and participants appealed for clear, consistent and transparent communication. (3) A more resilient healthcare supply chain was required to safeguard the distribution of equipment, supplies and medications. (4) Clear communication of policies related to sick leave, pay equity and workload was necessary. (5) Equity should be considered, particularly with regard to redeployment. (6) Nurses wanted psychological support offered by trusted providers, managers and peers. Over-reliance on employee assistance programmes and other individualized approaches to virtual care were not well-received. An integrative systems-based approach is needed to address the multifaceted mental health outcomes and reduce the deleterious impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the nursing workforce. Results of this study capture the recommendations made by nurses during in-depth interviews conducted early in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ralph, Freeman, MÃƒÂ©nard, Soucie","https://doi.org/10.1108/JHOM-02-2021-0051","20210829","COVID-19; Hospital administration; Mental Health; Nurses","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-31","",17565,""
"Review: Mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and youth - a systematic review","The COVID-19 pandemic has posed an unprecedented threat to global mental health. Children and adolescents may be more susceptible to mental health impacts related to their vulnerable developmental stage, fear of infection, home confinement, suspension of regular school and extracurricular activities, physical distancing mandates, and larger scale threats such as global financial recessions and associated impacts. Our objective was to review existing evidence of the COVID-19 pandemic's global impact on the mental health of children and adolescents &lt;19Ã‚Â years of age and to identify personal and contextual factors that may enhance risk or confer protection in relation to mental health outcomes. We conducted a search of peer-reviewed and preprint research published in English from January 1, 2020, to February 22, 2021. We included studies collecting primary data on COVID-19-related mental health impacts on children and adolescents. We graded the strength of included articles using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine rating scheme. Our search and review yielded 116 articles presenting data on a total of 127,923 children and adolescents; 50,984 child and adolescent proxy reports (e.g., parents, healthcare practitioners); and &gt;3,000 chart reviews. A high prevalence of COVID-19-related fear was noted among children and adolescents, as well as more depressive and anxious symptoms compared with prepandemic estimates. Older adolescents, girls, and children and adolescents living with neurodiversities and/or chronic physical conditions were more likely to experience negative mental health outcomes. Many studies reported mental health deterioration among children and adolescents due to COVID-19 pandemic control measures. Physical exercise, access to entertainment, positive familial relationships, and social support were associated with better mental health outcomes. This review highlights the urgent need for practitioners and policymakers to attend to and collaborate with children and adolescents, especially those in higher risk subgroups, to mitigate short- and long-term pandemic-associated mental health effects.","Samji, Wu, Ladak, Vossen, Stewart, Dove, Long, Snell","https://doi.org/10.1111/camh.12501","20210829","Mental health; adolescence; anxiety; depression; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-31","",17566,""
"Fatigue, perceived stigma, self-reported cognitive deficits and psychological morbidity in patients recovered from COVID-19 infection","Few studies have highlighted multiple psychosocial and physical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 infection after recovery. However, the data from developing countries is limited. To evaluate psychological morbidity, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), fatigue, and perceived stigma among patients with COVID-19 after recovery from the acute phase of COVID-19 infection. In a cross-sectional online survey, 206 adult patients (age&gt;18 years), recovered from COVID-19 infection completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), 4 items self-designed questionnaire evaluating cognitive deficits and self-designed questionnaire to evaluate perceived stigma. Additionally, they completed the information about demographic and clinical information. The prevalence of anxiety, depressive symptoms, and PTSD in the study sample was 24.8 %, 23.8 %, and 30 % respectively. About three-fifths of the participants (61.2 %) had at least one fatigue symptom as per the FSS with the mean FSS score being 32.10 Ã‚Â± 15.28. About one-fourth of the participants (23.7 %) reported ""feeling confused and always feeling mentally foggy"", and 38 % of patients reported experiencing at least one cognitive problem. The level of felt stigma related to self was seen in 31.1 %, 20 % reported stigma related to family, and 50 % reported stigma in relation to neighbors and society. Those reporting higher PTSD scores had higher anxiety and depressive scores, reported more fatigue and stigma, and had a higher level of cognitive deficits. A higher fatigue score was also associated with higher anxiety, depression, and cognitive deficits. Our study reveals that a significant proportion of patients after recovery from COVID-19 experience psychological morbidities, fatigue, cognitive problems, and stigma. Efforts should be made to take care of these issues in routine post-COVID follow-up care.","Grover, Sahoo, Mishra, Gill, Mehra, Nehra, Suman, Bhalla, Puri","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2021.102815","20210829","Anxiety; COVID-19; Cognitive deficits; Depression; Fatigue; Stigma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-31","",17567,""
"Health behaviors and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal population-based survey in Germany","To understand the mental health response to repeated and prolonged stress during the COVID-19 related lockdown and the role of specific health behaviors to buffer against this stress. In a longitudinal study with several measurement points covering three months during the COVID-19 pandemic, about 3500 randomly selected participants representative of the German population reported on their mental health (anxiety, depression, loneliness) and health behaviors (screen time, snack consumption, physical activity). Symptoms of anxiety, depression, and loneliness were highest shortly after the lockdown came into effect. Over time, the symptoms were stable or went down slightly, corresponding to patterns of habituation. Among people with higher vulnerability to poor mental health during the lockdown (e.g., women), the proportion with high levels of anxiety, depression, and loneliness was considerably larger. These groups also reported fewer health-promoting behaviors. More screen time, more snacking, and less physical activity were related to higher symptoms of anxiety, depression, and loneliness across all time points. Changes in health behaviors over time mostly did not predict changes in mental health symptoms. Mental health and engagement in protective health behaviors was lowest at the start of the lockdown. Health behaviors mostly returned to pre-lockdown levels within three months. Engaging in healthier behaviors was associated with better mental health. Policy implications of these findings are discussed. This study provides important insights into (unintended) side effects of an international crisis and can contribute to a better understanding of how to preserve mental health.","Mata, Wenz, Rettig, Reifenscheid, MÃƒÂ¶hring, Krieger, Friedel, Fikel, Cornesse, Blom, Naumann","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114333","20210829","COVID-19; Mental health; Physical activity; Screen time; Snacking","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-31","",17568,""

Along with these social and societal factors, biological factors triggered by intense stress intertwined with incumbent overactivity of the immune system and resulting inflammatory outcomes may impact the functional status the central nervous system (CNS). We review the literature concerning SARS-CoV2 infiltration and infection in the CNS and the prospects of synergy between stress, inflammation, and kynurenine pathway function during illness and recovery from Covid-19.

"","The spring 2020 COVID-19 epidemic severely impacted France's healthcare system. The associated lockdown (17Ã‚Â March- 11Ã‚Â May 2020) and the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 led patients to change their use of healthcare. This article presents the development and implementation of a real-time system to monitor i) private doctors' activity in South-eastern France, and ii) changes in prescription of drugs for people with diabetes, mental health disorders and for certain vaccines from Mars 2020 to October 2020. Data extracted from the regional healthcare insurance databases for 2019 and 2020 were used to construct indicators of healthcare use. They were calculated on a weekly basis, starting from week 2 2020 and compared for the same period between 2019 and 2020. Private doctors' activity decreased during the spring 2020 lockdown (by 23Ã‚Â % for general practitioners and 46Ã‚Â % for specialists), followed by an almost complete return to normal after it ended until week 41. Over the same period, a huge increase in teleconsultations was observed, accounting for 30Ã‚Â % of private doctors' consultations at the height of the crisis. The start of the lockdown was marked by a peak in drug prescriptions, while vaccinations declined sharply (by 39Ã‚Â % for the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine in children under 5Ã‚Â years old, and by 54Ã‚Â % for human papillomavirus vaccine in girls aged 10-14Ã‚Â years old). The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic may lead to health consequences other than those directly attributable to the disease itself. Specifically, lockdowns and foregoing healthcare could be very harmful at the individual and population levels. The latter issue is a concern for French public authorities, which have implemented actions aimed at encouraging patients to immediately seek treatment. However, the COVID-19 crisis has also created opportunities, such as the roll-out of teleconsultation and tele-expertise. The indicators described here as part of the monitoring system can help public decision-makers to become more responsive and to implement tailored actions to better meet the general population's healthcare needs.","Davin-Casalena, Jardin, Guerrera, Mabille, TrÃƒÂ©hard, Lapalus, MÃƒÂ©nager, Nauleau, Cassaro, Verger, Guagliardo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.respe.2021.07.006","20210829","COVID-19; Doctors; Drugs; Healthcare use; Private healthcare; Public health; Vaccination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-31","",17570,""
"1-year outcomes in hospital survivors with COVID-19: a longitudinal cohort study","The full range of long-term health consequences of COVID-19 in patients who are discharged from hospital is largely unclear. The aim of our study was to comprehensively compare consequences between 6 months and 12 months after symptom onset among hospital survivors with COVID-19. We undertook an ambidirectional cohort study of COVID-19 survivors who had been discharged from Jin Yin-tan Hospital (Wuhan, China) between Jan 7 and May 29, 2020. At 6-month and 12-month follow-up visit, survivors were interviewed with questionnaires on symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and received a physical examination, a 6-min walking test, and laboratory tests. They were required to report their health-care use after discharge and work status at the 12-month visit. Survivors who had completed pulmonary function tests or had lung radiographic abnormality at 6 months were given the corresponding tests at 12 months. Non-COVID-19 participants (controls) matched for age, sex, and comorbidities were interviewed and completed questionnaires to assess prevalent symptoms and HRQoL. The primary outcomes were symptoms, modified British Medical Research Council (mMRC) score, HRQoL, and distance walked in 6 min (6MWD). Multivariable adjusted logistic regression models were used to evaluate the risk factors of 12-month outcomes. 1276 COVID-19 survivors completed both visits. The median age of patients was 59Ã‚Â·0 years (IQR 49Ã‚Â·0-67Ã‚Â·0) and 681 (53%) were men. The median follow-up time was 185Ã‚Â·0 days (IQR 175Ã‚Â·0-198Ã‚Â·0) for the 6-month visit and 349Ã‚Â·0 days (337Ã‚Â·0-361Ã‚Â·0) for the 12-month visit after symptom onset. The proportion of patients with at least one sequelae symptom decreased from 68% (831/1227) at 6 months to 49% (620/1272) at 12 months (p&lt;0Ã‚Â·0001). The proportion of patients with dyspnoea, characterised by mMRC score of 1 or more, slightly increased from 26% (313/1185) at 6-month visit to 30% (380/1271) at 12-month visit (p=0Ã‚Â·014). Additionally, more patients had anxiety or depression at 12-month visit (26% [331/1271] at 12-month visit vs 23% [274/1187] at 6-month visit; p=0Ã‚Â·015). No significant difference on 6MWD was observed between 6 months and 12 months. 88% (422/479) of patients who were employed before COVID-19 had returned to their original work at 12 months. Compared with men, women had an odds ratio of 1Ã‚Â·43 (95% CI 1Ã‚Â·04-1Ã‚Â·96) for fatigue or muscle weakness, 2Ã‚Â·00 (1Ã‚Â·48-2Ã‚Â·69) for anxiety or depression, and 2Ã‚Â·97 (1Ã‚Â·50-5Ã‚Â·88) for diffusion impairment. Matched COVID-19 survivors at 12 months had more problems with mobility, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression, and had more prevalent symptoms than did controls. Most COVID-19 survivors had a good physical and functional recovery during 1-year follow-up, and had returned to their original work and life. The health status in our cohort of COVID-19 survivors at 12 months was still lower than that in the control population.

"The impact of COVID-19 on eating disorder referrals and admissions in Waikato, New Zealand","Several countries have reported increased demand for eating disorder services during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly for adolescents. Within New Zealand, anecdotal and media reports suggest similar changes but are limited in scope and detail. We assessed eating disorder service demand in the Waikato district in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. We retrospectively analysed records of eating disorder admissions and referrals for both children (&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°18Ã‚Â years) and adults (Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°18Ã‚Â years) during 2019 and 2020 in the Waikato, a mixed urban-rural province in northern New Zealand (population 435,000). We analysed medical admission and outpatient referral rates, and referral acuity, in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic using Welch's t- and chi-square tests. 106 medical admissions met inclusion criteria (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°37 in 2019; 69 in 2020). Admissions for eating disorders increased markedly following nationwide lockdown in March 2020 (RRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.7, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01), largely driven by increases in adult admissions (RR 2.0, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.005). The proportion of 'new patient' admissions showed comparable increases for both children (RRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.0, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.02) and adults (RRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.3, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.03). Following lockdown, outpatient referrals increased in acuity (RRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.8, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.047) and volume (RRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.6, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.076) for children but not for adults. Our study confirms a pandemic-related increase in demand for eating disorder services in the Waikato region of New Zealand, consistent with findings reported overseas. We observed contrasting increases in admissions for adults and outpatient referrals for children, exacerbating resource constraints for already stretched services and compromising provision of timely care. The COVID-19 pandemic has been linked to increased numbers and worsening severity of eating disorders in several settings. In New Zealand, similar trends have been noted anecdotally. We assessed clinical records to calculate rates of eating disorder-related hospital admissions and outpatient referrals during 2019 and 2020. We found significant increases in hospital admissions related to COVID-19, particularly for adults, and greater proportions of both children and adults having a first-ever eating disorder-related admission. In outpatient services, young people were referred more frequently during the pandemic and were more physically unwell when referred. These results indicate increased demand for eating disorder services as a result of the pandemic and complement findings reported overseas.","Hansen, Stephan, Menkes","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40337-021-00462-0","20210829","Anorexia nervosa; Bulimia nervosa; Feeding and eating disorders; Mental health services; New Zealand; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-31","",17572,""
"Anxiety, trauma and well-being in health-care professionals during COVID-19 first wave in Spain: the moderating role of personal protection equipment availability","The effect of COVID-19 on Health-Care Professionals' mental health has received increased attention in the last year's literature. However, previous studies essentially evaluated psychopathological symptoms and not the presence of positive mental health. Therefore, the first objective of the present research is to evaluate health-care professionals' mental illness (i.e., anxiety and traumatic intensity) and positive mental health (i.e., well-being) using the Complete State Model of Health. Our second objective is to study the effect of Personal Protection Equipment availability on professionals' mental health. Two-hundred and thirty-two health-care professionals working in Spain in the first line of COVID-19 patient care participated in the study. To measure anxiety, traumatic intensity and well-being participants completed the State Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Davidson Trauma Scale, and the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form. Pearson correlations were used to examine the relationships between all scales. In order to test the two continua model of mental health, we used parallel analysis and exploratory factor analysis. To analyze anxiety, traumatic intensity, and well-being differences between health-care professionals with and without Personal Protection Equipment availability we conducted different ANOVAS. To test our hypothesis regarding the moderating role of Personal Protection Equipment availability in the effect of mental illness on positive mental health, data were subjected to a hierarchical regression analysis. As in previous studies, health-care professionals showed high levels of anxiety and traumatic intensity. They also presented low levels of well-being indicators. According to our hypothesis, results of parallel analysis and exploratory factorial analysis indicated that the measures of mental illness and positive mental health loaded on separate but correlated factors. Finally, Personal Protection Equipment availability moderated the effects of state anxiety and traumatic intensity on professionals' well-being. Health-care professionals' mental illness and positive mental health reflect distinct continua, rather than the extreme ends of a single spectrum. Therefore, it is essential to measure both psychopathology and the presence of positive health to comprehensively evaluate professionals' mental health. Finally, our results indicated that Personal Protection Equipment availability is essential not only for professionals' physical health, but also for their mental health.","Bajo, Gallego, Stavraki, Lamprinakos, Luna, DÃƒÂ­az","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12955-021-01845-2","20210829","Anxiety; Complete state model of health; Health-care professionals; Well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-31","",17573,""
"The pathways from perceived discrimination to self-rated health among the Chinese diaspora during the COVID-19 pandemic: investigation of the roles of depression, anxiety, and social support","Research indicates the adverse impacts of perceived discrimination on health, and discrimination inflamed by the COVID-19 pandemic, a type of social exclusion, could affect the well-being of the Chinese diaspora. We analyzed the relationship and pathways of perceived discrimination's effect on health among the Chinese diaspora in the context of the pandemic to contribute to the literature on discrimination in this population under the global public health crisis. We analyzed data from 705 individuals of Chinese descent residing in countries outside of China who participated in a cross-sectional online survey between April 22 and May 9, 2020. This study utilized a structural equation model (SEM) to evaluate both direct and indirect effects of perceived discrimination on self-rated health (SRH) and to assess the mediating roles of psychological distress (namely, anxiety and depression) and social support from family and friends. This online sample comprised predominantly young adults and those of relatively high socioeconomic status. This study confirmed the total and direct effect of recently perceived discrimination on SRH and found the indirect effect was mainly mediated by depression. Mediating roles of anxiety and social support on the discrimination-health relationship were found insignificant in this SEM. Our findings suggest discrimination negatively affected the well-being of the Chinese diaspora, and depression acted as a major mediator between the discrimination-health relationship. Therefore, interventions for reducing discrimination to preserve the well-being of the Chinese diaspora are necessary. Prompt intervention to address depression may partially relieve the disease burden caused by the surge of discrimination.","Chen, Wang, Dong, Xu, Wu, Zhang, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-021-01537-9","20210829","COVID-19; Chinese diaspora; Cross-sectional; Mental health; Perceived discrimination; Self-rated health; Social support; Structural equation model","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-31","",17574,""
"The EPIPHA-KNEE trial: Explaining Pain to target unhelpful pain beliefs to Increase PHysical Activity in KNEE osteoarthritis - a protocol for a multicentre, randomised controlled trial with clinical- and cost-effectiveness analysis","Despite well-established benefits of physical activity for knee osteoarthritis (OA), nine of ten people with knee OA are inactive. People with knee OA who are inactive often believe that physical activity is dangerous, fearing that it will further damage their joint(s). Such unhelpful beliefs can negatively influence physical activity levels. We aim to evaluate the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of integrating physiotherapist-delivered pain science education (PSE), an evidence-based conceptual change intervention targeting unhelpful pain beliefs by increasing pain knowledge, with an individualised walking, strengthening, and general education program. Two-arm, parallel-design, multicentre randomised controlled trial involving 198 people aged Ã¢â€°Â¥50Ã¢â‚¬â€°years with painful knee OA who do not meet physical activity guideline recommendations or walk regularly for exercise. Both groups receive an individualised physiotherapist-led walking, strengthening, and OA/activity education program via 4x weekly in-person treatment sessions, followed by 4Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks of at-home activities (weekly check-in via telehealth), with follow-up sessions at 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°months (telehealth) and 5 and 9Ã¢â‚¬â€°months (in-person). The EPIPHA-KNEE group also receives contemporary PSE about OA/pain and activity, embedded into all aspects of the intervention. Outcomes are assessed at baseline, 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks, 6 and 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°months. Primary outcomes are physical activity level (step count; wrist-based accelerometry) and self-reported knee symptoms (WOMAC Total score) at 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°months. Secondary outcomes are quality of life, pain intensity, global rating of change, self-efficacy, pain catastrophising, depression, anxiety, stress, fear of movement, knee awareness, OA/activity conceptualisation, and self-regulated learning ability. Additional measures include adherence, adverse events, blinding success, COVID-19 impact on activity, intention to exercise, treatment expectancy/perceived credibility, implicit movement/environmental bias, implicit motor imagery, two-point discrimination, and pain sensitivity to activity. Cost-utility analysis of the EPIPHA-KNEE intervention will be undertaken, in addition to evaluation of cost-effectiveness in the context of primary trial outcomes. We will determine whether the integration of PSE into an individualised OA education, walking, and strengthening program is more effective than receiving the individualised program alone. Findings will inform the development and implementation of future delivery of PSE as part of best practice for people with knee OA.

"Association of COVID-19 Risk Misperceptions With Household Isolation in the United States: Survey Study","Adverse mental and emotional health outcomes are increasingly recognized as a public health challenge associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal of this study was to examine the association of COVID-19 risk misperceptions with self-reported household isolation, a potential risk factor for social isolation and loneliness. We analyzed data from the Franklin Templeton-Gallup Economics of Recovery Study (July to December 2020) of 24,649 US adults. We also analyzed data from the Gallup Panel (March 2020 to February 2021), which included 123,516 observations about loneliness. The primary outcome was self-reported household isolation, which we defined as a respondent having no contact or very little contact with people outside their household, analogous to quarantining. From July to December 2020, 53% to 57% of respondents reported living in household isolation. Most participants reported beliefs about COVID-19 health risks that were inaccurate, and overestimation of health risk was most common. For example, while deaths in persons younger than 55 years old accounted for 7% of total US deaths, respondents estimated that this population represented 43% of deaths. Overestimating COVID-19 health risks was associated with increased self-reported household isolation, with percentage differences ranging from 5.6 to 11.8 (P&lt;.001 at each time point). Characteristics associated with self-reported household isolation from the July and August 2020 surveys and persisting in the December 2020 survey included younger age (18 to 39 years), having a serious medical condition, having a household member with a serious medical condition, and identifying as a Democrat. In the Gallup Panel, self-reported household isolation was associated with a higher prevalence of loneliness. Pandemic-related harms to emotional and mental well-being may be attenuated by reducing risk overestimation and household isolation preferences that exceed public health guidelines.","Ladapo, Rothwell, Ramirez","https://doi.org/10.2196/30164","20210830","COVID-19; United States; guideline; health risk; isolation; loneliness; mental health; pandemic; perception; public health; risk; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-31","",17576,""
