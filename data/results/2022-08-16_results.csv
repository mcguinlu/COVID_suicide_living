"Online psychosocial interventions for improving mental health in people during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis","During the COVID-19 pandemic, interventions for public mental health were mostly delivered through online modalities. Although many studies have explored the effectiveness of online psychosocial interventions through randomized controlled trials, there is a lack of quantitative synthesis of the effectiveness of online psychosocial interventions and an examination of their overall application. To understand the commonly used psychosocial interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic and the effectiveness of the interventions. Risk bias was assessed in the included studies according to the Cochrane Collaboration criteria, and data from post-test and follow-up were combined for standardized mean differences using Stata 16.0 software, and sources of heterogeneity were explored by subgroup analysis, and risk bias was assessed in the included studies using Review Manager 5.4 software. The study was written in strict accordance with PRISMA specifications, and registration was completed on the PROSPERO platform (CRD42022302917). The online psychosocial intervention had an ameliorating effect on anxiety (SMDÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯-0.78), depression (SMDÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯-0.80), and insomnia (SMDÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯-0.19) in the public during the COVID-19 pandemic, was ineffective for the intervention on stress, and the effectiveness of the intervention on depression continued at follow-up. Subgroup analyses showed that the type of intervention, intervention form, Duration of intervention, and setting of the control group influenced the trial results to some extent, with cognitive behavioral therapy being the most effective intervention for anxiety and depressive symptoms, self-help interventions being more effective than interventions with therapist interventions, and 1-4Ã¢â‚¬Â¯week interventions being more effective than 5-8Ã¢â‚¬Â¯week interventions. Due to the limited number of studies included in the analysis and variability in quality, more randomized controlled trials are needed to test the findings. Online psychosocial interventions can be effective in improving symptoms of anxiety, depression, stress, and insomnia in the public during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, additional randomized controlled trial studies are needed to determine which types of interventions are more appropriate for which populations and how they can be implemented to achieve better intervention outcomes.","Zhiyu, Wentian, Ruizi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.08.023","20220815","COVID-19 pandemic; Mental health; Online psychosocial intervention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-16","",36108,""

"Substance use and common contributors to morbidity: A genetics perspective","Excessive substance use and substance use disorders (SUDs) are common, serious and relapsing medical conditions. They frequently co-occur with other diseases that are leading contributors to disability worldwide. While heavy substance use may potentiate the course of some of these illnesses, there is accumulating evidence suggesting common genetic architectures. In this narrative review, we focus on four heritable medical conditions - cardiometabolic disease, chronic pain, depression and COVID-19, which are commonly overlapping with, but not necessarily a direct consequence of, SUDs. We find persuasive evidence of underlying genetic liability that predisposes to both SUDs and chronic pain, depression, and COVID-19. For cardiometabolic disease, there is greater support for a potential causal influence of problematic substance use. Our review encourages de-stigmatization of SUDs and the assessment of substance use in clinical settings. We assert that identifying shared pathways of risk has high translational potential, allowing tailoring of treatments for multiple medical conditions.

"Adapting integrative cognitive-affective therapy for adolescents with full and subthreshold bulimia nervosa: A feasibility study","Integrative Cognitive Affective Therapy (ICAT) is an empirically supported treatment for bulimia nervosa (BN) in adults. However, it is unclear whether a modified version, Integrative Cognitive Affective Therapy-Adolescent (ICAT-A) is feasible and beneficial for adolescents. This study evaluated the feasibility of ICAT-A for adolescents with BN or subthreshold BN. Eight adolescents with BN or subthreshold BN (mean ageÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 16.1) were enroled in the study. At baseline and end of treatment, adolescents who participated in ICAT-A completed the Eating Disorder Examination (EDE) and self-report measures of eating disorder symptoms, depression, anxiety, self-esteem and functional impairment. Retention for the intervention (75%) suggests that the majority of participants found the intervention acceptable. Although all treatment completers participated in the clinician-administered assessment (EDE), compliance with end of treatment self-report questionnaires was compromised by the COVID-19 pandemic, which occurred during the treatment course of the majority of the sample. At the end of treatment, all 6 adolescents who completed the ICAT-A intervention were in full eating disorder remission based on EDE scores, with large effect sizes identified for reductions in EDE global scores (dÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.71), objective binge episodes (dÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.91), subjective binge episodes (dÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.06) and compensatory behaviours (dÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.72). Results suggest that ICAT-A is a feasible treatment that has promise for the treatment of adolescents with BN. Future studies are necessary to establish the efficacy of ICAT-A for adolescent BN.","Lebow, Sim, Wonderlich, Peterson","https://doi.org/10.1002/erv.2946","20220815","adolescent; bulimia nervosa; feeding and eating disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-16","",36111,""
"A Group Videoconferencing Intervention (C@nnected) to Improve Maternal Sensitivity: Protocol for a Randomized Feasibility Trial","Early childhood development is highly dependent on the sensitive care provided by caregivers, and interventions focused on supporting parents to improve their sensitivity have shown to be effective. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on mental health, with pregnant women and mothers of infants being an especially vulnerable group and maternal sensitivity particularly affected. However, access to face-to-face interventions is restricted; thus, it is important to have remote interventions to support this group of mothers. The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of C@nnected, a group videoconferencing intervention to improve maternal sensitivity aimed at mother-infant dyads attending primary health care centers in vulnerable areas of Santiago, Chile. This is a randomized feasibility single-masked (outcome assessor) study with a qualitative component. It will involve a block randomization procedure to generate a 3:2 allocation ratio (with more people allocated to the intervention arm). The intervention consists of 4 group videoconferencing sessions adapted from a face-to-face intervention with proven effectiveness. The control group will receive treatment as usual, along with educational brochures. The feasibility and acceptability of this study will be quantitatively and qualitatively assessed. Changes in clinical outcomes relating to maternal sensitivity, depressive symptoms, postpartum maternal attachment, and infant socioemotional development will also be evaluated. We finished adapting the face-to-face intervention to the videoconferencing format in July 2021. The study began recruitment in August 2021, and enrollment is expected to end in August 2022, with final study results expected in December 2022. This study will contribute evidence for the use of eHealth interventions to promote maternal sensitivity. It will also inform the design and implementation of a future randomized clinical trial.

"Topics and Sentiments Influence Likes: A Study of Facebook Public Pages' Posts About COVID-19 Vaccination","In this study, we analyzed &gt;200,000 posts collected from Facebook public pages that were published in December 2020 during the rollout of the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to the American public. We ran both topic modeling and sentiment analysis of the posts and found that first Facebook posts talked about not only treatment effectiveness such as trial results and testing approaches but also other issues that surround vaccines such as approval and distribution. Second, although the general sentiment during this period was positive and anticipation was the highest emotion, Facebook posts expressed a salient amount of fear and sadness, especially when discussing emergency approval and trial results. Finally, we found that both topics and sentiments have a significant influence on user likes. Using the topic of vaccine distribution as a baseline, posts that discuss related aspects of vaccines (e.g., effectiveness, shipment, and testing), call for actions (e.g., use of masks) and indicate care to vulnerable groups (e.g., health care workers and seniors) received more likes. Posts with bad news (e.g., new cases and deaths) and doubts over the usefulness of vaccines received fewer likes. Regardless of their valences, approach emotions lead to more likes whereas withdrawal emotions lead to fewer likes. Our study suggests that to facilitate actions, using certain topics and approach emotions in the posts could be helpful.","Zhang, Mukerjee, Qin","https://doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2022.0063","20220815","COVID-19; Facebook; likes; sentiment analysis; topic modeling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-16","",36113,""
"One-year results from the vaccination campaign against COVID-19 infection in 47 million individuals with severe mental disorders and other chronic diseases","Severe mental disorders have been associated with increased COVID-19 mortality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of the vaccination campaign against COVID-19 after 1 year using exhaustive population-based data. In this nationwide population-based study, we used data from the French national medico-administrative database (SNDS) and the COVID Vaccine teleservice from January 4, 2021 (date of activation of the teleservice) to January 30th, 2022. As of January 30th, 2022, the rate of first injection in France was 80.2% (54 million people) and the rate of booster vaccination was 78.3% (52.7 million people). Except for opioid use disorder, all individuals with chronic illnesses or risk factors for poor COVID-19 outcome (e.g., smoking and obesity) had higher rates of vaccination than the general population (from 83.4 to 94.5% vs. 78.3%). However, the four diseases ranking last for both initial and booster vaccinations were mental disorders: alcohol use disorders (86 and 84.3%), neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders (85.3 and 83.7%), schizophrenia-spectrum disorder (85 and 83.4%) and opioid use disorders (72.9 and 69.4%). Except for opioid disorders, all patients with mental disorders had higher rates of vaccination compared to the general population. However, these rates were lower than other chronic diseases at risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. Vaccination campaigns must redouble their efforts to improve vaccination penetration in patients with mental disorders.","Fond, Yon, Boyer","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00406-022-01467-9","20220815","COVID-19; Depressive disorders; Mental health; Mood disorders; Psychiatry; Schizophrenia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-16","",36114,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychotropic medication uptake: time-series analysis of a population-wide cohort","The COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns were predicted to have a major impact on mental health, however current studies have produced contradictory findings with limited longitudinal data. Nine years of linked, individual-level administrative data were used to examine changes in psychotropic medication uptake before and during the pandemic. Medication data from a population-wide prescribing database were linked to demographic and socioeconomic indicators from healthcare registration records (<i>n</i> = 1 801 860). Monthly prescription uptake was split (pre-restrictions: January 2012 to February 2020 and during restrictions: March to October 2020). Auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models were trained in R taking into consideration trends and seasonal effects. Forecast ('expected') monthly values were compared with 'actual' values, stratified by demographic factors. Over the study period 38.5% of the study population were in receipt of Ã¢â€°Â¥1 psychotropic medication. Uptake of these medications have been following a strong upward trend since January 2012. In March 2020 uptake of all medications increased beyond expected values, returning to expected trends from May 2020 for antidepressants, anxiolytics and antipsychotics. In the 8 months during restrictions uptake of hypnotic medication was 12% higher than expected among those &lt;18 years, and anxiolytic medication higher than expected in those &gt;65 years. Results suggest an initial 'stockpiling' of medications in March 2020 before trends mostly returned to expected levels. The anticipated tsunami of mental ill health is not yet manifest in psychotropic medication uptake. There are indications of increased anxiety and sleep difficulties in some subgroups, although these conditions may resolve as we emerge from the pandemic without need for psychiatric intervention.","Maguire, Kent, O'Neill, O'Hagan, O'Reilly","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.2022.112","20220815","COVID-19; cohort; data linkage; mental health; psychotropic medications","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-16","",36115,""

"Engaging nurses in patient recruitment to research trials in the emergency department","Research is essential for the implementation of evidence-based practice and can lead to improvements and innovations in care delivery. Although ultimately beneficial for patients and staff, the data collection involved in research often presents challenges, particularly in the emergency department (ED) setting. This article describes the challenges of undertaking a feasibility trial in a city centre ED. The target research population were adult patients who presented to the ED with an issue related to opioid misuse, for example opioid overdose, injection site wounds and/or abscess, or injury sustained during opioid intoxication. Challenges experienced during this trial included a demanding work environment, ED attendees not being suitable for recruitment into research, and suspension of the trial during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The author details the strategies introduced to ensure effective patient recruitment to the trial, including nurse secondment onto the research team, offering incentives, raising awareness of the trial among ED staff and implementing flexible training. These strategies continued to be effective after a period of suspension due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Wait","https://doi.org/10.7748/en.2022.e2137","20220815","accident and emergency; emergency care; mental health; overdose; research; study participation; study recruitment; substance misuse","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-16","",36117,""
"Mental health problems and needs of frontline healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain: A qualitative analysis","Healthcare workers (HCWs) from COVID-19 hotspots worldwide have reported poor mental health outcomes since the pandemic's beginning. The virulence of the initial COVID-19 surge in Spain and the urgency for rapid evidence constrained early studies in their capacity to inform mental health programs accurately. Here, we used a qualitative research design to describe relevant mental health problems among frontline HCWs and explore their association with determinants and consequences and their implications for the design and implementation of mental health programs. Following the Programme Design, Implementation, Monitoring, and Evaluation (DIME) protocol, we used a two-step qualitative research design to interview frontline HCWs, mental health experts, administrators, and service planners in Spain. We used Free List (FL) interviews to identify problems experienced by frontline HCWs and Key informant (KI) interviews to describe them and explore their determinants and consequences, as well as the strategies considered useful to overcome these problems. We used a thematic analysis approach to analyze the interview outputs and framed our results into a five-level social-ecological model (intrapersonal, interpersonal, organizational, community, and public health). We recruited 75 FL and 22 KI interviewees, roughly balanced in age and gender. We detected 56 themes during the FL interviews and explored the following themes in the KI interviews: fear of infection, psychological distress, stress, moral distress, and interpersonal conflicts among coworkers. We found that interviewees reported perceived causes and consequences across problems at all levels (intrapersonal to public health). Although several mental health strategies were implemented (especially at an intrapersonal and interpersonal level), most mental health needs remained unmet, especially at the organizational, community, and public policy levels. In keeping with available quantitative evidence, our findings show that mental health problems are still relevant for frontline HCWs 1 year after the COVID-19 pandemic and that many reported causes of these problems are modifiable. Based on this, we offer specific recommendations to design and implement mental health strategies and recommend using transdiagnostic, low-intensity, scalable psychological interventions contextually adapted and tailored for HCWs.","Mediavilla, Monistrol-Mula, McGreevy, Felez-Nobrega, Delaire, Nicaise, Palomo-Conti, BayÃƒÂ³n, Bravo-Ortiz, RodrÃƒÂ­guez-Vega, Witteveen, Sijbrandij, Turrini, Purgato, Vuillermoz, Melchior, Petri-RomÃƒÂ£o, Stoffers-Winterling, Bryant, McDaid, Park, Ayuso-Mateos, Corrao, Haro, Lora, Kalisch, Lorant, Mittendorfer-Rutz, Penninx, Walter, Roos","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.956403","20220815","COVID-19; free list interviews; healthcare workers (HCWs); key informant interviews; mental health; occupational health; psychological distress; qualitative study","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-16","",36118,""
"Perceived Stress, Resilience, and Wellbeing in Seasoned Isha Yoga Practitioners Compared to Matched Controls During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Yoga practices, including breathing, meditation, and posture protocols (asanas), have been shown to facilitate physical and mental wellbeing. Seasoned yoga practitioners were recruited from the Isha Foundation. Recruitment of the comparison group was achieved using snowball sampling and were not yoga practitioners. Participants in the non-yoga group were randomized to a 3-min Isha practice or a comparator group asked to perform 15-min of daily reading. Participants completed a series of web-based surveys (REDCap) at baseline, 6, and 12 weeks. These surveys include validated scales and objective questions on COVID-19 infection and medical history. The validated questionnaires assess for: perceived stress (PSS), mood states [anxiety and depression (PHQ-4), joy (DPES-Joy subscale)], mindfulness attention and awareness (MAAS), resilience (BRS), mental wellbeing (WEMWBS) and recovery from traumatic event (PTGI). Weekly activity diaries were employed as a tool for collecting compliance information from study participants. Perceived stress scale scores were identified as primary outcome for this study. The median Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score for the yoga practitioners compared to the active and placebo comparators was significantly lower at all time-points: baseline: 11 [IQR 7-15] vs. 16 [IQR 12-21] in both the active and placebo comparators (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001); 6 weeks: 9 [IQR 6-13] vs. 12 [IQR 8-17] in the active comparator and 14 [IQR 9-18] in the placebo comparator (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001); and 12 weeks: 9 [IQR 5-13] vs. 11.5 [IQR 8-16] in the active comparators and 13 [IQR 8-17] in the placebo comparator (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Among the randomized participants that were compliant for the full 12 weeks, the active comparators had significantly lower median PSS scores than the placebo comparators 12 weeks [10 (IQR 5-14) vs. 13 (IQR 8-17), <i>p</i> = 0.017]. Further, yoga practitioners had significantly lower anxiety at all three-time points (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), lower depression at baseline and 6 weeks (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0003), and significantly higher wellbeing (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) and joy (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) at all three-time points, compared to the active and placebo comparator groups. The lower levels of stress, anxiety, depression, and higher level of wellbeing and joy seen in the yoga practitioners compared to the active and placebo comparators illustrate the impact of regular yoga practices on mental health even during the pandemic.

This work is based on a qualitative, phenomenological, and interpretative approach through in-depth interviews with 42 informants, including 36 social and healthcare professionals, as well as 6 family members of those who died from COVID-19 in Madrid. The interviews were processed through a qualitative, interpretative, categorical analysis. Healthcare professionals were overexposed to a significant number of deaths under dramatic circumstances. Many of these professionals had difficulties processing their experiences and expressed the need for psychological help. The fact that certain professionals had previous exposure to high mortality rates was not a protective factor. Some coping differences were seen between healthcare professionals and professionals dedicated to the care of the deceased (undertakers or firemen), particularly in the degree to which they personalized the care they provided. The overexposure to death with the circumstances that existed during the state of emergency had a significant emotional impact on the professionals, which can lead to mental health problems in the near term.","HernÃƒÂ¡ndez-FernÃƒÂ¡ndez, Meneses-FalcÃƒÂ³n","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.957173","20220815","COVID-19; burnout; death; death anxiety; social services and healthcare professionals","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-16","",36120,""
"Vaccination against COVID-19 reduces virus-related fears: Findings from a German longitudinal study","During the recent pandemic, fear of COVID-19 has been widespread and is considered to deteriorate mental health. We assessed whether vaccination can effectively reduce the fear of COVID-19 and, thus, contribute to improving people's mental health status. We used two-wave panel data from a German online study collected in April 2021 (t1) and August/September 2021 (t2) and estimated differences-in-differences to determine whether those who were vaccinated against COVID-19 experienced a reduction of fear of COVID-19, and whether the reduction was more evident as compared to people who were not vaccinated for various reasons. Fear of COVID-19 generally decreased between t1 and t2 for all respondents. Moreover, reduction of fear for people who were unvaccinated at t1 but received the vaccine between t1 and t2 was strongest as compared to people who did not get vaccinated during that period, even after we controlled for factors associated with fear (e.g., age, gender). Vaccination reduced fear of COVID-19 beyond some seasonal fluctuation and, therefore, we argue that vaccination partially reduces the psychological distress caused by the pandemic. We recommend that scientists, practitioners, and politicians highlight this additional positive effect of vaccination in health communication.","Seddig, Maskileyson, Davidov","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.878787","20220815","COVID-19; differences-in-differences; fear of COVID-19; mental health; vaccination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-16","",36121,""
"Anxiety and depression in dry eye patients during the COVID-19 pandemic: Mental state investigation and influencing factor analysis","Investigate the anxiety and depression states among dry eye (DE) patients during the COVID-19 outbreak and analyze their influence factors. The study was conducted in a tertiary eye hospital in Tianjin, China from March-April 2021. Four hundred twenty-eight DE patients were tested with the Ocular Surface Disease Index, Short Healthy Anxiety Inventory, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Descriptive statistics was used to assess the difference between DE with depression or anxiety among different groups. And multiple linear regression was used to explore factors that influence anxiety and depression in DE patients. The incidence rates of anxiety and depression among DE patients during COVID-19 were 27.34 and 26.87%, respectively. The proportion with comorbid anxiety and depression was 24.30%. Patients' education level (<i>t</i> = -3.001, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05; <i>t</i> = -3.631, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), course of disease (<i>t</i> = 2.341, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05; <i>t</i> = 2.444, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), health anxiety (<i>t</i> = 3.015, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05; <i>t</i> = 2.731, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), and subjective sleep quality (<i>t</i> = 3.610, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05; <i>t</i> = 4.203, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) had certain influences on anxiety and depression. The results showed that subjective symptoms of DE patients were related to depression and anxiety. Higher education, shorter disease duration, lower health anxiety levels, and better subjective sleep quality were associated with the reduced depressive and anxiety symptoms in DE patients. These findings could be deemed beneficial to the treatment and prevention of DE during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Chen, He, Shi, Xu, Yang, Wei","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.929909","20220815","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; dry eye; health anxiety; linear regression; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-16","",36122,""
"Measuring, Modeling, and Forecasting the Mental Wealth of Nations","The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the deep links and fragility of economic, health and social systems. Discussions of reconstruction include renewed interest in moving beyond GDP and recognizing ""human capital"", ""brain capital"", ""mental capital"", and ""wellbeing"" as assets fundamental to economic reimagining, productivity, and prosperity. This paper describes how the conceptualization of Mental Wealth provides an important framing for measuring and shaping social and economic renewal to underpin healthy, productive, resilient, and thriving communities. We propose a transdisciplinary application of systems modeling to forecast a nation's Mental Wealth and understand the extent to which policy-mediated changes in economic, social, and health sectors could enhance collective mental health and wellbeing, social cohesion, and national prosperity. Specifically, simulation will allow comparison of the projected impacts of a range of cross-sector strategies (education sector, mental health system, labor market, and macroeconomic reforms) on GDP and national Mental Wealth, and provide decision support capability for future investments and actions to foster Mental Wealth. Finally, this paper introduces the Mental Wealth Initiative that is harnessing complex systems science to examine the interrelationships between social, commercial, and structural determinants of mental health and wellbeing, and working to empirically challenge the notion that fostering universal social prosperity is at odds with economic and commercial interests.","Occhipinti, Buchanan, Skinner, Song, Tran, Rosenberg, Fels, Doraiswamy, Meier, Prodan, Hickie","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.879183","20220815","gross domestic product (GDP); mental capital; mental health; policy analysis; simulation; systems modeling; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-16","",36123,""
"Metacognitive Reflection and Insight Therapy (MERIT) Delivered Virtually During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Illustration of Two Cases","Alternative platform offerings for psychotherapy have become a necessity in the age of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The current study describes the virtual adaptation of Metacognitive Reflection and Insight Therapy (MERIT) for people with psychosis. MERIT is a recovery-oriented psychotherapy that has shown promise in increasing metacognition and allowing individuals to make meaning of their psychiatric challenges and direct their own recovery efforts. MERIT delivery requires the assumption that metacognitive reflection is an intersubjective act where individuals make meaning with others instead of in isolation. As such, considering the current COVID-19 pandemic, research is needed to understand how intersubjectivity and the therapeutic alliance may differ in a virtual environment rather than in-person. The present study addresses this question by illustrating two case examples of MERIT's adaptation to a virtual delivery telehealth format. Moreover, this study expands on Lysaker and colleagues' (2020) investigation of virtual adaptations of MERIT by exploring how MERIT is adapted in a virtual environment, how intersubjectivity changes in a virtual environment, and, what opportunities virtual platforms allow for metacognitive reflection. Overall, we found that MERIT can be successfully delivered in a virtual telehealth platform. We discuss opportunities and considerations for MERIT and other psychotherapy virtual delivery.","Faith, Zou, Kukla","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10879-022-09557-4","20220815","Intersubjectivity; Metacognition; Psychosis; Schizophrenia; Telehealth; Virtual mental health interventions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-16","",36124,""
"Factors influencing the mental health of an ethnically diverse healthcare workforce during COVID-19: a qualitative study in the United Kingdom","<b>Background:</b> Healthcare workers (HCWs) have been reported to be experiencing a deterioration in their mental health due to COVID-19. In addition, ethnic minority populations in the United Kingdom are disproportionately affected by COVID-19. It is imperative that HCWs are appropriately supported and protected from mental harm during the pandemic. Our research aims to add to the evidence base by providing greater insight into the lived experience of HCWs from diverse ethnic backgrounds during the pandemic that had an impact on their mental health. <b>Methods:</b> We undertook a qualitative work package as part of the United Kingdom Research study into Ethnicity And COVID-19 outcomes among Healthcare workers (UK-REACH). As part of the qualitative research, we carried out 16 focus groups with a total of 61 HCWs between December 2020 and July 2021. The aim of the study was to explore topics such as their experiences, fears and concerns, while working during the pandemic. The purposive sample included ancillary healthcare workers, doctors, nurses, midwives and allied health professionals from diverse ethnic backgrounds to ensure inclusion of underrepresented and disproportionately impacted individuals. We conducted discussions using Microsoft Teams. Recordings were transcribed and thematically analysed. <b>Results:</b> Several factors were identified which impacted on the mental health of HCWs during this period including anxiety (due to inconsistent protocols and policy); fear (of infection); trauma (due to increased exposure to severe illness and death); guilt (of potentially infecting loved ones); and stress (due to longer working hours and increased workload). <b>Conclusion:</b> COVID-19 has affected the mental health of HCWs. We identified a number of factors which may be contributing to a deterioration in mental health for participants from diverse ethnic backgrounds. Healthcare organisations should consider developing strategies to counter the negative impact of these factors, including recommendations made by HCWs themselves. <b>Antecedentes:</b> Se ha informado que los trabajadores de la salud (HCW, por sus siglas en inglÃƒÂ©s) estÃƒÂ¡n experimentando un deterioro en su salud mental debido al COVID-19. AdemÃƒÂ¡s, las poblaciones de minorÃƒÂ­as ÃƒÂ©tnicas en el Reino Unido se ven afectadas de manera desproporcionada por el COVID-19. Es imperativo que los trabajadores de la salud reciban el apoyo adecuado y estÃƒÂ©n protegidos de afecciones mentales durante la pandemia. Nuestra investigaciÃƒÂ³n tiene como objetivo aumentar la base de evidencia al proporcionar una mayor comprensiÃƒÂ³n de la experiencia vivida por los trabajadores de la salud de diversos orÃƒÂ­genes ÃƒÂ©tnicos durante la pandemia que tuvieron un impacto en su salud mental.<b>MetodologÃƒÂ­a:</b> Llevamos a cabo un paquete de trabajo cualitativo como parte del estudio de investigaciÃƒÂ³n del Reino Unido sobre los resultados de la etnicidad y el COVID-19 entre los trabajadores de la salud (UK-REACH).

El objetivo del estudio fue explorar temas como sus experiencias, miedos y preocupaciones, mientras trabajaban durante la pandemia. La muestra intencional incluyÃƒÂ³ trabajadores auxiliares de la salud, mÃƒÂ©dicos, enfermeras, matronas y profesionales de la salud asociados de diversos orÃƒÂ­genes ÃƒÂ©tnicos para garantizar la inclusiÃƒÂ³n de personas subrepresentadas y desproporcionadamente afectadas. Llevamos a cabo debates utilizando Microsoft Teams. Las grabaciones fueron transcritas y analizadas temÃƒÂ¡ticamente.<b>Resultados:</b> Se identificaron varios factores que afectaron la salud mental de los trabajadores de la salud durante este perÃƒÂ­odo, incluida la ansiedad (debido a protocolos y polÃƒÂ­ticas inconsistentes); miedo (de infecciÃƒÂ³n); trauma (debido a una mayor exposiciÃƒÂ³n a enfermedades graves y muerte); culpa (de infectar potencialmente a los seres queridos); y estrÃƒÂ©s (debido a jornadas laborales mÃƒÂ¡s largas y mayor carga de trabajo).<b>ConclusiÃƒÂ³n:</b> COVID-19 ha afectado la salud mental de los trabajadores de la salud. Identificamos una serie de factores que pueden estar contribuyendo al deterioro de la salud mental de los participantes de diversos orÃƒÂ­genes ÃƒÂ©tnicos. Las organizaciones de atenciÃƒÂ³n mÃƒÂ©dica deben considerar el desarrollo de estrategias para contrarrestar el impacto negativo de estos factores, incluidas las recomendaciones hechas por los propios trabajadores de la salud. <b>Ã¨Æ’Å’Ã¦â„¢Â¯Ã¯Â¼Å¡</b>Ã¦ÂÂ®Ã¦Å Â¥Ã©Ââ€œÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜Ëœ (HCW) Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã§Å Â¶Ã¥â€ ÂµÃ§â€Â±Ã¤ÂºÅ½ COVID-19Ã¦Â­Â£Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¦ÂÂ¶Ã¥Å’â€“Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Â­Â¤Ã¥Â¤â€“Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¨â€¹Â±Ã¥â€ºÂ½Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â°â€˜Ã¦â€¢Â°Ã¦â€”ÂÃ¨Â£â€Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥ÂÂ£Ã¥Ââ€”Ã¥Ë†Â° COVID-19 Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ¥Â°Â¤Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ¤Â¸Â¥Ã©â€¡ÂÃ£â‚¬â€šHCW Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¥Â¾â€”Ã¥Ë†Â°Ã©â‚¬â€šÃ¥Â½â€œÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¦â€Â¯Ã¦Å’ÂÃ¥â€™Å’Ã¤Â¿ÂÃ¦Å Â¤Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã¤Â¸â€Ã¥â€¦ÂÃ¥Ââ€”Ã§Â²Â¾Ã§Â¥Å¾Ã¤Â¼Â¤Ã¥Â®Â³Ã¦ËœÂ¯Ã¥Â¾Ë†Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¥Â¿â€¦Ã¨Â¦ÂÃ§Å¡â€žÃ£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Ë†â€˜Ã¤Â»Â¬Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¦â€”Â¨Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã©â‚¬Å¡Ã¨Â¿â€¡Ã¦â€ºÂ´Ã¦Â·Â±Ã¥â€¦Â¥Ã¥Å“Â°Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¨Â§Â£Ã¦ÂÂ¥Ã¨â€¡ÂªÃ¤Â¸ÂÃ¥ÂÅ’Ã§Â§ÂÃ¦â€”ÂÃ¨Æ’Å’Ã¦â„¢Â¯Ã§Å¡â€žHCWÃ¥Å“Â¨Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã¤ÂºÂ§Ã§â€Å¸Ã¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ§Å¡â€žÃ§â€Å¸Ã¦Â´Â»Ã§Â»ÂÃ¥Å½â€ Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â¢Å¾Ã¥Å Â Ã¥Â¾ÂªÃ¨Â¯ÂÃ¥Å¸ÂºÃ§Â¡â‚¬Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â³â€¢Ã¯Â¼Å¡</b>Ã¤Â½Å“Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ¨â€¹Â±Ã¥â€ºÂ½Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¥Â·Â¥Ã¤Â½Å“Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã§Â§ÂÃ¦â€”ÂÃ¥â€™Å’ COVID-19 Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶ (UK-REACH) Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸â‚¬Ã©Æ’Â¨Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¦Ë†â€˜Ã¤Â»Â¬Ã¨Â¿â€ºÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¥Â®Å¡Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¥Â·Â¥Ã¤Â½Å“Ã¥Å’â€¦Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¤Â½Å“Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ¥Â®Å¡Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸â‚¬Ã©Æ’Â¨Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¦Ë†â€˜Ã¤Â»Â¬Ã¥Å“Â¨ 2020 Ã¥Â¹Â´ 12 Ã¦Å“Ë†Ã¨â€¡Â³ 2021 Ã¥Â¹Â´ 7 Ã¦Å“Ë†Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¥Â¼â‚¬Ã¥Â±â€¢Ã¤Âºâ€  16 Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ¥Å’â€¦Ã¥ÂÂ« 61 Ã¥ÂÂÃ¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ§Å¡â€žÃ§â€žÂ¦Ã§â€šÂ¹Ã¥Â°ÂÃ§Â»â€žÃ£â‚¬â€šÃ§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã§â€ºÂ®Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦ËœÂ¯Ã¦Å½Â¢Ã¨Â®Â¨Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¥Â·Â¥Ã¤Â½Å“Ã¦â€”Â¶Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Â»ÂÃ¥Å½â€ Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¦ÂÂÃ¦Æ’Â§Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¦â€¹â€¦Ã¥Â¿Â§Ã§Â­â€°Ã¤Â¸Â»Ã©Â¢ËœÃ£â‚¬â€šÃ§â€ºÂ®Ã¦Â â€¡Ã¦Â Â·Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã¥Å’â€¦Ã¦â€¹Â¬Ã¦ÂÂ¥Ã¨â€¡ÂªÃ¤Â¸ÂÃ¥ÂÅ’Ã§Â§ÂÃ¦â€”ÂÃ¨Æ’Å’Ã¦â„¢Â¯Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¨Â¾â€¦Ã¥Å Â©Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¥Â·Â¥Ã¤Â½Å“Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¥Å’Â»Ã§â€Å¸Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¦Å Â¤Ã¥Â£Â«Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¥Å Â©Ã¤ÂºÂ§Ã¥Â£Â«Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¨Ââ€Ã§â€ºÅ¸Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤Â¸â€œÃ¤Â¸Å¡Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã§Â¡Â®Ã¤Â¿ÂÃ§ÂºÂ³Ã¥â€¦Â¥Ã¤Â»Â£Ã¨Â¡Â¨Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¤Â¸ÂÃ¨Â¶Â³Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥Ââ€”Ã¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ¤Â¸ÂÃ¦Ë†ÂÃ¦Â¯â€Ã¤Â¾â€¹Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸ÂªÃ¤Â½â€œÃ£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Ë†â€˜Ã¤Â»Â¬Ã¤Â½Â¿Ã§â€Â¨Ã¥Â¾Â®Ã¨Â½Â¯Ã¥â€ºÂ¢Ã©ËœÅ¸Ã¨Â¿â€ºÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¨Â®Â¨Ã¨Â®ÂºÃ£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Â¯Â¹Ã¥Â½â€¢Ã©Å¸Â³Ã¨Â¿â€ºÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¨Â½Â¬Ã¥Â½â€¢Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¤Â¸Â»Ã©Â¢ËœÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã¯Â¼Å¡</b>Ã§Â¡Â®Ã¥Â®Å¡Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¦Â­Â¤Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥â€¡Â Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Å’â€¦Ã¦â€¹Â¬Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¯Â¼Ë†Ã§â€Â±Ã¤ÂºÅ½Ã¤Â¸ÂÃ¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¨â€¡Â´Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥ÂÂÃ¨Â®Â®Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¦â€Â¿Ã§Â­â€“Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¯Â¼â€ºÃ¥Â®Â³Ã¦â‚¬â€¢Ã¯Â¼Ë†Ã¦â€žÅ¸Ã¦Å¸â€œÃ¯Â¼â€°Ã¯Â¼â€ºÃ¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã¯Â¼Ë†Ã§â€Â±Ã¤ÂºÅ½Ã¦â€ºÂ´Ã¥Â¤Å¡Ã¥Å“Â°Ã¦Å¡Â´Ã©Å“Â²Ã¤ÂºÅ½Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¥Â¤Â§Ã§â€“Â¾Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¦Â­Â»Ã¤ÂºÂ¡Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¯Â¼â€ºÃ¥â€ â€¦Ã§â€“Å¡Ã¯Â¼Ë†Ã¥ÂÂ¯Ã¨Æ’Â½Ã¦â€žÅ¸Ã¦Å¸â€œÃ¤ÂºÂ²Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¯Â¼â€°Ã¯Â¼â€ºÃ¥â€™Å’Ã¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¯Â¼Ë†Ã§â€Â±Ã¤ÂºÅ½Ã¦â€ºÂ´Ã©â€¢Â¿Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â·Â¥Ã¤Â½Å“Ã¦â€”Â¶Ã©â€”Â´Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥Â¢Å¾Ã¥Å Â Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â·Â¥Ã¤Â½Å“Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¯Â¼â€°Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¨Â®ÂºÃ¯Â¼Å¡</b>COVID-19 Ã¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ¤Âºâ€ Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Ë†â€˜Ã¤Â»Â¬Ã§Â¡Â®Ã¥Â®Å¡Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¨Â®Â¸Ã¥Â¤Å¡Ã¥ÂÂ¯Ã¨Æ’Â½Ã¥Â¯Â¼Ã¨â€¡Â´Ã¦ÂÂ¥Ã¨â€¡ÂªÃ¤Â¸ÂÃ¥ÂÅ’Ã§Â§ÂÃ¦â€”ÂÃ¨Æ’Å’Ã¦â„¢Â¯Ã¥Ââ€šÃ¤Â¸Å½Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã¦ÂÂ¶Ã¥Å’â€“Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã§Â»â€žÃ§Â»â€¡Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¨â‚¬Æ’Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¥Ë†Â¶Ã¥Â®Å¡Ã§Â­â€“Ã§â€¢Â¥Ã¦ÂÂ¥Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¨Â¿â„¢Ã¤Âºâ€ºÃ¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¨Â´Å¸Ã©ÂÂ¢Ã¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Å’â€¦Ã¦â€¹Â¬Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¨â€¡ÂªÃ¥Â·Â±Ã¦ÂÂÃ¥â€¡ÂºÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â»ÂºÃ¨Â®Â®Ã£â‚¬â€š.","Qureshi, Gogoi, Al-Oraibi, Wobi, Chaloner, Gray, Guyatt, Hassan, Nellums, Pareek","https://doi.org/10.1080/20008066.2022.2105577","20220815","COVID-19; Ethnic minority; anxiety; healthcare; mental health; stress; trauma; workforce","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-16","",36125,""
"Financial Wellbeing and Quality of Life Among a Sample of the Lebanese Population: The Mediating Effect of Food Insecurity","Lebanon is undergoing multiple overlapping crises, affecting the food security, financial well-being, and quality of life (QOL) of its residents. The primary objective was to assess the food insecurity (FI) status of a sample of the Lebanese population. The second objective was to explore factors related to QOL parameters and evaluate the mediating effect of food security between financial well-being and QOL. The study was cross-sectional and enrolled 412 participants recruited online using the snowball sampling technique. The survey included questions related to sociodemographic and economic characteristics of Lebanese households and validated scales to assess FI, QOL measures, financial well-being, and fear of COVID-19. Almost 43% of the study participants reported being food insecure, with 31% experiencing mild FI, 10% moderate FI, and 1.5% severe FI. Compared to food-insecure participants, food secure participants had a significantly higher income (58.5% vs. 39.2%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), a university education level (96.6% vs. 88.1%, <i>p</i> = 0.002), an average perceived financial status (83.9% vs. 65.9%), higher financial well-being scores (5.14 vs. 3.19, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and lower crowding index (0.94 Ã‚Â± 0.4 vs. 1.09, <i>p</i> = 0.002). Multivariate analysis showed that FI was not associated with physical (Beta = -1.48, 95% CI: -3.10; 0.13) and mental (Beta = -1.46, 95% CI -3.68; 0.75) QOL, after adjusting for other demographic and socioeconomic correlates. This association remained non-significant when introducing the financial well-being variable to the model. Mediation analyses showed that the FI variable mediated the association between financial well-being and physical QOL (Beta = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.02; 0.36), but not the mental QOL (Beta = -0.02, 95% CI: -0.20; 0.14). Food insecurity was prevalent in our study sample, and it mediated the association between financial well-being and physical, but not mental, QOL parameters. These findings call for evidence-based policies and programs to help improve the food security and well-being of Lebanese households amidst these unprecedented circumstances.","Karam, Haddad, Sacre, Serhan, Salameh, Jomaa","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2022.906646","20220815","Lebanon; financial wellbeing; food insecurity; mental health; physical health; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-16","",36126,""
"Challenging terrains: socio-spatial analysis of Primary Health Care Access Disparities in West Virginia","Existing measures of health care access were inadequate for guiding policy decisions in West Virginia, as they identified the entire state as having limited access. To address this, we compiled a comprehensive database of primary health care providers and facilities in the state, developed a modified E2SFCA tool to measure spatial access in the context of West Virginia's rural and mountainous nature, and integrated this with an index of socio-economic barriers to access. The integrated index revealed that the rural areas, especially in the southern part of the state, have especially limited access to primary health care. 1. Introduction. An emerging public health issue which has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, is that of <i>healthcare deserts</i>, which are places where basic affordable health care is not accessible for residents. This problem has become worse in rural areas as rural hospitals close. In these areas, including West Virginia, scattered populations suffer from limited access to primary healthcare services. Uneven geographic and socio-economic barriers to accessing primary health care are major contributing factors to these health disparities. West Virginia's unique rural and mountainous settlement patterns, aging population, and economic crisis over the past two decades have resulted in unequal access to the primary healthcare services for its residents. The rural nature of the state makes it difficult to maintain medical facilities accessible to much of the population, especially as rural hospitals have been closing, such as the one in Williamson, WV (Jarvie, 2020). The mountainous terrain slows down travel across winding roads, lengthening travel times to the nearest hospital, while an aging population has increased health care needs. Lastly, an economic crisis and higher poverty rate makes West Virginians less able to pay for health care. As a result, West Virginians are confronting a health crisis. According to a recent report by the West Virginia Health Statistics Center (2019), West Virginians rank first in the country for heart attacks, have the second-highest obesity rate and prevalence of mental health problems in the country, along with the fourth-highest rate of diabetes and fifth-highest rate of cancer. An issue faced by West Virginia's policymakers is the limitations of tools for identifying and assessing healthcare deserts, as they are poorly suited for the unique challenges in West Virginia. Academic research has not analyzed comprehensive primary healthcare accessibility in WV, although previous studies have focused on Appalachia (e.g., Behringer &amp; Friedell 2006; Smith &amp; Holloman, 2011; Elnicki et al., 1995; Donohoe et al., 2015, 2016a, 2016b), and others focus on access to more specialized services (Valvi et al., 2019; Donohoe, 2016a). Existing approaches to identify the healthcare deprived areas, such as Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSA), are not suitable for guiding West Virginia policies, because every one of the 55 counties within the state has several HPSAs, which makes prioritizing resources difficult. The lack of easily accessible, comprehensive, and up-to-date physician and healthcare facility database creates additional difficulties. Physician license datasets were found to often include inconsistent, misleading, and out-of-date information. The last limitation of the HPSA designation is that it is based on zip code areas and census tracts, which are not ideal as zip code areas lack spatial context and much covariate data, while rural census tracts are too large to capture spatial variation of access. In this context, the WV HealthLink project was begun with joint effort with WV Rural Health Initiative (RHI) to fill gaps in research and support decision making for primary healthcare access in West Virginia. The goals of the projects are: (1) to help West Virginia's three medical schools provide specialized professional training in rural healthcare; (2) to address health disparities by investing in clinical projects in underserved areas; and (3) to retain health professionals in WV. In 2018, to support these goals, HealthLink was invited by the RHI's leadership to analyze disparities in primary health care access in West Virginia and develop tools for rural healthcare decision-making. These goals also create a comprehensive and up-to-date physician and facility database, new analysis tools, and new visualization tools for decision support. The goals of this paper are to assess the spatial and social accessibility of primary health care in West Virginia, and to understand spatial and social determinants that shape this access. To achieve these goals, this paper completes the following objectives: (1) define primary healthcare and access; (2) build an extensive and up-to-date primary healthcare database; (3) develop an assessment framework for WV; and (4) visualize the results for policy makers and practitioners. The structure of this paper is as follows. First, we describe three methodological problems encountered as we define primary health care access. Second, we present the methods used to resolve these problems, and conclude by presenting our modified enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2FCA hereafter) approach and its results for WV. Our foci in this modification were improving the accuracy of the analysis regarding measuring distance, considering distance decay effect, and more precisely representing the location of supply and demand.","Hong, Wilson, Gross, Conley, Powers","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12061-022-09472-0","20220815","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-16","",36127,""

Numerous researchers have utilized typical statistical methods to determine the effect of COVID-19 on the psychological wellbeing of young people. Moreover, the primary aspects that have changed in the psychological condition of children and young adults during COVID lockdown is analyzed. These changes are analyzed using machine learning and AI techniques which should be established for the alterations. This research work mainly concentrates on children's and young people's mental health in the first lockdown. There are six processes involved in this work. Initially, it collects the data using questionnaires, and then, the collected data are pre-processed by data cleaning, categorical encoding, and data normalization method. Next, the clustering process is used for grouping the data based on their mood state, and then, the feature selection process is done by chi-square, L1-Norm, and ReliefF. Then, the machine learning classifiers are used for predicting the mood state, and automatic calibration is used for selecting the best model. Finally, it predicts the mood state of the children and young adults. The findings revealed that for a better understanding of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on children's and youths' mental states, a combination of heterogeneous data from practically all feature groups is required.","Luo, Huang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.947856","20220815","COVID-19; artificial intelligence; clustering; feature selection; machine learning; mental health; mood state","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-16","",36128,""
"[Prevalence and factors associated with eating disorders in Peruvian Human Medicine students in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic: a multicentre study]","Eating disorders (ED) are serious conditions that have diverse consequences, associated with high morbidity and mortality: Among the factors associated with their development are, being female, and stress, which increased during the pandemic, and was higher in medical students. Our objective was to identify the prevalence and factors associated with ED in medical students. Cross-sectional study, conducted with an online questionnaire, between January 1 and 31, 2021, in 22 universities, using the Eating Disorder Scale (EAT-26) and the Family Communication Scale (FCS). Generalized logistic regressions were used to identify the association between variables. A total of 1224 participants were recruited, and the prevalence was 12.5%. Associated factors included a poor perception of health in 34.3%, having a family and/or social environment member with an eating disorder in 21.7%, and medium or low satisfaction with family communication in 57.3% and 34.9% respectively, in addition to the academic year, dieting, concern for body image and the perception of inadequate eating. Our results show that, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, 1-2 out of 10 Human Medicine students had an ED. The associated factors that influenced development of the condition included a fair or poor perception of health, the academic year completed, and medium or low satisfaction with family communication.","Pierre Zila-Velasque, Grados-Espinoza, Regalado-RodrÃƒÂ­guez, Luna-CÃƒÂ³rdova, CalderÃƒÂ³n, Diaz-Vargas, Diaz-VÃƒÂ©lez, Sifuentes-Rosales","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcp.2022.07.005","20220815","Eating behaviour; Family communication; Medical students; Mental health; Psychological support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-16","",36129,""
"The explanatory ability of COVID-19 life changes on quality of life: A comparison of those who have had and not had COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly negatively affected individuals' quality of life through multiple means such as social isolation, exacerbated mental health conditions, and financial instability. Multiple studies have demonstrated that one of the negative correlates of quality of life is the perceived danger of COVID-19 (i.e., fear of and anxiety about COVID-19). The current study addresses limitations in the literature by testing how life changes from COVID-19 explain the direct effect of the perceived danger of COVID-19 on quality of life using a United States sample between those who have had COVID-19 compared to those who have not had COVID-19. Undergraduate students (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°196) from a Midwestern University in the United States participated in this study for course credit (White: <i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°109; 55.61%; Male: <i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°94; 48.0%). Participants completed this study online and at home where they responded to a demographic form and several measures of the effects of COVID-19 and quality of life. The results suggest that COVID-19 life changes fully explain the negative relationship between the perceived danger of COVID-19 and quality of life, but only in those who have had COVID-19. In the group that has never had COVID-19, the only significant relationship was the positive relationship between the perceived danger of COVID-19 on COVID-19 life changes. The results suggest that researchers may consider steering research away from the perceived danger of COVID-19 and onto remedying life changes from COVID-19 to improve individuals' quality of life. I further discuss the theoretical findings, implications, limitations, and future directions.","Stone","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-03504-1","20220815","COVID-19; COVID-19 life changes; COVID-19 pandemic; Perceived danger; Quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-16","",36130,""
"Comparing parental distress and children's difficulties between parents of children with rheumatic diseases and parents of healthy children in families facing the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic could be a threat for the health status of children with a chronic condition. The present study aimed to explore parents' and children's psychological adjustment during the current pandemic, pursuing a triple objective: to compare the psychological adjustment of parents of children with pediatric rheumatic diseases (PRDs) and parents of healthy children; to analyze children's psychological symptoms (emotional problems and hyperactivity) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and with or without a PRDs diagnosis; to explore the associations of children's emotional problems and hyperactivity with parents' psychological adjustment, parent-child interactions and belonging or not to families with PRDs. This cross-sectional study involved 56 parents of children with PRDs and 53 parents of healthy children. Self-report questionnaires about parents' depression, anxiety, parenting stress, and children's emotional symptoms and hyperactivity-inattention were administered. No differences were detected on psychological adjustment between parents of children with PRDs and parents of healthy children. Parents of children with PRDs reported statistically significant higher levels of children's emotional problems and hyperactivity before the pandemic, compared to parents of healthy children; during COVID-19 pandemic, emotional symptoms increased for both groups, while hyperactivity-inattention symptoms increased only in the group of healthy children. Children's emotional difficulties were associated with higher levels of parental anxiety, worse parent-child interaction and having PRDs; children's hyperactivity symptoms were related to parent-child difficult interaction and higher levels of parental depression. Findings suggest the importance to target the children in relation to their parents, when approaching the psychological aspects of PRDs.","Bramanti, Manippa, Babore, Dilillo, Marcellino, Martucci, Mallardo, Isoldi, Bloise, Sanseviero, Iorfida, De Luca, Trumello, D'Alleva, Ventriglia, Lubrano, Del Giudice","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-03589-8","20220815","COVID-19; Chronic and recurrent pain; Hyperactivity and ADHD; Parent psychosocial functioning; Rheumatology; School-age children","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-16","",36131,""
"Modeling infectious disease dynamics: Integrating contact tracing-based stochastic compartment and spatio-temporal risk models","Major infectious diseases such as COVID-19 have a significant impact on population lives and put enormous pressure on healthcare systems globally. Strong interventions, such as lockdowns and social distancing measures, imposed to prevent these diseases from spreading, may also negatively impact society, leading to jobs losses, mental health problems, and increased inequalities, making crucial the prioritization of riskier areas when applying these protocols. The modeling of mobility data derived from contact-tracing data can be used to forecast infectious trajectories and help design strategies for prevention and control. In this work, we propose a new spatial-stochastic model that allows us to characterize the temporally varying spatial risk better than existing methods. We demonstrate the use of the proposed model by simulating an epidemic in the city of Valencia, Spain, and comparing it with a contact tracing-based stochastic compartment reference model. The results show that, by accounting for the spatial risk values in the model, the peak of infected individuals, as well as the overall number of infected cases, are reduced. Therefore, adding a spatial risk component into compartment models may give finer control over the epidemic dynamics, which might help the people in charge to make better decisions.","Mahmood, Amaral, Mateu, Moraga","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spasta.2022.100691","20220815","Compartment modeling; Contact tracing; Infectious diseases; Pedestrian mobility; Spatio-temporal modeling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-16","",36132,""
"[The Importance of Structural Parameters for Children and Adolescents with Mental Illnesses]","In March 2018, the first Austrian rehabilitation clinic for children and adolescents with disorders from the field of ""Mental Health"" opened in Wildbad, Styria. On the part of the Austrian Health Insurance (Ãƒâ€“GK), this term subsumes diagnoses from children and adolescents' psychiatrics, developmental and social pediatrics, and psychosomatics. After the lockdown caused by COVID-19, there was aÃ‚Â clear excess of assignments from the children and adolescents' psychiatric spectrum. Therefore, it was decided to specialize, which made treatment planning much easier. This specialization also restricted the age group, so that we primarily treated patients between the ages of 12 and 18Ã‚Â years. Because of the homogenization, we noticed that the patients tended to be able to end their stay more satisfied and more mentally stable. Therefore, we asked ourselves what the cause of this supposedly positive effect was. We developed aÃ‚Â questionnaire in order to be able to query and compare the most important points in our experience. At the beginning of the stay, self-motivation, subjectively perceived restrictions due to the illness, and own rehabilitation goals were queried. At the end of the stay, we tried to present aÃ‚Â differentiated assessment of symptom improvement and the resulting effects on everyday life.","Lienbacher","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00608-022-01001-z","20220815","Mental health rehabilitation for children; Psychological rehabilitation for children and the COVID-19 pandemic; Psychological stress in children and the COVID-19 pandemic; Psychological stress in children in lock-down; Psychological stress in families in lockdown","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-16","",36133,""
"Locked Down: Economic and Health Effects of COVID-19 Response on Residents of a South African Township","Little research has examined how pandemics affect residents in under-resourced communities. This study investigated how COVID-19 and lockdown policies affected residents of Alexandra, one of Johannesburg, South Africa's lowest-income townships. We conducted a telephone survey May 11-22, 2020, while the lockdown and alcohol ban were in effect, of a spatially stratified sample of 353 adult Alexandra residents drawn randomly from voter registration, credit card application, and prior studies' sampling frames. We examined economic consequences; health experiences, including COVID-19 exposure and mental health symptoms; alcohol use; and personal experiences with violence. Respondents were aged 18 to 89 and 47% female. About 70% of those employed before the lockdown were no longer working. Over half of households lost at least one source of income. About 50% of respondents reported stockpiling food. A majority reported price rises and declines in availability of food. Smaller percentages reported such changes for other items. Over 80% reported stress or anxiety, or depression due to the pandemic. The prevalence of past-week alcohol use fell from over 50% before the lockdown to less than 10% during the lockdown. Self-reported physical violence victimization increased. COVID-19 and the lockdown disrupted Alexandra residents' lives through unemployment, lost income, mental health problems, and increased violence. The differences between these outcomes and those in more advantaged communities deserve investigation. Research should also seek to identify tailored responses to effectively address the challenges of marginalized communities that often have limited resources to deal with pandemics and policies to contain them.","Fisher, Miller, Grube, Ringwalt, Achoki, Ngwato, Shilakoe, Mkhondo","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40609-022-00230-1","20220815","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Pandemic; South Africa","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-16","",36134,""

"Changes in College Students Mental Health and Lifestyle During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review of Longitudinal Studies","College students have poorer mental health than their peers. Their poorer health conditions seem to be caused by the greater number of stressors to which they are exposed, which can increase the risk of the onset of mental disorders. The pandemic has been an additional stressor that may have further compromised the mental health of college students and changed their lifestyles with important consequences for their well-being. Although research has recognized the impact of COVID-19 on college students, only longitudinal studies can improve knowledge on this topic. This review summarizes the data from 17 longitudinal studies examining changes in mental health and lifestyle among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to improve understanding of the effects of the outbreak on this population. Following PRISMA statements, the following databases were searched PubMed, EBSCO, SCOPUS and Web of Science. The overall sample included 20,108 students. The results show an increase in anxiety, mood disorders, alcohol use, sedentary behavior, and Internet use and a decrease in physical activity. Female students and sexual and gender minority youth reported poorer mental health conditions.

"Reasons and trends in youth's suicide rates during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic posed many mental health challenges to youth through unprecedented infection control measures such as nationwide school closures. Despite this, few studies have investigated trends in suicide among youth during the pandemic, let alone their reasons. Population-level data on crude monthly suicide rates (2016-2021) and reasons of suicide (2018-2020) among youth aged 10-19 years were obtained from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare and the National Police Agency, respectively. Using an event study design (with a Poisson regression model to calculate changes-in-changes (CiC) estimates) and interrupted time series analysis, we investigated changes in monthly suicide rates during the first 12 months of the pandemic (May 2020 to April 2021) compared to pre-pandemic levels (May 2016 to March 2020). Additionally, we investigated the changes in reasons of suicide (family-related, mental illness, social concerns, and academic concerns). In the event study analysis, suicide rates among youth increased during the pandemic relative to pre-pandemic levels, especially between August-November 2020 (e.g., ratio of the suicide rate in November 2020 relative to previous years, 1.86; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.30 to 2.66). Though suicide levels returned closer to pre-pandemic levels by December 2020, they remained slightly elevated into 2021. In the interrupted time series analysis, suicide rates increased from May to August 2020 (0.099 cases per 100,000 youth per month; 95% CI, 0.022 to 0.176), followed by a decrease from September to December 2020 (-0.086 cases per 100,000 youth per month; 95% CI, -0.164 to -0.009). We observed elevated suicide rates for all major reasons from summer to autumn 2020, especially suicides attributed to family-related problems and social concerns. Furthermore, rates of suicides attributed to mental illness remained higher than pre-pandemic levels into December 2020. Suicide rates among youth remained slightly elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels into 2021. The reasons of the increase in suicide rates were multifactorial, including mental health issues and disruptions in social relationships. During a pandemic, interventions that provide mental support as well as opportunities for regular social interactions to youth may be beneficial.

"War, immigration and COVID-19: The experience of Afghan immigrants to Iran Amid the pandemic","Afghanistan's domestic upheaval following the Taliban's invasion leads to massive displacement of its population. The number of Afghan refugees in Iran has dramatically increased since the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021. Multiple pre-and post-migratory traumatic experiences affect immigrants' physical, psychological, social, and economic wellbeing. The coronavirus outbreak, considered a traumatic experience in human life in the 21st century, added to their problems in Iran and exposed them to new challenges. This qualitative study aimed to investigate their experiences early before, during, and after immigration and the pandemic's challenges to their lives in Iran. In the present qualitative study, ten Afghan residents living in Iran who immigrated to Iran legally or illegally since the summer of 2021 and the last year after the second Taliban invasion were selected via purposive sampling. A semi-structured interview was applied to gather the data, and the data were analyzed through Braun and Clarke's thematic analysis method. Ten male participants with a mean age of 26 y/o were interviewed. Their residence in Iran was between 20 days and 8 months. Four main themes were extracted. The first theme, the <i>Tsunami of suffering</i>, represents a disruption of the normal flow of life. Six subthemes, including loss, being near death, insecurity, sudden hopelessness, leaving the country involuntarily, and reluctance to explore underlying emotions, are included in this category. The second one, <i>Lost in space</i>, describes the participant's attempt to leave Afghanistan following the extensive losses and violent death threats. Their experiences are categorized into four subthemes: the miserable trip, encountering death, life-threatening experiences, and being physically and verbally abused. The third theme, with its five subthemes, try to demonstrate the participants' experiences after getting to their destination in Iran. The last one, <i>Challenges of the COVID-19</i> explained the experience of Taliban return, war trauma, running away, and living as a refugee or immigrant coincided with the COVID pandemic. Our interviewees explained multiple and successive traumatic experiences of war, migration, and the pandemic. The central clinical features of survivors are fears of losing control, being overwhelmed, and inability to cope. They felt abandoned because not only lost their family support in their homeland but could not also receive support in Iran due to the pandemic-related social distancing and isolation. They were dissociated and emotionally numb when describing their experience, which is a hallmark of experiencing severe, unprocessed traumas. Gaining a better understanding of Afghan refugees lived experiences may help provide them with better social and health care support. Proper mental and physical healthcare support and de-stigmatization programs may reduce the impact of multiple traumas on their wellbeing.","Mohammadsadeghi, Bazrafshan, Seify-Moghadam, Mazaheri Nejad Fard, Rasoulian, Eftekhar Ardebili","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.908321","20220815","Afghan; COVID-19; Iran; immigration; war","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-16","",36141,""

The major exposure was HCWs' sleep disturbance, and the major outcome was mental health. The correlation coefficients (<i>r</i>), regression coefficients (ÃŽÂ²) and odds ratios (OR) of the included studies were integrated. Fifty-nine studies were included for qualitative analysis, of which 30 studies could be combined and entered into quantitative analysis. There were 23 studies during the COVID-19 pandemic among the 59 included studies. The results of the meta-analysis showed that the correlation coefficient between sleep disturbance and mental health was 0.43 (95% CI: 0.39-0.47). HCWs with sleep disturbance had a 3.74 (95% CI: 2.76-5.07) times higher risk of mental health problems than those without sleep disturbance. The correlation coefficient during the COVID-19 epidemic was 0.45 (95% CI: 0.37-0.53), while it was 0.40 (95% CI: 0.36-0.44) during the non-epidemic period. Subgroup analysis compared the OR results in epidemic and non-epidemic periods of COVID-19, which were 4.48 (95% CI: 2.75-5.07) and 3.74 (95% CI: 2.74-7.32), respectively. Sleep disturbance and mental health problems were positively correlated among HCWs. Particularly in the COVID-19 pandemic, more attention should be given to this issue.","Liu, Zhang, Jiang, Zhong, Huang, Zhang, Chen","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.919176","20220815","COVID-19; healthcare workers; mental health; sleep; systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-16","",36142,""
"Online group psychodynamic psychotherapy-The effectiveness and role of attachment-The results of a short study","The role of remote treatment, including psychotherapy, has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of research in this area are promising, initially pointing to similar effectiveness for online psychotherapy as that of face-to-face psychotherapy. A significantly smaller amount of research has been conducted on online group psychotherapy, in particular, in the psychodynamic paradigm. Many authors have drawn attention to the need to conduct further research, considering specific patient features, for example, personality traits, attachment style, age, and other demographic variables. This study conducted pre- and post-treatment (10 weeks) and a 6-week follow-up, on the effectiveness of online synchronous group psychodynamic psychotherapy (via Zoom) taking into account patients' attachment styles. Four main hypotheses were tested: H1: Patients will obtain a lower score in the attachment's dimensions of anxiety and avoidance; H2: Patients will get a lower level of symptoms and sense of loneliness; H3: Patients will have increased self-esteem; and H4: The anxiety and avoidance dimensions of the attachment will be predictors for the effectiveness of online psychodynamic group psychotherapy. Twenty-two outpatients participated in the study, out of which 18 suffered from neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders (F40-F48), and four suffered from a depressive episode (F32.0, F32.1) according to ICD-10. The results of the pre-treatment test showed a reduction in the global severity of psychiatric symptoms (<i>d</i> = -0.526) and depressive symptoms (<i>d</i> = -0.5), as well as an increase in self-esteem (<i>d</i> = 0.444) and feelings of loneliness (<i>d</i> = 0.46). A change in the attachment dimension, anxiety (<i>d</i> = -0.557) and avoidance (<i>d</i> = -0.526), was also observed. The above results were maintained in the follow-up test conducted after 6 weeks. Additionally, a reduction in the symptoms of social phobia was observed. Attachment dimensions were not a predictor of the effectiveness of psychotherapy, but a decrease in avoidance during therapy was a predictor of increased symptoms of pain. The results of the research are promising in terms of psychiatric symptoms and increased self-esteem. During therapy, there may be a favorable change in attachment dimensions, but this variable was not shown to be a predictor of results. These results suggest that more controlled research is required.","Wajda, Kapinos-Gorczyca, LiziÃ…â€žczyk, Sitnik-Warchulska, Izydorczyk","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.798991","20220815","COVID-19; attachment style; effectiveness; group psychodynamic psychotherapy; internet-based intervention anxiety; online group psychotherapy; online therapy; remote therapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-16","",36143,""
"'Kindness and empathy beyond all else': Challenges to professional identities of Higher Education teachers during COVID-19 times","COVID-19 has continued to effect higher education globally in significant ways. During 2020, many institutions shifted learning online overnight as the sector closed its doors and opened new sites for remote teaching. This article reports on an international study [Phillips et al., 2021] that sought to capture how cross-sectoral teachers experienced these emergency changes during the first months of restrictions. The data, analysed using narrative identity theory, revealed concerns that fall into two broad categories: technologies and relationships. Significantly, it was not a loss of content delivery or changes to assessment that prompted the greatest anxiety for our colleagues, but that they held significant concerns about their students' mental health; inequities of access to a range of services including technological; and challenges connecting emotionally with their students at a distance. The results provide actionable strategies for higher education institutions to apply in future emergencies where remote teaching is necessary.","Cain, Campbell, Coleman","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13384-022-00552-1","20220815","COVID-19; Educational inequity; Higher education; Teaching and learning; Technologies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-16","",36144,""
"Physical activity and the incidence of depression during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil: Findings from the PAMPA cohort","We examined the longitudinal association between physical activity (PA) and the incidence of self-reported diagnosed depression in adults in southern Brazil during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from the PAMPA (Prospective Study About Mental and Physical Health) cohort was used. Data collection for baseline was carried out on June-July 2020, with two follow-up assessments taking place six months apart. An online, self-reported questionnaire assessed depression and PA. Depression was assessed by asking participants whether they were ever diagnosed with depression. We included 441 participants (women: 75.9%; mean age [SD]: 38.0 [13.5]) in southern Brazil. Over the follow-up, 21.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 18.1%-25.9%) were diagnosed with depression. Insufficiently active (&lt;150Ã‚Â min per week of physical activity) (Incidence rate [IR]: 61.9; 95%CI: 39.5-102.4; pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.047) and active (Ã¢â€°Â¥150Ã‚Â min per week of physical activity) (IR: 50.4; 95%CI: 31.9-84.0; pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.015) participants had reduced IR of depression per 1000 persons-year at risk compared to inactive ones (0Ã‚Â min per week of physical activity) (IR: 99.9; 95%CI: 79.7-126.8). In the adjusted analyses, participants in the insufficient active (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.58; 95%CI: 0.34-0.98) and active (HR: 0.53; 95%CI: 0.31-0.93) group had a lower risk of developing depression than the inactive group. PA both at and out of home reduced the risk of incident depression (HR: 0.49; 95%CI: 0.25-0.98) compared to no physical activity. Endurance (HR: 0.52; 95%CI: 0.28-0.97) and endurance plus strengthening (HR: 0.40; 95%CI: 0.17-0.95) PA reduced the risk of incident depression compared to none.

"Cuttlefish bone powder as an efficient solid-phase extraction sorbent of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs in environmental water","Many antiviral drugs were developed to counteract coronavirus disease, 2019 (COVID-19) with severe acute respiratory syndrome. Therefore, the scientific community's efforts have focused on the detection and quantification of antiviral compounds currently being tested for COVID-19 treatment. Cuttlefish bone powder (CFBP) has been used for the first time as solid-phase extraction (SPE) sorbent for the extraction of SARS CoV-2 antiviral drugs (chloroquine, ritonavir and indomethacin) from water samples. An effective and sensitive method was developed by combining SPE and liquid chromatography- UV detection (LC-UV). An experimental design was applied for the optimization of extraction process. Experimental variables were optimized using Doehlert matrix. The developed method included 50Ã‚Â mg of CFBP sorbent, 20Ã‚Â mL of water sample at pHÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°9 and 5Ã‚Â mL of ACN/KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> buffer solution (80:20, v/v) in the elution step. For validation of the method, selectivity, linearity precision, and sensitivity were evaluated. Extraction recovery percentage of all Sars cov-2 antivirals were above 98.2%. The detection and quantification limits were between 0.1 and 0.5Ã‚Â Ã‚Âµg L<sup>-1</sup> and 0.6 and 2Ã‚Â Ã‚Âµg L<sup>-1</sup>, respectively.

"Student Subjective Wellbeing amidst the Covid-19 Pandemic in Iran: Role of Loneliness, Resilience and Parental Involvement","The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns potentially severely impact adolescents' mental well-being. This research aims to study students' subjective well-being during the covid-19 pandemic in Iran and investigate the role of loneliness, resilience, and parental involvement. For this study, 629 students (<i>female</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°345) were recruited by purposive sampling. Students were assessed on the Student's Subjective Well-Being, Loneliness Scale, Resilience Scale, and Parental Involvement. The results confirm our hypothesis that the relationship between parental involvement and students' subjective well-being is mediated by loneliness. Furthermore, the results indicated a partial mediation of resilience in the relationship between parental involvement and students' subjective well-being. This study theoretically contributes to a better understanding of the factors determining the impact of traumatic events such as a pandemic on adolescents' mental health. The implications of this study indicate interventions that can be carried out to minimize the negative psychological consequences of the pandemic.","Asanjarani, Kumar, Kalani","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12187-022-09963-z","20220815","Covid-pandemic; Loneliness; Parental involvement; Resilience; Subjective well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-16","",36147,""
"Scalability of an ACT-Based strategy for improving well-being in health care providers: A mix-method and preliminary evaluation of efficacy","The burden of the COVID-19 pandemic has been mainly carried by health care providers. Technology-Mediated Interventions (TMI) seem to be a feasible alternative to increase access to behavioral health resources in this population. However, scaling-up treatments into TMI requires developing user-friendly, accepted, and accessible formats. A two-stage study was conducted to assess scalability of an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) based strategy (named FACE COVID) delivered using technology. First, a mix-method design connected qualitative and quantitative data from health providers and ACT experts by which changes were performed to enhance scalability. Second, a pretest-posttest study was conducted to preliminary evaluate the efficacy of FACE COVID intervention on well-being, psychological distress, and psychological flexibility. Results showed a positive impact on well-being, but not distress and psychological flexibility. While this intervention has promising results, changes in dose intensity, social support, and mental health literacy could improve retention as well as increase opportunities to target distress and psychological flexibility in future studies.","MuÃƒÂ±oz-MartÃƒÂ­nez, Otto-Scheiber, Zuluaga-Jassir, Medina-DÃƒÂ­az, Pulido-Rozo, Venegas-RamÃƒÂ­rez, Igua-Jojoa","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2022.07.005","20220815","Acceptance and commitment therapy; Health care providers; Mix-methods; Scalability; Technology-mediated interventions; Well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-16","",36148,""
"Impact of Healthcare on Stock Market Volatility and Its Predictive Solution Using Improved Neural Network","The unprecedented Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic has put the world in peril and shifted global landscape in unanticipated ways. The SARSCoV2 virus, which caused the COVID-19 outbreak, first appeared in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and quickly spread around the world. This pandemic is not only a global health crisis, but it has caused the major global economic depression. As soon as the virus spread, stock market prices plummeted and volatility increased. Predicting the market during this outbreak has been of substantial importance and is the primary motivation to carry out this work. Given the nonlinearity and dynamic nature of stock data, the prediction of stock market is a challenging task. The machine learning models have proven to be a good choice for the development of effective and efficient prediction systems. In recent years, the application of hyperparameter optimization techniques for the development of highly accurate models has increased significantly. In this study, a customized neural network model is proposed and the power of hyperparameter optimization in modelling stock index prices is explored. A novel dataset is generated using nine standard technical indicators and COVID-19 data. In addition, the primary focus is on the importance of selection of optimal features and their preprocessing. The utilization of multiple feature ranking techniques combined with extensive hyperparameter optimization procedures is comprehensive for the prediction of stock index prices. Moreover, the model is evaluated by comparing it with other models, and results indicate that the proposed model outperforms other models. Given the detailed design methodology, preprocessing, exploratory feature analysis, and hyperparameter optimization procedures, this work gives a significant contribution to stock analysis research community during this pandemic.","Rouf, Bashir Malik, Sharma, Ra, Singh, Meena","https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/7097044","20220815","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-16","",36149,""

The sample consisted of 93 parents. Data were collected using a descriptive questionnaire, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS- 42), and Coping Style Scale (CSS). Participants had mean DASS ""depression,"" ""anxiety,"" and ""stress"" subscale scores of 13.69Ã¢â‚¬Â¯Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬Â¯8.86, 12.11Ã¢â‚¬Â¯Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬Â¯8.37, and 19.09Ã¢â‚¬Â¯Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬Â¯9.24, respectively. They had mean CSS ""self-confident,"" ""optimistic,"" ""helpless,"" ""submissive coping,"" and ""seeking of social support"" subscale scores of 2.71Ã¢â‚¬Â¯Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.65, 2.57Ã¢â‚¬Â¯Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.59, 2.29Ã¢â‚¬Â¯Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.62, 2.25Ã¢â‚¬Â¯Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.49, and 2.38Ã¢â‚¬Â¯Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.52, respectively. Fathers had lower mean CSS ""helpless"" and ""submissive"" subscale scores than mothers. Participants who were briefed about their babies' condition by nurses had lower mean CSS ""helpless"" and ""submissive"" subscale scores than others. Participants with higher education had lower mean CSS ""helpless"" and ""submissive"" subscale scores than others. Participants with spouses with bachelor's or higher degrees had a higher median CSS ""optimistic"" subscale score than those with literate spouses or spouses with primary school degrees. Participants who were worried about the ""no visitors"" policy had a lower median CSS ""self-confident"" subscale score than those who were not. Parents who are not allowed to see their babies due to the ""no visitors"" policy during the COVID-19 pandemic experience more psychosocial problems. Though not a result of the present study, the ""no visitors"" policy seems to affect the mother-infant attachment adversely. Healthcare professionals should brief parents about what a neonatal intensive care unit is like. They should also warn them that they may not be too happy about how their baby looks before seeing them. Therefore, they should use therapeutic communication techniques to talk to them and explain the situation in a way they can understand. Moreover, they should provide parents with psychological empowerment training programs to help them adopt active coping strategies to deal with challenges in times of crisis.","T KÃ„Â±lÃ„Â±ÃƒÂ§, TaÃ…Å¸gÃ„Â±t","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnn.2022.07.027","20220815","Coping; Neonatal intensive care unit; No visitors policy; Nursing; Parents; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-16","",36150,""

"Job stress and loneliness among desk workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan: focus on remote working","Previous studies have reported an increase in loneliness since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but there are few data on the relationship between job stress and loneliness. This study aimed to assess the relationship between job stress and loneliness among desk workers, with a focus on the impact of remote working. This study was part of the Collaborative Online Research on the Novel-coronavirus and Work (CORoNaWork) project in Japan. We extracted data from 13,468 workers who indicated that they were doing desk work. Loneliness was assessed using a single question and job stress was valuated using the Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ). Multiple logistic regression was performed. Participants who worked remotely 4 or more days per week were marginally more likely to report feeling lonely compared with those who did not work remotely (adjusted odds ratio = 1.23, 95% CI: 0.99-5.84, P = 0.066). Remote working did not explain the interaction between JCQ scale scores and loneliness. Among remote workers, the level of support provided by co-workers and supervisors was strongly associated with feelings of loneliness as well as non-remote workers (co-worker support: AOR = 4.06, 95% CI: 2.82-5.84, P &lt; 0.001; supervisor support: AOR = 2.49, 95% CI: 1.79-3.47, P &lt; 0.001).

Logistic regression analyses examined associations between (1) mental distress and delayed medical visits, (2) mental distress and missed prescription refills, controlling for sociodemographics, pre-existing chronic conditions, and access to health insurance. We found that, compared to those that exhibited normal levels of mental distress, those with mild (aORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯2.83, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯2.47-3.24), moderate (aORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯3.43, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯2.95-3.99), and severe (aORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯4.96, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯4.21-5.84) mental distress showed greater odds of delaying medical visits.

"Psychosocial impact of COVID-19 among adults in the southeastern United States","Limited research has explored the mental health impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the U.S., especially among Black and low-income Americans who are disproportionately affected by COVID-19. To address this gap in the literature, we investigated factors associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms during the pandemic. From October to December 2020, over 4400 participants in the Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS) completed a survey about the impact of the pandemic. The SCCS primarily enrolled adults with low income in 12 southeastern states. We used polytomous unconditional logistic regression to investigate factors associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms. About 28% of respondents reported mild or moderate/severe depressive symptoms and 30% reported mild or moderate/severe anxiety symptoms. Respondents in fair/poor health had significantly higher odds of moderate/severe depression and anxiety than those in very good/excellent health (depression: odds ratio (OR)Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯4.72 [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.57-6.23]; anxiety: ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯4.77 [95%CI: 3.63-6.28]). Similarly, living alone was associated with higher odds of moderate/severe depression and anxiety (depression: ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.74 [95%CI: 1.38-2.18]; anxiety ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.57 [95%CI: 1.27-1.95]). Individuals whose physical activity or vegetable/fruit consumption decreased since the start of the pandemic also had higher odds of moderate/severe depression and anxiety. Results overall suggest that individuals in fair/poor health, living alone, and/or experiencing decreased physical activity and vegetable/fruit consumption have higher risk of depressive and anxiety symptoms.

"Rates of depressive and anxiety symptoms in the perinatal period during the COVID-19 pandemic: Comparisons between countries and with pre-pandemic data","The COVID-19 pandemic was a significant threat to perinatal mental health. This study examined differences in clinically significant depression, anxiety, and co-morbid symptoms among pregnant and postpartum women across several countries and compared prevalence of perinatal depression and anxiety before and during the pandemic in each participating country. Participants were 3326 pregnant and 3939 postpartum women (up to six months postpartum) living in Brazil, Chile, Cyprus, Greece, Israel, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. An online survey was completed between June 7th and October 31st 2020, and included the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener (GAD-7). The pre-pandemic studies were identified through literature review. Prevalence of clinically significant depression (EPDSÃ¢â€°Â¥13), anxiety (GAD-7Ã¢â‚¬Â¯Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬Â¯10), and co-morbid (EPDSÃ¢â€°Â¥13 and GAD-7Ã¢â‚¬Â¯Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬Â¯10) symptoms was 26.7Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%, 20Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% and 15.2Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%, in pregnant women, and 32.7Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%, 26.6Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% and 20.3Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%, in postpartum women, respectively. Significant between-country differences were found in all mental health indicators in both perinatal periods. Higher levels of symptoms were observed during (versus before) the pandemic, especially among postpartum women. Participants were mostly highly educated and cohabiting with a partner. The online nature of the survey may have limited the participation of women from vulnerable socio-economically backgrounds. Our findings expand previous literature on the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on perinatal mental health, by highlighting that this may be influenced by country of residence. Mental health care policies and interventions should consider the unique needs of perinatal women in different parts of the world.","Mateus, Cruz, Costa, Mesquita, Christoforou, Wilson, Vousoura, Dikmen-Yildiz, Bina, Dominguez-Salas, Contreras-GarcÃƒÂ­a, Motrico, OsÃƒÂ³rio","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.08.017","20220814","Anxiety; COVID-19 pandemic; Depression; Mental health; Postpartum; Pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-16","",36155,""
"First vs second wave of COVID-19 pandemic in patients with obsessive compulsive disorder: A multicentre report from tertiary clinics in Northern Italy","Among patients with mental illness, those with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) showed a significant clinical worsening by the COVID-19 pandemic. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on OCD have been shown to worsen symptoms severity, with serious clinical consequences. However, the persistence of COVID-19 pandemic in OCD patients has been poorly investigated. The purpose of the present study was to assess the impact of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in a sample of OCD patients and to compare the results with those obtained during the first wave on the same OCD sample. 116 OCD outpatients attending three OCD tertiary clinics in Northern Italy and previously included in a report on the impact of COVID-19, were followed-up in order to investigate sociodemographic and clinical features. Appropriate statistical analyses for categorical and continuous variables were conducted. The 43 OCD patients with a clinical worsening (OW) reported a significant development of new obsessions/compulsions and the recurrence of past OC symptoms, higher rates of psychiatric comorbidities and sleep disturbances compared to patients without symptom worsening. Moreover, an increase in avoidance behaviors, suicidal ideation, Internet checking for reassurance, and job difficulties emerged in OW patients. Also, lower rates of pharmacological stability, and higher rates of therapy adjustment were observed. In terms of sex differences, males showed higher rates of past obsessions occurrence, while females showed a rise in Internet checking behaviors. When comparing OW patients between the first and the second wave, the latter showed significantly higher rates of past obsession occurrence and lower rates of pharmacological stability. Moreover, patients with OW showed a significantly older age during the second wave. The persistence of the COVID-19 pandemic showed a globally impaired clinical picture in the analyzed OCD sample. A further worsening between the two waves timepoints emerged, mainly involving older patients with OCD. The concordance between our results and those existing in literature highlights the importance of an accurate long-term monitoring of OCD patients in light of COVID-19 pandemic persistence.","Benatti, Albert, Maina, Celebre, Girone, Bramante, Rigardetto, ViganÃƒÂ², Dell'Osso","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.07.058","20220816","Avoidance; COVID-19; Internet-checking; Obsessive compulsive disorder; Suicidal ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-16","",36156,""
