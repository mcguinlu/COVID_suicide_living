"Longitudinal experiences and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among people with past or current eating disorders in Sweden","ObjectiveTo document the impact of the COVI-19 pandemic on the health and well-being of individuals with past and current eating disorders in Sweden.

MethodWe re-contacted participants from two previous Swedish studies who had a known lifetime history of an eating disorder. Participants completed an online questionnaire about their health and functioning at baseline early in the pandemic (Wave 1; N=982) and six months later (Wave 2); N=646).

ResultsThree important patterns emerged: 1) higher current eating disorder symptom levels were associated with greater anxiety, worry, and pandemic-related eating disorder symptom increase; 2) patterns were fairly stable across time, although a concerning number who reported being symptom-free at Wave 1 reported re-emergence of symptoms at Wave 2; and only a minority of participants with current eating disorders were in treatment, and of those who were in treatment, many reported fewer treatment sessions than pre-pandemic and decreased quality of care.

ConclusionsThe COVID-19 pandemic is posing serious health challenges for individuals with eating disorders, whether currently symptomatic or in remission. We encourage health service providers and patient advocates to be alert to the needs of individuals with eating disorders and to take active measures to ensure access to appropriate evidence-based care both during and following the pandemic.

Significant Outcomes and LimitationsO_LIIndividuals with eating disorders symptoms or current active disorder report higher adverse impact of COVID-19 on their mental health
C_LIO_LIEven individuals who were symptom-free early in the pandemic reported a resurgence of eating disorder symptoms
C_LIO_LIA large proportion of symptomatic individuals were not in treatment for their eating disorder, services should be aware and access to evidence-based care should be ensured across Sweden
C_LIO_LILimitations included the use of a convenience sample with atypical diagnostic distribution, and a low initial response rate, possibly introducing bias and limiting generalisability.

"The effect of the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic on urology practice and anxiety scores of patients awaiting surgery","We aimed to determine the effect COVID-19 pandemic on the daily urology practice of the level three center located in one of the most affected regions in Turkey.We also aimed to assess anxiety and depression levels of patients whose procedures and surgeries had to be postponed due to COVID-19-related restrictions. The number of patients admitted to the outpatient clinic,outpatient procedures, emergency consultation requests,hospitalized patients,and the total number of surgeries between March 10, 2020 and June 15, 2020 were evaluated.These numbers were compared to the same period of 2019. Subsequently,patients who could not be operated or whose elective surgeries were postponed between March 10, 2020 and June 15, 2020 were determined(n:96).These patients were asked to fill out Beck Depression Inventory(BDI) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory(STAI).The presence of difference between the baseline anxiety levels and the anxiety levels during the COVID-19 pandemic were investigated.Afterwards,these patients were divided into two groups based on planned procedures as oncological group (group1) and non-oncological group (group2).The presence of a difference between the anxiety and depression levels between the groups was investigated. There was a drastic decline in number of patients in all assessed parameters.The least amount of change was seen in the number of emergency consultations.The evaluation of anxiety and depression scores of the patients showed a significant difference between their STAI-S and STAI-T scores (51.8Ã‚Â±9.3, 38.2Ã‚Â±7.5,respectively)(p &lt;0.001).STAI-S scores of the patients were found to be compatible with severe anxiety.The patients' mean BDI score was found to be 15Ã‚Â±8.9, which indicated mild depression.However,the age and STAI-S values Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã¢â‚¬â€¹were significantly higher in group1. We noted that anxiety and depression levels increased in patients whose operations were delayed due to pandemic-related restrictions,especially in oncological patients.We believe that an important contribution can be made to the protection of public health by planning advance psychosocial interventions for high-risk groups during pandemics.","Micoogullari, Kisa, Yucel, Ozbilen, Karaca, Cakici, Ilbey","https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14201","20210401","Beck Depression Inventory; COVID-19 pandemic; State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; anxiety; urology practice","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-02","",12551,""
"The interplay between anxiety, fear, protective behaviors, compassion, and resilience among older adults during a COVID-19 lockdown: a structural equation modeling study","The implementation of lockdown measures to curb the transmission of Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has brought about significant psychological impacts and older adults have been identified as one of the vulnerable groups. In the current COVID-19 context among older adults in the community, the fear of COVID-19, anxiety symptoms, compassion, resilience, and the practice of protective behaviors are possibly related to each other in several ways. How these factors relate to each other would have important implications in managing the spread of the disease and its mental health consequences. To this end, we modeled their interrelationships using a structural equation model. Older adults (N = 421), aged 60 and above completed various questionnaires-COVID-19 Fear Inventory, Short form of the Geriatric Anxiety Inventory, COVID-19 Risky and Protective Behaviours, Resilience Appraisals Scale, and Compassion Scale during a COVID-19 lockdown. The relationships between these variables were assessed within a structural equation model. The findings showed that older adults who are more compassionate engage in protective behaviors more frequently. Additionally, frequent practice of protective behaviors and greater resilience predicted lower anxiety among older adults. Greater fear predicted higher anxiety levels but did not significantly influence an individual's engagement in protective behaviors. Mental health services are crucial in fostering resilience and supporting older adults psychologically. Social services are also necessary in maintaining and enhancing social support for older adults. Importantly, these findings suggest that public health communications could promote compassion and avoid using a fear-based approach to increase engagement in protective behaviors. This study focused on the interrelations between various psychosocial factors (i.e., fear of COVID-19, compassion, and resilience) and the behavioral (i.e., engagement in protective health behaviors) and psychological responses (i.e., anxiety) to COVID-19 among community-dwelling older adults. The study analyzed self-reported data from 421 older adults who are aged 60 and above. The findings showed that older adults who are more compassionate engage in protective behaviors more frequently. Additionally, older adults who showed greater resilience and engage in protective health behaviors more frequently reported lower anxiety levels. Lastly, greater fear of COVID-19 predicted greater anxiety among older adults but did not significantly influence their engagement in protective health behaviors.","Lim, Yap, Mahendran, Yu","https://doi.org/10.1093/tbm/ibaa143","20210401","Anxiety; COVID-19; Mental health; Older adults; Protective behavior; Psychosocial","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-02","",12552,""
"The inevitability of Covid-19 related distress among healthcare workers: Findings from a low caseload country under lockdown","To characterize psychological distress and factors associated with distress in healthcare practitioners working during a stringent lockdown in a country (Jordan) that had exhibited one of the lowest incidence rates of Covid-19 globally at the time of the survey. A cross-sectional online survey sent to healthcare practitioners working in various hospitals and community pharmacies. Demographic, professional and psychological characteristics (distress using Kessler-6 questionnaire, anxiety, depression, burnout, sleep issues, exhaustion) were measured as were sources of fear. Descriptive and multivariable statistics were performed using level of distress as the outcome. We surveyed 937 practitioners (56.1% females). Approximately 68%, 14%, and 18% were nurses/technicians, physicians, and pharmacists (respectively). 32% suffered from high distress while 20% suffered from severe distress. Exhaustion, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances were reported (in past seven days) by approximately 34%, 34%, 19%, and 29% of subjects (respectively). Being older or male, a positive perception of communications with peers, and being satisfied at work, were significantly associated with lower distress. Conversely, suffering burnout; reporting sleep-related functional problems; exhaustion; being a pharmacist (relative to a physician); working in a cancer center; harboring fear about virus spreading; fear that the virus threatened life; fear of alienation from family/friends; and fear of workload increases, were significantly associated with higher distress. Despite low caseloads, Jordanian practitioners still experienced high levels of distress. Identified demographic, professional and psychological factors influencing distress should inform interventions to improve medical professionals' resilience and distress likelihood, regardless of the variable Covid-19 situation.","Hawari, Obeidat, Dodin, Albtoosh, Manasrah, Alaqeel, Mansour","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248741","20210401","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-02","",12553,""
"A mental health paradox: Mental health was both a motivator and barrier to physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the mental health, physical activity, and sedentary behavior of people worldwide. According to the Health Belief Model (HBM), health-related behavior is determined by perceived barriers and motivators. Using an online survey with 1669 respondents, we sought to understand why and how physical activity and sedentary behavior has changed by querying about perceived barriers and motivators to physical activity that changed because of the pandemic, and how those changes impacted mental health. The following results were statistically significant at p &lt; .05. Consistent with prior reports, our respondents were less physically active (aerobic activity, -11%; strength-based activity, -30%) and more sedentary (+11%) during the pandemic as compared to 6-months before. The pandemic also increased psychological stress (+22%) and brought on moderate symptoms of anxiety and depression. Respondents' whose mental health deteriorated the most were also the ones who were least active (depression r = -.21, anxiety r = -.12). The majority of respondents were unmotivated to exercise because they were too anxious (+8%,), lacked social support (+6%), or had limited access to equipment (+23%) or space (+41%). The respondents who were able to stay active reported feeling less motivated by physical health outcomes such as weight loss (-7%) or strength (-14%) and instead more motivated by mental health outcomes such as anxiety relief (+14%). Coupled with previous work demonstrating a direct relationship between mental health and physical activity, these results highlight the potential protective effect of physical activity on mental health and point to the need for psychological support to overcome perceived barriers so that people can continue to be physically active during stressful times like the pandemic.","Marashi, Nicholson, Ogrodnik, Fenesi, Heisz","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239244","20210401","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-02","",12554,""
"Symptoms of Anxiety or Depressive Disorder and Use of Mental Health Care Among Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic - United States, August 2020-February 2021","The spread of disease and increase in deaths during large outbreaks of transmissible diseases is often associated with fear and grief (1). Social restrictions, limits on operating nonessential businesses, and other measures to reduce pandemic-related mortality and morbidity can lead to isolation and unemployment or underemployment, further increasing the risk for mental health problems (2). To rapidly monitor changes in mental health status and access to care during the COVID-19 pandemic, CDC partnered with the U.S. Census Bureau to conduct the Household Pulse Survey (HPS). This report describes trends in the percentage of adults with symptoms of an anxiety disorder or a depressive disorder and those who sought mental health services. During August 19, 2020-February 1, 2021, the percentage of adults with symptoms of an anxiety or a depressive disorder during the past 7 days increased significantly (from 36.4% to 41.5%), as did the percentage reporting that they needed but did not receive mental health counseling or therapy during the past 4 weeks (from 9.2% to 11.7%). Increases were largest among adults aged 18-29 years and among those with less than a high school education. HPS data can be used in near real time to evaluate the impact of strategies that address mental health status and care of adults during the COVID-19 pandemic and to guide interventions for groups that are disproportionately affected.","Vahratian, Blumberg, Terlizzi, Schiller","https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7013e2","20210401","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-02","",12555,""
"Decline of psychological health following COVID-19 pandemic designation: A descriptive study","Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020 and currently as of this writing, in the state of Texas, USA, there has are more than 675,000 cases with over 14,000 deaths. Many of these implementations can increase sedentary lifestyles. which can lead to the development of chronic diseases, obesity development among the population and overall cause serious threats to people's physical health and lives. Individuals with pre-existing conditions are at increased risk of contracting COVID and thus may have higher levels of stress. Explore the relationship between individual's level of physical activity and status of mental health, on individuals with health conditions versus those with none, before and after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic for the citizens of Texas. An electronic survey was disseminated throughout various regions of Texas. 157 respondents were asked questions about their demographics, time spent on daily physical activities, and daily mental health status before and after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. Frequency distribution and descriptive statistics was performed. 61% of participants reported having 1 or more health conditions with 13.6% of the respondents having 3+ medical conditions. . Though not significant, participants with 1 or more preexisting condition drastically decreased their activity as evident by a 10% increase in sedentary lifestyles after the COVID-19 pandemic designation. On the contrary, we observed a 9% increase in the number of individuals without a preexisting condition reporting 30-60 min of physical activity per week. There was a 2-fold increase in the number of participants reporting more frequent feelings of nervousness, worrying too much, having trouble relaxing and feeling afraid something awful might happen after the pandemic. More specifically, individuals with pre-existing medical conditions reported on average a 10% higher incidence of feelings of stress, anxiety and sadness compared to healthy counterparts after the pandemic declaration. Stressful life conditions and having a chronic disease are risk factors that can affect mental health and reduce the ability of proper daily functioning. Therefore, when implementing pandemic protocols, municipalities should consider providing mental health support to their citizens to protect them from this invisible adverse effect.","Patel, Gamez, Shah, Patel","https://doi.org/10.2196/24964","20210401","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-02","",12556,""
"Association of job loss, income loss, and financial burden with adverse mental health outcomes during coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in Thailand: A nationwide cross-sectional study","Economic crises during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic severely impacted mental health outcomes. However, there is limited evidence on this issue in Thailand. We aimed to evaluate the association of economic burden during the first phase of the pandemic and the risk of adverse mental health outcomes in the Thai population. We recruited 2,303 participants agedÃ‚Â 18 years or above with employment/full-time jobs before the national lockdown in April-May 2020. The measures of economic burden were job loss, income loss, and financial problems related to the outbreak. The outcomes included depressive symptoms, anxiety, and perceived stress. The association between economic burden and adverse mental health outcomes was evaluated using multivariable logistic regression models. Individuals who lost their jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic had a higher risk of perceived stress compared to those who maintained their job (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-4.51; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.006).

A qualitative study was conducted in the constructivist paradigm. Purposive sampling was used, and twenty-two students participated in semi-structured interviews, which were then content-analysed. The study is reported using the COREQ checklist. Five themes emerged in the 'Experiences and emotional response' dimension (context, patients, emotions and feelings, risk of contagion, and personal satisfaction), and three themes emerged in the 'Coping strategies' dimension strategies in the work environment, in daily life and personal life.

"Mental health in Japanese children during school closures due to the COVID-19","Changes in relationships, sleep rhythms, and physical activity caused by school closures instituted to curb the spread of COVID-19 influenced children's mental health. We explored changes in children's daily life and effects on their mental health during school closures. Participants included elementary and junior high school students 9 years of age and older seen in the outpatient clinic during school closures and were required to complete the Japanese version of WHO Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5-J). The results were compared with those of students seen after schools reopened. Participants included 78 students in the school closure group and 113 in the school reopening group. Although those in the closure group devoted more time to family and sleep, their sleep rhythms, eating habits, and physical activities were disrupted. Although there were no significant differences between the two groups in total WHO-5-J scores, single WHO-5-J items such as activity and vigor and interest were significantly worse and rest was significantly better in the school closure group. Although school closures resulted in elementary and junior high school students spending more time with family and sleeping, their sleep rhythms, eating habits, and physical activities were disrupted. As the children's living environment changed, they felt less active and vigorous and had difficulty finding things that interested them. However, their sleep improved and overall, the number of children with potential mental health problems did not change.","Saito, Kikuchi, Lefor, Hoshina","https://doi.org/10.1111/ped.14718","20210401","COVID-19; child; mental health; school closure","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-02","",12563,""
"[Neuropsychiatric sequelae of the COVID-19 pandemic]","The COVID-19 pandemic has a significant impact on mental health. On the one hand, fears about one's economic situation, own health and the health of others can lead to psychosocial consequences. On the other hand, social isolation through physical distancing can affect mental health. Finally, the infection itself can lead to psychiatric and neuropsychiatric symptoms as part of a systemic manifestation. In this paper, different mechanisms are presented, which can lead directly or indirectly to neuropsychological and psychopathological symptoms in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"COVID-19, Unemployment, and Behavioral Health Conditions: The Need for Supported Employment","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused massive unemployment, exacerbated pre-existing behavioral health (mental health and substance use) disorders for many people, and created new disorders for others. Although policy changes have increased health care and unemployment benefits, most people want jobs and self-sufficiency rather than handouts. A robust evidence base shows that supported employment can enable unemployed people with behavioral health conditions to find competitive, integrated employment and behavioral health supports. Millions of U.S. citizens may need these services as the pandemic recedes and jobs become available.

"BTK inhibitors for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2): A Systematic Review","ImportanceThe Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) regulates B cell and macrophage signaling, development, survival, and activation. BTK inhibition was shown to protect against lethal influenza-induced acute lung injury in mice. Inhibiting BTK has been hypothesized to ameliorate lung injury in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). ObjectiveTo evaluate the use of BTK inhibitors (BTKinibs) during COVID-19 and assess how they may affect patient outcomes.Evidence ReviewWe searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science: Core on December 30, 2020. Clinical studies with at least 5 COVID-19 patients treated with BTKinibs were included. Case reports and reviews were excluded.FindingsOne hundred twenty-five articles were identified, 6 of which met inclusion criteria. Sample size ranged from 6 to 126 patients. Patient populations included subjects hospitalized with COVID-19 (6/6) and admitted to the intensive care unit (5/6). Patient age ranged between 35 and 98 years. Four studies included patients already receiving BTKinibs for their lymphoproliferative disease, 1 for Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia and 3 for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The most common clinical outcomes measured were oxygen requirements (4/6) and hospitalization rate or duration (3/6). Differences in standard-of-care reflected the date of study and pre-existing conditions in the various patient cohorts. Full-dose acalabrutinib was evaluated in 2 studies, one study evaluated full-dose ibrutinib, and another study evaluated both ibrutinib and acalabrutinib. The remainder 2 studies described outcomes in CLL patients on multiple BTKinibs and other CLL-targeted treatments. Three studies showed decreased oxygen requirements in patients who started or continued BTKinibs. All three studies that evaluated hospitalization rate or duration found favorable outcomes in those on BTKinibs. Conclusions and RelevanceÃ¯Â»Â¿BTKinib use was associated with decreased oxygen requirements and decreased hospitalization rates and duration. However, randomized clinical trials are needed to validate the beneficial effects of BTKinibs for acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Stack, Sacco, Castagnoli, Livinski, Notarangelo, Lionakis","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-319342/v1","20210401","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-02","",12566,""
"COVID-19: The disease of loneliness and solitary demise","The birth of the COVID-19 pandemic has transformed working lives of British Asian general practitioners (GPs), such as one of the authors. The effects of the national lockdown and the subsequent loneliness have impacted every aspect of our lives and increased mental health problems. The added social isolation of local lockdowns, such as in Leicester, will undoubtedly exacerbate some health problems due to a lack of patient willingness to attend healthcare services and the postponement of some appointments. The lack of culturally competent support is likely to add to the isolation in non-English-speaking people. Thus, we should pre-empt these issues in a culturally effective manner. To prepare for subsequent waves, GPs are risk-stratifying patients for COVID-19 and have commenced ReSPECT care-plan conversations with higher-risk patients. But with the increased risk from COVID-19 to Black, Asian and minority ethnic patients, should this and other groups of patients also have a ReSPECT care plan? Is now the time to consider community-hospice settings for our palliative COVID-19 patients? This pandemic has uncovered a training need for healthcare professionals to feel more comfortable in discussing end of life as an integral consultation component. We should focus our efforts in alleviating suffering by achieving 'shared understanding' and 'negotiating management' of our ReSPECT conversations.","Trivedi, Trivedi, Trivedi, Moorthy","https://doi.org/10.7861/fhj.2020-0154","20210401","COVID-19; ReSPECT; end-of-life care; loneliness; mental health,","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-02","",12567,""

"The impact of COVID-19 shielding on the wellbeing, mental health and treatment adherence of adults with cystic fibrosis","People with cystic fibrosis (CF) were advised to undertake 'shielding' at home during the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce their risk of infection. We studied the impact shielding had on their wellbeing, mental health (GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores) and adherence to treatment. 63 (46%) of 137 people surveyed responded (19 anonymously; 44 gave their identity). Most (94%) adhered to shielding advice 'all the time/often' but many (76%) found this difficult with disruption of their routines, relationships and exercise habits. Treatment adherence rates were high and continued during COVID-19. Depression scores were low and remained stable. Clinically significant anxiety rates rose from 27% pre-COVID-19 to 54% during COVID-19 and seven patients requested a psychology consultation from this study.

"The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children - A resource for COVID-19 research: Generation 2 questionnaire data capture May-July 2020","The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) is a prospective population-based cohort study which recruited pregnant women in 1990-1992 from the Bristol area (UK). ALSPAC has followed these women, their partners (Generation 0; G0) and their offspring (Generation 1; G1) ever since. From 2012, ALSPAC has identified G1 participants who were pregnant (or their partner was) or had become parents, and enrolled them, their partners, and children in the ALSPAC-Generation 2 (ALSPAC-G2) study, providing a unique multi-generational cohort. At present, approximately 1,100 G2 children (excluding those <i>in utero</i>) from 810 G1 participants have been enrolled. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, ALSPAC rapidly deployed two online questionnaires; one during the initial lockdown phase in 2020 (9 <sup>th</sup> April-15 <sup>th</sup> May), and another when national lockdown restrictions were eased (26 <sup>th</sup> May-5 <sup>th</sup> July). As part of this second questionnaire, G1 parents completed a questionnaire about each of their G2 children. This covered: parental reports of children's feelings and behaviour since lockdown, school attendance, contact patterns, and health. A total of 289 G1 participants completed this questionnaire on behalf of 411 G2 children. This COVID-19 G2 questionnaire data can be combined with pre-pandemic ALSPAC-G2 data, plus ALSPAC-G1 and -G0 data, to understand how children's health and behaviour has been affected by the pandemic and its management. Data from this questionnaire will be complemented with linkage to health records and results of biological testing as they become available. Prospective studies are necessary to understand the impact of this pandemic on children's health and development, yet few relevant studies exist; this resource will aid these efforts. Data has been released as: 1) a freely-available dataset containing participant responses with key sociodemographic variables; and 2) an ALSPAC-held dataset which can be combined with existing ALSPAC data, enabling bespoke research across all areas supported by the study.","Smith, Northstone, Bowring, Wells, Crawford, Pearson, Thomas, Brooks-Pollock, Lawlor, Timpson","https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16414.1","20210401","ALSPAC; COVID-19; Children; Children of the 90s; Contact Patterns; Coronavirus; Cross-generation; Mental Health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-02","",12570,""
"Deconstructing Racialized Experiences in Healthcare: What a Missed Opportunity for Healing Looks Like and Healthcare Resources for Children and Their Families","Some patients and families of color, including Asian Americans, face significant adverse stressors due to living within a White-dominant society. Xenophobia and racism can impact health. Research evidence points to early exposure to adverse childhood experiences such as racial discrimination as being detrimental and having significant short-term and long-term impact on physical and mental health. The purpose of this commentary article is to illuminate the need of patients and their families who may seek health care providers (HCPs) to express their concerns and fears when issues of xenophobia and racism arise. Patients and families need space in a healthcare setting to feel heard and understood. Anti-Asian xenophobia and racism among medically underserved Asian Americans persists and has been heightened during the COVID-19 pandemic. We describe tenets of Critical Race Theory and AsianCrit, and use this lens to understand an example actual scenario, a counter-story, of a Vietnamese mother, and her Vietnamese-Chinese American family's experience with xenophobia and racism at a community recreation center and the subsequent communication of this experience with a HCP. We describe the impacts of these experiences of seeking healing including discontinuity of a HCP-patient-family relationship. It takes bravery for patients and families to tell their story of xenophobia and racism to a HCP. There are Asian Americans who are afraid to seek healthcare because of anti-Asian xenophobia and concerns about White fragility. Following, we highlight research evidence on implicit bias, also known as unconscious bias, as context about its persistent and widespread existence among healthcare professionals in general and the need to address this in healthcare. Implicit bias can influence care provided to a patient-family and the interactions between a HCP-patient-family. We include additional resources such as those from the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners, American Psychological Association Office on Children Youth and Families, the Office of Ethnic Minority Affairs, the Office on Socioeconomic Status, and American Academy of Pediatrics to consider in support of equity in healthcare practice of children and their families.","Nguyen-Truong, Rakha, Eti, Angelesco","https://doi.org/10.31372/20200504.1109","20210401","AsianCrit; Critical Race Theory; Vietnamese; Vietnamese-Chinese; White fragility; adverse childhood experiences; equity; families; healthcare practice; implicit bias; racism; xenophobia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-02","",12571,""
"COVID/HIV Co-Infection: A Syndemic Perspective on What to Ask and How to Answer","The present commentary explored the intersecting nature of the COVID-19 and HIV pandemics to identify a shared research agenda using a syndemic approach. The research agenda posits the following questions. Questions around HIV infection, transmission, and diagnosis include: (i) molecular, genetic, clinical, and environmental assessments of COVID-19 in people living with HIV, (ii) alternative options for facility-based HIV testing services such as self- and home-based HIV testing, and (iii) COVID-19 related sexual violence and mental health on HIV transmission and early diagnosis. These and related questions could be assessed using Biopsychosocial and socio-ecological models. Questions around HIV treatment include: (i) the effect of COVID-19 on HIV treatment services, (ii) alternative options for facility-based treatment provision such as community-based antiretroviral therapy groups, and (iii) equitable distribution of treatment and vaccines for COVID-19, if successful. Bickman's logic model and the social determinants of health framework could guide these issues. The impact of stigma, the role of leveraging lessons on sustained intra-behavioral change, the role of medical mistrust and conspiracy beliefs, and the role of digital health on integrated management of HIV care and spectrum of care of COVID-19 need assessment using several frameworks including Goffman's stigma framework, Luhmann's Trust theory, and Gidden's theory of structuration. In conclusion, the potential research agenda of this commentary encompasses a variety of research fields and disciplinary areas-clinicians, laboratory scientists, public health practitioners, health economists, and psychologists-, and suggests several theoretical frameworks to guide examination of complex issues comprehensively.","Gesesew, Mwanri, Stephens, Woldemichael, Ward","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.623468","20210401","COVID-19; HIV; HIV care continuum; framework; syndemic approach","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-02","",12572,""
"Anxiety and Its Associated Factors During the Initial Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Indonesia","<b>Introduction:</b> Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a novel coronavirus which has not been identified previously in humans. The disease leads to respiratory problems, systemic disorders, and death. To stop the virus transmission, physical distancing was strongly implemented, including working and school from home (WFH &amp; SFH). The limitation altered daily routines and needs advanced to adapt. Many have felt uncomfortable and this could have triggered anxiety symptoms. This study aimed to evaluate the proportion of significant anxiety symptoms and its association with COVID-19-related situations in an Indonesian context during the initial months of the pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> An online community survey was distributed through social media and communication platforms, mainly WhatsApp, targeting people &gt;18 years old in Indonesia. Anxiety symptoms were assessed using Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (Indonesian Version). Demographical data and information on social situation related to the COVID-19 pandemic were collected. The proportion of clinically significant anxiety symptoms was calculated and the association with demographic and social factors was assessed using chi square test (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup>) and logistic regression for multivariate analysis. <b>Results:</b> Out of 1215 subjects that completed the survey, 20.2% (<i>n</i> = 245) exhibited significant anxiety symptoms. Several factors, such as age (AOR = 0.933 CI 95% = 0.907-0.96), sex (AOR = 1.612 CI 95% = 1.097-2.369), medical workers (AOR = 0.209 CI 95% = 0.061-0.721), suspected case of COVID-19 (AOR = 1.786 CI 95% = 1.001-3.186), satisfaction level of family support (AOR = 3.052 CI 95% = 1.883-4.946), and satisfaction level of co-workers (AOR = 2.523 CI 95% = 1.395-4.562), were associated with anxiety. <b>Conclusion:</b> One out of five Indonesian people could have suffered from anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. The riskiest group being young females, people who had suspected cases of COVID-19, and those with less satisfying social support. Nevertheless, health workers were found to have a lesser risk of developing anxiety.

"Predictors of Health Behaviors Among Undergraduate Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Predictive Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the health behaviors of university students. Thus, factors influencing students' health behaviors during the COVID-19 outbreak should be examined. To our knowledge, little is known about stress, adversity quotient, and health behaviors of university students in Thailand. Therefore, the aims of this study were to determine the relationships among socioeconomic factors, stress, and adversity quotient influencing university students' health behavior during the COVID-19 crisis. We conducted a cross-sectional predictive study; it was included 416 undergraduate students Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years of age at a university in Thailand. We used descriptive statistics, chi-squared test, and stepwise multiple linear regression for data analysis. The results indicated that most participants were women (71.90%), and the highest proportion of students were enrolled in College of Politics and Governance (25.24%). Most of the students had a high stress level (M = 3.54, SD = 0.53), high adversity quotient (M = 3.77, SD = 0.63), and good health behavior (M = 3.06, SD = 0.53). Adversity quotient, stress, and current faculty/college were significant predictors of health behaviors of undergrad students (total variance: 37.2%). Total adversity quotient was the strongest predictor of health behavior, followed by stress and current faculty/colleges. On the basis of our results, we suggested that faculty members, caretakers, and interdisciplinary care teams should consider adversity quotient and stress in developing activities to encourage and promote students' physical and mental health behaviors, particularly during the COVID-19.","Suksatan, Choompunuch, Koontalay, Posai, Abusafia","https://doi.org/10.2147/JMDH.S306718","20210401","COVID-19 pandemic; Thai students; adversity quotient; health behaviors; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-02","",12574,""
"Assessment of Psychological Distress and Associated Factors among Hospitalized Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic at Selected Hospitals in Southwest Ethiopia","The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of psychological distress and associated factors among hospitalized patients during the COVID-19 pandemic at three selected hospitals in southwest Ethiopia.

"Biobehavioral aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic: A review","This review highlights the scope and significance of the COVID-19 pandemic with a focus on biobehavioral aspects, as well as critical avenues for research. A narrative review of the published research literature was undertaken, highlighting major empirical findings emerging during the first and second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Interactions among biological, behavioral and societal processes are prominent across all regions of the globe during the first year of the COVID-19 emergency. Affective, cognitive, behavioral, socioeconomic and technological factors all play a significant role in the spread of infection, response precautions, and outcomes of mitigation measures. Affective disorders, suicidality and cognitive dysfunction have been widely reported consequences of both the infection, economic impact and the necessary public health mitigation measures themselves. The impact of COVID-19 may be especially serious for those living with severe mental illness and/or chronic medical diseases, given the confluence of several adverse factors in a manner that appears to have syndemic potential. The COVID-19 pandemic has made clear that biological and behavioral factors interact with societal processes in the infectious disease context. Empirical research examining mechanistic pathways from infection, loss, and recovery to immunological, behavioral and emotional outcomes is critical. Examination of emotional and behavioral factors is critical to ongoing management of the current pandemic, as well as future major threats to global health.","Hall, Sheeran, Fong, Cheah, Oremus, Liu-Ambrose, Sakib, Butt, Ayaz, Jandu, Morita","https://doi.org/10.1097/PSY.0000000000000932","20210401","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-02","",12576,""
"A cross-sectional study of the association of age, gender, education and economic status with individual perceptions of governmental response to COVID-19","We assessed the impact of key population variables (age, gender, income and education) on perceptions of governmental effectiveness in communicating about COVID-19, helping meet needs for food and shelter, providing physical and mental healthcare services, and allocating dedicated resources to vulnerable populations. Cross-sectional study carried out in June 2020. 13Ã¢â‚¬â€°426 individuals from 19 countries. More than 60% of all respondents felt their government had communicated adequately during the pandemic. National variances ranged from 83.4% in China down to 37.2% in Brazil, but overall, males and those with a higher income were more likely to rate government communications highly. Almost half (48.8%) of the respondents felt their government had ensured adequate access to physical health services (ranging from 89.3% for Singapore to 27.2% for Poland), with higher ratings reported by younger and higher-income respondents. Ratings of mental health support were lower overall (32.9%, ranging from 74.8% in China to around 15% in Brazil and Sweden), but highest among younger respondents. Providing support for basic necessities of food and housing was rated highest overall in China (79%) and lowest in Ecuador (14.6%), with higher ratings reported by younger, higher-income and better-educated respondents across all countries. The same three demographic groups tended to rate their country's support to vulnerable groups more highly than other respondents, with national scores ranging from around 75% (Singapore and China) to 19.5% (Sweden). Subgroup findings are mostly independent of intercountry variations with 15% of variation being due to intercountry differences. The tendency of younger, better-paid and better-educated respondents to rate their country's response to the pandemic more highly, suggests that government responses must be nuanced and pay greater attention to the needs of less-advantaged citizens as they continue to address this pandemic.","Lazarus, Palayew, Rabin, Wyka, Hajo, Ratzan, Fielding, El-Mohandes","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-047310","20210401","COVID-19; health policy; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-02","",12577,""
"Household food insecurity and its association with self-reported male perpetration of intimate partner violence: a survey of two districts in central and western Uganda","This study aimed to determine the lifetime prevalence of male-perpetrated intimate partner violence (IPV), and to assess the association with food insecurity, sociodemographic factors and health risk behaviours in Uganda in the year preceding COVID-19-associated lockdowns. Population-based, cross-sectional household survey. Urban, semiurban and rural communities of the Wakiso and Hoima districts in Uganda. A total of N=2014 males aged 13-80 years participated in the survey. The current study included males who reported having ever been in a sexual union and responded to the IPV questions (N=1314). Data were collected face-to-face from May 2018 to July 2019 using an interviewer-mediated questionnaire. Lifetime IPV perpetration was measured as 'no physical and/or sexual IPV', 'physical' versus 'sexual violence only', and 'physical and sexual violence'. Past-year food insecurity was measured through the Food Insecurity Experience Scale and categorised into 'none', 'low' and 'high'. Multinomial logistic regression was used to determine the crude and adjusted relative risk ratios (aRRRs) of IPV perpetration in relation to self-reported food insecurity, adjusting for sociodemographic and health risk behaviours. The prevalence of self-reported lifetime IPV perpetration was 14.6% for physical and 6.5% for sexual violence, while 5.3% reported to have perpetrated both physical and sexual IPV. Most (75.7%) males reported no food insecurity, followed by low (20.7%) and high (3.6%) food insecurity. In adjusted models, food insecurity was associated with increased risk of having perpetrated both physical and sexual violence (aRRR=2.57, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.52 to 4.32). IPV perpetration was also independently associated with having had more than one lifetime sexual partner and drinking alcohol, but not with education level or religion. This study suggests that food insecurity is associated with male IPV perpetration, and more efforts are needed to prevent and mitigate the expected worsening of this situation as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Awungafac, Mugamba, Nalugoda, SjÃƒÂ¶land, Kigozi, Rautiainen, Malyabe, Ziegel, Nakigozi, Nalwoga, Kyasanku, Nkale, Watya, EkstrÃƒÂ¶m, KÃƒÂ¥gesten","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-045427","20210401","HIV &amp; AIDS; epidemiology; mental health; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-02","",12578,""
"Prevalence and risk factors for chalazion in an older veteran population","Chalazia are common inflammatory eyelid lesions, but their epidemiology remains understudied. This retrospective case-control study examined the prevalence, risk factors and geographic distribution of chalazia in a large veteran population. Data on all individuals seen at a Veterans Affairs (VA) clinic between October 2010 and October 2015 were extracted from the VA health database. Subjects were grouped based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code for chalazion. Univariable logistic regression modelling was used to identify clinical and demographic factors associated with chalazion presence, followed by multivariable modelling to examine which factors predicted risk concomitantly. All cases were mapped across the continental US using geographic information systems modelling to examine how prevalence rates varied geographically. Overall, 208Ã¢â‚¬â€°720 of 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°453Ã¢â‚¬â€°944 (6.04%) subjects were diagnosed with chalazion during the study period. Prevalence was highest in coastal regions. The mean age of the population was 69.32Ã‚Â±13.9 years and most patients were male (93.47%), white (77.13%) and non-Hispanic (93.72%). Factors associated with chalazion risk included smoking (OR=1.12, p&lt;0.0005), conditions of the tear film (blepharitis (OR=4.84, p&lt;0.0005), conjunctivitis (OR=2.78, p&lt;0.0005), dry eye (OR=3.0, p&lt;0.0005)), conditions affecting periocular skin (eyelid dermatitis (OR=2.95, p&lt;0.0005), rosacea (OR=2.50, p&lt;0.0005)), allergic conditions (history of allergies (OR=1.56, p&lt;0.0005)) and systemic disorders (gastritis (OR=1.54, p&lt;0.0005), irritable bowel syndrome (OR=1.45, p&lt;0.0005), depression (OR=1.35, p&lt;0.0005), anxiety (OR=1.31, p&lt;0.0005)). These factors remained associated with chalazion risk when examined concomitantly. Periocular skin, eyelid margin and tear film abnormalities were most strongly associated with risk for chalazion. The impact of environmental conditions on risk for chalazion represents an area in need of further study.","Patel, Tohme, Gorrin, Kumar, Goldhagen, Galor","https://doi.org/10.1136/bjophthalmol-2020-318420","20210401","COVID-19; cornea; epidemiology; eye lids; infection","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-02","",12579,""
"Trends in reasons for emergency calls during the COVID-19 crisis in the department of Gironde, France using artificial neural network for natural language classification","During periods such as the COVID-19 crisis, there is a need for responsive public health surveillance indicators in order to monitor both the epidemic growth and potential public health consequences of preventative measures such as lockdown. We assessed whether the automatic classification of the content of calls to emergency medical communication centers could provide relevant and responsive indicators. We retrieved all 796,209 free-text call reports from the emergency medical communication center of the Gironde department, France, between 2018 and 2020. We trained a natural language processing neural network model with a mixed unsupervised/supervised method to classify all reasons for calls in 2020. Validation and parameter adjustment were performed using a sample of 39,907 manually-coded free-text reports. The number of daily calls for flu-like symptoms began to increase from February 21, 2020 and reached an unprecedented level by February 28, 2020 and peaked on March 14, 2020, 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°days before lockdown. It was strongly correlated with daily emergency room admissions, with a delay of 14Ã¢â‚¬â€°days. Calls for chest pain and stress and anxiety, peaked 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°days later. Calls for malaises with loss of consciousness, non-voluntary injuries and alcohol intoxications sharply decreased, starting one month before lockdown. No noticeable trends in relation to lockdown was found for other groups of reasons including gastroenteritis and abdominal pain, stroke, suicide and self-harm, pregnancy and delivery problems. The first wave of the COVID-19 crisis came along with increased levels of stress and anxiety but no increase in alcohol intoxication and violence. As expected, call related to road traffic crashes sharply decreased. The sharp decrease in the number of calls for malaise was more surprising. The content of calls to emergency medical communication centers is an efficient epidemiological surveillance data source that provides insights into the societal upheavals induced by a health crisis. The use of an automatic classification system using artificial intelligence makes it possible to free itself from the context that could influence a human coder, especially in a crisis situation. The COVID-19 crisis and/or lockdown induced deep modifications in the population health profile.","Gil-JardinÃƒÂ©, Chenais, Pradeau, Tentillier, Revel, Combes, Galinski, Tellier, Lagarde","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13049-021-00862-w","20210401","COVID-19; Emergency medical communication centers; Lockdown; Public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-02","",12580,""
"Syringe service program-based telemedicine linkage to opioid use disorder treatment: protocol for the STAMINA randomized control trial","A key strategy for mitigating the current opioid epidemic is expanded access to medications for treating opioid use disorder (MOUD). However, interventions developed to expand MOUD access have limited ability to engage opioid users at higher levels of overdose risk, such as those who inject opioids. This paper describes the study protocol for testing STAMINA (Syringe Service Telemedicine Access for Medication-assisted Intervention through NAvigation), an intervention that engages high-risk opioid users at community-based syringe service programs (SSP) and quickly links them to MOUD using a telemedicine platform. This randomized control trial will be conducted at threeÃ‚Â SSP sites in Chicago. All participants will complete an initial assessment with a provider from a Federally Qualified Health Center who can prescribe or refer MOUD services as appropriate. The control arm will receive standard referral to treatment and the intervention arm will receive immediate telemedicine linkage to the provider and (depending on the type of MOUD prescribed) provided transportation to pick up their induction prescription (for buprenorphine or naltrexone) or attend their intake appointment (for methadone). We aim to recruit a total of 273 participants over two years to provide enough power to detect a difference in our primary outcome of MOUD treatment linkage. Secondary outcomes include treatment engagement, treatment retention, and non-MOUD opioid use. Data will be collected using structured interviews and saliva drug tests delivered at baseline, threeÃ¢â‚¬â€°months, andÃ‚Â sixÃ¢â‚¬â€°months. Fixed and mixed effects generalized linear regression analyses and survival analysis will be conducted to compare the probabilities of a successful treatment linkage between the two arms, days retained in treatment, and post-baseline opioid and other drug use. If successful, STAMINA's telemedicine approach will significantly reduce the amount of time between SSP clients' initial indication of interest in the medication and treatment initiation. Facilitating this process will likely lead to stronger additional treatment- and recovery-oriented outcomes. This study is also timely given the need for more rigorous testing of telemedicine interventions in light of temporary regulatory changes that have occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"COBRE on Opioid and Overdose: A Collaborative Research-Based Center Addressing the Crises in Rhode Island and Beyond","Overdose deaths across the country have spiked since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is crucial now, more than ever, to address the continuing and worsening, complex and dynamic opioid and overdose epidemics. In 2018, The Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) on Opioids and Overdose, based at Rhode Island Hospital, launched with three major goals: 1) establish a center of scientific excellence on opioids and overdose; 2) train the next generation of scientists to become independent investigators and address the opioid and overdose crises; and 3) contribute to the scientific progress and solutions to combat these epidemics. To date, we have made substantial progress. While the opioid and overdose crises continue to evolve, the COBRE on Opioid and Overdose and its team of investigators are well poised to address the daunting task of understanding and meaningfully addressing these deadly epidemics, with the ultimate goal of saving lives.","Green, Kaplowitz, Langdon, Hughto, Goedel, Czynski, Fraser, Rich","https://www.google.com/search?q=COBRE+on+Opioid+and+Overdose:+A+Collaborative+Research-Based+Center+Addressing+the+Crises+in+Rhode+Island+and+Beyond.","20210401","fentanyl; jail; opioid; overdose; prison","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-02","",12582,""
"Identifying the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on service access for people who use drugs (PWUD): A national qualitative study","Introduction Closures and reductions in capacity of select health and social services in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may have placed people who use drugs (PWUD) at a disproportionately increased risk for experiencing harms, and resulted in critical treatment disruptions. We conducted the current national study among a cohort of PWUD to understand how COVID-19 has affected service access, including any significant impacts PWUD may have experienced. Results will contribute to the evidence base for informing future pandemic and public health policy planning for vulnerable populations. Methods The project involved qualitative telephone-based interviews with 196 adult (aged 18+) PWUD from across Canada. Eligibility criteria included daily or weekly use of psychoactive substance(s), and/or current enrollment in opioid agonist treatment (OAT). Data collection took place between May and July 2020. Data underwent thematic analyses, and common themes informed the results. Results Most participants experienced detrimental service access issues and treatment disruptions during COVID-19, including reduced access to harm reduction services, OAT, withdrawal management and treatment services, medical professionals (e.g., addictions and mental health counseling), shelters/housing, and food banks. Positive impacts included greater access to OAT take-home â€˜carriesâ€™ and prescription deliveries. Decreases in service capacity resulted in increased health issues and risky substance use behaviors among PWUD, such as unaccompanied substance use, sharing/re-use of supplies, and overdose events. Conclusions Reductions in the accessibility of critical services PWUD rely on during COVID-19 has increased existent substance use and health issues among PWUD, while decreasing their ability to mitigate risks related to substance use. Thus, the expansion of the depth and breadth of support options is crucial. Services must remain open and flexible to the unique needs of PWUD during COVID-19, while novel and effective adaptations and interventions should remain available and accessible post-COVID-19.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108374","20211001","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-02","",12583,""
"Effects of COVID-19-related stay-at-home order on neuropsychophysiological response to urban spaces: Beneficial role of exposure to nature?","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has had severe negative effects on populations worldwide. The seriousness of the pandemic necessitated local and even national lockdowns. In Singapore a national lockdown with aStay-at-Home Order (SHO) lasted for over 7 weeks. The impact of the pandemic and of the long SHO period on neuropsychophysiological functioning remains unknown. Studies prior to the pandemic highlighted the beneficial role of nature exposure on mental health and well-being, although this has not yet been explored in the post-pandemic world. This is the first study to investigate the longitudinal changes in (1) brain frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA; neuroelectric marker of approach-related motivation), (2) depressive mood and (3) symptoms, and (4) emotional response to videos of various urban spaces from before COVID-19 to immediately after the SHO in Singapore was over. Finally, we examined whether higher vs lower exposure to nature during the SHO moderated changes over time. Methods The sample included 25 healthy adult Singaporeans (56% female, MageÂ =Â 40.4Â y, SDÂ =Â 17.8), who attended two electroencephalography (EEG) lab sessions, within a year before the COVID-19 pandemic (T1) and immediately following the SHO (T2). The participants viewed 9 fixed-frame videos, filmed before the pandemic, from 3 urban public spaces (Busy Downtown, Residential Green, Lush Garden) on the roll-up screen. They rated their emotional response (arousal, valence) after each video and completed Becks Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) as a measure of depressive symptoms, Profile of Mood Scale (POMS), as a measure of momentary mood, and self-reported the frequency and duration of their nature visits during the SHO. Results Linear mixed models were fitted to examine changes over time, and effect moderation by amount of nature exposure during the SHO. The results showed decrease in FAA (pÂ <Â 0.001), increase in depressive symptoms (pÂ =Â 0.046), and a trend for marginal increase in momentary mood disturbance (pÂ =Â 0.097) after the SHO. Importantly, people with high nature exposure during SHO had greater decrease in FAA over time (pÂ =Â 0.005) than those with low nature exposure, FAA scores decreased the most for Residential Green. Valence and Arousal did not change over time, but Arousal towards Busy Downtown decreased among high nature exposure individuals (pÂ =Â 0.002). Conclusions Post SHO, brain activity and responsiveness to landscapes changed, and showed a general reduction in positive emotions and increased depressive symptoms among participants. The higher nature exposure during the SHO did not help mitigate this depressive symptoms, as previous research would suggest. This can be due to the modified quality of nature exposure during lockdown, which highlights the importance of high quality nature experience in cities and the provision of diversified visual exposures. Potential neuropsychophysiological consequences of SHO should be considered by policy makers in the post-COVID-19 world.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2021.101590","20210601","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-02","",12584,""
