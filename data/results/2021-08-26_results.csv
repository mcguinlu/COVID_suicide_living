"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adult mental health in the UK: A rapid systematic review","Background. There is evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the mental health of the UK population, but this needs synthesising to guide effective policy recommendations and ensure support is targeted to populations most at risk. We conducted a rapid systematic review of the evidence of the impact of COVID-19 and associated restrictions on the mental health of UK adults, including risk and protective factors. Method. A range of databases were searched to identify eligible studies. Studies were eligible if they reported primary quantitative or qualitative research on the mental health of UK adults between March 2020 and March 2021. Journal publications and pre-prints were included. Reviews, position papers, protocol papers and studies published in languages other than English were excluded. The study authors screened papers for eligibility and included 102 papers in the analysis. Results. The evidence from this review indicates that the mental health of UK adults has declined since the start of the pandemic, with different populations being unequally affected. Populations particularly affected are women, young adults, ethnic minorities, people from lower socio-economic backgrounds, people with pre-existing conditions and people who have had COVID-19. Other risk factors include having to isolate and time spent watching pandemic related news. Protective factors include social contact and maintaining healthy behaviours, such as physical activity. Conclusions. Policy should aim to discourage risky behaviours while ensuring support is available for people to engage in protective behaviours. Interventions should be directed towards populations that have been most adversely affected. Addressing the decline in mental health across the UK population since the COVID-19 pandemic will require increasing mental health provision and ensuring equitable access to support.","Eleonore Batteux; Jo Taylor; Holly Carter","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.23.21262469","20210825","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-26","",17366,""
"Health and social behaviour through pandemic phases in Switzerland: Regional time-trends of the COVID-19 Social Monitor panel study","Switzerland has a liberal implementation of Coronavirus mitigation measures compared to other European countries. Since March 2020, measures have been evolving and include a mixture of central and federalistic mitigation strategies across three culturally diverse language regions. The present study investigates a hypothesised heterogeneity in health, social behavior and adherence to mitigation measures across the language regions by studying pre-specified interaction effects. Our findings aim to support the communication of regionally targeted mitigation strategies and to provide evidence to address longterm population-health consequences of the pandemic by accounting for different pandemic contexts and cultural aspects. We use data from from the COVID-19 Social Monitor, a longitudinal population-based online survey. We define five mitigation periods between March 2020 and May 2021. We use unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models to investigate a hypothesized interaction effect between mitigation periods and language regions on selected study outcomes covering the domains of general health and quality of life, mental health, loneliness/isolation, physical activity, health care use and adherence to mitigation measures. We analyze 2,163 (64%) participants from the German/Romansh-speaking part of Switzerland, 713 (21%) from the French-speaking part and 505 (15%) from the Italian-speaking part. We found evidence for an interaction effect between mitigation periods and language regions for adherence to mitigation measures, but not for other study outcomes (social behavior, health). The presence of poor quality of life, lack of energy, no physical activity, health care use, and the adherence to mitigation measures changed similarly over mitigation periods in all language regions. As the pandemic unfolded in Switzerland, also health and social behavior changed between March 2020 to May 2021. Changes in adherence to mitigation measures differ between language regions and reflect the COVID-19 incidence patterns in the investigated mitigation periods, with higher adherence in regions with previously higher incidence. Targeted communcation of mitigation measures and policy making should include cultural, geographical and socioeconomic aspects to address yet unknown long-term population health consequences caused by the pandemic.","Moser, von Wyl, HÃƒÂ¶glinger","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0256253","20210825","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-26","",17367,""
"(Un)mask yourself! Effects of face masks on facial mimicry and emotion perception during the COVID-19 pandemic","Face masks have been said to impact face-to-face interaction negatively. Yet, there is limited evidence on the degree to which partial face occlusion is detrimental to empathic processes such as emotion perception and facial mimicry. To address this question, we conducted an online experiment (<i>N</i>=200, U.K. sample) that assessed subjective ratings and facial expressions (mimicry) in response to masked and unmasked faces. Perceivers were able to recognise happiness and sadness in dynamic emotion expressions independent of (surgical) face masks. However, perceived emotion intensity and interpersonal closeness were reduced for masked faces. Facial mimicry, the perceiver's imitation of the expresser's emotional display, was reduced or absent in response to happy but preserved for sad mask-covered expressions. For happy target expressions, the face-mimicry link was partially mediated by perceived emotion intensity, supporting the idea that mimicry is influenced by context effects. Thus, these findings suggest that whether face masks impede emotion communication depends on the emotion expressed and the emotion-communication aspect of interest. With unprecedented changes in nonverbal communication brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, this research marks a first contribution to our understanding of facial mimicry as an important social regulator during these times.","Kastendieck, Zillmer, Hess","https://doi.org/10.1080/02699931.2021.1950639","20210825","COVID-19; Emotional mimicry; emotion perception; face masks; facial mimicry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-26","",17368,""
"Changes in Life Circumstances and Mental Health Symptoms during the COVID-19 Pandemic among Midlife Women with Elevated Risk for Cardiovascular Disease","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death among women. During midlife (ages 40-60), universal aging processes, sex-specific factors such as menopause, psychological distress, and conditions such as hypertension substantially increase women's risk for CVD. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted employment, social interactions, caregiving responsibilities, and overall well-being worldwide; however, little research has investigated how COVID-19 has affected women in midlife. The present study was designed to determine how COVID-19 has affected women in midlife with elevated risk for CVD, by examining changes in their mental health symptoms and life domains across three time points: prior to COVID-19 (2019), during stay-at-home orders (April-June 2020), and during initial reopening (August 2020). Women in midlife with one or more CVD risk conditions (e.g., hypertension; <i>n</i> =Ã‚Â 35) responded to questions related to COVID-19, changes in life circumstances, and mental health symptoms at each time point. Findings showed meaningful changes in caregiving, medical visits, and employment status, as well as significant changes in depression and sleep quality scores across time. However, the findings also showed that women were distressed prior to COVID-19 and did not exhibit changes in perceived stress, body dissatisfaction, or anxiety symptoms over time. Findings from this study highlight the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on an at-risk group of women, which may be used to help guide future health promotion efforts specifically tailored to this population.","Brown, Arigo","https://doi.org/10.1080/08952841.2021.1967654","20210825","COVID-19; WomenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s health; cardiovascular risk; mental health; midlife","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-26","",17369,""
"Health Literacy Does Not Protect Against Underage Alcohol Use During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Limited health literacy (HL) and alcohol use increase teens' risk for preventable disease burden and adverse outcomes. In the current study, relationships between HL and alcohol use were explored in 39 secondary school students sheltering-at-home during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. HL was assessed using the Newest Vital Sign. Alcohol use was assessed with questions from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS). Most students (76.9%) had adequate HL. Males had higher HL than females. Many teens (42.9%) reported drinking and recent alcohol use (18.2%). Drunk driving and riding with someone under the influence were comparable to the YRBS. Lifetime and recent alcohol use and positive alcohol expectancies were comparable among teens with adequate and limited HL. More teens with adequate HL had negative expectancies. Only teens with adequate HL reported recent binge drinking (10.3%), drunk driving (10.5%), or riding with someone under the influence (17.9%). Adequate HL does not protect teens from alcohol use and misuse.

"Evening-types show highest increase of sleep and mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic - Multinational study on 19,267 adults","Individual circadian type is a ubiquitous trait defining sleep, with eveningness often associated with poorer sleep and mental health than morningness. However, it is unknown whether COVID-19 pandemic has differentially affected sleep and mental health depending on the circadian type. Here, the differences in sleep and mental health between circadian types are examined globally before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample collected between May and August 2020 across 12 countries/regions consisted of 19,267 adults with information on their circadian type. Statistical analyses were performed by using Complex Sample procedures, stratified by country and weighted by the number of inhabitants in the country/area of interest and by the relative number of responders in that country/area. Evening-types had poorer mental health, well-being, and quality of life or health than other circadian types during the pandemic. Sleep-wake schedules were delayed especially on working days, and evening-types reported an increase in sleep duration. Sleep problems increased in all circadian types, but especially among evening-types, moderated by financial suffering and confinement. Intermediate-types were less vulnerable to sleep changes, although morningness protected from most sleep problems. These findings were confirmed after adjusting for age, sex, duration of the confinement or socio-economic status during the pandemic. These findings indicate an alarming increase in sleep and mental health problems, especially among evening-types as compared to other circadian types during the pandemic.","Merikanto, Kortesoja, Benedict, Chung, Cedernaes, Espie, Morin, Dauvilliers, Partinen, De Gennaro, Wing, Chan, Inoue, Matsui, Holzinger, Plazzi, Mota-Rolim, Leger, Penzel, Bjorvatn","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsab216","20210825","Chronotype; Circadian Rhythms; Coronavirus; Depression; Eveningness; Insomnia; Sleep quality; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-26","",17371,""
"Prevalence and Trends in Suicidal Behavior Among US Military Veterans During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has raised considerable concerns about increased risk for suicidal behavior among US military veterans, who already had elevated rates of suicide before the pandemic. To examine longitudinal changes in suicidal behavior from before the COVID-19 pandemic to nearly 10 months into the pandemic and identify risk factors and COVID-related variables associated with new-onset suicide ideation (SI). This population-based prospective cohort study used data from the first and second wave of the National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, conducted from November 18, 2019, to December 19, 2020. Median dates of data collection for the prepandemic and peripandemic assessments were November 21, 2019, and November 14, 2020, nearly 10 months after the start of the COVID-19 public health emergency in the US. A total of 3078 US military veterans aged 22 to 99 years were included in the study. Past-year SI and suicide attempts. In this cohort study of 3078 US veterans (mean [SD] age, 63.2 [14.7] years; 91.6% men; 79.3% non-Hispanic White veterans, 10.3% non-Hispanic Black veterans, and 6.0% Hispanic veterans), 233 (7.8%) reported past-year SI, and 8 (0.3%) reported suicide attempts at the peripandemic assessment. Past-year SI decreased from 10.6% prepandemic (95% CI, 9.6%-11.8%) to 7.8% peripandemic (95% CI, 6.9%-8.8%). A total of 82 veterans (2.6%) developed new-onset SI over the follow-up period. After adjusting for sociodemographic and military characteristics, the strongest risk factors and COVID-19-related variables for new-onset SI were low social support (odds ratio [OR], 2.77; 95% CI, 1.46-5.28), suicide attempt history (OR, 6.31; 95% CI, 2.71-14.67), lifetime posttraumatic stress disorder and/or depression (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.16-4.35), past-year alcohol use disorder severity (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.12), COVID-19 infection (OR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.41-5.01), and worsening of social relationships during the pandemic (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.16-1.88). The results of this cohort study suggest that despite grim forecasts that the COVID-19 pandemic would exacerbate suicidality among US military veterans, the rate of SI decreased at the population level nearly 10 months into the pandemic. Veterans who were infected with COVID-19 were more than twice as likely to report SI, which suggests the need for future research to examine the potential link between COVID-19 infection and suicidal behavior.","Nichter, Hill, Na, Kline, Norman, Krystal, Southwick, Pietrzak","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2021.2332","20210825","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-26","",17372,""
"Factors associated with depression, anxiety and stress among dentists during the COVID-19 pandemic","The objective of this work was to evaluate the relationship between factors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and depression, anxiety, and stress (DAS) in dentists. Factors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic were evaluated using a questionnaire and scores of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales-21 were measured. The differences between the DAS scores based on the factors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic were tested through the successive application of multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA, ÃŽÂ± = 0.05). After a sample size calculation, 998 participants with a mean age of 39.39 (Ã‚Â± 11.69) years were included. The effect size indicated that changes in sleep quality (ÃŽÂ·2 = 0.161), eating habits (ÃŽÂ·2 = 0.057), and physical health (ÃŽÂ·2 = 0.051) were the ones that most negatively affected DAS scores. The highest DAS scores were observed in professionals who lived with someone at high-risk for COVID-19 (p &lt; 0.001) and in those who did not engage in leisure activities during the pandemic (p &lt; 0.001). Dentists who worked on the frontline against COVID-19 had higher scores of anxiety and stress (p = 0.029). The highest scores for anxiety, depression, and/or stress were seen in dentists living with someone at high-risk for COVID-19, who acts on the frontline, who does not practice in leisure activities during the pandemic, who completely changed eating habits, quality of sleep and physical health during the pandemic. In general, DAS levels of dentists were associated with factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Alencar, Silva, Jural, Magno, Campos, Silva, Coqueiro, Pithon, Maia","https://doi.org/10.1590/1807-3107bor-2021.vol35.0084","20210825","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-26","",17373,""
"Behavioral Health in the Pandemic: Making the Shift from Mental Illness to Mental Well-Being","Fighting the global COVID-19 pandemic has shifted from immediate response efforts to recognition of the long-term effects on the mental health and well-being of the general population and healthcare workforce. Leaders need to understand the vital role of behavioral health services in a population-based, integrated healthcare framework and address the needs of the behavioral health workforce to successfully deploy services in their organizations and communities.During the ongoing national response to COVID-19, three major trends have emerged: (1) a shift to telehealth and digital care, (2) greater awareness of the impact on the workforce of the shift to digital care, and (3) an open dialogue to counteract the stigma and discrimination related to mental illness and to emphasize mental well-being instead. When they address stigma and discrimination, healthcare leaders embrace a more holistic approach that welcomes behavioral health professionals as equal, vital members of the care team.

"Neural connectome prospectively encodes the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom during the COVID-19 pandemic","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has affected humans worldwide and led to unprecedented stress and mortality. Detrimental effects of the pandemic on mental health, including risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), have become an increasing concern. The identification of prospective neurobiological vulnerability markers for developing PTSD symptom during the pandemic is thus of high importance. Before the COVID-19 outbreak (September 20, 2019-January 11, 2020), some healthy participants underwent resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) acquisition. We assessed the PTSD symptomology of these individuals during the peak of COVID-19 pandemic (February 21, 2020-February 28, 2020) in China. This pseudo-prospective cohort design allowed us to test whether the pre-pandemic neural connectome status could predict the risk of developing PTSD symptom during the pandemic. A total of 5.60% of participants (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 42) were identified as being high-risk to develop PTSD symptom and 12.00% (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 90) exhibited critical levels of PTSD symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pre-pandemic measures of functional connectivity (the neural connectome) prospectively classified those with heightened risk to develop PTSD symptom from matched controls (AccuracyÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 76.19%, SensitivityÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 80.95%, SpecificityÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 71.43%). The trained classifier generalized to an independent sample. Continuous prediction models revealed that the same connectome could accurately predict the severity of PTSD symptoms within individuals (<i>r</i> <sup>2</sup>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.31p&lt;.0). This study confirms COVID-19 break as a crucial stressor to bring risks developing PTSD symptom and demonstrates that brain functional markers can prospectively identify individuals at risk to develop PTSD symptom.","Chen, Feng, Becker, Xu, Nassar, Sirois, Hommel, Zhang, He, Qiu, He, Lei, Chen, Feng","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ynstr.2021.100378","20210825","COVID-19; Deep learning; Post-traumatic stress disorder; Prospective diagnosis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-26","",17377,""
"The role of social support, detachment, and depressive and anxiety symptoms in suicidal thoughts and behaviours during the Covid-19 lockdown: Potential pathways","During the COVID-19 pandemic, anxiety and depressive symptoms, as well as problems related to social relationships, such as available social support and feelings of detachment from others, have worsened. These factors are strongly associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviours (STB). The effects of feelings of detachment on mental health and on STB have been scarcely studied, together with the relation that it may have with available social support. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess potential pathways connecting these conditions. A nationally representative sample of Spanish adults (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3305) was interviewed during the COVID-19 pandemic (June 2020). STB, social support, and depressive and anxiety symptoms were measured with the C-SSRS (modified version), OSSS-3, PHQ-8, and GAD-7 scales, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression models and mediation analyses were performed. Social support and some of its components (i.e., social network size and relations of reciprocity) were associated with lower odds of STB. Detachment significantly mediated (22% to 25%) these associations. Symptoms of emotional disorders significantly mediated the association between social support components (29% to 38%) - but not neighbourhood support - with STB, as well as the association between detachment and higher odds of STB (47% to 57%). In both cases, depressive symptoms were slightly stronger mediating factors when compared to anxiety symptoms. Our findings suggest that interventions aimed at lowering depressive and anxiety symptoms, and STB should provide social support and help tackle the feeling of detachment in a complementary way.","Gabarrell-Pascuet, FÃƒÂ©lez-NÃƒÂ³brega, CristÃƒÂ³bal-NarvÃƒÂ¡ez, Mortier, Vilagut, Olaya, Alonso, Haro, DomÃƒÂ¨nech-Abella","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-02205-5","20210825","Anxiety symptoms; COVID-19; Depressive symptoms; Detachment; Social support; Suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-26","",17378,""

"Emergency department visits for psychiatric care during the first lockdown in Melbourne","We investigated the nature of patients presenting to an emergency department (ED) during the first lockdown in Melbourne. This study compared adult patients in the North West Area Mental Health Service catchment area who presented to the local ED during the lockdown (16 March-12 May 2020) and the control (16 March-12 May 2019) periods. The control and lockdown periods included 321 and 332 patients, respectively. Compared to the control period, patients with non-English speaking backgrounds and presenting complaints of suicidal behaviour were lower, whereas patients with anxiety symptoms and needing compulsory assessments were higher in the lockdown period. Diagnostically, the lockdown period included more patients with anxiety disorders, substance use disorders and psychotic disorders. ED access for acute psychiatric care can vary depending upon certain patient characteristics during lockdowns.","Jagadheesan, Danivas, Itrat, Lakra","https://doi.org/10.1177/10398562211037329","20210825","COVID-19; access; emergency department; lockdown; pandemic; psychiatric care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-26","",17382,""
