"A cross-sectional study of the relationship between exercise, physical activity, and health-related quality of life among Japanese workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: Exercise and physical activity positively affect physical and mental health, and healthy workers contribute to increased work productivity. This study aimed to investigate time spent on exercise during leisure time and physical activity, including time at work, in relation to health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among Japanese workers. Methods: An Internet-based national health survey --Collaborative Online Research on Novel-coronavirus and Work study (CoRoNaWork study)-- was conducted among 33,087 Japanese workers in December 2020. After excluding invalid responses, 27,036 participants were categorized into four and five groups according to exercise time and physical activity time, respectively. Each group's scores were compared on each of the four questions on the Japanese version of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Health-Related Quality of Life (CDC HRQOL-4) between each group using a linear mixed model. Age-sex adjusted and multivariate models were used to compare each index of the CDC HRQOL-4.","Ryosuke Sugano; Kazunori Ikegami; Hisashi Eguchi; Mayumi Tsuji; Seiichiro Tateishi; Tomohisa Nagata; Shinya Matsuda; Yoshihisa Fujino; Akira Ogami","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.15.21259002","20210618","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-19","",15074,""
"Long COVID symptoms from Reddit: Characterizing post-COVID syndrome from patient reports","Objective To mine Reddit to discover long-COVID symptoms self-reported by users, compare symptom distributions across studies, and create a symptom lexicon. Materials and Methods We retrieved posts from the /r/covidlonghaulers subreddit and extracted symptoms via approximate matching using an expanded meta-lexicon. We mapped the extracted symptoms to standard concept IDs, compared their distributions with those reported in recent literature and analyzed their distributions over time. Results From 42,995 posts by 4249 users, we identified 1744 users who expressed at least 1 symptom. The most frequently reported long-COVID symptoms were mental health-related symptoms (55.2%), fatigue (51.2%), general ache/pain (48.4%), brain fog/confusion (32.8%) and dyspnea (28.9%) amongst users reporting at least 1 symptom. Comparison with recent literature revealed a large variance in reported symptoms across studies. Temporal analysis showed several persistent symptoms up to 15 months after infection. Conclusion The spectrum of symptoms identified from Reddit may provide early insights about long-COVID.","Abeed Sarker; Yao Ge","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.15.21259004","20210618","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-19","",15075,""
"Specificity and Mechanism of Coronavirus, Rotavirus and Mammalian Two-Histidine-Phosphoesterases That Antagonize Antiviral Innate Immunity","2,5-oligoadenylate(2-5A)-dependent endoribonuclease, RNase L, is a principal mediator of the interferon (IFN) antiviral response. Therefore, regulation of cellular levels of 2-5A is a key point of control in antiviral innate immunity. Cellular 2-5A levels are determined by IFN-inducible 2,5-oligoadenylate synthetases (OASs) and by enzymes that degrade 2-5A. Importantly, many coronaviruses and rotaviruses encode 2-5A degrading enzymes thereby antagonizing RNase L and its antiviral effects. A-kinase anchoring protein 7 (AKAP7), a mammalian counterpart, could possibly limit tissue damage from excessive or prolonged RNase L activation during viral infections or from self double-stranded-RNAs that activate OAS. We show these enzymes, members of the two-histidine-phosphoesterase (2H-PE) superfamily, constitute a sub-family referred here as 2,5-PEs. 2,5-PEs from mouse coronavirus (CoV) MHV (NS2), MERS-CoV (NS4b), group A rotavirus (VP3), and mouse (AKAP7) were investigated for their evolutionary relationships and activities. While there was no activity against 3,5-oligoribonucleotides, all cleaved 2,5-oligoadenylates efficiently, but with variable activity against other 2,5-oligonucleotides. The 2,5-PEs are shown to be metal ion-independent enzymes that cleave trimer 2-5A (2,5-p3A3) producing mono- or di- adenylates with 2,3-cyclic phosphate termini. Our results suggest that elimination of 2-5A might be the sole function of viral 2,5-PEs, thereby promoting viral escape from innate immunity by preventing or limiting the activation of RNase L.

IMPORTANCEViruses often encode accessory proteins that antagonize the host antiviral immune response. Here we probed the evolutionary relationships and biochemical activities of two-histidine-phosphoesterases (2H-PEs) that allow some coronaviruses and rotaviruses to counteract antiviral innate immunity. In addition, we investigated the mammalian enzyme, AKAP7, which has homology and shared activities with the viral enzymes and might reduce self-injury. These viral and host enzymes, that we refer to as 2,5-PEs, specifically degrade 2,5-oligoadenylate activators of the antiviral enzyme RNase L. We show that the host and viral enzymes are metal ion independent and exclusively cleave 2,5- and not 3,5-phosphodiester bonds, producing cleavage products with cyclic 2,3-phosphate termini. Our study defines 2,5-PEs as enzymes that share characteristic conserved features with the 2H-PE superfamily but which have specific and distinct biochemical cleavage activities. These findings may eventually lead to pharmacologic strategies for developing antiviral drugs against coronaviruses, rotaviruses, and other viruses.","Abhishek Asthana; Christina Gaughan; Susan R.

"The Perspective of Thailand Economy After the Effect of Coronavirus-19 Pandemics: Explication by Dynamic I-O Models and Agent-Based Simulations","The panic surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic has collapsed world economic systems  Thailand is no exception  Evidently, domestic-industrial activities in many countries have nearly stopped, and international sectors have abruptly disintegrated  Unemployment has become critical, and business viability has run into trouble  This article illustrates the potential solutions to these issues linked to Thailandâ€™s domestic and international-trade economies by econometrically applying sectoral forecasting analyses and simulations because the pandemic has not only caused physical damage, but also a negative chain in worldwide economic systems  Methodologically, dynamic input-output (I-O) analysis is circumspectly employed to obtain foresight on some predominantly industrial sectors that could potentially rescue the Thai domestic economy from the depression of 2020â€“2022  The I-O tables are sourced from official data of the Asian Development Bank (ADB)  For the international-trade scenario, the agent-based model and simulations are used to forecast the future trends of macroeconomic responses  The two methods, dynamic I-O models and agent-based simulations, are the current means capable of sensibly predicting macroeconomic responses for monitoring the upcoming years  The empirical outcomes can clearly predict upcoming events that will be beneficial for policy implementations  Â© The Author(s) 2021","Chen, R.; Chaiboonsri, C.; Wannapan, S.","https://doi.org/10.1177/21582440211021841","","Database: Scopus; Publication details: SAGE Open; 11(2), 2021.; Publication details: SAGE Open; 11(2), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-19","",15089,""

"A Mixed-Methods Study of Nurse Managers' Managerial and Clinical Challenges in Mental Health Centers During the COVID-19 Pandemic","PURPOSE: The worldwide outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has posed challenges for nurses  The aim of this study was to examine the managerial and clinical challenges of nurse managers in mental health centers during the current COVID-19 pandemic  DESIGN: A mixed-methods study based on an analysis of data obtained in focus groups with 25 nurse managers from two mental health centers in Israel  METHODS: The quantitative phase was conducted prior to the group sessions using a structured self-administered questionnaire that examined the nurse managers' (a) background data, (b) communication with the staff nurses, (c) perceptions of nurses' functioning, (d) perceptions of their own functioning, and (e) management as impacted by the pandemic  The qualitative phase included three sessions of focus groups in which the nurse managers discussed both their challenging and positive issues during the pandemic  FINDINGS: The most important challenges were related to the need to protect patients from infection and communicating with families and primary caregivers  Work policies and procedures were less well adapted to pandemic conditions;nevertheless, nurse managers felt a sense of purpose, duty, and pride in their work  Three themes emerged: (a) ""management complexity"" included the change from a familiar routine to a new reality, working in capsules, protecting against infection, functional confusion, and insights into future epidemics;(b) ""challenging communication"" included communication with patients through glass walls and communication with staff through screens and (c) ""bright spots"" referred to staff cohesion and the provision of respectful care  CONCLUSIONS: Mental health nurse managers have experienced during the pandemic a change in their roles from being less managerial to focusing more on clinical work  Communication between nurse managers and staff nurses and between mental health patients and staff were the main challenges  Nurse managers favorably noted the uniformity and humanity of the staff, sense of cohesion, and shared responsibility  CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In the first wave of the pandemic, there was confusion as to the functional role of ward nurse managers, as the focus of their activities became more clinical and less managerial  During and after the pandemic, preventive interventions should be carried out in order to assist patients, staff nurses, and nurse managers in mental health centers","Kagan, I.; Shor, R.; Ben Aharon, I.; Yerushalmi, S.; Kigli-Shemesh, R.; Gelman, S.; Itzhaki, M.","https://doi.org/10.1111/jnu.12685","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Journal of Nursing Scholarship; 15:15, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Nursing Scholarship; 15:15, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-19","",15091,""
"A trouble shared is a trouble halved: The role of family identification and identification with humankind in well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered health-related anxiety in ways that undermine peoples' mental and physical health  Contextual factors such as living in a high-risk area might further increase the risk of health deterioration  Based on the Social Identity Approach, we argue that social identities can not only be local that are characterized by social interactions, but also be global that are characterized by a symbolic sense of togetherness and that both of these can be a basis for health  In line with these ideas, we tested how identification with one's family and with humankind relates to stress and physical symptoms while experiencing health-related anxiety and being exposed to contextual risk factors  We tested our assumptions in a representative sample (N = 974) two-wave survey study with a 4-week time lag  The results show that anxiety at Time 1 was positively related to stress and physical symptoms at Time 2  Feeling exposed to risk factors related to lower physical health, but was unrelated to stress  Family identification and identification with humankind were both negatively associated with subsequent stress and family identification was negatively associated with subsequent physical symptoms  These findings suggest that for social identities to be beneficial for mental health, they can be embodied as well as symbolic","Frenzel, S.

"A Global Pandemic and Substance Use Disorder: Healthcare Professionals' Viewpoints on the Merging of Two Crises","INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 has resulted in extraordinary adversities  Mandates such as distancing and variations to treatment services were implemented to slow transmission of the virus, but created new challenges for persons with Substance Use Disorder (SUD)  To better understand this phenomenon, we surveyed healthcare professionals on how they believe COVID-19 has impacted persons with SUD and what needs to occur to effectively treat this vulnerable population  Methods: Attending physicians, residents, nurses, medical and nursing students, and other healthcare professionals were asked to respond to three open-ended questions related to the impact of COVID-19 on persons with SUD  Two independent coders reviewed the comments utilizing constant comparative analysis to develop themes  Results: Common themes of concern were found from the respective participants (n = 205) including: lack of access to treatment, feelings of isolation, negative impacts on mental health, and the possibility of relapse  Healthcare strategies to effectively treat and help persons with SUD included increasing access to treatment including telehealth, development of peer support groups, availability of mental health resources, development of enhanced communication channels between providers and patients, and systematic changes  Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic, overdose deaths have dramatically increased  As the short-term and long-term effects of the pandemic become more apparent, swift and comprehensive responses and policies must be enacted  This study provides insight from healthcare providers on the effects of the pandemic for persons with SUD  Many preexisting issues remain unresolved (e g  stigma and healthcare disparities), and now the pandemic has presented new obstacles as noted by the providers  The findings from this study provide implications for important discussion regarding the development of strategies for substance use treatment and harm reduction","Shreffler, J.; Shreffler, M.; Murfree, J.

"Verbal memory is associated with adherence to COVID-19 protective behaviors in community dwelling older adults","BACKGROUND: Adherence to protective behaviors is central to limiting the spread of COVID-19 and associated risk of serious illness and mortality in older populations  Whether cognition predicts adherence to protective behaviors has not been examined in older adults  AIMS: To examine whether specific cognitive abilities predict adherence to COVID-19 protective behaviors in older adults, independent of other relevant factors  METHODS: Data from 431 older adults (i e , &gt;= 65 years) who took part in the COVID-19 module of the Health and Retirement Study were included in the present study  Separate binary logistic regression models were used to examine whether performance on measures of immediate and delayed recall and working memory predicted adherence to COVID-19 protective behaviors, controlling for demographics, level of COVID-19 concern, depressive symptoms, and medical conditions  RESULTS: For every unit increase in immediate and delayed recall, the probability of adhering to COVID-19 protective behaviors increased by 47% and 69%, respectively  There was no association between the measure of working memory and adherence  DISCUSSION: It is of public interest to understand the factors that reduce adherence to protective behaviors so that we can better protect those most vulnerable and limit community spread  Our findings demonstrate that reduced memory predicts non-adherence to COVID-19 protective behaviors, independent of virus concern, and other relevant demographic and health factors  CONCLUSIONS: Public health strategies aimed at increasing adherence to COVID-19 protective behaviors in community dwelling older adults, should account for the role of reduced cognitive function in limiting adherence","O'Shea, D.

"Attitudes of a geriatric population towards risks about COVID-19 pandemic: in the context of anxiety and depression","Abstract Background A curfew for elderly people was announced in Turkey to protect the geriatric population during the COVID-19 pandemic  Although this may have the beneficial effect of preventing infection, psychological distress may also increase with prolongation of the pandemic  Methods Geriatric patients were interviewed by telephone due to the ongoing curfew  Demographical characteristics, comorbidities, personal risk perception of COVID-19, common concerns related to COVID-19, and experiences of delayed hospital admission due to the pandemic were recorded  The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to assess psychological distress, anxiety, and depression  Results Participants (n =?136;82 females, 60 3%) had a mean age of 73 4?Â±?5 9?years  The most common comorbidity was hypertension (75%)  Approximately 80% of the participants reported a decrease in physical activity during the curfew period  The HADS scores indicated rates of anxiety as 25 7% and depression as 16 9%  Anxiety was significantly more common in females than males (PÂ =?0 002)  Sleep problems (PÂ =?0 000), fatigue (PÂ =?0 000), and hopelessness (PÂ =?0 000) were more common in participants with depression and anxiety  Logistic regression analyses showed an association between a delay in hospital admission and the presence of depression (PÂ =?0 0029, R2Â =?0 146)  Personal risk perception of COVID-19 was statistically significantly higher among patients with anxiety (PÂ =?0 0027, R2Â =?0 157)  Conclusion Decreased adaptation to external and internal factors among older individuals may facilitate unfavourable outcomes of the pandemic  These results indicate that the geriatric population was mentally and physically affected by the restrictions and isolation","Yurumez Korkmaz, Busra, Gemci, Emine, Cosarderelioglu, Caglar, Yigit, Seher, Atmis, Volkan, Yalcin, Ahmet, Varli, Murat, Aras, Sevgi","https://doi.org/10.1111/psyg.12731","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Psychogeriatrics; n/a(n/a), 2021.; Publication details: Psychogeriatrics; n/a(n/a), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-19","",15120,""
"The use of cleaning products and its relationship with the increasing health risks during the Covid-19 pandemic","ABSTRACT Objective The present study aimed to determine the factors affecting the use of cleaning products at the home environment and the frequency of problems during the COVID-19 pandemic  Materials and Methods This cross-sectional research was performed online between 30 08 2020 and 15 09 2020  The population of the study consisted of adults aged between 18 and 80 years, affected by the COVID-19 pandemic  Data collection forms (Introductory Information and Risk Perception Form and Cleaning Products Usage Characteristics Form) were shared through Web2 tools  The questionnaire study was completed with 674 participants between the ages of 18 and 80 years in Turkey  Descriptive statistics and classification tree were used in the analysis of the data  Statistical significance was accepted as p=0 01 in all analyses  Results During the pandemic period compared to the pre-pandemic period, it was observed that the frequency of cleaning (69 3%) and the amount of cleaning product usage (74 2%) increased significantly and the frequency of problems related to the use of cleaning products was found as 46 9%  The most common reported problems were skin disturbances (68%) and shortness of breath (23%)  It was determined that the history of contact with the COVID-19 patient, the perceived risk of COVID-19 infection and risky cleaning behavior were predictive in determining the risk of experiencing problems related to cleaning products  The amount of bleach consumed per month among who did experience problems was higher than those who did not experience problems and was associated with the perceived risk of COVID-19 infection  Conclusion In the COVID-19 pandemic, human beings have been found to increase the frequency of cleaning and using cleaning products  In order to reduce the negative effects of chemicals used for cleaning on human and environmental health, the trainings to be given by the teams providing primary health care services can be effective as well as general education activities for community groups","Koksoy Vayisoglu, Sumbule, Oncu, Emine","https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14534","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: International Journal of Clinical Practice; n/a(n/a):e14534, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Clinical Practice; n/a(n/a):e14534, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-19","",15121,""

"Eating behavior and determinants of weight gain in French adults during the COVID-19 lockdown: perceived trends (Coviprev, 2020)","Introduction - To cope with the COVID-19 pandemic in France, a lockdown of the population was instituted from 17 March to 11 May 2020, causing a disruption of daily routines for many people  From the start of this lockdown, Sante publique France set up a survey to monitor health behaviors (CoviPrev)  This article presents the results on the perceived change in eating behaviors relative to before lockdown and the determinants of weight gain  Methods - Two independent samples each composed of 2,000 people aged 18 and over living in metropolitan France were interviewed online during the third (W3, 5th week of lockdown) and sixth (W6, 8th week of lockdown) survey waves while in lockdown  In W3, the reported changes in eating behavior, sports activity and body weight were analyzed in a descriptive manner  Logistic regressions were performed to assess factors associated with weight gain  Possible changes in snacking and body weight were estimated by rewinding questions related to these variables in W6 and comparing to W3 data by Chi-square tests  Results - Among the W3 respondents, 37% reported having ""modified their diet"" without difference according to sex  Women were however more likely than men to report a change in some behaviors: they cooked and nibbled more, consumed more products high in fat, sugar or salt (HFSS), had more or less appetite, paid more attention to their weight  Most behaviors studied were impacted for 25 to 40% of respondents: for example, 37% of participants reported cooking homemade meals more often than usual  Among the W3 respondents, 27% reported weight gain and 11% reported weight loss  No significant association was observed between weight gain and age or gender, but positive associations were observed with perceiving one's financial situation as difficult, eating more than usual, snacking more, having more appetite, having reduced fruit and vegetable consumption, increased HFSS products, less sports activity, having depression disorders and sleep disorders  Among the W6 respondents, 27% reported more snacking vs 22% in W3 and 36% reported weight gain vs 27% in W3  Conclusion - This study highlights an impact of lockdown on several eating behaviors, especially for women  While this context may have increased home cooking, other unhealthy changes occurred such as increased snacking and weight gain  These results suggest that repeated lockdowns could worsen health issues such as diet related non communicable diseases  Therefore eating behaviors and body weight need to be monitored, and public health measures must be supported to encourage or sustain healthy eating habits","Delamaire, C.; Sarda, B.; Ducrot, P.; Verdot, C.; Deschamps, V.; Serry, A.

"Psoriasis","Psoriasis is a common, chronic papulosquamous skin disease occurring worldwide, presenting at any age, and leading to a substantial burden for individuals and society. It is associated with several important medical conditions, including depression, psoriatic arthritis, and cardiometabolic syndrome. Its most common form, chronic plaque or psoriasis vulgaris, is a consequence of genetic susceptibility, particularly in the presence of the HLA-C*06:02 risk allele, and of environmental triggers such as streptococcal infection, stress, smoking, obesity, and alcohol consumption. There are several phenotypes and research has separated pustular from chronic plaque forms. Immunological and genetic studies have identified IL-17 and IL-23 as key drivers of psoriasis pathogenesis. Immune targeting of these cytokines and of TNF&#945; by biological therapies has revolutionised the care of severe chronic plaque disease. Psoriasis cannot currently be cured, but management should aim to minimise physical and psychological harm by treating patients early in the disease process, identifying and preventing associated multimorbidity, instilling lifestyle modifications, and employing a personalised approach to treatment.","Griffiths, Christopher E M; Armstrong, April W; Gudjonsson, Johann E; Barker, Jonathan N W N","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32549-6","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Lancet;397(10281): 1301-1315, 2021 Apr 03.; Publication details: Lancet;397(10281): 1301-1315, 2021 Apr 03.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-19","",15133,""

"The use of Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) to address causality in complex systems: a systematic review of research on public health interventions","BACKGROUND: Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) is a method for identifying the configurations of conditions that lead to specific outcomes. Given its potential for providing evidence of causality in complex systems, QCA is increasingly used in evaluative research to examine the uptake or impacts of public health interventions. We map this emerging field, assessing the strengths and weaknesses of QCA approaches identified in published studies, and identify implications for future research and reporting. METHODS: PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were systematically searched for peer-reviewed studies published in English up to December 2019 that had used QCA methods to identify the conditions associated with the uptake and/or effectiveness of interventions for public health. Data relating to the interventions studied (settings/level of intervention/populations), methods (type of QCA, case level, source of data, other methods used) and reported strengths and weaknesses of QCA were extracted and synthesised narratively. RESULTS: The search identified 1384 papers, of which 27 (describing 26 studies) met the inclusion criteria. Interventions evaluated ranged across: nutrition/obesity (n = 8); physical activity (n = 4); health inequalities (n = 3); mental health (n = 2); community engagement (n = 3); chronic condition management (n = 3); vaccine adoption or implementation (n = 2); programme implementation (n = 3); breastfeeding (n = 2), and general population health (n = 1). The majority of studies (n = 24) were of interventions solely or predominantly in high income countries. Key strengths reported were that QCA provides a method for addressing causal complexity; and that it provides a systematic approach for understanding the mechanisms at work in implementation across contexts. Weaknesses reported related to data availability limitations, especially on ineffective interventions. The majority of papers demonstrated good knowledge of cases, and justification of case selection, but other criteria of methodological quality were less comprehensively met. CONCLUSION: QCA is a promising approach for addressing the role of context in complex interventions, and for identifying causal configurations of conditions that predict implementation and/or outcomes when there is sufficiently detailed understanding of a series of comparable cases. As the use of QCA in evaluative health research increases, there may be a need to develop advice for public health researchers and journals on minimum criteria for quality and reporting.","Hanckel, Benjamin; Petticrew, Mark; Thomas, James; Green, Judith","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10926-2","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMC Public Health;21(1): 877, 2021 05 07.; Publication details: BMC Public Health;21(1): 877, 2021 05 07.; Population Health; Public Health; Causality; Exercise; Humans; Mental Health; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-19","",15135,""
"Potential impact of a COVID-19 and smoking paper on Twitter users' attitudes toward smoking: Observational Study","BACKGROUND: A cross-sectional study conducted by French researchers showed that the rate of current daily smoking was significantly lower in COVID-19 patients than in the French general population. OBJECTIVE: We aim to examine the dissemination of this Miyara et al. study among Twitter users and whether a shift in their attitudes towards smoking occurred after its publication on April 21st, 2020. METHODS: Twitter posts were crawled between April 14th and May 4th, 2020 by the Tweepy stream API, using a COVID-19 related keyword query. After filtering, the final 1,929 tweets were classified into three groups: 1) tweets not related to Miyara et al. study before it was published; 2) tweets not related to Miyara et al. study after it was published; 3) tweets related to Miyara et al. study after it was published. The tweets' attitudes towards smoking were compared among the above three groups using multinomial logistic regression models in statistical analysis software R. RESULTS: The temporal analysis showed a peak in the number of tweets discussing the results from the Miyara et al. study right after its publication. Multinomial logistic regression models on sentiment scores showed the proportion of negative attitudes toward smoking in tweets related to Miyara et al. study after it was published (17.07%) was significantly lower than tweets not related to the Miyara et al. study either before (34.92%, P < 0.001) or after the Miyara et al. study was published (34.34%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The public's attitude toward smoking shifted in a positive direction after the Miyara et al. study found a lower incidence of COVID-19 cases in daily smokers.","Tao, Chunliang; Diaz, Destiny; Xie, Zidian; Chen, Long; Li, Dongmei; O' Connor, Richard","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/25010","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;2021 Apr 22.; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;2021 Apr 22.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-19","",15136,""

"Legal exploration of right to health","The right to health is recognised as a fundamental human right in the World Health Organisation (WHO) Constitution  In Malaysia, the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health is a fundamental human right without discrimination for every human being  Consequently, the principle of the ""right to health,"" regardless of the legal status of an individual, is the driving force in creating acceptable standards of health care for all citizens  Even for individual who suffers from Covid-19, he still has a fundamental right to health  The issue of the right to health is whether the patients have any rights of their health?

"Order out of chaos: Sense of coherence and the mediating role of coping resources in explaining mental health during COVID-19 in 7 countries","In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and the universal chaos created by it, this study explores the role of sense of coherence (Soc, Antonovsky, 1979) and how it enables coping with a stressful situation and staying well  SOC is a generalized orientation which allows one to perceive the world as comprehensible, manageable, and meaningful  In an attempt to understand â€˜how does the SOC workâ€™ we employed the salutogenic assumption that a strong SOC allows one to reach out in any given situation and find those resources appropriate to the specific stressor  Thus, we hypothesized that the positive impact of SOC on mental health outcomes would be mediated through coping resources that are particularly salient in times of crisis  One resource is related to the micro level (perceived family support) and the other concerns the macro level (trust in leaders and social-political institutions)  Data collection was conducted in different countries during Mayâ€“June 2020 via online platforms  The data included 7 samples of adult participants (age 18â€“90) from Israel (nÂ <U+200B>=Â <U+200B>669), Italy (nÂ <U+200B>=Â <U+200B>899), Spain (nÂ <U+200B>=Â <U+200B>476), Germany (nÂ <U+200B>=Â <U+200B>708), Austria (nÂ <U+200B>=Â <U+200B>1026), Switzerland (nÂ <U+200B>=Â <U+200B>147), and the U S  (nÂ <U+200B>=Â <U+200B>506)  The questionnaires included standard tools (MHC-SF, SOC-13) as well as questionnaires of perceived family support and trust that were adapted to the pandemic context  As expected, SOC was associated with mental health in all the samples  Perceived family support and trust in leaders and social-political institutions mediated the relationships between SOC and mental health, controlling for age, gender, and level of financial risk  It appears that SOC has a universal meaning, not limited by cultural and situational characteristics  The discussion focuses on the theoretical, social, and political applications of the salutogenic model â€“ and its core concept of SOC â€“ in the context of coping with a global pandemic across different cultural contexts and countries","Mana, A.; Bauer, G.

"Treating two pandemics for the price of one: Chronic and infectious disease impacts of the built and natural environment","Compact walkable environments with greenspace support physical activity and reduce the risk for depression and several obesity-related chronic diseases, including diabetes and heart disease  Recent evidence confirms that these chronic diseases increase the severity of COVID-19 infection and mortality risk  Conversely, denser transit supportive environments may increase risk of exposure to COVID-19 suggesting the potential for contrasting chronic versus infectious disease impacts of community design  A handful of recent studies have examined links between density and COVID-19 mortality rates reporting conflicting results  Population density has been used as a surrogate of urban form to capture the degree of walkability and public transit versus private vehicle travel demand  The current study employs a broader range of built environment features (density, design, and destination accessibility) and assesses how chronic disease mediates the relationship between built and natural environment and COVID-19 mortality  Negative and significant relationships are observed between built and natural environment features and COVID-19 mortality when accounting for the mediating effect of chronic disease  Findings underscore the importance of chronic disease when assessing relationships between COVID-19 mortality and community design  Based on a rigorous simulation-assisted random parameter path analysis framework, we further find that the relationships between COVID-19 mortality, obesity, and key correlates exhibit significant heterogeneity  Ignoring this heterogeneity in highly aggregate spatial data can lead to incorrect conclusions with regards to the relationship between built environment and COVID-19 transmission  Results presented here suggest that creating walkable environments with greenspace is associated with reduced risk of chronic disease and/or COVID-19 infection and mortality","Frank, Lawrence D.; Wali, Behram","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2021.103089","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Sustainable Cities and Society;: 103089, 2021.; Publication details: Sustainable Cities and Society;: 103089, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-19","",15145,""
"Coping with the COVID-19 pandemic: contemplative practice behaviors are associated with better mental health outcomes and compliance with Shelter-In-Place orders in a prospective cohort study","Psychosocial health can influence the development and experience of several chronic diseases, and has been negatively affected for many individuals amid the COVID-19 global pandemic  To understand the impact of contemplative practices on emotional and mental health during COVID-19, the Stanford WELL for Life Study (US component), incorporated a series of additional surveys into its ongoing study  A total of 1,097 participants residing in California who responded to at least one of three COVID-19 surveys were included in this analysis  Linear and generalized mixed-effects regression models were used to investigate relationships between individual contemplative practice behaviors (CPB) (embodied observing meditation, non-reactive mindfulness meditation, self-compassion cultivation, cultivation of compassion for others) and four psychosocial outcomes measured in the original WELL questionnaire (resilience, dealing with stress, positive emotions, and negative emotions)  In addition, the associations between CPB and depression, distress, and compliance with local Shelter-In-Place orders were also investigated  Participants who engaged in any contemplative practice reported significantly more resilience and positive emotions, dealing better with stress, lower distress, and were less likely to report an experience with depression in the last week  Similar findings held when CPB was modeled as a continuous variable  Significant interactions between the duration of the SIP and CPB were also observed for resilience and SIP compliance outcomes, indicating that steeper declines were observed among participants with little or no CPB across the study period  Further investigation into the potential protective benefits of CPB during times of major disruption and uncertainty is warranted","Chrisinger, Benjamin W.; Rich, Tia, Lounsbury, David, Peng, Katy, Zhang, Janice, Heaney, Catherine A.; Lu, Ying, Hsing, Ann W.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2021.101451","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Preventive Medicine Reports;: 101451, 2021.; Publication details: Preventive Medicine Reports;: 101451, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-19","",15146,""
"Exploring variables related to medical surrogate decision-making accuracy during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objective Surrogate medical decision making is common in the United States healthcare system  Variables that may influence surrogate decision making have been proposed  Little work has examined relations between these variables and outcomes of surrogate decision making  This study investigated whether surrogatesâ€™ characteristics, including their knowledge of treatment options, and interpersonal factors predicted surrogatesâ€™ accuracy and intervention selections  Specifically, predictor variables included: trust in the medical profession, trait-level anxiety, depression, anxiety about COVID-19, religiosity, perceived emotional support, understanding of treatment options, empathy, willingness to accept responsibility for medical decisions, reluctance to burden others, and perceived similarity between oneself and the patient  Methods 154 pairs of patients and their surrogates completed an online survey  Patients indicated preferred treatments in hypothetical decision scenarios  Surrogates indicated the treatment that they thought the patient would prefer  Results When taken all together in a predictive model, the variables significantly predicted surrogates' accuracy, F (6) = 3 03, R 2 = 12, p = 008  Variables also predicted selection of intensive interventions, F (4) = 5 95, R 2 = 14, p = 00  Surrogates reporting greater anxiety about COVID-19 selected more intensive interventions  Conclusions Consistent with prior research, this study found that surrogatesâ€™ characteristics influence the interventions they choose, with anxiety about COVID-19 having considerable bearing on their chosen interventions  Practice Implications These findings can inform development of decision-making interventions to improve surrogatesâ€™ accuracy  Providers may attend to variables highlighted by this study to support surrogates, particularly within the stressful context of COVID-19 and possible future pandemics","Spalding, Rachael L.; Edelstein, Barry","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2021.06.011","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Patient Education and Counseling;2021.; Publication details: Patient Education and Counseling;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-19","",15147,""
"COVID-19 Associated Suicidal Ideation in Older Adults: Two Case Reports with a Review of the Literature","ABSTRACT The COVID-19 pandemic may profoundly harm the mental health and emotional well- being of many older adults  Public health interventions to minimize the spread of the virus have had the unintended consequences of worsening social isolation, financial stress, and unemployment  Results of early research efforts assessing the impact of these interventions on the mental health of older adults have been mixed  Available findings suggest that a subset of community-dwelling older adults have been less negatively impacted than younger adults, while people of color, the poor, residents of nursing homes and other communal living environments, and those living with dementia and their caregivers are more likely to suffer from COVID-related health problems  This manuscript describes two older adults for whom COVID-19 associated stresses caused significant worsening in their psychiatric illnesses, including the emergence of suicidal ideation, summarizes the literature on the impact of interactions between psychosocial stresses and biological factors on the mental health and well-being of older adults, and discusses interventions to help older adults whose mental health has worsened due to COVID-19  Timely and accurate diagnosis, prompt provision of individualized care using both pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic interventions, adoption of new technologies that permit care to be provided safely at a distance and which allow for virtual social interactions, coupled with ongoing advocacy for policy changes that address significant health care disparities and provide older adults continued access to health care and relief from financial hardship, will help older adults remaining as healthy as possible during the pandemic","Asthana, Niraj K.; Mehaffey, Eamonn, Sewell, Daniel D.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2021.05.026","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry;2021.; Publication details: The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-19","",15148,""

"Early COVID-19 quarantine: A machine learning approach to model what differentiated the top 25% well-being scorers","This study focused on the interaction of demographics and well-being. Diener's subjective well-being (SWB) was successfully validated with Exploratory Graph Analysis and Confirmatory Factor Analysis to track well-being differences of the COVID-19 quarantined individuals. Six tree-based Machine Learning models were trained to classify top 25% SWB scorers during COVID-19 quarantine, after data-splitting (train 70%, test 30%). The model input variables were demographics, to avoid overlapping of inputs-outputs. A 10-fold cross-validation method (70%â€“30%) was then implemented in the training session to select the optimal Machine Learning model among the six tested. A CART classification was the optimal algorithm (Train-AccuracyÂ =Â 0.77, Test-AccuracyÂ =Â 0.75). A clean, three-node tree suggested that if someone spends time on perceived creative activities during the COVID-19 quarantine, under clearly described conditions, he/she had high probabilities to be a top subjective well-being scorer. The key importance of creative activities was subsequently cross-validated with three different model configurations: (1) a different tree-based model (Test-Accuracy =0.75); (2) a different operationalization of subjective well-being (Test-Accuracy =0.75) and (3) a different construct (depression; Test-Accuracy =0.73). This is an integrative approach to study individual differences in subjective well-being, bridging Exploratory Graph Analysis and Machine Learning in a single research cycle with multiples cross-validations.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.110980","20211001","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-19","",15161,""
