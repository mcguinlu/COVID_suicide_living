Its resilience to shocks is quite apparent. Since the outbreak of the pandemic in spring 2020, the sector preserved many jobs and created new ones, while its innovative and technological advances remained uninterrupted. This study â€“ based on surveys, statistical and other databases â€“ aims to take stock of the current state of the Hungarian space sector and industry, and to set out possible directions for state involvement to enhance further progress. Our research confirmed that the Hungarian space industry, although its direct contribution to social performance is moderate today, employs a significant number of highly skilled workers and introduces cuttingedge technologies. Furthermore, through its innovations and technological and scientific transfers, its contribution to the competitiveness of the Hungarian economy is significant, even at the current level of its capacities. With adequate support and wise investments, the added value, the growth and international potential and the global space industry value chain involvement the space industry can be exploited to a much greater extent than at present.","Parragh, Bianka, GusztÃ¡v, BÃ¡ger, KovÃ¡cs, ÃrpÃ¡d, TÃ³th, Gergely","https://doi.org/10.35551/PSZ_2021_1_2","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: PÃ©nzÃ¼gyi Szemle; 66(1):32-48, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33271,""

"Possible impact of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on suicide behavior among patients in Southeast Serbia","Individuals with serious mental illness are more affected by emotional reactions, including suicidal behavior due to COVID-19 and psychosocial consequences of pandemic. The current cross-sectional study aimed to explore the possible association of COVID-19 and suicidal behavior (suicide ideation and attempt) before and during pandemic-associated lockdown in Serbia. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of 104 adult psychiatric inpatients admitted at Psychiatric Clinic, University Clinic Center NiÅ¡, Serbia, after ending lockdown and compared the obtained results with 181 adult psychiatric inpatients admitted during the same period in 2019 and 2018. Suicide ideation were more frequent in 2020 comparing with 2019 and 2018 (25 vs 12.5%, vs 9.41%;p &lt; 0.05). Around 28% of patients with suicide attempts were exposed daily to the information related to COVID-19 coming from social media, while this frequency was significantly lower, only 7.55% (p &lt; 0.1), among patients with no suicide ideation or attempts. Adjustment disorder was more frequent among patients with suicide attempts in comparison to the patients with suicide ideation (32 vs 11%), especially in patients without suicide ideation and attempts (32 vs 0%, p &lt; 0.001). Of all studied patients with suicide attempts during 2020, 60% were not in the previous psychiatric treatment before admission.","Suzana Tosic, Golubovic, Zikic, Olivera, Nikolic, Gordana, Kostic, Jelena, Simonovic, Maja, Binic, Iva, Gugleta, Uros","https://doi.org/10.1515/med-2022-0488","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Open Medicine; 17(1):1045-1056, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33275,""

"Quality of life in the cirrhosis registry during the SARS-CoV-2 lockdown in Slovakia (preprint)","Introduction:  Liver cirrhosis is associated with a poor quality of life (QOL). The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic has led to several restriction measures and psychosocial consequences whose impact on QOL has combined with that of cirrhosis in an unknown way. Therefore, we have used our cirrhosis registry to assess quality of life before the pandemic (at the first admission to the tertiary liver unit) and during the most pronounced phase of the first lockdown. Materials:  and Methods: In this cross-sectional study conducted during the first lockdown in Slovakia (from April to May 2020), we have repeated the QOL measurement of QOL in cirrhotic patients previously enrolled in the RH7 registry. Of the entire RH7 cohort, we have identified patients who were alive (according to the national registry of deaths) and contacted them by phone with a structured and standardized interview led by trained professionals. The tool used for both QOL measurements (at enrolment to RH7 and during the lockdown) was standardized and validated EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) questionnaire. Results: : The study included 97 patients, of which 37 (38.1%) were women and 60 (61.9%) were men. Responses were achieved from 75 patients (68,18%). In general, patients have scored their quality of life significantly higher during the pandemic compared to examination at admission to RH7 (that is, on admission to our tertiary liver unit with cirrhosis) (p = 0.005). In particular, of the domains included in EQ-5D, I.) self-care was better during lockdown compared to the first record on admission to RH7 (p&lt;0.001);II.) the ability to perform daily activities has also improved during lockdown (p = 0.002);on the other hand, III.) pain and discomfort have not changed significantly during lockdown compared with previous measurement (p = 0.882), IV.) anxiety and depression were lower during lockdown compared to admission to RH7 (p = 0.01). Conclusion:  The quality of life in patients with liver cirrhosis was better during the lockdown of SARS-CoV-2 compared to the previous measurement at admission to the tertiary liver unit.","SkladanÃ½, LubomÃ­r, LÃ­Å¡ka, DÃ¡vid, LiptÃ¡kovÃ¡, Erika, TapajcikovÃ¡, Tatiana, VnencakovÃ¡, Janka, Koller, TomÃ¡Å¡","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1722546/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33277,""
"EQUIP Emergency: Can interventions to reduce racism, discrimination and stigma in EDs improve outcomes? (preprint)","Background:  Despite a publicly funded system, health care in Canada has been shown to be deeply inequitable, particularly toward Indigenous people. Based on research identifying key dimensions of equity-oriented health care as being cultural safety, harm reduction and trauma- and violence-informed care, an intervention to promote equity at the organizational level was tested in primary health care, refined and adapted, and tested in Emergency Departments (EDs). Methods:  In partnership with clinical, community and Indigenous leaders in three diverse EDs in one Canadian province, we supported direct care staff to tailor and implement the intervention. Intervention activities varied in type and intensity at each site. Survey data were collected pre- and post-intervention from every consecutive patient over age 18 presenting to the EDs (n= 4771) with 3315 completing post-visit questions in 4 waves at two sites and 3 waves (due to pandemic constraints) at the third. Administrative data were collected for 12 months pre- and 12 months post-intervention. Results:  Throughout the study period, the participating EDs were dealing with a worsening epidemic of overdoses and deaths related to a toxic drug supply, and the COVID 19 pandemic curtailed both intervention activities and data collection. Despite these constraints, staff at two of the EDs mounted equity-oriented intervention strategies;the other site was experiencing continued, significant staff shortages and leadership changeover. Longitudinal analysis using multiple regression showed non-significant but encouraging trends in patient perceptions of quality of care and patient experiences of discrimination in the ED. Subgroup analysis showed that specific groups of patients experienced care in significantly different ways at each site. An interrupted time series of administrative data showed no significant change in staff sick time, but showed a significant decrease in the percentage of patients who left without care being completed at the site with the most robust intervention activities. Conclusions:  The trends in patient perceptions and the significant decrease in the percentage of patients who left without care being completed suggest potential for impact. Realization of this potential will depend on readiness, commitment and resources at the organizational and systems levels.

"COVID-19 and its prevention in internally displaced person (IDP) camps in Somalia: Impact on livelihood, food security and mental health (preprint)","Background:  Somalia has over 2.6 million internally displaced people (IDP) that depend on daily wages and humanitarian assistance for their livelihoods. This study investigated the impact of COVID-19 on livelihoods, food security and mental health of Somaliaâ€™s IDPs. Methods A questionnaire was conducted with â€œbreadwinnersâ€ (n = 585) residing in one of 15 randomly selected IDP camps. Mental health was assessed using the 5-item World Health Organization Wellbeing Index (WHO-5) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Multivariable regression was used to explore the effect of depressive symptoms on soap use and ability to pay for food/medicine/rent Results Knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms, transmission and prevention was relatively high, however only 55% reported using soap for hand-washing. Around one third perceived that prohibition of public gatherings had negatively impacted weekly earnings. Participants reported difficulty buying food (85%), medicine (82%) and paying rent (51%) because of COVID-19. The majority were assessed as having low wellbeing and high depressive symptoms (mean WHO-5 = 44.2/100;mean PHQ-9 = 18.6/27), with most (74%) indicating that they felt worse than before the pandemic. Compared to people with low depressive symptoms, people with high depressive symptoms were less likely to use soap (aOR = 0.3, 95% CI = 0.2, 0.7;P &lt; 0.001) and more likely to report difficulty buying food (aOR = 2.2;95% CI = 1.1, 4.3;P = 0.02). Conclusions COVID-19 and associated restrictions have negatively impacted Somaliaâ€™s internally displaced population. Livelihood and mental health support is urgently needed in the recovery phase of the pandemic and should be factored into future pandemic planning.","Mumin, Farah Isse, Wesonga, Fred, Handuleh, Jibril I.

"Intersecting substance use treatment and harm reduction services: Exploring the characteristics and service-needs of a community-based sample of people who use drugs (preprint)","Background:  Substance use treatment and harm reduction services are essential components of comprehensive strategies for reducing the harms of drug use and overdose. However, these services have been historically siloed, and there is a need to better understand how programs that serve people who use drugs (PWUD) are integrating these services. In this study, we compared treatment and harm reduction services offered by a multistate sample of substance use service providers and assessed how well they align with characteristics and needs of clients they serve early in the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: : We recruited a convenience sample of programs that deliver harm reduction and/or treatment services in 10 states. Program directors participated in a survey assessing the services offered at their program. We also recruited clients of these programs to participate in a survey assessing a range of sociodemographic and health characteristics, substance use behaviors, and health service utilization. We then cross-compared client characteristics and behaviors relative to services being offered through these programs. Results: : We collected and analyzed data from 511 clients attending 18 programs which either offered treatment with medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) (N=6), syringe service programs (SSP) (N=8), or both MOUD and SSP (N=4). All programs delivered a range of treatment and harm reduction services, with MOUD+SSP programs delivering the greatest breadth of services. There were discrepancies between services provided and characteristics and behaviors reported by clients: 80% of clients of programs that offered MOUD without SSP actively used drugs and 50% injected drugs;40% of clients of programs that offered SSP without MOUD sought drug treatment services. Approximately half of clients were unemployed and unstably housed, but few programs offered direct social services. Conclusions: : In many ways, existing programs are not meeting the service needs of PWUD. Investing in innovative models that empower clients and integrate a range of accessible and flexible treatment, harm reduction and social services can pave the way for a more effective and equitable service system that considers the long-term health of PWUD.","Krawczyk, Noa, Allen, Sean, Schneider, Kristin, Solomon, Keisha, Shah, Hridika, Morris, Miles, Harris, Samantha, Sherman, Susan, Saloner, Brendan","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1693969/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33280,""
"A Systematic Review & Metaethnography of the lived experiences of long COVID patients (preprint)","Background:  â€˜Long Covidâ€™ is the term used to signify signs and symptoms that emerge or develop after acute COVID-19. It constitutes both ongoing symptomatic COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 symptoms. Symptoms of â€œlong COVIDâ€ include fatigue, muscle weakness, sleep difficulties, anxiety and depression, amongst other physiological signs of illness. While previous studies have highlighted the symptoms and epidemiological characteristics of â€˜long COVIDâ€™, the implications of â€˜long COVIDâ€™ extend well into the mental well-being of the patients, affecting their everyday lives. The present systematic review and meta-ethnography attempt to reveal deeper insights from the lived experiences of long COVID patients, which has clinical implications for improving future care and formulating clinical guidelines for future use. Methods:  and analysis: We performed a systematic review and meta-ethnography on the lived experiences of â€œlong COVIDâ€ patients using Reciprocal Translation Analysis (RTA), Refutation Analysis, and Line-of-Argument synthesis. Electronic databases of EMBASE (Ovid), AMED (Ovid), HMIC (Ovid), BNI (ProQuest), CINAHL(EBSCO), EMCORE(Ovid), PsycINFO(ProQuest), Medline/PubMed, Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics) and Google Scholar were searched using a combination free texts and MeSH terms. A combination of the terms â€œlong COVIDâ€ AND â€œsurvivorsâ€ AND â€œlived experiencesâ€ with their corresponding synonyms were used as a search strategy. Further, we limited search results to peer-reviewed primary studies published in the English language from 2019 till May 18th, 2021. Citation tracking, footnote chasing, bibliography scanning, and citation alerts (on the web of science) were further performed to create a comprehensive search. The retrieved search results were managed on the COVIDENCE platform, where eligible studies were identified after screening the articles based upon preidentified eligibility criteria. The quality of the eligible studies was further assessed through critical appraisal using the CASP Tool for Qualitative Studies. Findings:  1120 articles were retrieved from the search strategy, of which 774 unique articles were subjected to title & abstract screening after removing the duplicates. Furthermore, a full-text review of eligible studies after title & abstract screening was performed to ultimately include 6 studies that matched the eligibility criteria for this review. Based on the analysis of the critical appraisal, no studies were rejected. The majority of the studies were from the UK, with the study population skewed towards white British ethnicity and mostly female participants. The meta-ethnography attuned to a lifeworld perspective revealed four key themes: struggle & strife over self-identity;searching for a shared identity & belongingness;uncertainty & mistrust of the care system;seeking reassurance from others. The long covid patients were in a state of confusion with their illness symptoms and sought reassurance from the caring professionals when confronted with a loss of self-identity due to illness. Helplessness, frustration, anxiety, and depression affected the participants, resulting in the depreciation of their self-esteem. Uncertainty overdiagnosis of the illness symptoms along with limited face-to-face interaction with caring professionals led the participants to a state of helplessness and a resilient search for online support groups with similar symptoms. In a nutshell, this study revealed a state of constant struggle and strife over the self-identity of participants, along with an urge to belong back to the lifeworld. Conclusions: : The present study offers key insights into the lives of long-covid patients and can be especially helpful in formulating future clinical guidelines for long-covid patients. The uncertainty over symptoms and diagnosis of long COVID is affecting the general population and healthcare professionals alike. Understanding the lifeworld of long-COVID patients could allow clinicians to create customize self-care plans for them and provide an opportunity for improvement in their psychosocial health in these uncertain times.","Bhattacharjee, Priyadarshini, Nath, Shoily","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.pex-1897/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33281,""
"Much research, but little learned to date: A scoping review of the methodological quality of research on mental health of healthcare professionals in low- and lower-middle income countries (preprint)","Background:  SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in widespread awareness of health workersâ€™ work realities and their mental health impacts, and corresponding unprecedented research effort. Reviews of the quantitative literature on mental health of clinical skilled healthcare personnel in low- and lower-middle income countries (LLMIC), however, point at quality issues in the pre-pandemic literature. We used the evidence generated in the context of one pre-pandemic review to understand methodological strengths and weaknesses in detail, with the aim of distilling recommendations for future research. Methods: : Our study used the literature identified in a systematic search up to the end of 2020, in English or French language, in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, Global Health, and CAIRN. Following a scoping review approach, we extracted and charted data on key study characteristics as well as on study quality. In regard to the latter, we developed nine quality criteria on the basis of existing quality checklists, but expanding on issues of particular relevance to the measurement and interpretation of levels of mental health or illness. We collated the charted data in descriptive fashion. Results: : We included data from 152 studies, assessing a range of mental health outcomes, with a focus on burnout. Most studies were conducted in India, Nigeria, Pakistan, or Egypt, in urban secondary- and tertiary-care settings. We judged only 20% of studies as of high quality due to shortcomings particularly regarding sample representativeness, context-specific measurement tool validity, and reporting of methodological detail. Conclusion:  We conclude that despite its impressive size, we can learn comparatively little from the body of literature up to the end of 2020 due to limitations in quality. Based on our findings, we outline areas for expansion, methodological improvement, and standardization of reporting in future research.

"Changes in the utilisation of acute hospital care in Ireland during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 (preprint)","Background:  Reduced and delayed presentations for non-COVID-19 illness during the COVID-19 pandemic have implications for population health and health systems. The aim of this study is to quantify and characterise changes in acute hospital healthcare utilisation in Ireland during the first wave of COVID-19 to inform healthcare system planning and recovery. Methods: A retrospective, population-based, observational study was conducted using two national datasets, Patient Experience Time (PET) and Hospital In-Patient Enquiry (HIPE). The study period was 6th January to 5th July 2020. Results: Comparison between time periods pre- and post-onset of the COVID-19 pandemic within 2020 showed there were 81,712 fewer Emergency Department (ED) presentations (-18.8%), 19,692 fewer admissions from ED (-17.4%) and 210,357 fewer non-COVID-19 hospital admissions (-35.0%) than expected based on pre-COVID-19 activity. Reductions were greatest at the peak of population-level restrictions, at extremes of age and for elective admissions. In the period immediately following the first wave, acute hospital healthcare utilisation remained below pre-COVID-19 levels, however, there were increases in emergency alcohol-related admissions (Rate Ratio 1.22, 95% CI 1.03, 1.43, p-value 0.016), admissions with self-harm (Rate Ratio 1.39, 95% CI 1.01, 1.91, p-value 0.043) and mental health admissions (Rate Ratio 1.28, 95% CI 1.03, 1.60, p-value 0.028). Discussion: While public health implications of delayed and lost care will only become fully apparent over time, recovery planning must begin immediately. In the short-term, backlogs in care need to be managed and population health impacts of COVID-19 and associated restrictions, particularly in relation to mental health and alcohol, need to be addressed through strong public health and health system responses. In the long-term, COVID-19 highlights health system weakness and is an opportunity to progress health system reform to deliver a universal, high-quality, sustainable and resilient health system, capable of meeting population health needs and responding to future pandemics.","Marron, Louise, Burke, Sara, Kavanagh, Paul","https://doi.org/10.12688/hrbopenres.13307.2","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33283,""
"A quantitative study exploringÂ theÂ acceptance of theÂ eHealthÂ model forÂ mentalÂ wellness amongÂ digital workers (preprint)","Background:  Â eHealth makes use of information and communication technologies (ICT) to improve health. In the digital age, the use of eHealth applications and other health-related applications has gained popularity,Â particularlyÂ during theÂ COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the pandemic, many uncertainties haveÂ arisen, causing stress andÂ affecting the mental health of many skilled workers in the digital industry, particularly in the ICT, computing, and creative media industries.Â eHealthÂ applicationsÂ haveÂ the potential to benefit people's health. As a prerequisite for effective implementation of eHealth for mental wellness (EHMW), this paper examines the acceptance of EHMW amongÂ digital workersÂ in Malaysia.Â  The objectives of this research are two-fold:Â 1) To explore the acceptance of EHMW amongÂ digital workersÂ in a localÂ Premier Digital Tech InstitutionÂ (PDTI), and 2)Â To explore how these talents' demographic profiles, mental health literacy and workplace wellness influence their acceptance of EHMW.Â Â  Methods:Â This research surveyedÂ 41Â digital workersÂ who played vital roles in providing digital skills at a tertiary education level.Â Â Â  Results:Â MostÂ respondentsÂ agreed that eHealthÂ was appropriate for managing mental wellness. Among the three eHealth domainsÂ for managing mental wellness, the acceptance level is the highest for the application domain of ""interacting for health"",Â with maleÂ respondentsÂ more likely to accept the use ofÂ EHMW.Â  Conclusions:Â This small-scale survey could not fully examine theÂ acceptance ofÂ eHealth andÂ itsÂ usage patterns for mental wellness amongÂ digital workersÂ in Malaysia. Future research will target moreÂ digital workersÂ in Malaysia.Â This research addresses the research gap onÂ theÂ eHealth perspectives ofÂ digital workersÂ on their acceptance,Â and the potential influence of demographic profiles, mental health literacy, and workplace wellness on EHMW's acceptance of digital health tools/platforms to promote their mental wellness.","Tan, Choon Hong, Koo, Ah Choo, Rahmat, Hawa, Siew, Wei Fern, Cheang, Alexius Weng Onn, Amir Sharji, Elyna","https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.73482.2","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33284,""
"Media coverage and speculation about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicide: A content analysis of UK news (preprint)","Rationale: Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been much concern and speculation about rises in suicide rates, despite evidence that suicides did not in fact increase in the first year of the pandemic in most countries with real-time suicide data. This public narrative is potentially harmful, as well as misleading, and is likely to be perpetuated by sensational news coverage. Method: We conducted a systematic analysis of UK news coverage (including opinion pieces) on the impact of COVID-19 on suicidality, to examine the content and quality of such reporting as the pandemic developed, and as different coronavirus restrictions were imposed. Results: We identified 372 stories about COVID-19 and suicidality in online and print news between the first UK lockdown (March 2020) and May 2021 (when restrictions were significantly eased in the UK). Throughout this period, over a third of articles (39.2%) and headlines (41.4%) claimed or predicted a rise in suicide, often attributed to feelings of entrapment and poor mental health (especially amongst young people), and fueled by expert commentary and speculation. Almost a third of reports were rated as being of poor overall quality (116, 31.2%), and at least half included no signposting to help and support. However, reporting improved in phases of less stringent COVID-19 restrictions and over time, with later articles and headlines including fewer negative statements and predictions about rises in suicides, and greater reliance on academic evidence. Conclusions: As the longer-term consequences of the pandemic develop, and other national and global events unfold, it is increasingly important that the media, and the wider community of experts shaping its narratives, strive for a positive and evidence-informed approach to news coverage of suicide.","Marzano, Lisa, Hawley, Monica, Fraser, Lorna, Lainez, Yasmine, Marsh, James, Hawton, Keith","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.10.22275998","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33285,""
"The effect of potential factors on all-cause and cause-specific and mortality: a pre-COVID-19 period review (preprint)","Background About 3 million people die every year in USA. In order to provide a general direction and background for subsequent research and development in this field, we reviewed the studies about impact of potential factors associated with the main causes of mortality and all-cause mortality. Method Researches are selected by PubMed website for last 15 years with published language of English. The leading cause of death were published by CDC in 2020 (excluded COVID-19) including the ten natural mortalities and unnatural mortality. We summarized the potential factors associated with the mortality and sorted them by â€œpositive/negative effectâ€ and â€œlong-term/short-term effectâ€. Result Among risk factors, the factors of depression, unhealthy diet, overweight and obesity and other similar factors increase the mortality of main leading natural causes. Among protective factors, the factors of physical activity, nut intake, chocolate consumption were associated with the reduced mortality of multiple diseases. We also found that some factors possess bidirectional influence on different diseases or even one disease. The gender of female negatively affects mortality of diabetes, but positively affects cardiovascular diseases. The majority of air pollutants are risk factors for respiratory diseases while ozone possibly reduce the mortality. Conclusion Our review summarized various factors which have positive/negative and long-term/short-term effects on the main mortality of cause-specific and all-caused mortality. Further study is required to investigate the contribution of different variable on mortality.","Xu, Jia, Lin, Yunkai, Tong, Jianyu, Zhou, Ying","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.08.22276123","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33286,""
"Non-pharmacological therapies for post-viral syndromes, including Long COVID: A systematic review (preprint)","Background:  Post-viral syndromes (PVS), including Long COVID, are symptoms sustained from weeks to years following an acute viral infection. Non-pharmacological treatments for these symptoms are poorly understood. This review summarises evidence for the effectiveness of non-pharmacological treatments for symptoms of PVS. It also summarises the symptoms and health impacts of PVS in individuals recruited to studies evaluating treatments. Methods and findings: We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions for PVS, as compared to either standard care, alternative non-pharmacological therapy, or placebo. The outcomes of interest were changes in symptoms, exercise capacity, quality of life (including mental health and wellbeing), and work capability. We searched five databases (Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, MedRxiv) for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published between 1st January 2001 to 29th October 2021. We anticipated that there would be few RCTs specifically pertaining to Long COVID, so we also included observational studies only if they assessed interventions in individuals where the viral pathogen was SARS-COV-2. Relevant outcome data were extracted, study quality appraised using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, and the findings were synthesised narratively. Quantitative synthesis was not planned due to substantial heterogeneity between the studies. Overall, five studies of five different interventions (Pilates, music therapy, telerehabilitation, resistance exercise, neuromodulation) met the inclusion criteria. Aside from music-based intervention, all other selected interventions demonstrated some support in the management of PVS in some patients. Conclusions: In this study, we observed a lack of robust evidence evaluating non-pharmacological treatments for PVS, including Long COVID. Considering the prevalence of prolonged symptoms following acute viral infections, there is an urgent need for clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of non-pharmacological treatments for patients with PVS as well as what may work for certain sub-groups of patients with differential symptom presentation. Registration: The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO [CRD42021282074] in October 2021 and published in BMJ Open in 2022.

"Evaluation of Outdoor swimming courses as an intervention to refresh and revitalise NHS workers (preprint)","Background Frontline healthcare staff working in the National Health Service (NHS) have been, and continue to be, under a significant level of work related stress as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Long hours and greater clinical need have impacted negatively on work-life balance. The results of our preliminary studies indicate that outdoor swimming may be an effective treatment for anxiety and depression. We therefore hypothesised that the activity could improve symptoms of work-related burnout and stress in NHS workers. The primary objective of this study was to gather feedback from NHS staff participating in supervised swimming sessions that took place in an outdoor pool in London and the sea in Cornwall on the value and effectiveness of this initiative as they perceived it. Methods Following ethical approval (University of Portsmouth Science and Health research ethics committee SHFEC 2021-066), participants who had signed up to outdoor swimming courses provided by NHS Improvement in Cornwall and London were asked to give their consent to participate in an online survey. They were asked to complete them at three time-points: the week prior to, upon completion and six weeks after completion of the outdoor swimming course. As well as being asked for qualitative feedback, participants completed the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale and the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory. Results 85 (63.9%) of the 133 Participants who signed up to outdoor swimming courses completed the first survey, 62 (49.6%) the second and 43 (35.5%) the third. 41 (33.8%) completed all three surveys. Overall, there was a 14.8% increase in wellbeing scores when comparing the scores before and after the courses which was statistically significant (p&lt;0.0001, d= 1.02). Compared to scores before the course, the scores at its conclusion were reduced by 25%, 18% and 18% in personal, work-related and client-related burnout respectively. These burnout scores were significantly different for personal (P&lt;0.0001) and work-related burnout (P=0.0018). Qualitative feedback was overwhelmingly positive with the effects being broadly divided into those relating to mood and physical health, the social aspects of the group activity, feelings of achievement and self-care and mindfulness. Conclusion This research suggests that the outdoor swimming activity, as a workplace intervention, can be an effective way of promoting staff wellbeing and reducing personal and work-related burnout. Further, formal trials of this intervention are justified.","Pett, P.; Massey, H.; Denton, H.; Burlingham, A.; Harper, M.","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.11.22273166","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: Embase; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33288,""
"T<U+FEFF>he Social Pandemic from SARS-CoV-2 among Italian University Students: A Pilot Study (preprint)","The impact of restrictions on movement resulting from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may contribute to a disruption of mental health in young people during this era. In March 2021, lockdown restrictions were enforcing national policies of tackling the infectious disease across the globe. In the early stages of the vaccination rollout, public enquires on confidence to endure the virus pandemic have shown high levels of psychological distress. Under the above circumstances, 333 university students were asked to fill in an online-based survey on alcohol consumption, compulsive behavior as a loss of control over eating, fear of weight changes, excessive sleepiness and sleep deprivation. Text mining and multiple correspondence analysis were employed to analyze qualitative data on the lived experience against the occurrence of health-related behaviors. Data analyses have showed that the pandemic was associated with a mixed breakup of clustered lemmas based on sex, age, and relationship status. The extent to which the participants have reported a lower degree of satisfaction on living arrangements, intimate and family relationships were interpreted as meaningfully related with a more negative lived experience. Social confinement has resulted as an immediate action for mitigating a public health crisis from the SARS-CoV-2 disease. Incidentally, social measures to mitigate the virus transmission have sought to protect internal collapse of the health care systems by reducing the number of casualties. Conversely, these findings provide new evidence on the social determinants of health among youth and consequently highlight the potential interference from missing social interactions in the COVID-19 pandemic response.","Russo, Claudio, Giordano, Giuseppe, Marsico, Giuseppina","https://www.google.com/search?q=T<U+FEFF>he+Social+Pandemic+from+SARS-CoV-2+among+Italian+University+Students:+A+Pilot+Study+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33289,""
"I Can Be More Resilient! A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Interventions to Promote Resilience During the COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic threatens mental health, making the enhancement of individual resiliency against this adversity a matter of urgency. This study aimed to synthesize existing evidence on resilience interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic, estimate intervention effectiveness, and identify potential moderators of between-study heterogeneity. Methods: Nine English and three Chinese electronic databases were searched for intervention studies with resilience as the primary or secondary outcome conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Meta-analysis with the random-effects model was conducted to pool the effect sizes of the included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs with a control group, and a qualitative review synthesized the results of the included studies without control groups. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were used to examine study heterogeneity. Outcomes: A total of 33 studies including 8 RCTs, 11 non-RCTs with control groups, and 14 single-armed studies with 3159 intervention participants and 1199 control participants were identified in this systematic review. Meta-analysis of 17 studies showed that interventions conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, regardless of their theoretical background, improved the resilience level, with a medium to large pooled effect size (Hedgesâ€™g = 0Â·77, 95% CI 0Â·46â€“1Â·07, p &lt; 0Â·0001). Moderation analyses showed that culture, population type, intervention format, delivery mode, and resilience measurements were the sources of study heterogeneity. Specifically, interventions applied to Eastern people, children, and adolescents;in group formats;and in-person showed larger intervention effects than their counterparts. Moreover, 13 of the 16 studies in the descriptive analysis showed significant improvements in resilience after completion of the interventions. Interpretation: Interventions were effective at building resilience in individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is suggested that resilience enhancement programs consider the moderators identified in this study to optimize intervention benefits.","Ren, Zhihong, Tong, Jingqiang, Yan, Yifei, Yu, Nancy Xiaonan, Shi, Congrong, Wei, Xinjie","https://www.google.com/search?q=I+Can+Be+More+Resilient!+A+Systematic+Review+and+Meta-Analysis+of+Interventions+to+Promote+Resilience+During+the+COVID-19+Pandemic+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33290,""

"The 'Welcomed Lockdown' Hypothesis: When Do Mobility Restrictions Influence Mental Wellbeing? (preprint)","The COVID-19 pandemic and its mobility restrictions have been an external shock, influencing wellbeing. However, does risk exposure affect the welfare effect of lockdowns? This paper examines the â€˜welcomed lockdownâ€™ hypothesis, namely the extent to which there is a level of risk where mobility restrictions are not a hindrance to wellbeing. We exploit the differential timing of the effect of the pandemic across European countries, and the different stringency of lockdown to examine the effects on two mental health conditions, namely anxiety and depression. We examine whether differences in symptoms of anxiety and depression are explained by mortality and stringency of lockdown measures using ad event study that draws on Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM), Difference-in-Difference (DiD) and Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD). Our estimates suggest an average increase in depression (3.95%) and anxiety (10%) symptoms relative to the mean level on the day that the lockdown took effect. However, such effects are wiped out when a country exhibits high mortality (â€˜pandemic category 5â€™). Hence, we conclude that in an environment of high mortality, lockdowns no longer give rise to a reduction in well-being consistent with the â€˜welcome lockdownâ€™ hypothesis.","Costa-i-Font, Joan, Knapp, Martin, Vilaplana-Prieto, Cristina","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+'Welcomed+Lockdown'+Hypothesis:+When+Do+Mobility+Restrictions+Influence+Mental+Wellbeing?+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33292,""
"Patient characteristics associated with access to minimally invasive gynecologic surgery: Changes during the COVID-19 pandemic","To evaluate patient characteristics that affect access to minimally invasive gynecologic surgery (MIGS) subspecialty care and identify changes during the COVID-19 pandemic DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of patients referred to MIGS in 2014-2016 (historical cohort) compared to 2020 (pandemic cohort). Primary outcome was interval between referral and first appointment SETTING: Single-institution academic MIGS division PATIENTS: Historical cohort (n=1082) and pandemic cohort (n=770) INTERVENTIONS: NA MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Demographics and socioeconomic variables (race, ethnicity, language, insurance, employment, socioeconomic factors by census tract) and distance from hospital were compared between historical and pandemic cohorts with respect to referral interval using Chi-square, Fisher's Exact tests, and logistic regression. After adjusting for referral indication, being unemployed and living in an area with less population density, less education, and higher percentage of poverty were associated with referral interval &gt;30 days in the historical cohort. In the pandemic cohort, only unemployment persisted as a covariate associated with prolonged referral interval and new associated variables were primary language other than English (OR 3.20, 95% CI: 1.60, 6.40) and ""other"" race (OR 2.22, 95% CI: 1.34, 3.68). The odds of waiting &gt;30 days increased by 6% with the addition of one demographic risk factor (95% CI: 1.01-1.10) and 17% for three risk factors (95% CI:1.03-1.34) in the historical cohort whereas no significant intersectionality was identified in the pandemic cohort. Average referral intervals were significantly shorter during the pandemic (31 vs. 50 days, p&lt;.01). Telemedicine appointments had a significantly shorter referral interval versus in-person appointments (27 vs 47 days, p&lt;.01). Of patients using telemedicine, a greater proportion were non-Hispanic, English speaking, employed, privately insured, and lived further from the hospital (p&lt;.05). Time from referral to first appointment at a tertiary-care MIGS practice during the COVID-19 pandemic was shorter than prior to the pandemic, likely due to the adoption of telemedicine. Differences in socioeconomic and demographic factors suggest that telemedicine improved access to care and decreased access disparities for many populations, but not for non-English speaking patients.","Silverstein, McClurg, Moore, Fliss, Louie","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmig.2022.06.016","20220624","Keywords: Coronavirus; disparity; laparoscopic surgery; social determinants of health; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33293,""
"From surviving to thriving: integrating mental health care into HIV, community, and family services for adolescents living with HIV","Adolescents are a crucial generation, with the potential to bring future social and economic success for themselves and their countries. More than 90% of adolescents living with HIV reside in sub-Saharan Africa, where their mental health is set against a background of poverty, familial stress, service gaps, and an HIV epidemic that is now intertwined with the COVID-19 pandemic. In this Series paper, we review systematic reviews, randomised trials, and cohort studies of adolescents living with and affected by HIV. We provide a detailed overview of mental health provision and collate evidence for future approaches. We find that the mental health burden for adolescents living with HIV is high, contributing to low quality of life and challenges with adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Mental health provision is scarce, infrastructure and skilled providers are missing, and leadership is needed. Evidence of effective interventions is emerging, including specific provisions for mental health (eg, cognitive behavioural therapy, problem-solving, mindfulness, and parenting programmes) and broader provisions to prevent drivers of poor mental health (eg, social protection and violence prevention). We provide evidence of longitudinal associations between unconditional government grants and improved mental health. Combinations of economic and social interventions (known as cash plus care) could increase mental health benefits. Scalable delivery models include task sharing, primary care integration, strengthening families, and a pyramid of provision that differentiates between levels of need, from prevention to the care of severe disorders. A turning point has now been reached, from which complacency cannot persist. We conclude that there is substantial need, available frameworks, and a growing evidence base for action while infrastructure and skill acquisition is built.","Cluver, Sherr, Toska, Zhou, Mellins, Omigbodun, Li, Bojo, Thurman, Ameyan, Desmond, Willis, Laurenzi, Nombewu, Tomlinson, Myeketsi","https://doi.org/10.1016/S2352-4642(22)00101-8","20220624","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33294,""
"Doing more with less - How frugal innovations can contribute to improving healthcare systems","The dominance of an innovation discourse laden with cutting edge and expensive technologies, may be preventing us from recognizing alternative and complementary perspectives, which could help cut healthcare costs while improving worldwide access to health services. One such complementary approach is that of frugal innovation. Frugal innovation, as a way to produce efficacious and affordable products using fewer resources to reach the underserved customers, has received increasing attention in the social sciences literature. Although frugal innovation is commonly associated with emerging economies, there is now a rising interest from healthcare providers in developed countries, to find and apply effective, and lower-cost solutions. Nonetheless, knowledge on frugal innovation and its role in healthcare is dispersed across different literatures which hampers researchers and practitioners to access a fuller, and integrated picture of the phenomenon. In this study, by synthesizing extant knowledge, we tackle the fragmentation of the phenomenon. We elucidate on who the actors are, what is being done, how are such innovations being developed, and what the outcomes are, providing a framework that lays out the underlying mechanisms of frugal innovation in healthcare (FIH). The midrange theory that we develop, provides a conceptual framework for researchers to undertake empirical observation and models to guide managerial practices. Furthermore, by providing a more unified perspective of frugal innovation in healthcare, we hope to initiate conversations on the development, adequacy and adoption of these innovations in healthcare services, which could increase affordability and access for the population while maintaining quality.","Sarkar, Mateus","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.115127","20220624","COVID-19; Frugal innovation; Healthcare; Resource constraints","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33295,""
"Genetic and environmental contributions to psychopathological symptoms stability and change across the COVID-19 pandemic","Several longitudinal studies investigated changes in mental health related to the pandemic event. However, little research has focused on the mediating role of environmental and genetic factors. The current prospective study aimed to evaluate the genetic and environmental contributions to the stability of symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress during the COVID-19 crisis. A total of 798 adult twins, previously enrolled in the Italian Twin Register, participated in the study and completed on-line questionnaires sent out on June 2020 and December 2020. The nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the six-item State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6), and the Impact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R) were administered to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms, and pandemic-related subjective distress, respectively. A considerable longitudinal stability was observed for each trait (range: 0.57, STAI-6 - 0.67, PHQ-9). Bivariate Cholesky decomposition indicated that genetic factors explained from 53% (IES-R) to 61% (STAI-6) of between-wave covariance and that genetic overlap between the two waves was almost complete (range: 0.91, STAI-6 - 0.99, PHQ-9). Our findings support the hypothesis, at least over the 6-month period examined, of a genetic stability between waves and of an environmental discontinuity due to changes in life conditions during the pandemic.","Gigantesco, Fagnani, Picardi, Stazi, Medda","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114678","20220624","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Heritability; Mental health; Stress; Twin","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33296,""

This is a cross-sectional study involving five hundred and nine self-isolating COVID-19 patients in Osogbo, Nigeria. They completed a socio-demographic questionnaire, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI-7) and Brief Self Rating Scale (BSRS-5). The viral load was inferred from the Cycle threshold (Ct) value. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, insomnia, and suicidal ideation were 40%, 35.6%, 23%, and 7.3%, respectively. The respondents who had high viral load had significantly higher mean scores compared to those with a low viral load on the anxiety, depression, insomnia, psychological symptoms scales, and suicidal ideation item. There was significant negative correlation between Ct values and the study measures. Only psychological distress and suicidal ideation were the variables that were significantly associated with high viral load. There is a need to institute measures for mental health surveillance and psychosocial support among Nigerian COVID-19 patients especially during the period of self-isolation.

"Menstrual cycle changes and mental health states of women hospitalized due to COVID-19","Many studies have evaluated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women's mental health and menstrual changes. However, most of these studies only included nonhospitalized COVID-19 patients, while information on hospitalized women is very limited. Thus, this study aimed to examine the mental health status and menstrual changes in hospitalized female COVID-19 patients. A survey was administered to female COVID-19 patients in the isolation ward of a national referral hospital in Indonesia between January and August 2021, and the women were followed up 3 months after discharge. The survey evaluated menstrual patterns and mental health using the Self Reporting Questionnaire-29 (SRQ-29). The study enrolled 158 female patients. There was an increase in patients who had a cycle length of &gt; 32 or &lt; 24 days, and significant increases in menstrual irregularity and heavy menstrual bleeding were noted. Overall, 37.3% of the patients reported a change in menstrual pattern after infection with COVID-19. Based on SRQ-29 scores, 32.3% of the women had neurotic symptoms, 12.7% had psychotic symptoms, and 38.0% had symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. Patients with symptoms of mental health disorders were twice as likely to report a menstrual change (OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.12-4.22; p = 0.021). Menstrual changes and increased symptoms of mental health disorders occur in hospitalized female COVID-19 patients. The length of isolation was the key factor affecting overall menstrual changes and mental health in hospitalized female COVID-19 patients.","Muharam, Agiananda, Budiman, Harahap, Prabowo, Azyati, Putri, Pratama, Sumapraja","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0270658","20220624","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33298,""
"Human gingival mesenchymal stem cells retain their growth and immunomodulatory characteristics independent of donor age","Aging has been reported to deteriorate the quantity and quality of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which affect their therapeutic use in regenerative medicine. A dearth of age-related stem cell research further restricts their clinical applications. The present study explores the possibility of using MSCs derived from human gingival tissues (GMSCs) for studying their ex vivo growth characteristics and differentiation potential with respect to donor age. GMSCs displayed decreased in vitro adipogenesis and in vitro and in vivo osteogenesis with age, but in vitro neurogenesis remained unaffected. An increased expression of p53 and SIRT1 with donor age was correlated to their ability of eliminating tumorigenic events through apoptosis or autophagy, respectively. Irrespective of donor age, GMSCs displayed effective immunoregulation and regenerative potential in a mouse model of LPS-induced acute lung injury. Thus, we suggest the potential of GMSCs for designing cell-based immunomodulatory therapeutic approaches and their further extrapolation for acute inflammatory conditions such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and COVID-19.","Dave, Chandekar, Behera, Desai, Salve, Sapkal, Mhaske, Dewle, Pokare, Page, Jog, Chivte, Srivastava, Tomar","https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abm6504","20220624","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33299,""
"Prevalence of depression and associated factors among adult cancer patients receiving chemotherapy during the era of COVID-19 in Ethiopia Hospital-based cross-sectional study","Depression is a major public health problem among cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. It compromises patient outcomes, resulting in higher rates of mortality. Currently, there are little data on the prevalence of depression in Sub-Sharan countries. Therefore, the current study was done to assess the prevalence of depression among adult cancer patients and its associated factors in Ethiopia. An institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted among 420 adult cancer patients from 1st March to April 30, 2021. Systematic random sampling technique was used to recruit participants. Depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. The collected data were coded and entered into Epi-data version 4.2 and exported to SPSS version 25 for analysis. Bivariate binary logistic regression was performed to select factors that will be included in multivariate analysis, and variables with a p-value &lt; 0.05 were included in multivariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals were computed and variables with p-value &lt; 0.05 were considered to declare a significant association. In this study, the prevalence of depression was 33.1% (95% CI = 0.2858, 0.3761). Minimal symptoms of depression, minor depression, moderate depression, moderate severe depression, and severe depression were found to be 272 (64.8%), 9 (2.1%), 104 (24.8%), 28 (6.7%), and 7 (1.7%), respectively. Those cancer patients who had unemployed status, sacked from jobs, and had stage IV cancer were most likely to develop depression, whereas patients who completed primary education, colon, prostate and cervical cancer were less likely to have depression. Depression is found to be a major public health concern for adult cancer patients in Ethiopia. To reduce the occurrence of depression among cancer patients, special attention is needed.","Belete, Alemagegn, Mulu, Yazie, Bewket, Asefa, Shiferaw","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0270293","20220624","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33300,""
"Experiences of Home-living Vulnerable Older Adults with Clinical Depression during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Study","Little is known about the diversity of older adults' experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. We therefore investigated the pandemic experiences of home-living vulnerable older adults with depression, an understudied subpopulation. We conducted unstructured interviews with <i>N</i>=Ã‚Â 20 older (60+Ã‚Â years) adults with clinical depression receiving care in their homes in June and again in December 2020. Interviews were coded according to the grounded theory approach. We identified eight themes. Participants described <i>feeling disconnected</i> before and during the pandemic, which they attributed to their physical impairments and old age. Their <i>social relations</i> with family, medical providers, and caregivers helped them feel connected. Participants did not feel significantly impacted by the <i>COVID-19 pandemic</i>, but they missed social and physical contact. During the pandemic, isolation was normalized. Participants therefore experienced <i>loneliness</i> due to their isolation, but also a sense of <i>togetherness</i> with the rest of society. Isolation within the home was re-framed as <i>cocooning</i>, which provided a sense of autonomy. Participants nevertheless expressed <i>resignation</i>. Home-living vulnerable older adults with depression experienced loneliness but also a degree of relief during the pandemic. Positively re-framing isolation and the stability of formal caregiving helped participants endure <i>feeling disconnected</i> during the pandemic.","GrohÃƒÂ©, Gellert, Kessler","https://doi.org/10.1080/07317115.2022.2091499","20220624","Everyday experience; grounded theory; loneliness; mental health; resilience; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33301,""
"Birmingham vasculitis activity score and the short form 36-item health survey predict current depressive disorders in patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic","This study compared the frequency and severity of depressive disorders in patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV) before and during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic using the Korean version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-Revised (K-CESD-R) and the Korean version of the Profile of Mood States (K-POMS) depression, and further determined predictors of current depressive disorders in the patients during the pandemic. Of the 61Ã‚Â patients with AAV who participated before the pandemic, 8Ã‚Â patients were transferred to other hospitals, 3Ã‚Â patients died, and 2Ã‚Â patients refused to participate in this study. Finally, 48Ã‚Â patients participated in this study. Depression disorders were defined as KÃ¢â‚¬â€˜CESD-RÃ¢â‚¬Â¯Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°16. When comparing the patterns of mental health between patients with AAV before and during the pandemic, no change in KÃ¢â‚¬â€˜CESDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜R or KÃ¢â‚¬â€˜POMS subscale scores was observed. Among AAV-related indices, regardless of the pandemic, the short-form 36-item Health Survey (SF-36) mental component score (MCS) and physical component score (PCS) were significantly correlated with KÃ¢â‚¬â€˜CESDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜R and could predict current depressive disorders. When the cut-off of Birmingham vasculitis activity score (BVAS) for depressive disorders was obtained by the receiver operator characteristic curve, it significantly predicted current depressive disorders in patients with AAV during the pandemic, unlike those before the pandemic. We verified that SF-36 MCS and PCS could predict current depressive disorders, regardless of the pandemic, and furthermore, we demonstrated for the first time that BVAS was aÃ‚Â predictor of current depressive disorders in patients with AAV during the pandemic unlike those before the pandemic.

Dazu wurden die koreanische Version der Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-Revised (K-CESD-R) und die koreanische Version des Profile of Mood States (K-POMS) fÃƒÂ¼r Depression verwendet; auÃƒÅ¸erdem wurden weitere PrÃƒÂ¤diktoren fÃƒÂ¼r aktuell bestehende depressive StÃƒÂ¶rungen bei den Patienten wÃƒÂ¤hrend der Pandemie ermittelt. Von den 61Ã‚Â Patienten mit AAV, die vor der Pandemie teilnahmen, wurden 8Ã‚Â Patienten an andere KrankenhÃƒÂ¤user ÃƒÂ¼berwiesen, 3Ã‚Â Patienten starben, und 2Ã‚Â verweigerten die Teilnahme an der Studie. Letztlich nahmen 48Ã‚Â Patienten an der Studie teil. Depressive StÃƒÂ¶rungen wurden definiert als ein Wert fÃƒÂ¼r KÃ¢â‚¬â€˜CESD-RÃ¢â‚¬Â¯Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°16. Beim Vergleich der Muster fÃƒÂ¼r psychische Gesundheit von Patienten mit AAV vor und wÃƒÂ¤hrend der Pandemie wurde keine VerÃƒÂ¤nderung hinsichtlich der Subskalenwerte fÃƒÂ¼r KÃ¢â‚¬â€˜CESDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜R oder KÃ¢â‚¬â€˜POMS festgestellt.

"Treatment outcomes and patient satisfaction of a virtual partial hospital program: A mixed-method study","Despite a proliferation of virtual partial hospital programs (PHP) during the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a dearth of research on such programs. In the current study, we compared treatment outcomes and patient satisfaction between an in-person and a virtual PHP. Further, we examined patients' qualitative feedback about the virtual PHP. Participants included 282 patients attending a virtual PHP during the COVID-19 pandemic and 470 patients attending an in-person PHP one year prior. Patients completed daily measures of symptom severity, and post-treatment measures of patient satisfaction and treatment outcomes. Patients in the virtual PHP provided feedback about virtual care. Quantitative data were analyzed using multilevel modeling, and qualitative data were analyzed using the principles of inductive analysis. Patients experienced a reduction in depression (<i>b</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-.28, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and anxiety symptoms (<i>b</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-.25, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) over time and reported high satisfaction in both the in-person and virtual PHPs.

"The Impact of COVID-19 on Distress Tolerance in Pakistani Men and Women","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that spread across the world, bringing with it serious mental health problems for men and women. Women in Pakistan are infected with COVID-19 at a much lower rate than men, yet report worse mental health. To explain this paradox, we surveyed 190 participants (46% male) shortly following the country lockdown, focusing on perceptions of the COVID-19 impact and positive adjustment. Measures used in this study included the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale and Distress Tolerance Scale. Factor analysis revealed five distinct areas related to COVID-19, which did not differ by sex. However, men reported higher levels of both distress tolerance and well-being than women. High endorsement of actions to protect against COVID-19 was related to lower distress tolerance scores, but in different ways for men and women. Men, but not women, who endorsed more protective measures to stop the pandemic reported higher DTS absorption scores, and therefore being more consumed by distress; women who endorsed more protective measures to stop the pandemic reported less acceptance of distress than men, as reflected in DTS appraisal scores. An in-depth analysis of women's beliefs and behaviors related to COVID-19 is warranted to understand why Pakistani women who are infected with COVID-19 at lower rates than men show more mental health symptoms.","Shahzad, Kliewer, Bano, Begum, Ali","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.852121","20220624","COVID-19; Pakistan; distress tolerance; sex differences; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33306,""
"An online mindfulness intervention for medical students in South Africa: A randomised controlled trial","Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, an association was observed between medical students' stress, possibly because of an intensive academic workload and clinical responsibilities, and mental ill health. The literature has shown the benefit of online mindfulness interventions for different mental health challenges. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of information on their benefit to medical students in South Africa. The aim of this study was to explore whether medical students attending an online mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) would show improved resilience and stress management compared with attendance at an online supportive counselling (SC) programme. Secondary to this was the viability of the intervention, for which an in-depth understanding of participants' experiences was sought. The study setting was online through https://zoom.us/. Forty-five participants were randomly allocated between two 6-week, teacher-facilitated groups. A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) of outcome, well-being, perceived stress and self-compassion scores conducted at three time points, as well as thematic analysis of participant feedback, contributed to quantitative and qualitative data. Participants in both the groups showed significant improvement over time in measures of well-being, perceived stress and subjective stress management. Participants in the mindfulness group showed a statistically significant treatment effect in mindfulness at programme completion. A decrease in self-compassion over time was observed in both the groups. The results of this study indicate that in this South African medical student cohort, an online MBI and a SC programme are both feasible and show potential for reducing stress, increasing stress management and increasing resilience. Further study in this area is recommended.","Boyd, Alexander","https://doi.org/10.4102/sajpsychiatry.v28i0.1840","20220624","medical students; online mindfulness-based interventions; perceived stress; self-compassion; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33307,""

"Ivermectin-Induced Acute Psychosis in Patients Infected With COVID-19 Pneumonia","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia is an infection of the lungs that causes severe inflammation in the lungs' alveoli. It causes alveoli to fill with fluid, blood clots, and sometimes even pus. Patients who are infected with COVID-19 pneumonia experience severe cough, shortness of breath, fever, fatigue, chest pain, night sweats, chills, loss of appetite, etc. During the initial phase of the COVID-19 pneumonia pandemic, it was thought that ivermectin might be helpful in patients infected with COVID-19 pneumonia, but this was later proven to be false due to its severe risks/side effects.

"Social Vulnerability and Mental Health Inequalities in the ""Syndemic"": Call for Action","Covid-19 is referred to as a ""syndemic,"" i.e., the consequences of the disease are exacerbated by social and economic disparity. Poor housing, unstable work conditions, caste, class, race and gender based inequities and low incomes have a profound effect on mental health and wellbeing. Such disparities are increasing between, among and within countries and are exacerbated by human rights violations, in institution and in society, stigma and discrimination. Social capital can mediate health outcomes, through trust and reciprocity, political participation, and by mental health service systems, which can be coercive or more open to demand of emancipation and freedom. Societal inequalities affect especially vulnerable groups, and Covid itself had a wider impact on the most socially vulnerable and marginalized populations, suffering for structural discrimination and violence. There are complex relations among these social processes and domains, and mental health inequalities and disparity. Participation and engagement of citizens and community organizations is now required in order to achieve a radical transformation in mental health. A Local and Global Action Plan has been launched recently, by a coalition of organizations representing people with lived experience of mental health care; who use services; family members, mental health professionals, policy makers and researchers, such as the International Mental Health Collaborating Network, the World Federation for Mental Health, the World Association for Psychosocial Rehabilitation, the Global Alliance of Mental Illness Advocacy Networks (GAMIAN), The Mental Health Resource Hub in Chennai, India, The Movement for Global Mental Health (MGMH) and others. The Action Plan addresses the need for fundamental change by focusing on social determinants and achieving equity in mental health care. Equally the need for the politics of wellbeing has to be embedded in a system that places mental health within development and social justice paradigm, enhancing core human capabilities and contrasting discriminatory practices. These targets are for people and organizations to adopt locally within their communities and services, and also to indicate possible innovative solutions to Politics. This global endeavor may represent an alternative to the global mental discourse inspired by the traditional biomedical model.","Mezzina, Gopikumar, Jenkins, Saraceno, Sashidharan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.894370","20220624","Action Plan; COVID-19; community mental healthcare; empowerment; mental health inequality; mental health policy; stigma; vulnerable groups","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33310,""
"Conspiratorial Beliefs About COVID-19 Pandemic - Can They Pose a Mental Health Risk? The Relationship Between Conspiracy Thinking and the Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression Among Adult Poles","The aim of the study was to describe the relationship between the tendency to believe in false information about the COVID-19 pandemic, tendency to believe in conspiracy theories and the severity of anxiety and depression symptoms among the surveyed Poles. The study was conducted via the Internet in a group of 700 people aged 24.8 Ã‚Â± 6.3 years (mean Ã‚Â± SD). 585 females and 110 males were involved. Scales such as Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale (GCBS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the original questionnaire COVID-19 Conspiratorial Beliefs Scale (COVID-19 CBS) designed to measure the tendency to believe in false information about COVID-19 pandemic were used. A positive correlation was observed between the tendency to believe in false information about the COVID-19 pandemic (COVID-19 CBS) and the tendency to believe in general conspiracy theories (GCBS) (r = 0.768; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Moreover, both COVID-19 CBS and GCBS positively correlated with the severity of anxiety and depression symptoms in the study group. For COVID-19 CBS, the correlation coefficients were 0.087 (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.021) and.108 (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.004) for depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively, while for GCBS the coefficients were 0.132 (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and 0.147 (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Regression analysis showed that the increased tendency to believe in false beliefs about the COVID-19 pandemic may be associated with an increase in the severity of anxiety (b = 0.04; <i>p</i> = 0.021) and depression (b = 0.06; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) symptoms. It can be hypothesized that the tendency to believe in false information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic is positively associated with the tendency to general belief in conspiracy theories. False beliefs about the COVID-19 pandemic may, at least to some extent, influence the development of anxiety and depression symptoms.","DÃˆÂ©bski, BoroÃ…â€ž, KapuÃ…â€ºniak, DÃˆÂ©bska-Janus, Piegza, Gorczyca","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.870128","20220624","COVID-19; anxiety; conspiracy thinking; conspiratorial beliefs; depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33311,""
"Prevalence and Related Factors of Anxiety Among University Teachers 1 Year After the COVID-19 Pandemic Outbreak in China: A Multicenter Study","This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of anxiety among university teachers 1 year after the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and provide empirical evidence of psychological intervention. A multicenter study was conducted to examine the prevalence of anxiety among 10,302 teachers in 21 Chinese universities from February 12 to April 23, 2021. The generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale (GAD-7) was used to assess symptoms of anxiety. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to analyze the relationship between potential influence and anxiety symptoms. The overall prevalence of anxiety was 40.0% 1 year after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which was found to be higher in women than in men (41.32% vs. 38.22%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). The multivariate logistic regression showed that being the female (<i>OR</i> = 1.207; <i>95%CI</i>: 1.103-1.318), age Ã¢â€°Â¥60 years (<i>OR</i> = 2.004; <i>95%CI</i>: 1.128-3.560), being married (<i>OR</i> = 1.319; <i>95%CI</i>: 1.150-1.513), and poor family economic status (<i>OR</i> = 1.580; <i>95%CI</i>: 1.321-1.891) were significantly associated with anxiety. Participants with moderate, slight, or no impact of COVID-19 on life (<i>OR</i> for moderate, 0.557; <i>95%CI</i>, 0.508-0.611; <i>OR</i> for slight/no, 0.377; <i>95%CI</i>, 0.323-0.439) showed a reduced risk of anxiety compared to those who reported a significant effect. Symptoms of anxiety were found in about two-fifths of Chinese university teachers 1 year after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"An Evaluation of the Effect of the Use of N95 Respirators by Surgical Teams on Early Surgical Site Infections in Orthopedic Cases","Background Surgical site infections (SSIs) are seen in the postoperative period in orthopedic and traumatology clinics. Just as in all surgical clinics, SSIs lead to patient dissatisfaction with the results, prolong the length of stay in the hospital, and increase treatment costs. SSIs are known to occur as a result of wound contamination through inoculation of microorganisms found mainly in the air or in the surgical area. Because of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, N95 masks have been widely used in the operating rooms of our hospital by nurses, residents, and surgeons since March 2020. This study aims to evaluate the effect of N95 respirator use by the surgical team on SSIs determined in patients operated on in our clinic compared to surgical mask use. Methodology In this retrospective study, the use of N95 respirators by the surgical team was compared with the use of surgical masks to evaluate the effect on SSIs in patients operated on in our clinic. Two groups were formed of patients operated on by the surgical team wearing surgical masks between February 2019 and February 2020 and those operated on with the surgical team using N95 respirators between March 2020 and March 2021. Each patient was diagnosed withÃ‚Â postoperative SSIs by two different surgeons in the same clinic and by an infection clinic specialist based on clinical and laboratory findings. Results A total of 1,486 patients were examined; 729 patients in February 2019-February 2020 period (Group 1) and 757 in March 2020-March 2021 period (Group 2). In total, 124 and 104 patients were excluded from the first and second groups, respectively, for various reasons, including revision surgery, open fractures, diabetes, smoking, peripheral vascular disease, or other comorbidities that could affect infection rates. SSIs were determined in 35 patients in Group 1 and 13 patients in Group 2. The SSI rates in the second period in both types of procedures (arthroplasty and trauma surgeries) were determined to be significantly lower. Conclusions Because of the use of intraoperative N95 respiratory masks by surgical teams in orthopedics and traumatology procedures, the number of SSIs decreased significantly compared to the use of surgical masks.","Hassa, AlÃ„Â±ÃƒÂ§","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.25138","20220624","covid-19 outbreak; medical mask; n95 respirator; orthopedics-related infections; surgical site infections","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33313,""
"Emotion Recognition for Partial Faces Using a Feature Vector Technique","Wearing a facial mask is indispensable in the COVID-19 pandemic; however, it has tremendous effects on the performance of existing facial emotion recognition approaches. In this paper, we propose a feature vector technique comprising three main steps to recognize emotions from facial mask images. First, a synthetic mask is used to cover the facial input image. With only the upper part of the image showing, and including only the eyes, eyebrows, a portion of the bridge of the nose, and the forehead, the boundary and regional representation technique is applied. Second, a feature extraction technique based on our proposed rapid landmark detection method employing the infinity shape is utilized to flexibly extract a set of feature vectors that can effectively indicate the characteristics of the partially occluded masked face. Finally, those features, including the location of the detected landmarks and the Histograms of the Oriented Gradients, are brought into the classification process by adopting CNN and LSTM; the experimental results are then evaluated using images from the CK+ and RAF-DB data sets. As the result, our proposed method outperforms existing cutting-edge approaches and demonstrates better performance, achieving 99.30% and 95.58% accuracy on CK+ and RAF-DB, respectively.","Khoeun, Chophuk, Chinnasarn","https://doi.org/10.3390/s22124633","20220624","emotion recognition; facial expression; facial mask; feature vectors; landmark detector; occlusion","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33314,""
"Immune System and Psychological State of Pregnant Women during COVID-19 Pandemic: Are Micronutrients Able to Support Pregnancy?","The immune system is highly dynamic and susceptible to many alterations throughout pregnancy. Since December 2019, a pandemic caused by coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has swept the globe. To contain the spread of COVID-19, immediate measures such as quarantine and isolation were implemented. These containment measures have contributed to exacerbate situations of anxiety and stress, especially in pregnant women, who are already particularly anxious about their condition. Alterations in the psychological state of pregnant women are related to alterations in the immune system, which is more vulnerable under stress. COVID-19 could therefore find fertile soil in these individuals and risk more severe forms. Normally a controlled dietary regimen is followed during pregnancy, but the use of particular vitamins and micronutrients can help counteract depressive-anxiety states and stress, can improve the immune system, and provide an additional weapon in the defense against COVID-19 to bring the pregnancy to fruition. This review aims to gather data on the impact of COVID-19 on the immune system and psychological condition of pregnant women and to assess whether some micronutrients can improve their psychophysical symptoms.","Alesci, Pergolizzi, Fumia, Miller, Cernigliaro, Zaccone, Salamone, Mastrantonio, Gangemi, Pioggia, Cicero","https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14122534","20220624","COVID-19; immune system; micronutrients; pregnancy; stress; vitamins","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33315,""
"The Associations of Suspected COVID-19 Symptoms with Anxiety and Depression as Modified by Hemodialysis Dietary Knowledge: A Multi-Dialysis Center Study","During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential to evaluate hemodialysis patients' dietary knowledge, especially among those with COVID-19 related symptoms, in order to identify appropriate strategies in managing their mental health. The study's purposes were to test the psychometric properties of the hemodialysis dietary knowledge (HDK) scale, and to investigate the modifying impact of HDK on the associations of suspected COVID-19 symptoms (S-COVID-19-S) with anxiety and depression among hemodialysis patients. A cross-sectional study was conducted from July 2020 to March 2021 at eight hospitals across Vietnam. Data of 875 hemodialysis patients were analyzed, including socio-demographic, anxiety (the generalized anxiety disorder scale, GAD-7), depression (the patient health questionnaire, PHQ-9), S-COVID-19-S, HDK, health literacy, and digital healthy diet literacy. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and logistic regression models were used to analyze the data. The HDK scale demonstrates the satisfactory construct validity with good model fit (Goodness of Fit Index, GFI = 0.96; Adjusted Goodness of Fit Index, AGFI = 0.90; Standardized Root Mean Square Residual, SRMR = 0.05; Root Mean Square Error of Approximation, RMSEA = 0.09; Normed Fit Index, NFI = 0.96; Comparative Fit Index, CFI = 0.96, and Parsimony goodness of Fit Index, PGFI = 0.43), criterion validity (as correlated with HL (r = 0.22, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.01) and DDL (r = 0.19, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.01), and reliability (Cronbach alpha = 0.70)). In the multivariate analysis, S-COVID-19-S was associated with a higher likelihood of anxiety (odds ratio, OR, 20.76; 95% confidence interval, 95%CI, 8.85, 48.70; <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) and depression (OR, 12.95; 95%CI, 6.67, 25.14, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). A higher HDK score was associated with a lower likelihood of anxiety (OR, 0.70; 95%CI, 0.64, 0.77; <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) and depression (OR, 0.72; 95%CI, 0.66, 0.79; <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). In the interaction analysis, the negative impacts of S-COVID-19-S on anxiety and depression were mitigated by higher HDK scores (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). In conclusion, HDK is a valid and reliable tool to measure dietary knowledge in hemodialysis patients. Higher HDK scores potentially protect patients with S-COVID-19-S from anxiety and depression during the pandemic.","Dang, Luong, Nguyen, Hoang, Nguyen, Nguyen, Duong, Tran, Pham, Ngo, Nguyen, Trieu, Do, Trinh, Ha, Phan, Do, Yang, Wang, Duong","https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14122364","20220624","Vietnam; anxiety; depression; digital healthy diet literacy; health literacy; hemodialysis; hemodialysis dietary knowledge; psychometric properties; suspected COVID-19 symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33316,""
"Self-Reported Long COVID in the General Population: Sociodemographic and Health Correlates in a Cross-National Sample","We aimed to gain knowledge of possible sociodemographic predictors of long COVID and whether long COVID was associated with health outcomes almost two years after the pandemic outbreak. There were 1649 adults who participated in the study by completing a cross-sectional online survey disseminated openly in Norway, the UK, the USA, and Australia between November 2021 and January 2022. Participants were defined as having long COVID based on self-reports that they had been infected by COVID-19 and were experiencing long-lasting COVID symptoms. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine possible sociodemographic predictors, and multivariate analysis of variance was used to examine whether long COVID status was associated with health outcomes. None of the sociodemographic variables was significantly associated with reporting long COVID. Having long COVID was associated with higher levels of psychological distress, fatigue, and perceived stress. The effect of long COVID on health outcomes was greater among men than among women. In conclusion, long COVID appeared across sociodemographic groups. People with long COVID reported worsened health outcomes compared to those who had had COVID-19 but without long-term symptoms. Men experiencing long COVID appear to be particularly vulnerable to experiencing poorer health outcomes; health services may pay extra attention to potentially unnoticed needs for support among men experiencing long COVID.","Bonsaksen, Leung, Price, Ruffolo, Lamph, Kabelenga, Thygesen, Geirdal","https://doi.org/10.3390/life12060901","20220624","COVID-19; cross-cultural study; fatigue; mental health; psychological distress; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33317,""
"Postpartum Depression in COVID-19 Days: Longitudinal Study of Risk and Protective Factors","COVID-19 impacted the childbirth experience and increased the rates of postpartum depression (PPD). We assessed the longitudinal effects of the pandemic on the rates of PPD and evaluated the PPD causes and symptoms among women who delivered during the first COVID-19 quarantine in Israel. The participants completed online questionnaires 3 (T1) and 6 months (T2) following delivery. We used the 'COVID-19 exposure' questionnaire, while PPD symptoms, situational anxiety, and social support were evaluated with the EPDS, STAI, and MSPSS questionnaires. The mean EPDS scores increased between T1 and T2 (6.31 Ã‚Â± 5.6 vs. 6.92 Ã‚Â± 5.9, mean difference -0.64 Ã‚Â± 4.59 (95% CI (-1.21)-(-0.06)); t (244) = -2.17, <i>p</i> = 0.031), and the STAI scores decreased (45.35 Ã‚Â± 16.4 vs. 41.47 Ã‚Â± 14.0, t(234) = 4.39, <i>p</i> = 0.000). Despite the exposure to an increased number of COVID-19 events (3.63 Ã‚Â± 1.8 vs. (6.34 Ã‚Â± 2.3)), the impact of exposure decreased between T1 and T2 (8.91 Ã‚Â± 4.6 vs. 7.47 Ã‚Â± 4.1), <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). In the MSPSS, significant differences were noted on the family scale between the T1 (6.10 Ã‚Â± 1.3) and T2 (5.91 Ã‚Â± 1.4) scores; t (216) = 2.68, <i>p</i> = 0.0008. A regression analysis showed three statistically significant variables that correlated with increased EPDS scores: the MSPSS family subscale (F (1212.00) = 4.308, <i>p</i> = 0.039), the STAI scores (F (1212.00) = 31.988, <i>p</i> = 0.000), and the impact of exposure to COVID-19 (F (1212.00) = 5.038, <i>p</i> = 0.026).

"Comprehensive Clinical Characterisation of Brain Fog in Adults Reporting Long COVID Symptoms","(1) Introduction: A subset of individuals experiencing long COVID symptoms are affected by 'brain fog', a lay term that often refers to general cognitive dysfunction but one that is still poorly characterised. In this study, a comprehensive clinical characterisation of self-reported brain fog was conducted vis-ÃƒÂ -vis other long COVID symptoms and parameters of mental, cognitive, and physical health. (2) Methodology: Adult participants reporting long COVID symptoms were recruited from hospital clinics and as self-referrals. Participants completed a battery of questionnaires and clinical assessments, including COVID-19 history, symptomatology, self-reported scales (Chalder Fatigue Scale [CFQ], Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, and Impact of Events Scale-Revised), computer-based cognitive assessments (simple response time and choice reaction time tasks), physical performance tests (gait velocity and muscle strength assessments), and an orthostatic active stand test. A systematic comparison between participants with and without self-reported brain fog was conducted, and a backwards binary logistic regression model was computed to identify the strongest independent associations with brain fog. This was complemented by an automatic cluster analysis to rank the importance of associations. Finally, a structural equation model was postulated with a causal model of key symptomatic indicators and functional consequences of brain fog as a latent variable. (3) Results: Of 108 participants assessed, brain fog was a self-reported symptom in 71 (65.7%) participants. Those with brain fog were at a longer point in time since COVID-19 onset and reported longer duration of low activity during the acute illness. When assessed, those with brain fog had higher frequencies of subjective memory impairment, word-finding difficulties, dizziness, myalgia, arthralgia, hyperhidrosis, cough, voice weakness, throat pain, visual and hearing problems, dysosmia, paraesthesia, chest pain, skin rashes, and hair loss; mean scores in fatigue, depression, and post-traumatic stress scales were higher; performance in both computer-based cognitive tasks was poorer; and measured gait speed and grip strength were lower. The logistic regression suggested that the best independent associations with brain fog were memory impairment, CFQ, and myalgia. The cluster analysis suggested that the most important associations with brain fog were CFQ, dizziness, myalgia, reduced gait speed, word-finding difficulties, reduced grip strength, and memory impairment. The SEM was consistent with key indicators of brain fog being CFQ, dizziness, myalgia, word-finding difficulties, and memory impairment; and reduced grip strength, gait speed, and cognitive response times its functional consequences. (4) Conclusions: The findings indicate that self-reported brain fog in long COVID is a recognisable symptom cluster primarily characterised by fatigue, dizziness, myalgia, word-finding difficulties, and memory impairment and has adverse psychological and psychomotor correlates. In long COVID, brain fog should be regarded as a wide-ranging symptom and addressed holistically with medical, psychological, and rehabilitative supports as guided by individual needs.","Jennings, Monaghan, Xue, Duggan, Romero-OrtuÃƒÂ±o","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11123440","20220624","COVID-19; brain fog; cognitive dysfunction; depression; fatigue; gait; long COVID; neurocardiovascular assessment; neuropsychology; strength assessment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33319,""
"Central Symptoms of Insomnia in Relation to Depression and COVID-19 Anxiety in General Population: A Network Analysis","Insomnia is prevalent among the general population, and studies have shown an increase in insomnia symptoms during the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Despite numerous studies of insomnia, few studies have investigated insomnia symptoms in detail. In this study, we used network analysis to investigate interactions between insomnia symptoms in the general population. Furthermore, given the effect of COVID-19 on mental health, we also investigated how anxiety response to COVID-19 and depression related to insomnia symptoms. Data from 785 non-infected participants were used. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-6 Scale (SAVE-6), and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) were used to measure insomnia symptoms, anxiety response to COVID-19, and depression, respectively. Network analysis was performed using R Studio. Centrality indices and edge weights were obtained, and each index was evaluated using bootstrapping methods. The network revealed ISI7 (worry about current sleep pattern) to be the most central insomnia symptom. ISI7 was strongly connected to SAVE-6 total score, and ISI2 (difficulty staying asleep) was strongly connected to PHQ-9 total score. High centrality of ISI7 supports the role of dysfunctional cognitions in etiological models of insomnia and thus the cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. The relationship between ISI7 and SAVE-6 is explained by transposition of worry and fear of contracting COVID-19 to worry about sleep patterns. The link between ISI2 and PHQ-9 necessitate further investigations of whether specific symptoms of insomnia are more associated with depression.","Cha, Jeon, Chung","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11123416","20220624","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; insomnia; network analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33320,""

In hospitalized patients, COVID-19 is associated with significantly higher incidences of physical conditions (venous thromboembolism (5.8% vs. 2.9%, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001), pulmonary circulation disorder (5.1% vs. 2.9%, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001), chronic lung disease (8.4% vs. 4.3%, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001), acute kidney injury (16.4% vs. 9.3%, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001), chronic kidney disease (6.5% vs. 4.8%, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001), cardiac arrhythmia (15.2% vs. 10.9%, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001), complicated hypertension (12% vs. 8.5%, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001), coagulopathy (6.1% vs. 2.6%, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001), fluid/electrolyte disorders (24.4% vs. 12.6%, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) and neurological disorders (7.1% vs. 3.8%, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001)) and mental health conditions (depressive episode (6.6% vs. 4.3%, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001), adjustment disorder (2.5% vs. 1.7%, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001), insomnia (4.9% vs. 3.2%, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) and dementia (3.0% vs. 1.9%, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001)) compared to propensity-matched hospitalized COVID-19 negative patients. In outpatient settings, COVID-19 diagnosis is associated with smaller increase in the incidences of the physical sequelae. <b>Conclusions:</b> In this propensity-score-matched analysis of US veterans, COVID-19 survivors, especially those who were hospitalized, developed new physical and mental health sequelae at a significantly higher rate than those without COVID-19.","Patel, Dahman, Bajaj","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11123390","20220624","COVID-19; mental sequelae; physical sequelae; veterans","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33321,""
"COVID-19 Pandemic Psychological Impact and Volunteering Experience Perceptions of Medical Students after 2 Years","Undergraduate healthcare students were mobilized to support healthcare systems during the COVID-19 pandemic, but we have scarce information regarding their experience and its impact on their wellbeing. An anonymous online survey was conducted among undergraduate students and recently graduated physicians of a medical university in Spain, regarding their symptoms and volunteering experience during the initial months of the Spanish COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents showed a high prevalence of perceived stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, measured by the PHQ-9 and GAD-7. 14.5% reported healthcare-related volunteering tasks. Volunteering was a satisfactory experience for most of the respondents and the majority felt ready to do volunteering tasks (66.6%). Yet, 16.6% acknowledged not getting appropriate specific-task education before starting, 20.8% reported not having appropriate supervision, and 33.3% feel they did not have proper protective equipment. More than half of volunteers feared getting infected, more than 70% feared infecting their relatives or friends, and 54.2% reported stigmatization. Volunteers showed significantly higher stress, anxiety, and depression scores than the rest of the respondents, and 32% reported a highly traumatic event during volunteering, with high scores on the IES-R in the 16% of volunteers. Our results should help guide future potential volunteering processes in emergencies, enhance academic programs at medical schools and provide valuable data for psychological support services.","GÃƒÂ³mez-DurÃƒÂ¡n, FumadÃƒÂ³, GassÃƒÂ³, DÃƒÂ­az, Miranda-Mendizabal, Forero, Virumbrales","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19127532","20220624","COVID-19; physicians; psychological impact; volunteering","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33322,""
"Distinguishing the Effect of Time Spent at Home during COVID-19 Pandemic on the Mental Health of Urban and Suburban College Students Using Cell Phone Geolocation","The aim of this study was to assess the correlation of depression and anxiety with time spent at home among students at two universities-one urban and the other suburban-during the COVID-19 pandemic. Geolocation data from the smartphones of 124 participants were collected between February 2021 and May 2021. The level of depression was estimated by the PHQ-9 and PHQ-2 screening tools, and anxiety scores were estimated by the GAD-2 and GAD-7 screening tools. 51% of participants in the PHQ-9 surveys indicated mild to severe depression. Participants spent on average 75% of their time at home during COVID. Time spent at home had a positive correlation with the mental health of urban students but a negative correlation with suburban students. The relation between the time at home with mental health was stronger among female participants than among male participants. Correlations between female depression, anxiety, and time at home were significant. Lockdown and distance learning contributed to the high levels of depression in university students. This research highlights the importance of time spent at home for mental health being during the pandemic and the importance of distinguishing between urban and suburban settings when formulating public health recommendations. Quality of time spent at home versus time spent outside differentiated the mental well-being of students located in different environments. Staying at home may be recommended for students without access to safe outdoor places as it is associated with lower levels of depression.","Ayranci, Bandera, Phan, Jin, Li, Kenne","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19127513","20220624","COVID-19; GAD-7; GPS; PHQ-9; anxiety; depression; home stay; mobile health; smart phone","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33323,""
"Health Promotion Behaviors of Pregnant Couples in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Actor-Partner Interdependence Model","Pregnancy during the pandemic may be a stressful life event. This cross-sectional study aimed to identify the actor and partner effects of the fear of COVID-19, depression, posttraumatic growth, and marital adjustment on the health promotion behaviors of pregnant couples during the COVID-19 pandemic in Korea. Data were collected from 123 pregnant couples using a structured questionnaire. The data were analyzed using the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model (APIM). The actor effects of the fear of COVID-19, depression, and posttraumatic growth on the health promotion behaviors of pregnant women and their spouses were significant. Furthermore, both actor and partner effects of husbands' marital adjustment on health promotion behaviors were significant. When carrying out nursing intervention for the health promotion of pregnant couples, programs aimed at reducing depression and improving posttraumatic growth in pregnant couples should be included. In addition, improving marital adjustment will positively affect the health promotion behaviors of pregnant couples. The findings highlight the important role of healthcare providers in assessing depressive symptoms and fear of COVID-19 in pregnant couples and providing support to promote health behaviors as part of prenatal care.","Kim, Kang","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19127501","20220624","COVID-19; couples; depression; fear; health behavior; health promotion; marital adjustment; posttraumatic growth; pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33324,""
"Factors That Influence the Use of Dietary Supplements among the Students of Wroclaw Medical University in Poland during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The use of dietary supplements (DS) and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs is increasing every year. The COVID-19 pandemic might additionally influence the use of such preparations. The study aimed to investigate factors influencing the use of dietary supplements (DS), including stress-relieving supplements, by the students. In the cross-sectional study, 624 students of the Wroclaw Medical University in Poland, from the second to the last year of studies, completed the anonymous questionnaire, consisting of 22 items, about the use of DS/OTC drugs during the academic year 2020/2021. Obtained data were analyzed using Pearson's chi-square test, the U-Mann Whitney test, the Kruskal-Wallis test with the post-hoc analysis, and with logistic regression. About 70% of students declared the use of any DS, 33% used DS for stress, anxiety, depression, or sleeping problems, and 59% used other DS. The most important factors influencing the decision to take any kind of DS were Division (<i>p</i> = 0.0001, odds ratio [OR]: 0.35, and confidence interval [CI]: 0.21-0.59), a self-estimated level of stress (<i>p</i> = 0.014, OR: 1.13, CI: 1.03-1.25), and self-estimated level of knowledge about DS (<i>p</i> = 0.0000, OR: 1.31, CI: 1.19-1.36). In the case of students taking DS for stress, anxiety, depression, or sleeping problems, the level of stress and the declared knowledge had the greatest impact on the decision for such a use of DS (<i>p</i> = 0.0001, OD: 1.24, CI: 1.11-1.39 and <i>p</i> = 0.0000, OD: 1.35, CI: 1.22-1.5, respectively). The COVID-19 pandemic did not change the pattern of DS/OTC drug usage in about 33% of students. Those who started taking DS during the pandemic accounted for 19% of all students. The use of DS is common among Wroclaw Medical University students with some differences between subgroups of respondents. Additionally, despite declared good knowledge about DS, most students declare the need to learn more about them.","Merwid-LÃ„â€¦d, Szandruk-Bender, Matuszewska, Trocha, Nowak, Oster, SzelÃ„â€¦g","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19127485","20220624","COVID-19 pandemic; Medical University students; OTC drugs; anxiety; depression; dietary supplements; sleeping problems; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33325,""
"Comparing Mental Health, Wellbeing and Flourishing in Undergraduate Students Pre- and during the COVID-19 Pandemic","There has been a preponderance of studies on student mental health, wellbeing and flourishing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Few studies have compared data on student mental health and wellbeing before and during the pandemic. The purpose of the current study was to compare mental health and wellbeing in undergraduate students before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Survey research was conducted with three groups of undergraduate students (n = 905) from diverse scientific fields at a large, urban university in South Africa. Data was collected by means of electronic surveys, combining full-scale items from three instruments, the Mental Health Continuum Short Form, the Flourishing Scale and the Fragility of Happiness Scale. Data was analysed by the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), the Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS) and R software. The results indicate that while the mental health and wellbeing of students declined during the pandemic concerning their perceived ability to contribute to society, having supportive and rewarding social relationships and them being engaged and interested in their daily activities, it also improved in terms of their perceived ability to manage their daily lives (environmental mastery), being challenged to grow (personal growth) and in terms of their views that society was becoming better (social growth/actualisation).","Graham, Eloff","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19127438","20220624","flourishing; flourishing scale; fragility of happiness scale; mental health continuum short form; pandemic; student mental health; student wellbeing; undergraduate students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33326,""
"Resilient or Vulnerable? Effects of the COVID-19 Crisis on the Mental Health of Refugees in Germany","Even though the COVID-19 pandemic had consequences for the whole society, like during most crises, some population groups tended to be disproportionally affected. We rely on the most recent data from the IAB-BAMF-SOEP Survey of Refugees to explore the resilience or vulnerability of refugees in the face of the pandemic. As the 2020 wave of the survey was in the field when the second nationwide lockdown started in December, we are able to apply a regression discontinuity design to analyze how refugees in Germany are coping with these measures. Our results reveal a negative effect of the lockdown on refugees' life satisfaction. Male refugees and those with a weaker support system face stronger negative outcomes than their counterparts. Since mental health is an important prerequisite for all forms of integration, understanding the related psychological needs in times of crisis can be highly important for policymakers and other stakeholders.","GoÃƒÅ¸ner, Kosyakova, Laible","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19127409","20220624","COVID-19; Germany; crisis; life satisfaction; lockdown; mental health; refugees; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33327,""
"Telephone-Administered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Body Dysmorphic Disorder: Case Series","Cognitive behavioral therapy is an effective treatment for body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), but many patients do not receive appropriate treatment due to several treatment barriers and psychosocial care structures. Low-threshold interventions, including those from the field of e-mental health, could improve access to psychotherapy. In addition to internet-administered therapy, telephone-administered therapy may reduce treatment barriers, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. This article presents four case reports of the same treatment (12 weeks of telephone-administered cognitive behavioral therapy accompanied by a workbook) applied to patients with body dysmorphic disorder during the summer of 2020. Three patients who completed the treatment had clinically relevant reductions in body dysmorphic and depressive symptoms and improved insight. One patient did not complete the telephone-administered therapy because her symptoms worsened, and she needed a more intensive form of treatment. These findings encourage future studies on the efficacy and effectiveness of telephone-administered treatment for BDD and its role in stepped-care models.","DrÃƒÂ¼ge, Roth, Watzke","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19127373","20220624","body dysmorphic disorder; case series; cognitive behavioral therapy; e-mental health; obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders; telemedicine; telephone-administered therapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33328,""
"Application of the Balance Model in the Analysis of Factors Responsible for Depressive Disorders among Women in the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the lives and mental health of people around the world, and it has become clinically essential to define risk factors in order to provide adequate prevention and support. The aim of the study was to describe coping strategies in Polish women related to the COVID-19 pandemic using the balance model, one of the most important concepts of positive psychotherapy (PPT after Peseschkian since 1977). The analysis included 735 women at the mean age of 39.61 years. The survey was conducted using the questionnaire form on the website. Based on Beck's depression test, depressive disorders were disclosed in 32.65%, and both the presence and severity of depressive syndromes were inversely correlated with age. Using a cluster analysis, three adaptation strategies could be identified, related to the different prevalence of depressive disorders. Relationships proved the most crucial area of the balance model, responsible for the effectiveness of the coping strategy. Based on the obtained results, it has to be concluded that preventive measures should primarily concern women aged &amp;lt; 25 years old and focus on strengthening the relationships area.","DobiaÃ…â€ša, GulczyÃ…â€žska, MaÃ…â€šecki, Efremova, Ã…Âawicka, KarmoliÃ…â€žska-Jagodzik, Kirillov","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19127361","20220624","COVID-19 pandemic; balance model; depression; positive psychotherapy; women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33329,""
"The Mental Health Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic Second Wave on Shielders and Their Family Members","In March 2020, individuals shielding from coronavirus reported high rates of distress. This study investigated whether fear of contamination (FoC) and use of government-recommended behaviours (GRB; e.g., handwashing and wearing masks) were associated with psychological distress during February 2021. An online cross-sectional questionnaire assessed psychological distress in three groups (shielding self, shielding other/s, and control), and those shielding others also completed an adapted measure of health anxiety (ÃŽÂ± = 0.94). The sample (<i>N</i> = 723) was predominantly female (84%) with a mean age of 41.72 (<i>SD</i> = 15.15). Those shielding (self) demonstrated significantly higher rates of health anxiety and FoC in comparison to other groups (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). The use of GRB was significantly lower in controls (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001), with no significant difference between the two shielding groups (<i>p</i> = 0.753). Rates of anxiety were higher when compared to March 2020 findings, except for controls. Hierarchical regressions indicated FoC and GRB accounted for 24% of variance in generalised anxiety (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) and 28% in health anxiety, however, the latter was a non-significant predictor in final models. Those shielding themselves and others during the pandemic have experienced sustained levels of distress; special consideration must be given to those indirectly affected. Psychological interventions should account for realistic FoC and the impact of government-recommended health behaviours, as these factors are associated with distress in vulnerable groups and may extend beyond the pandemic. Future research should focus on longitudinal designs to monitor and better understand the clinical needs of those shielding, and those shielding others post-pandemic.","Daniels, Rettie","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19127333","20220624","anxiety; behaviour; contamination; coronavirus; shielding","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33330,""
"""It's All COVID's Fault!"": Symptoms of Distress among Workers in an Italian General Hospital during the Pandemic","Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers (HCWs) have been faced with specific stressors endangering their physical and mental health and their functioning. This study aimed to assess the short-term psychological health of a sample of Italian HCWs and the related influencing factors. In particular, the study focused on the differences related to HCWs' gender and to having been directly in charge of COVID-19 patients or not. An online survey was administered to the whole staff of the Modena General University Hospital three months after the onset of the pandemic, in 2020. Demographic data and changes in working and living conditions related to COVID-19 were collected; mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). 1172 out of 4788 members returned the survey (response rate = 24.5%), the male/female ratio was 30/70%. Clinically significant symptoms assessed according to the DASS-21 emerged among 21.0% of the respondents for depression, 22.5% for anxiety and 27.0% for stress. Symptoms suggestive of a traumatic reaction were reported by 19.0% of the sample. Symptoms of psychological distress were statistically associated with female gender, job role, ward, changes in lifestyle, whereas first-line work with COVID-19 patients was statistically associated with more stress symptoms. HCWs reported a significant level of psychological distress that could reach severe clinical significance and impact dramatically their quality of life and functioning. Considering the persistence of the international emergency, effective strategies to anticipate, recognize and address distress in HCWs are essential, also because they may impact the organization and effectiveness of healthcare systems.","Mastroberardino, Cuoghi Costantini, De Novellis, Ferrari, Filippini, Longo, Marchi, Rioli, Valeo, Vicini, Galeazzi, D'Amico, Vandelli","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19127313","20220624","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; distress; healthcare workers; pandemic; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33331,""
"Longitudinal Predictors of Coronavirus-Related PTSD among Young Adults from Poland, Germany, Slovenia, and Israel","The aim of this study was to reveal longitudinal predictors of coronavirus-related PTSD and the moderating roles of country, sex, age, and student status among young adults from Poland, Germany, Slovenia, and Israel. We included the following predictors: perceived stress, exposure to COVID-19, perceived impact of COVID-19 on well-being in socioeconomic status (PNIC-SES) and social relationships (PNIC-SR), fear of COVID-19, fear of vaccination, and trust in institutions. We conducted the study online among a representative sample of 1723 young adults aged 20-40 (<i>M</i> = 30.74, <i>SD</i> = 5.74) years in February 2021 (T1) and May-June 2021 (T2). We used McNemar's <i>Ãâ€¡</i><sup>2</sup> and the paired samples Student's <i>t</i>-test to test differences over time. We assessed the relationships between variables using Pearson's correlation. We performed structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine the associations between variables at T1 and T2. We used a lagged regression model to examine the causal influences between variables across different time points (T1 and T2). The results showed that all variables decreased over time, except exposure to COVID-19. The rates of infected, tested, and under-quarantine participants increased. The rates of those who lost a job and experienced worsening economic status decreased. The rate of hospitalized participants and those experiencing the loss of close ones did not change. Higher perceived stress, fear of COVID-19, fear of vaccination, and trust in institutions were significant longitudinal predictors of coronavirus-related PTSD regardless of country, sex, age, and student status. Institutions should provide more accurate programs for public health, so trust in institutions can be a protective and not a risk factor in future traumatic events.","Ochnik, Rogowska, ArzenÃ…Â¡ek, Benatov","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19127207","20220624","COVID-19; coronavirus-related PTSD; mental health; trust in institutions; young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33332,""

However, adolescents were likely particularly impacted by such measures due to this time being key for social and educational development. This qualitative study explored young people's experiences of lockdowns and school closures. Fifteen secondary schools within south-west England were initially contacted and three schools participated in recruitment efforts. From December 2020 to March 2021, 25 students aged 14-15 participated in a combination of individual interviews (<i>n</i> = 5) and focus groups (<i>n</i> = 3). Findings revealed diverse experiences of the pandemic and highlighted the complexity of experiences according to individual student contexts. Three main themes were identified: (1) Learning environments; (2) Connection to peers; (3) Transition, adaptation and coping. These findings highlight the value young people place on face-to-face social contact with close friends, and the sense of structure provided by school, with implications for future home-based learning. Further in-depth qualitative research is needed to continue to understand the varied experiences during the course of the pandemic, particularly longer-term impacts on mental health and learning.","Widnall, Adams, Plackett, Winstone, Haworth, Mars, Kidger","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19127163","20220624","COVID-19; adolescence; mental health; peer relationships; qualitative methods; school closures","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33333,""
"Predictors of Vaccine Hesitancy among Health Care Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Most studies of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among health care workers (HCWs) have been descriptive, few have tested models to predict hesitancy, and none have examined the possible relationship between HCWs' distress and vaccine hesitancy. This study examined predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, including HCWs' distress after taking into account HCW sex, doctoral-level status, race, age, and exposure to COVID-19. Further, it examined specific reasons HCWs endorsed for their hesitancy. 266 HCWs in the United States (U.S.). completed an online survey administered in January 2021, following the availability of the vaccine for HCWs in the U.S. The survey assessed demographics, depression, anxiety, COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, and reasons for hesitancy. A comprehensive linear regression model explained 72.2% of the variance in COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. HCWs were more hesitant if they did not know someone personally who had tested positive. Distress had no effect. The reasons most predicting vaccine hesitancy included safety, potential side effects, believing the risks from COVID-19 were lower than from the vaccine, not feeling at risk for getting COVID-19, and current pregnancy. Rather than rely on providing information about the COVID-19 vaccines to HCWs, strategies that address their concerns are required to promote vaccine acceptance. Contemporary issues of political polarization, misinformation and mistrust are likely to contribute to the concerns HCWs have about the COVID-19 vaccines.","Elliott, Perrin, Powers, Jacobi, Warren","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19127123","20220624","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; health care providers; vaccine hesitancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33334,""
"Alteration of Inflammatory Parameters and Psychological Post-Traumatic Syndrome in Long-COVID Patients","The aim of our study is to evaluate the correlation between the psychological status of patients recovered from SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) infection (long-COVID patients) and their inflammatory status. Three months after hospital discharge, ninety-three patients were recruited and categorized into two distinct populations: control and long-COVID (COrona VIrus Disease) group. Patients belonging to the control group presented with an entering diagnosis of cardiovascular, metabolic, or respiratory disease and a negative history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas the long-COVID population presented with a severe SARS-CoV-2 infection treated in the sub-intensive Care Unit. Psychological evaluation was performed through the administration of the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL90) and LDH (Lactate dehydrogenase), ferritin, CRPhs (C-high sensitivity Reactive Protein), NLR (Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio), PLR (Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio), and SII (systemic immune-inflammation index) were investigated. We highlighted that beyond the first three months after contagion, patients recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection are characterized by the persistence of a systemic inflammatory state and are at high risk for developing somatization, depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances. Interestingly, ferritin value was strongly correlated with sleep disorders (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05).

The purpose was to determine the effect of homophily on participants' perceptions or knowledge of TIC training. Mental Health America of Greater Houston (MHAGH) offered TIC training from 2019 to 2020 to Texas educators (<i>N</i> Ã¢â€°Ë† 29,900) from nine school districts that experienced significant natural and human-made traumatic events. Proportional stratified random samples were selected based on trainer type (experts vs. peer trainers). Perception was measured with close-ended items on five-point scales. Knowledge was measured with content-specific questions. Independent <i>t</i>-tests and two-way ANOVA revealed no significant interaction effects (i.e., trainer and test type) and no differences existed in perception or knowledge by trainer type. TIC training can be equally effective when delivered by homophilous peers (i.e., school staff) and heterophilous experts (i.e., mental health experts). COVID-19 worsened the effects of ACEs and youth mental health issues. High-quality training will increase school staff's use of TIC practices. MHAGH's train-the-trainer model helps educators supporting youth affected by ACEs and other life stressors.","Zickafoose, Wingenbach, Haddad, Freeny, Engels","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19127104","20220624","COVID-19; adverse childhood experiences; mental health; train-the-trainer","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33336,""
"Evaluating the Prevalence and Predictors of Moderate to Severe Depression in Fort McMurray, Canada during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has produced adverse health consequences, including mental health consequences. Studies indicate that residents of Fort McMurray, a community which has experienced trauma from flooding and wildfires in the past, may be more vulnerable to the mental health effects of the pandemic. This study aimed to examine the prevalence and predictors of likely Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) among residents of Fort McMurray during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional approach was adopted utilizing an online survey questionnaire to gather sociodemographic data, COVID-19 related data, and clinical information, including likely MDD using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scale, from the residents of Fort McMurray between the period of 24 April to 2 June 2021. Overall, 186 individuals completed the survey out of 249 residents who accessed the online survey, yielding a completion rate of 74.7%. The prevalence of likely MDD among respondents was 45%. Respondents willing to receive mental health counselling were five times more likely to experience MDD during the COVID-19 pandemic (OR = 5.48; 95% CI: 1.95-15.40). Respondents with a history of depression were nearly five folds more likely to report MDD during the era of the pandemic than residents without a history of depression (OR = 4.64; 95% CI: 1.49-14.44). Similarly, respondents with a history of taking hypnotics (sleeping tablets) were nearly six-fold more likely to express MDD than respondents with no history of receiving sleeping tablets (OR = 5.72; 95% CI: 1.08-30.30). Finally, respondents who reported receiving only partial support from the employer had three times higher odds of having likely MDD than those who received absolute support from the employer (OR = 3.50; 95% CI: 1.24-9.82). In addition to the effect of the pandemic and other measures taken to curb the psychopathological impact of the pandemic, policymakers need to implement policies to manage individuals with preexisting mental health conditions and provide strong employer support.","Obuobi-Donkor, Eboreime, Shalaby, Agyapong, Oluwasina, Adu, Owusu, Mao, Agyapong","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19127090","20220624","COVID-19; Fort Mcmurray; Major Depressive Disorder; employer support; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33337,""
"Mental Health during COVID-19 Pandemic: Qualitative Perceptions among Lithuanian Adolescents","Since the COVID-19 pandemic emerged, humanity has had to face unprecedented change in daily routines. Therefore, the pandemic has also had an impact on mental health. Most of the literature analyzes adult experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, while the youth is less investigated. The purpose of this study was to reveal adolescent experiences during COVID-19. This qualitative study consisted of 19 adolescents from 11-17 years old. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted, and thematic analysis was applied. Five themes were identified: ambivalent feelings; daily routine changes; disappointment with distance education; coping strategies; and discoveries. The study revealed adolescents' mostly negative feelings such as sadness, anger, loneliness, or boredom. They shared about frustrating daily routine changes and shifting to a distance education mode that was quite limited in effectiveness and convenience. Nonetheless, communication with family, peers, pets, active leisure, and favorite activities helped them to cope with the difficulties during COVID-19. During this period, adolescents had more free time for themselves and personal growth, found new activities, or improved some relationships. Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic had mostly negative side effects, and regardless of positive experiences, it was mainly considered by adolescents as an adversity for their mental health.","LukoÃ…Â¡eviÃ„ÂiÃ…Â«tÃ„â€”, Ã…Â migelskas","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19127086","20220624","COVID-19; adolescent; mental health; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33338,""
"The Influence of Sociodemographic Factors on Symptoms of Anxiety, the Level of Aggression and Alcohol Consumption in the Time of the COVID-19 Pandemic among Polish Respondents","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the mental health of most of the world's population. The authors of this study decided to identify differences in the intensity of anxiety, aggression and alcohol consumption within the study population. The study was conducted via an Internet survey. It uses Polish adaptations of international scales to assess anxiety (GAD-7), aggression (Buss and Perry Aggression Scale) and alcohol consumption (AUDIT test). A total of 538 people were examined. The surveyed group of respondents does not reflect the structure of Polish society. The group of surveyed women scored higher than men in terms of anxiety, as well as anger and hostility. The examined men were characterized by higher results of alcohol consumption and physical aggression. People between 18 and 49 years of age consumed significantly more alcohol than people aged 50 and over. People aged 18-29 obtained statistically significantly higher scores in generalized aggression and hostility. The relationships between the studied parameters do not differ significantly from those presented in other studies. People under the age of 50 are the group most exposed to the harmful effects of alcohol. Women between the ages of 30 and 49 are most vulnerable to the negative mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a need for further research studies in which the studied group will obtain a greater degree of compliance with the structure of Polish society.","Florek, Piegza, DÃ„â„¢bski, Gorczyca, Pudlo","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19127081","20220624","COVID-19; aggression; alcohol consumption; anxiety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33339,""
"Factors Predicting Post-Traumatic Positive and Negative Psychological Changes Experienced by Nurses during a Pandemic COVID-19: A Cross-Sectional Study","It is common knowledge that COVID-19 affects physiopathological changes in all systems of the human body. On the other hand, events related to the COVID-19 pandemic also have a significant impact on the social and mental sphere of human functioning. The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between selected sociodemographic variables and selected subjective cognitive resources, and the positive and negative perception of the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic in a group of nurses working in Poland. The computer-assisted web interviewing method was conducted between 1 and 15 May 2020. Participants were requested to complete the following questionnaires: The Changes in Outlook Questionnaire (CIOQ), The Impact Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), The Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), The Safety Experience Questionnaire (SEQ), and The Meaning in Life Questionnaire (MLQ). Three-hundred and twenty fivenurses working all over Poland participated in the study. Their mean age was 39.18 Ã‚Â± 11.16 years. A higher average level was noted among the surveyed nurses in the Positive Change subscale (18.56 Ã‚Â± 4.04). In a multivariate model, taking into account both sociodemographic and cognitive variables, the level of perceived traumatic stress, the level of social support, a sense of security, reflection on safety and a sense of meaning and meaning in life were independent predictors of a positive perception of the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Those variables explained as much as 37% of the dependent variable, and the nature of the relationship was positive. While we are still a long way from understanding the full range of the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and psychosocial well-being, it is possible that in this challenging context there are many individual resources available to perceive the effects of the current pandemic positively. Therefore, they should be strengthened through the development and implementation of intervention programs to improve the mental state of nurses.","Nowicki, Ã…Å¡lusarska, Zboina, JÃ„â„¢drzejewska, Kotus","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19127073","20220624","COVID-19; changes in outlook; influencing factors; nurses; pandemic; post-traumatic growth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33340,""
"Perceived Epidemic Risk and Depression Symptoms during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Mediating Role of Security and the Moderation Role of Perceived Discrimination","The 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic has resulted in a significant increase in the incidence and prevalence of mental health problems such as anxiety and depression, posing a threat to peoples' lives and health safety all over the world. Research suggests some potential relationships among perceived risk, discrimination, security, and depression symptoms. However, little attention has been paid to the complex mechanisms of the associations between these variables. This study aimed to examine the mediating role of security and moderation role of perceived discrimination in the prediction of perceived epidemic risk on depression symptoms. Thus, we aimed to identify if perceived epidemic risk is a positive predictor of depression. A cross-sectional study was conducted through an anonymous online survey in China during the COVID-19 pandemic which measured perceived epidemic risk, discrimination, security, and depression symptoms. A total of 3443 valid questionnaires were obtained. The results indicated that depression symptoms were predicted by perceived epidemic risk through the mediating role of security, and this mediating role of security was moderated by perceived discrimination. Specifically, high levels of perceived discrimination may lead to a significant decrease in personal security, thus clustering depressive symptoms. These findings shed light on the influence of the perceived risk of the epidemic on depression symptoms in the context of the epidemic situation, which may help to develop targeted interventions.","Hu, Shu, Zhang, Wang, Yu, Cui","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19127054","20220624","depression symptoms; mediated moderation model; perceived discrimination; perceived epidemic risk; security","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33341,""
"Perceived Satisfaction with Online Study during COVID-19 Lockdown Correlates Positively with Resilience and Negatively with Anxiety, Depression, and Stress among Slovenian Postsecondary Students","The purpose of this study is to fill the research gap regarding the influence of satisfaction with distance learning on the correlates of mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online cross-sectional study was conducted in February and March 2021, involving 4661 postsecondary students. Five validated instruments-PHQ-9 (depression), GAD-7 (anxiety), PSS-4 (stress), CD-RISC-10 (resilience) and SAT-5 (satisfaction with online study)-were used in the present study. The correlations between anxiety, depression, and stress were so high that they were almost inextricably linked. Both satisfaction with online learning and psychological resilience were negatively correlated with anxiety, depression, and stress. Satisfaction with online learning was also negatively correlated with psychological resilience. Females showed higher levels of vulnerability to anxiety, depression, and stress, and exhibited lower levels of psychological resilience than males. Home-based distance-learning during the COVID-19-induced lockdown had a significant impact on students' mental health. Low satisfaction with distance learning can lead to the development of anxiety and depression symptoms, increase stress, and decrease the psychological resilience of postsecondary students; therefore, it is critical that educational institutions focus on implementing interventions that promote students' satisfaction with distance learning, and their psychological resilience, to protect their mental health.","Gabrovec, Selak, CrnkoviÃ„Â, Cesar, Ã…Â orgo","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19127024","20220624","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; online study; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33342,""
"Symptoms of Anxiety, Depression, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder in Health Care Personnel in Norwegian ICUs during the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic, a Prospective, Observational Cross-Sectional Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has induced demanding work situations in intensive care units (ICU).

From May to July 2020, this cross-sectional study included 484 ICU professionals from 27 hospitals throughout Norway. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were measured on Hopkins Symptom Checklist-10 (HSCL-10). Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were measured on the PCL-5. The study population were highly educated and experienced professionals, well prepared for working with COVID-ICU patients. However, 53% felt socially isolated and 67% reported a fear of infecting others. Probable cases of anxiety and depression were found in 12.5% of the registered nurses, 11.6% of the physicians, and 4.1% of the leaders. Younger age and &amp;lt;5 years previous work experiences were predictors for high HSCL-10 scores. Reported symptom-defined PTSD for nurses 7.1%; the leaders, 4.1%; and 2.3% of physicians.

"Synthesizing Stakeholders Perspectives on Online Psychological Interventions to Improve the Mental Health of the Italian Population during the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Online Survey Study","The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to significantly increase the prevalence of mental health problems, thus raising the need for psychological support interventions around the world. Online psychological interventions have already been shown to be an effective solution to promote psychological treatments. Nevertheless, planning and developing an online intervention, involving possible stakeholders, might facilitate the dissemination of, willingness to use, and success of the future intervention. This study aims to explore and compare the experiences that Italians living in Italy and abroad had with available support services during the COVID-19 pandemic, their needs, and attitudes, as well as possible barriers to online psychological interventions. A sample of 1024 Italians (F = 69.8%; mean age = 41.3; SD = 15.3) was recruited through social media platforms and personal contacts and they were asked to complete an online survey. Results showed that perceived psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic improved. In Europe, psychological support was delivered mainly in person (69.0%), while online interventions were primarily used in extra-European countries (57%). Then, only 44% of the total sample was interested in trying an online psychological intervention. Various advantages and disadvantages were defined by stakeholders: The main advantages were the reduction in geographical distances, economic reasons, and the reduction in the waiting list; The main disadvantages were problems with technology, low motivation of users, and privacy/safety reasons. These data made it possible to improve the knowledge regarding the views and attitudes that Italians have about online psychological interventions, and shed light on how to increase the uptake of digital health.","Bertuzzi, Semonella, Castelnuovo, Andersson, Pietrabissa","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19127008","20220624","COVID-19; clinical psychology; online psychological intervention; stakeholders survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33344,""
"Mental Well-Being and Sexual Intimacy among Men and Gender Diverse People Who Have Sex with Men during the First UK COVID-19 Lockdown: A Mixed-Methods Study","This mixed-methods study aimed to explore mental well-being, circumstances and strategies around managing sexual intimacy and risk during the first UK COVID-19 lockdown (Spring 2020) among men and gender diverse people who have sex with men (MGDPSM), commencing while lockdown was in progress. n = 1429 MGDPSM completed the survey and 14 undertook an in-depth interview. Low mental well-being was reported by 49.6% of the survey participants. Low mental well-being was not predicted by relationship and living circumstance, sexual networking app use, or by casual sexual partners. Low mental well-being was associated with more frequent COVID-19 anxiety (OR = 5.08 CI: 3.74, 6.88 <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) and with younger age (18-24 years OR = 2.23 CI:1.41-3.53 <i>p</i> = 0.001, 25-34 years OR = 1.45 CI:1.04-2.02 <i>p</i> = 0.029, 35-44 years OR = 1.41 CI:1.00-1.99 <i>p</i> = 0.052). The interview participants understood their lockdown experiences as being relative to normalcy, and those experiencing more dramatic changes faced greater challenges. Living with partners was felt to protect well-being. Many participants reported intimacy interruption challenges. The findings indicate that mental well-being is predicted by age and COVID-19 impact, highlighting opportunities for targeting MGDPSM who are most vulnerable to poor mental health. Services that support MGDPSM during COVID-19 recovery efforts must provide non-judgemental and affirming support.","Edelman, Witzel, Samba, Nutland, Nadarzynski","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19126985","20220624","COVID-19; MSM; gender-diverse; intimacy; mental health; mixed-methods; sexual behaviour; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33345,""
"Is Team Resilience More Than the Sum of Its Parts? A Quantitative Study on Emergency Healthcare Teams during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, emergency healthcare workers have come under even more pressure than before, threatening the workers' mental health and the continuity of care delivered by their teams. This study aims to investigate what conditions increase individual and team resilience, referring to the ability to ""bounce back"" from stressful situations. We also assess whether team resilience is the sum of the individual resilience of team members, or whether other conditions enhance team resilience and thus continuity of care, despite limited individual resilience. We collected survey data from 129 emergency healthcare team members in the Netherlands to examine to what extent transformational leadership and team familiarity influence the level of team resilience, either directly or mediated by individual resilience, accounting for psychological characteristics and social support. The results show two distinct pathways to enhance team resilience, directly by familiarizing team members with each other and by mobilizing family support, and indirectly but with a much weaker effect, by encouraging team members' individual resilience through transformational leadership and staffing optimistic team members with high levels of self-efficacy.","Hendrikx, Vermeulen, Wientjens, Mannak","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19126968","20220624","COVID-19 pandemic; emergency healthcare; individual resilience; mental health; optimism; self-efficacy; social support; team familiarity; team resilience; transformational leadership","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33346,""
"The Impact of World Trade Center Related Medical Conditions on the Severity of COVID-19 Disease and Its Long-Term Sequelae","The individuals who served our country in the aftermath of the attacks on the World Trade Center (WTC) following the attacks of 11 September 2001 have, since then, been diagnosed with a number of conditions as a result of their exposures. In the present study, we sought to determine whether these conditions were risk factors for increased COVID-19 disease severity within a cohort of N = 1280 WTC responders with complete information on health outcomes prior to and following COVID-19 infection. We collected data on responders diagnosed with COVID-19, or had evidence of receiving positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction or antigen testing, or were asymptomatic but had IgG positive antibody testing. The presence of post-acute COVID-19 sequelae was measured using self-reported symptom severity scales. Analyses revealed that COVID-19 severity was associated with age, Black race, obstructive airway disease (OAD), as well as with worse self-reported depressive symptoms. Similarly, post-acute COVID-19 sequelae was associated with initial analysis for COVID-19 severity, upper respiratory disease (URD), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), OAD, heart disease, and higher depressive symptoms. We conclude that increased COVID-19 illness severity and the presence of post-acute COVID-19 sequelae may be more common in WTC responders with chronic diseases than in those responders without chronic disease processes resulting from exposures at the WTC disaster.","Lhuillier, Yang, Morozova, Clouston, Yang, Waszczuk, Carr, Luft","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19126963","20220624","9/11 disaster; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; comorbidities; post-acute COVID-19 syndrome; severity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33347,""

All subjects included 17-year-old male adolescents. A total of 117 subjects were assigned to one of four groups according to the degree of depression based on item #6 in the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) questionnaire as follows: no-depression group (NDG, <i>n</i> = 71; 61.0%), low-depression group (LDG, <i>n</i> = 23; 19.0%), moderate-depression group (MDG, <i>n</i> = 15; 13.0%), and high-depression group (HDG, <i>n</i> = 8; 7.0%). This study analyzed the data using quantitative and qualitative methods to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic affects adolescents' daily lives, psychophysiological conditions, and immune function. This study found that the COVID-19 pandemic significantly affects the daily lifestyle pattern, psychophysical condition, and immunocytes of adolescents. In terms of depression, 39.0% of adolescents felt depressed, and 7% of them felt depressed almost every day. Overall, HDG considered themselves unhealthy and felt prone to immune diseases, such as colds. HDG were prone to sleep late, eat more frequently, and work out less. Regarding physical fitness factors, the cardiorespiratory endurance, strength, and power of HDG were significantly lower than those of NDG, LDG, and MDG. Moreover, HDG had the worst body composition, including the lowest muscle mass. Finally, natural killer (NK) cells and T cells were significantly different among groups, with the levels in HDG being significantly lower than those of the other three groups.

"Utility of Teleorthodontics in Orthodontic Emergencies during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review","<b>Background.</b> Coronavirus disease has subjected the whole of humanity to two years of social isolation and a series of restrictions. These circumstances have led to the use of information technology in an increasingly widespread manner. Even in the dental field, telematic means have been used to respond to emergencies. The aim of this systematic review of the literature is to evaluate the types of orthodontic emergency that occurred most often and how they were managed by teleorthodontics during the COVID-19 pandemic. The secondary aim is that clinicians will use teleorthodontics not only during pandemics but as an additional tool to manage orthodontics. <b>Materials and Methods.</b> Out of 1695 articles available on PubMed, Science Direct, Cochrane and SciELO, eight articles were selected for this systematic literature review. Google Scholar was used as a secondary source to confirm that there were no additional articles. The screened papers comprised editorials, clinical studies, cross-sectional studies and retrospective studies in Italian, English or Spanish language. <b>Results.</b> The articles showed that the means by which patients most often communicated with their orthodontists were voice calls and smartphone applications such as WhatsApp<sup>Ã‚Â®</sup> Messenger. Through these media, patients communicated their orthodontic emergencies. These mainly involved fixed multibracket appliances and the most common issues were discomfort and pain, fracture or loss of the appliance, protruding distal ends of archwires, brackets, tubes and bands or retainer detachment. Through teleorthodontics, patients could solve these issues by using orthodontic relief wax, cutting the protruding distal ends of the archwire with a nail clipper or a stronger cutter and removing or replacing detached bands, brackets, tubes or metallic ligature with a clean tweezer. <b>Conclusions.</b> In situations where personal contact is limited, teleorthodontics represents a valuable aid for professionals and patients facing orthodontic emergencies. The hope is that it may continue to represent a valuable aid for patients with difficulties in planning an in-office visit.","Saccomanno, Quinzi, Albani, D'Andrea, Marzo, Macchiarelli","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10061108","20220624","COVID-19; clear aligners; fixed multibracket orthodontics; gum swelling; mucosal injuries; oral care; oral pain; orthodontic device; orthodontic urgencies; teleorthodontics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33351,""
"The Moderated Mediating Effect of Hope, Self-Efficacy and Resilience in the Relationship between Post-Traumatic Growth and Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic","As a major life trauma, COVID-19 had negative impacts on psychological well-being. The aim of this study was to test and verify the mediation of resilience, hope and self-efficacy and to analyze the moderating effect of gender and COVID-19 contagion on the association between symptoms of anxiety, stress and depression, and post-traumatic growth among adults during COVID-19. A cross-sectional study was conducted via an online survey with self-administered questionnaires. The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale, the Post-traumatic Growth Inventory, the Resilience Scale, the General Self-Efficacy Scale, and the Comprehensive State Hope Scale were used. A total of 493 <i>(n</i> = 262 female and <i>n =</i> 231 male) participated in the survey (<i>M<sub>age</sub></i> = 33.40 years, <i>SD</i> = 13.41, range = 20 to 60). A multiple mediation model was used to verify the mediating effect of resilience, hope and self-efficacy on the relationship between symptoms of anxiety, stress and depression, and PTG. A moderated mediation model was examined to find and test the moderated effects of gender and COVID-19 contagion on the mediation model. Results showed the indirect effects of anxiety (ÃŽÂ² = 0.340 (0.120); 95% CI [from 0.128 to 0.587]) and depression (ÃŽÂ² = 0.222 (0.095); 95% CI [0.048, 0.429]) on PTG trough resilience and hope. Symptoms of anxiety, stress and depression, and self-efficacy were significantly highest in females. Moreover, males and participants with COVID-19 contagion had significantly higher levels of resilience and post-traumatic growth. These findings suggest that hope and resilience, as protective factors, could be an important key to developing an intervention strategy to enhance and improve psychological health during a crisis.","Di Corrado, Muzii, Magnano, Coco, La Paglia, Maldonato","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10061091","20220624","COVID-19; hope; mental health; post-traumatic growth; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33352,""
"Subjective Wellbeing and Its Associated Factors among University Community during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Northern Malaysia","Lockdown implementation during COVID-19 pandemic has caused many negative impacts in various aspect of life, including in the academic world. Routine disruption to teaching and learning environment has raised concerns to the wellbeing of university staff and students. This study aimed to examine the subjective wellbeing of the university community in Northern Malaysia during lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic and the factors affecting it. An online cross-sectional survey involving 1148 university staff and students was conducted between March and April 2020. The research tools include the Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI) to assess subjective wellbeing and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress 21 (DASS-21) scale for psychological distress. While we found the subjective wellbeing score in our study population was stable at 7.67 (1.38), there was high prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress with 27.4%, 18.4%, and 11.5%, respectively. The students reported higher levels of psychological distress compared to staff. The PWI score was seen to be inversely affected by the depression and stress score with a reduction in the PWI score by 0.022 (95% CI -0.037 to -0.007) and 0.046 (95% CI -0.062 to -0.030) with every one-unit increment for each subscale, respectively. Those who perceived to have more difficulty due to the lockdown also reported low subjective wellbeing. Thus, it is crucial to ensure policies and preventative measures are in place to provide conducive teaching and learning environment. Additionally, the detrimental psychological effects especially among students should be addressed proactively.","Dinsuhaimi, Ab Razak, Liza-Sharmini, Wan Mohammad, Yaakub, Othman, Daud, Musa, Draman, Besari","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10061083","20220624","COVID-19; lockdown; subjective wellbeing; university community","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33353,""
"Factors Associated with the Level of Physical Activity in Middle-Aged Colombian People during Lockdown in Response to COVID-19: A Cross-Sectional Study","(1) Background: Due to the pandemic caused by COVID-19, mandatory confinement was declared, which generated a decrease in the practice of physical activity (PA). Based on this problem, it was proposed to study the associations between PA in relation to depressive symptoms, quality of sleep, and the quality of life of middle-aged people who work in the university context during compulsory confinement as a result of COVID-19. (2) Methods: A total of 336 middle-aged people (48 Ã‚Â± 6.67) participated in this analytical cross-sectional study. The variable levels of PA, quality of sleep, symptoms of depression, and quality of life were measured with the International Physical Activity Questionary (IPAQ), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (ZSDS), and the SF-12v2 questionnaire, respectively. (3) Results: A logistic regression model was used to analyze the relationships between the level of PA and depressive symptoms (OR = 2.053), total sleep duration (OR = 0.495), sleep disturbances (OR = 2.414), quality of sleep (OR = 2.471), use of sleep medication (OR = 0.348), daytime dysfunction (OR = 1.809), general health (OR = 0.949), and physical functioning (OR = 0.987).

"The Psychological Impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 on Patients Attending a Tertiary Healthcare Facility in Pakistan: A Cross-Sectional Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a damaging impact on global health. Post-infection, patients may experience mental health difficulties and therefore require suitable psychological treatment and support. The objective of this study was to identify the psychological impact of COVID-19 on patients who were recovering from the physical effects of the disease, and to examine socio-demographic correlates within one month of treatment at a tertiary healthcare facility in Pakistan. A cross-sectional study was employed that utilized the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist for DSM-5. A questionnaire was administered to 250 patients, with data collected over three months. Mild to extremely severe scores of depression, anxiety and stress were reported by approximately 43%, 52% and 42% of participants, respectively, and 8% developed PTSD. The incidence of depression, anxiety, stress or PTSD was not significantly associated with gender, age or previous interaction with COVID-19 patients. Depression was significantly associated with levels of education, severity of COVID-19 disease and a patient's current condition. Anxiety was associated with healthcare worker status. The severity of disease and a patient's current condition were also linked to the levels of anxiety, stress and the presence of PTSD. Collectively, these results indicate that a high percentage of patients recovering from COVID-19 experience psychological distress.","Ali, Iftikhar, Amat-Ur-Rasool, Ahmed, Hafeez, Carter","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10061049","20220624","COVID-19 psychological impact; PTSD; anxiety; depression; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33355,""
"Impacts of COVID-19 Sanitary Cues on Hedonic Appreciation of Foods","The COVID-19 pandemic led to several lifestyle changes, including eating behavior. Herein, we aimed to evaluate how pandemic-related sanitary cues presented in food videos impact food appraisal and desire to eat, and their priming after-effects on subsequent food pictures presented without such cues. In two online sessions, separated by 4 to 7 days, participants watched either a Non-Pandemic or a Pandemic video of a woman eating, the latter containing sanitary elements adopted during the pandemic. The order of the videos was counterbalanced across participants over the two experimental sessions. Videos were followed by images of food from different categories. After observing both videos and each picture, participants were instructed to evaluate the visual aspect, expected smell and flavor, and rate their desire to eat. Our study demonstrated (1) higher hedonic responses to the Non-Pandemic compared to the Pandemic video, (2) a priming effect showing higher appreciation for sweet foods after the Non-Pandemic compared to the Pandemic video, (3) that food exposure gradually increases one's desire to eat, but such effects are impacted by pandemic sanitary cues, and (4) greater hedonic responses are given for sweet and high-calorie foods compared to salty and low-calorie ones, irrespective of pandemic priming. Finally, depression and anxiety symptoms were associated with lower smell evaluations only in the Pandemic condition.","Oliveira, Sampaio, Lapenta","https://doi.org/10.3390/foods11121753","20220624","COVID-19; dietary preferences; eating behavior; food choice; multisensory food perception","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33356,""

"Psychiatric reaction of an intensive care unit survivor in the context of coronavirus disease 2019: a case report","The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has had a serious impact on global mental health, particularly in intensive care unit survivors. Given the lethal potential and unpredictability of coronavirus disease 2019, a high risk of posttraumatic stress disorder was identified in the beginning of the crisis. There are insufficient details in current literature and no official guidelines available for the treatment and follow-up of acute stress disorder and the prevention of posttraumatic stress disorder for intensive care unit survivors in the context of coronavirus disease 2019. We hereby describe a 67-year-old Swiss patient presenting a psychiatric reaction in the context of coronavirus disease 2019. He was admitted to the intensive care unit due to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and intubated for 13 days. Afterwards, there was a severe worsening of acute renal failure prompting hemodialysis, and he developed delirium. Psychiatric liaison was requested 4 days post-intubation because the patient presented residual symptoms of delirium, false memories about the real context of his medical care, and ideas of persecution toward medical caregivers. He suffered from a very strong peritraumatic reaction, then developed an acute stress disorder linked with his care on the intensive care unit. We looked for strategies to prevent progression from acute stress disorder to posttraumatic stress disorder. We proceeded to the following therapeutic interventions: intensive psychiatric follow-up, intensive care unit diary, and low-dose antipsychotic treatment. The aim of our psychotherapeutic approach was to allow him to increase his feeling of security and to cope with the reality of his traumatic experience. He showed clinical improvement in his mental state after 3Ã‚Â months, despite several predictive factors of evolution to post-intensive care unit posttraumatic stress disorder. This case report illustrates how a delusional clinical presentation after intensive care in the context of coronavirus disease 2019 can hide psychotraumatic symptoms. It is important to highlight that the intensive care unit diary completed by the intensive care team and the follow-up by the psychiatric liaison team helped the patient reconstruct an appropriate and coherent account. Further studies are needed to determine the psychiatric effects of coronavirus disease 2019 and to assess early and appropriate psychiatric intervention for patients hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 to prevent posttraumatic stress disorder.","Benzakour, Kakoraiti, Perrin, Cereghetti, Assal","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13256-022-03450-3","20220623","Acute stress disorder (ASD); COVID-19; Case report; Liaison psychiatry; Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33359,""
"A Trying Time: Problematic Internet Use (PIU) and its association with depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The prevalence of problematic Internet use (PIU) among adolescents and young adults (AYA) was approximately 9-11% before the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of PIU among AYAs (especially younger adolescents) during the COVID-19 pandemic using the Problematic and Risky Internet Use Screening Scale (PRIUSS). Additionally, we examined the relationship between PIU, depression and anxiety among AYAs during the same period. A descriptive-analysis survey study was completed over a 6-month period from January 4, 2021, to June 30, 2021. It was conducted at a tertiary care Adolescent Medicine Clinic with AYAs age 12-21. The PRIUSS screened for PIU, the PHQ-9A [Patient Health Questionnaire-9A] screened for depression, and the GAD-7 [General Anxiety Disorder-7] screened for generalized anxiety. Fisher's exact test, the Mann-Whitney test and Spearman correlations were performed. A positive PRIUSS score was observed in 18% of the 447 participants. Of these participants, 44% had a pre-existing diagnosis of depression, 39% had a pre-existing diagnosis of anxiety and 29% had a pre-existing diagnosis of depression and anxiety. There was a positive correlation between PRIUSS, PHQ-9A and GAD-7 total scores. A higher PRIUSS score was associated with a higher PHQ-9A and GAD-7 score (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). There was also a positive correlation between a positive PRIUSS score and a pre-existing diagnosis of depression (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). This study showed a higher prevalence of PIU during the COVID-19 pandemic using the PRIUSS. In addition, a positive correlation between PRIUSS scores and pre-existing diagnosis of depression, positive GAD-7 and PHQ-9A scores was noted.

"Locked in and locked out: sequelae of a pandemic for distressed and vulnerable teenagers in Ireland : Post-COVID rise in psychiatry assessments of teenagers presenting to the emergency department out-of-hours at an adult Irish tertiary hospital","The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on teenage psychiatry referrals following crisis presentation to the adult emergency department (ED) of an Irish tertiary hospital. In doing so, this study will specifically examine the effect of COVID-19 on self-injurious behaviour, suicidality and substance use among older adolescents (age 16/17Ã‚Â years). This is a retrospective descriptive analysis of acute adolescent psychiatry referrals assessed out-of-hours via the adult ED psychiatry service across three consecutive time points (during the months of March, April and May) from pre-pandemic, 2019 (T1); initial pandemic, 2020 (T2); and peak pandemic, 2021 (T3). Data were obtained via the hospital's ED-specific electronic database, review of original assessment notes and cross-referenced by manually extracting data logged in the on-call register. Crisis psychiatry assessments of teenagers during on-call hours trebled during the period of this study (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Although ED/crisis referrals initially decreased overall at the start of the pandemic, the rate of teenage referrals remained constant, before increasing as restrictions tightened in lockdown. The negative impact of COVID-19 on teenagers' ability to cope was found to be statistically significant (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Changes in rates of self-harming and/or suicidal behaviours were not statistically significant between 2019, 2020 and 2021 (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.082). Alcohol misuse occurred in up to one-third of cases across each timeframe and remained virtually constant throughout the pandemic. Drug misuse decreased from onset of COVID-19 (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). To our knowledge, this is the first study to specifically examine the impact of COVID-19 on suicidality, self-harming behaviours, substance misuse and on-call ED presentations of teenagers in Ireland. This study demonstrates that coronavirus-related stress is associated with negative mental health sequelae for vulnerable at-risk older adolescents, as evidenced by a rise in ED presentations and on-call referrals since the onset of the pandemic. Presentation of increased numbers of under-18's for psychiatry assessment at the adult ED/general hospital indicates a deepening chasm between available and aspirational emergency (adolescent-specific) psychiatric care in the community. Mobilising resilience factors and maximising coping skills for at-risk youth will inform tailored intervention and support strategies along with adequate resourcing of services for vulnerable adolescents in the community.","McLoughlin, Abdalla, Gonzalez, Freyne, Asghar, Ferguson","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11845-022-03080-0","20220623","Coronavirus Pandemic; Emergency Department; Psychiatry; Self-Harm; Suicidality; Youth Mental Health; Youth Substance Misuse","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33362,""
"Psychological resources and flexibility predict resilient mental health trajectories during the French covid-19 lockdown","The implementation of lockdowns and the Covid-19 pandemic situation have negatively impacted mental health (anxiety, depression). However, little is known about individual differences in the longitudinal reactions to lockdown. We designed a longitudinal study (a) to identify the various trajectories of symptoms of depression and anxiety in the general population during and after lockdown; (b) to determine which positive psychological resources prevent individuals from falling into groups with the most severe trajectories; (c) to test the mediating role of psychological flexibility. We collected and analysed longitudinal data on a sample of French participants (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1399, M<sub>age</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°43.4; SD<sub>age</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°12; 87.8% women) during the end of the first lockdown. Participants were asked to report their psychological resources and (in)flexibility at baseline and symptoms of anxiety and depression at each measurment occasion (five weekly observations from 17 March to 11 May 2020, including baseline). Using growth mixture modelling, seven dynamic profiles of symptoms were identified: four for depression and three for anxiety. Resilience emerged as the most frequent trajectory. Wisdom, optimism, hope, self-efficacy and peaceful disengagement significantly prevented individuals from belonging to the symptomatic groups. Moreover, psychological flexibility emerged as a significant mediator of these effects. This study highlights the importance of cultivating protective factors and psychological flexibility to prevent mental health damage during potentially traumatic events (PTE) and to favour resilience trajectories.","Pellerin, Raufaste, Corman, Teissedre, Dambrun","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-14572-5","20220623","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33363,""
"Effects of a healthy lifestyle intervention and COVID-19-adjusted training curriculum on firefighter recruits","There are knowledge gaps regarding healthy lifestyle (HLS) interventions in fire academy settings and also concerning the impacts of the pandemic on training.

The three academies have similar training environments and curricula. The exposures of interest were a combination of (1) an HLS intervention and (2) impacts of the pandemic on training curricula and environs (i.e. social distancing, masking, reduced class size, etc.). We examined the health/fitness changes throughout training. The follow-up rate was 78%, leaving 92 recruits in the historical control group and 55 in the intervention group. The results show an HLS intervention improved the effects of fire academy training on recruits healthy behaviors (MEDI-lifestyle score, 0.5Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.4 vs. -Ã‚Â 0.3Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.7), systolic blood pressure (-Ã‚Â 7.2Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°10.0 vs. 2.9Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°12.9Ã‚Â mmHg), and mental health (Beck Depression score, -Ã‚Â 0.45Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.14 vs. -Ã‚Â 0.01Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.05) (all PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). The associations remained significant after multivariable adjustments. Moreover, a 1-point MEDI-lifestyle increment during academy training is associated with about 2% decrement in blood pressures over time, after multivariable adjustments (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Nonetheless, the impacts of pandemic restrictions on academy procedures compromised physical fitness training, namely in percent body fat, push-ups, and pull-ups.","Lan, Scheibler, Hershey, Romero-Cabrera, Gaviola, Yiannakou, Fernandez-Montero, Christophi, Christiani, Sotos-Prieto, Kales","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-10979-2","20220623","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33364,""

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the perception of planned oocyte cryopreservation in the United States","To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on attitudes toward planned oocyte cryopreservation (OC). Cross-sectional study. Internet-based survey questionnaire distributed nationally. One thousand women aged 21-45 years, stratified by age Ã¢â€°Â¤35 or &gt;35 years. None. Change in the likelihood of considering OC because of the pandemic. Of the participants who reported that the pandemic altered their likelihood of considering OC (15.2%, n = 152), 52.6% (n = 80) reported an increased and 47.3% (n = 72) reported a decreased likelihood of considering OC. Vaccination status did not affect the likelihood of considering OC. In multivariable analysis, history of COVID-19 infection (odds ratio [OR] 1.57; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-2.45), government-subsidized insurance (OR 1.47; 95% CI 0.97-2.21), loss of health insurance because of the pandemic (ORÃ‚Â 2.32; 95% CI 1.15-4.66), working more (OR 2.99; 95% CI 1.62-5.51) or less (OR 2.54; 95% CI 1.65-3.90) because of the pandemic, and relationship status (divorced, separated, or widowed [OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.20-0.99]) were significantly associated with a change in the likelihood of considering OC because of the pandemic. Of those who believed that the COVID-19 pandemic influenced their childbearing plans (28.3%, n = 283), 64.0% (n = 181) deferred childbearing and 29.7% (n = 84) expedited childbearing. The pandemic's economic impact, concerns regarding safety of pregnancy/childbirth, and safety of childrearing were cited as most influential on childbearing (67%, 70%, 58%, respectively) and on the likelihood of considering OC (47%, 45%, and 34%, respectively). Through its negative impact on financial security and perceived safety, the COVID-19 pandemic has altered the likelihood of considering OC in &gt;15% of reproductive-aged women and reproductive timelines in 30%. Vaccination has not significantly modified these changes.","Huttler, Koelper, Mainigi, Gracia, Senapati","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xfre.2022.04.008","20220624","COVID-19; coronavirus; fertility preservation; oocyte cryopreservation; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33366,""

"The Effect of Covid-19 on Adolescentsâ€™ Mental Health, Social Lives, and Academic Achievement","The aim of this study was to discover effects of Covid-19 on the mental health, academic life, social life of students and discover their interrelationships at a boarding school in New Jersey, USA. 193 participants completed a 26 question survey relating to the preceding topics. A majority reported that Covid-19 had a negative effect on their mental health and social lives, felt well informed about Covid-19 cases on campus, and were unconcerned about getting Covid-19 at school. Significant correlations implied that Covid-19 has impacted all areas of school life. Age correlated with impacted mental health, social lives and academic performance. Females were more strongly impacted with regards to social bonds and mental health than males. Support and strategies to mitigate effects of Covid-19 are needed for affected students, with regards to mental health, as well as academic and social lives.","Megan Kumar et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01FE-E0D-1E1","20220624","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; coronavirus; mental health; adolescents; academic outcomes","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","",33369,""
