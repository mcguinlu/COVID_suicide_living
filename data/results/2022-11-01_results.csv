"Cognitive Subjective Well-Being during the Second Lockdown in Portugal: The Predictive Role of Sociodemographic and Psychopathological Dimensions","The negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on well-being has been widely described. However, studies on how country-specific characteristics influenced the impacts of the pandemic experience on cognitive subjective well-being are still needed. This study examined the predictive role of sociodemographic characteristics and psychopathological dimensions on cognitive subjective well-being during the second lockdown period in Portugal. An online sample of 332 adults completed a series of self-report instruments between April and July 2021, covering the period from 15 January to 15 March 2021. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that being married or living in a civil union, not having/or living with children, not living with/or caring for an elderly person, and not being infected with the SARS-CoV-2 were significant and positive predictors of higher cognitive subjective well-being. In contrast, a non-heterosexual sexual orientation;isolation due to COVID-19;and higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, along with repetitive negative thinking, were significant predictors of negative cognitive subjective well-being during the second lockdown in Portugal. The importance of developing promotional, preventive, and remedial interventions focused on specific country and individual characteristics for poor cognitive subjective well-being for promoting mental health and well-being during this critical period and similar future crisis events is discussed.","Peixoto, Maria Manuela, Sousa, Mariana, Cruz, Sara, Cunha, Olga","https://doi.org/10.3390/psych4040053","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psych; 4(4):717-732, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40043,""
"Risk Factors and Changes in Depression and Anxiety over Time in New Zealand during COVID-19: A Longitudinal Cohort Study","This longitudinal study investigated changes in and risk factors for anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic in a New Zealand cohort. Online surveys were distributed to 681 participants at three time-points: May 2020 (Time 1), August&ndash;September 2020 (Time 2), and March&ndash;April 2021 (Time 3). Participants completed measures of anxiety and depression, alongside measures of possible risk/protective factors. A total of 261 participants completed all three surveys and were included in analyses. Depression and anxiety reduced over time;however, levels were still significantly higher than pre-pandemic norms. Being younger, having a prior mental health disorder, experiencing negative life events due to COVID-19, and being a pet owner were risk factors for poorer depression and anxiety, whereas having higher positive mood was protective. This study demonstrates persisting negative effects of the pandemic on anxiety and depression in a context of low transmission and highlights the importance of providing psychological help to those most at risk.","Law, Mikaela, Gasteiger, Norina, Vedhara, Kavita, Massey, Adam, Jia, Ru, Ayling, Kieran, Chalder, Trudie, Coupland, Carol, Broadbent, Elizabeth","https://doi.org/10.3390/psych4040052","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psych; 4(4):706-716, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40044,""
"Study of Impact of COVID-19 on Mental Health and Wellbeing of Staff Working in a Forensic Mental Health Service","This study explored the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health and wellbeing and trust support of Tees Esk and Wear Valleys (TEWV) NHS forensic staff using an online google survey during the second wave of the pandemic. Survey respondents were a voluntary cross-sectional sample of 246 TEWV staff working in the forensic directorate staff;this included males (n = 60, 24.5%);with the majority of staff aged between 36&ndash;50 years (n = 99, 40.2%) and 50 years or older (n = 80, 32.5%). The results showed that staff working at home and on the front line were both affected by depression, stress and anxiety. Those most at risk were younger staff members. We concluded that the mental health and well-being of staff working should be a priority. It is important to consider targeted support that should be aimed at younger staff members to provide an open culture enabling for those who want support to have readily available signposted resources. Staff working in different settings may have experienced a different impact of COVID-19 on their mental health and wellbeing, and whilst some interventions might be successfully applied across the service, it would be beneficial to understand the unique needs of staff working in specific settings.","Baker, Heather, Gill, Sikander Singh, Aboaja, Anne, Kole, Swapan, Perry, Amanda E.","https://doi.org/10.3390/psych4040051","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psych; 4(4):695-705, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40045,""
"Marine Natural Products in Clinical Use","Marine natural products are potent and promising sources of drugs among other natural products of plant, animal, and microbial origin. To date, 20 drugs from marine sources are in clinical use. Most approved marine compounds are antineoplastic, but some are also used for chronic neuropathic pain, for heparin overdosage, as haptens and vaccine carriers, and for omega-3 fatty-acid supplementation in the diet. Marine drugs have diverse structural characteristics and mechanisms of action. A considerable increase in the number of marine drugs approved for clinical use has occurred in the past few decades, which may be attributed to increasing research on marine compounds in laboratories across the world. In the present manuscript, we comprehensively studied all marine drugs that have been successfully used in the clinic. Researchers and clinicians are hopeful to discover many more drugs, as a large number of marine natural compounds are being investigated in preclinical and clinical studies.","Haque, N.; Parveen, S.; Tang, T.; Wei, J.; Huang, Z.","https://doi.org/10.3390/md20080528","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Marine Drugs; 20(8), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40046,""
"Antidepressant Use and Its Association with 28-Day Mortality in Inpatients with SARS-CoV-2: Support for the FIASMA Model against COVID-19","To reduce Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related mortality and morbidity, widely available oral COVID-19 treatments are urgently needed. Certain antidepressants, such as fluvoxamine or fluoxetine, may be beneficial against COVID-19. We included 388,945 adult inpatients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at 36 APâ€“HP (Assistance Publiqueâ€“HÃ´pitaux de Paris) hospitals from 2 May 2020 to 2 November 2021. We compared the prevalence of antidepressant use at admission in a 1:1 ratio matched analytic sample with and without COVID-19 (N = 82,586), and assessed its association with 28-day all-cause mortality in a 1:1 ratio matched analytic sample of COVID-19 inpatients with and without antidepressant use at admission (N = 1482). Antidepressant use was significantly less prevalent in inpatients with COVID-19 than in a matched control group of inpatients without COVID-19 (1.9% versus 4.8%;Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.38;95%CI = 0.35â€“0.41, p &lt; 0.001). Antidepressant use was significantly associated with reduced 28-day mortality among COVID-19 inpatients (12.8% versus 21.2%;OR = 0.55;95%CI = 0.41â€“0.72, p &lt; 0.001), particularly at daily doses of at least 40 mg fluoxetine equivalents. Antidepressants with high FIASMA (Functional Inhibitors of Acid Sphingomyelinase) activity seem to drive both associations. These treatments may reduce SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related mortality in inpatients, and may be appropriate for prophylaxis and/or COVID-19 therapy for outpatients or inpatients.","Hoertel, Nicolas, SÃ¡nchez-Rico, Marina, Kornhuber, Johannes, Gulbins, Erich, Reiersen, Angela M.; Lenze, Eric J.; Fritz, Bradley A.; Jalali, Farid, Mills, Edward J.; Cougoule, CÃ©line, Carpinteiro, Alexander, MÃ¼hle, Christiane, Becker, Katrin Anne, Boulware, David R.; Blanco, Carlos, Alvarado, JesÃºs M.; Strub-Wourgaft, Nathalie, Lemogne, CÃ©dric, Limosin, FrÃ©dÃ©ric, on behalf of AP-HP/UniversitÃ© Paris CitÃ©/INSERM COVID-19 Research Collaboration, AP-HP COVID CDR Initiative, Consortium, â€œEntrepÃ´t de DonnÃ©es de SantÃ©â€ AP-HP","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11195882","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Medicine; 11(19):5882, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40047,""
"The Effectiveness of Mobile Apps for Monitoring and Management of Suicide Crisis: A Systematic Review of the Literature","Suicide risk is a multifaceted phenomenon, and many risk factors are involved in its complexity. In the last few decades, mental health apps have spread, providing economic and affordable strategies to prevent suicide. Therefore, the aim of this review is to identify original studies on mobile apps that target suicidal crises. The review follows PRISMA guidelines, searching through four major electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, PsycInfo and Web of Science) for relevant titles/s published from January 2010 to May 2022. It includes original studies that explicitly analyze mobile apps for suicide prevention. A total of 32 studies met the inclusion criteria. Sixteen studies assessed the feasibility and acceptability of mobile apps, ten studies assessed the efficacy of mobile apps in preventing suicide, and six studies described randomized control trial protocols not yet implemented. Generally, the apps were judged by participants to be acceptable and helpful, and several improvements to enhance the functionality of apps were suggested. The efficacy of mobile apps, although limited and assessed with very heterogenous methods, was confirmed by most of the studies. Mobile apps could represent a helpful supplement to traditional prevention tactics, providing real-time monitoring of at-risk persons, personalized tools to cope with suicidal crises, and immediate access to specific support.","Sarubbi, Salvatore, Rogante, Elena, Erbuto, Denise, Cifrodelli, Mariarosaria, Sarli, Giuseppe, Polidori, Lorenzo, Lester, David, Berardelli, Isabella, Pompili, Maurizio","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11195616","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Medicine; 11(19):5616, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40048,""
"Attitude and Performance for Online Learning during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Meta-Analytic Evidence","The COVID-19 pandemic prominently hit almost all the aspects of our life, especially in routine education. For public health security, online learning has to be enforced to replace classroom learning. Thus, it is a priority to clarify how these changes impacted students. We built a random-effect model of a meta-analysis to pool individual effect sizes for published articles concerning the attitudes and performance towards online learning. Databases included Google Scholar, PubMed and (Chinese) CNKI repository. Further, a moderated analysis and meta-regression were further used to clarify potential heterogenous factors impacting this pooled effect. Forty published papers (n = 98,558) were screened that were eligible for formal analysis. Meta-analytic results demonstrated that 13.3% (95% CI: 10.0â€“17.5) of students possessed negative attitudes towards online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 12.7% (95% CI: 9.6â€“16.8) students were found to report poor performance in online learning. Moderated analysis revealed poor performance in online learning in the early pandemic (p = 0.006). Results for the meta-regression analysis showed that negative attitudes could predict poor learning performance significantly (p = 0.026). In conclusion, online learning that is caused by COVID-19 pandemic may have brought about negative learning attitudes and poorer learning performance compared to classroom learning, especially in the early pandemic.","Liu, Xuerong, Gong, Zheng, Miao, Kuan, Yang, Peiyi, Liu, Hongli, Feng, Zhengzhi, Chen, Zhiyi","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912967","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(19):12967, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40049,""
"Barriers to Mental Health Service Use among Palestinian-Arab Women in Israel: Psychological Distress as Moderator","Background: Many studies indicate that ethnic minority women, including women from the disadvantaged Palestinian-Arab minority in Israel, experience higher rates of psychological distress but are less likely to use mental health services. This study examined psychological distress and its role as a moderator in the relationship between mental health service use and stigma-related, attitudinal, and instrumental barriers. Method: Cross-sectional study of 146 Palestinian-Arab women who completed measures of psychological distress, mental health service use, the Barriers to Care Evaluation scale, and sociodemographic characteristics. Results: Participants who did not utilize mental health services reported higher levels of all barrier types compared to participants who reported previous use, but lower levels of psychological distress. Psychological distress was a significant moderator only in the relationship between attitudinal barriers and mental health service use. Conclusions: This study highlights the role of psychological distress in the relationship between barriers to and utilization of mental health services, helping professionals and policymakers increase mental health service use among Palestinian-Arab women in Israel and other vulnerable women elsewhere.","Abo-Rass, Fareeda, Abu-Kaf, Sarah, Nakash, Ora","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912557","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(19):12557, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40050,""
"Mediation of Self-Compassion on Pathways from Stress to Psychopathologies among Japanese Workers","As awareness of mental health increases worldwide, how to improve mental health has begun to be discussed in many countries. Stress is known to cause diverse physical and mental health problems, including psychopathologies. On the other hand, our previous studies identified that self-compassion, kindness and understanding towards oneself are key components for good mental health in many populations, including Japanese workers. The government reports that Japanese workers suffer from high rates of mental health problems. However, the mechanism of how self-compassion helps their mental health remains to be evaluated. Accordingly, this study aimed to elucidate how self-compassion intervenes in pathways from stress to psychopathologies, namely depression and anxiety. One hundred and sixty-five Japanese workers completed an online survey regarding self-compassion, depression, anxiety and stress. Correlation and path analyses were conducted. These four variables were significantly inter-related. While self-compassion mediated the pathway from stress to depression, it did not mediate the pathway from stress to anxiety. These exploratory insights assist in understanding the mechanism of how self-compassion improves mental health and inform effective methods to implement self-compassion interventions to the Japanese workforce.","Kotera, Yasuhiro, Young, Holly, Maybury, Sarah, Aledeh, Muhammad","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912423","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(19):12423, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40051,""
"Effect of a Digital Literacy Program on Older Adultsâ€™ Digital Social Behavior: A Quasi-Experimental Study","In South Korea, digital literacy education programs are expected to help its older population participate in online welfare services to increase their social support, self-esteem and well-being. This quasi-experimental study assesses the effects of digital literacy education on digital device usage among rural-dwelling adults aged 65 and above and evaluates the positive effects of digital literacy education on depression, happiness, quality of life, self-efficacy and cognitive function. A digital literacy education program and a customized questionnaire survey were conducted to evaluate smartphone use competency and the programâ€™s effects, respectively. We also conducted a chi-square test, paired t-test and difference-in-differences regression analysis. The experimental group showed a significant increase in smartphone usage and video recording capacity than the control group. The happiness and cognitive function scores for dementia screening increased significantly by a mean of 3.7 and 1.1 points, respectively, after digital literacy education. Cognitive function increased significantly by 1.305 points in the experimental group compared to the control group (ÃŸ = 1.305, p = 0.05 *). Digital literacy education for older adults in rural areas greatly increased smartphone use, video recording capacity, happiness and cognitive function. Based on these findings, it is recommended that the government should implement digital literacy education for older adults in rural areas to increase their happiness and cognitive function.","Lee, Hocheol, Lim, Joo-Aeh, Hae-Kweun, Nam","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912404","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(19):12404, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40052,""
"Deaths of Despair: A Scoping Review on the Social Determinants of Drug Overdose, Alcohol-Related Liver Disease and Suicide","Background: There is a lack of consensus on the social determinants of Deaths of Despair (DoD), i.e., an increase in mortality attributed to drug overdose, alcohol-related liver disease, and suicide in the United States (USA) during recent years. The objective of this study was to review the scientific literature on DoD with the purpose of identifying relevant social determinants and inequalities related to these mortality trends. Methods: Scoping review focusing on the period 2015â€“2022 based on PubMed search. Articles were selected according to the following inclusion criteria: published between 1 January 2000 and 31 October 2021;including empirical data;analyzed DoD including the three causes defined by Case and Deaton;analyzed at least one social determinant;written in English;and studied DoD in the USA context only. Studies were excluded if they only analyzed adolescent populations. We synthesized our findings in a narrative report specifically addressing DoD by economic conditions, occupational hazards, educational level, geographical setting, and race/ethnicity. Results: Seventeen studies were included. Overall, findings identify a progressive increase in deaths attributable to suicide, drug overdose, and alcohol-related liver disease in the USA in the last two decades. The literature concerning DoD and social determinants is relatively scarce and some determinants have been barely studied. However different, however, large inequalities have been identified in the manner in which the causes of death embedded in the concept of DoD affect different subpopulations, particularly African American, and Hispanic populations, but blue collar-whites are also significantly impacted. Low socioeconomic position and education levels and working in jobs with high insecurity, unemployment, and living in rural areas were identified as the most relevant social determinants of DoD. Conclusions: There is a need for further research on the structural and intermediate social determinants of DoD and social mechanisms. Intersectional and systemic approaches are needed to better understand and tackle DoD and related inequalities.","Beseran, Elisabet, PericÃ s, Juan M.; Cash-Gibson, Lucinda, Ventura-Cots, Meritxell, Pollack Porter, Keshia M.; Benach, Joan","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912395","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(19):12395, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40053,""
"The Influence of Physical Exercise Frequency and Intensity on Individual Entrepreneurial Behavior: Evidence from China","Physical exercise can benefit individualsâ€™ physical and mental health and also influence individualsâ€™ long-term behavioral choices. Doing exercise is particularly important given that physical exercise can impact individualsâ€™ cognitive abilities and positive emotional states, which may further impact entrepreneurial behavior. Therefore, understanding the relationship between exercise and entrepreneurial behavior is essential, because it can provide policy suggestions for popularizing athletic activities and boosting entrepreneurship. Consequently, the present study examined whether physical exercise could predict entrepreneurial behavior and the possible psychological mechanisms within this relationship. Based on the 2017 Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS2017), this study tested the hypotheses using the Probit and Tobit models. The results showed that individualsâ€™ physical exercise intensity and frequency positively affected their entrepreneurial behavior. In addition, five variables moderated the relationships between physical exercise and individual entrepreneurial behavior: urbanâ€“rural differences, education level, marital status, the existence of minor children, and age. Moreover, positive emotions and physical/mental health mediated the influence of physical exercise (exercise frequency and exercise intensity) on individual entrepreneurial behavior. Endogeneity explanations were ruled out by including instrumental variable, copula terms and adopting coarsened exact matching.","Liu, Dewen, Han, Shenghao, Zhou, Chunyang","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912383","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(19):12383, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40054,""
"Actionable Predictive Factors of Homelessness in a Psychiatric Population: Results from the REHABase Cohort Using a Machine Learning Approach","Background: There is a lack of knowledge regarding the actionable key predictive factors of homelessness in psychiatric populations. Therefore, we used a machine learning model to explore the REHABase database (for rehabilitation databaseâ€”n = 3416), which is a cohort of users referred to French psychosocial rehabilitation centers in France. Methods: First, we analyzed whether the different risk factors previously associated with homelessness in mental health were also significant risk factors in the REHABase. In the second step, we used unbiased classification and regression trees to determine the key predictors of homelessness. Post hoc analyses were performed to examine the importance of the predictors and to explore the impact of cognitive factors among the participants. Results:Â First, risk factors that were previously found to be associated with homelessness were also significant risk factors in the REHABase. Among all the variables studied with a machine learning approach, the most robust variable in terms of predictive value was the nature of the psychotropic medication (sex/sex relative mean predictor importance: 22.8, s = 3.4). Post hoc analyses revealed that first-generation antipsychotics (15.61%;p &lt; 0.05 FDR corrected), loxapine (16.57%;p &lt; 0.05 FWER corrected) and hypnotics (17.56%;p &lt; 0.05 FWER corrected) were significantly associated with homelessness. Antidepressant medication was associated with a protective effect against housing deprivation (9.21%;p &lt; 0.05 FWER corrected). Conclusions: Psychotropic medication was found to be an important predictor of homelessness in our REHABase cohort, particularly loxapine and hypnotics. On the other hand, the putative protective effect of antidepressants confirms the need for systematic screening of depression and anxiety in the homeless population.","Lio, Guillaume, Malek, Ghazzai, Haesebaert, FrÃ©dÃ©ric, Dubreucq, Julien, Verdoux, HÃ©lÃ¨ne, Quiles, ClÃ©lia, Jaafari, Nemat, ChÃ©reau-Boudet, Isabelle, Legros-Lafarge, Emilie, Guillard-Bouhet, Nathalie, Massoubre, Catherine, Gouache, Benjamin, Plasse, Julien, Barbalat, Guillaume, Franck, Nicolas, Demily, Caroline","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912268","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(19):12268, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40055,""
"The Influence of Motivators and Barriers to Exercise on Attaining Physical Activity and Sedentary Time Guidelines among Canadian Undergraduate Students","Canadian 24 h movement guidelines recommend engaging in &gt;150 min/week of moderateâ€“vigorous-intensity physical activity and =8 h/day of sedentary time. Half of Canadian post-secondary students do not meet physical activity or sedentary time guidelines. This pan-Canadian study aimed to (1) identify commonly cited motivators/barriers to exercise, and (2) determine which motivators/barriers were most influential for attaining physical and sedentary activity guidelines. A total of 341 respondents (279 females, 23 Â± 4 years old, 53% met activity guidelines, 49% met sedentary guidelines) completed an online survey regarding undergraduate student lifestyle behaviours. Improved physical health (74% of respondents), mental health (67%), physical appearance (60%), and athletic performance (28%) were the most common motivators to exercise. The most common barriers were school obligations (68%), time commitments (58%), job obligations (32%), and lack of available fitness classes (26%). Students citing improved athletic performance (odds ratio (OR) = 1.94, p = 0.02) were more likely to adhere to activity guidelines, while those who selected physical health (OR = 0.56, p = 0.03) and physical appearance (OR = 0.46, p = 0.001) as motivators were less likely to meet activity guidelines. Students who cited school obligations as a barrier were less likely (OR = 0.59, p = 0.03) to meet sedentary guidelines. The motivators and barriers identified provide a foundation for university-led initiatives aimed at promoting physical activity and reducing sedentary time among undergraduate students. Strategies that positively re-frame studentsâ€™ physical health and appearance-based motivations for exercise may be particularly useful in helping more students achieve national activity recommendations.","Pellerine, Liam P.; Bray, Nick W.; Fowles, Jonathon R.; Furlano, Joyla A.; Morava, Anisa, Nagpal, Taniya S.; Myles, W.

"The Relationship between Physical Exercise and Negative Emotions in College Students in the Post-Epidemic Era: The Mediating Role of Emotion Regulation Self-Efficacy","Objective: To investigate the relationship between physical activity and negative emotions among college students in the post-epidemic era and determine if emotional regulation plays a mediating role between physical activity and negative emotions. Methods: 479 college students (293 males, 186 females, M = 19.94, SD = 1.25) who were under closed campus management during the epidemic period were surveyed using the physical activity rating scale (PARS-3), the self-assessment scale for anxiety (SAS), the self-esteem scale for depression (SDS), and the emotion regulation self-efficacy scale (RES). Results: (1) Physical activity, negative emotions, and emotion regulation self-efficacy among college students were significantly different by gender (p &lt; 0.01). (2) Physical exercise was negatively correlated with anxiety and depression (r = -0.236, p &lt; 0.01;r = -0.198, p &lt; 0.01) and positively correlated with emotion regulation self-efficacy (r = 0.256, p &lt; 0.01) in college students. (3) Emotion regulation self-efficacy was negatively correlated with anxiety and depression (r = -0.440, p &lt; 0.01;r = -0.163, p &lt; 0.01).

"Context Mattersâ€”Child Growth within a Constrained Socio-Economic Environment","Communities in major cities in developing countries may experience economic vulnerability, which has detrimental consequences for maternal and child health. This study investigated individual-, household-, and community-level factors associated with child growth and resilience of early-grade learners aged 6 to 8 years. Demographic characteristics, depression scale, child wellbeing, and anthropometric measurements were collected on a sample of 162 caregiverâ€“child pairs (children 46% female) who receive the child support grant (cash transfer programme) from five low-income urban communities in the City of Johannesburg, South Africa. Height and weight were converted to z-scores using the WHO Anthroplus software. Multiple linear regression was used to assess factors associated with child health outcomes and multi-level regression to account for community-level factors. Higher income vulnerability was associated with lower weight- and height-for-age z-scores (WAZ and HAZ). Not completing secondary schooling and higher household size were associated with lower HAZ but higher BAZ. Child male sex and caregiver with depression were associated with lower child resilience. Caregiverâ€™s level of schooling and household size remained independent predictors of child growth, while the caregiverâ€™s mental health status independently predicted child resilience. Thus, notwithstanding systemic constraints, there may be modifiable drivers that can help in developing targeted intervention.","Nyati, Lukhanyo H.; Patel, Leila, Haffejee, Sadiyya, Sello, Matshidiso, Mbowa, Sonia, Sani, Tania, Norris, Shane A.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191911944","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(19):11944, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40058,""
"Promoting Mental Health Help-Seeking Behaviors by Mental Health Literacy Interventions in Secondary Education? Needs and Perspectives of Adolescents and Educational Professionals","Mental health literacy (MHL) interventions in secondary schools may help to improve competencies that adolescents require to stay mentally healthy and seek help if mental health problems arise. These MHL interventions should be tailored to the needs of adolescents and educational professionals (EPs) to reach sustainable implementation and long-term effectiveness. However, evidence is lacking on these needs. Thus, our aim was to explore their experiences with, and perspectives on, mental health help seeking and needs regarding MHL interventions. We performed online focus group discussions and interviews with adolescents (n = 21;13â€“19 years) and EPs (n = 12) and analyzed the data using directed content analysis. We identified three themes related to mental health help seeking: (1) Limited MHL competencies of adolescents, (2) Limited competencies of EP to provide mental health support, and (3) Limited mental health promotion in the school environment. We further identified three themes regarding MHL interventions: (1) Addressing basic mental health knowledge and skills, (2) Interactive and easily accessible, and (3) Sustainable implementation. Improving the MHL competencies of adolescents and EPs, and creating a mental health-literate school environment can promote adolescentsâ€™ mental health help seeking. Our findings highlight the importance of developing MHL interventions that are tailored to both adolescentsâ€™ and EPs needs.","Beukema, Lindy, Tullius, Janne M.; Korevaar, Lies, Hofstra, Jacomijn, Reijneveld, Sijmen A.; de Winter, Andrea F.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191911889","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(19):11889, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40059,""
"The Preventive Health Professions in Italy: The Efficient Use of Resources, Skills and Best Practice during the Pandemic","Health visitors (HVs) and environmental health officers (EHOs) are the healthcare workers (HCWs) who, in the Italian National Health Service, mainly operate in the prevention departments of local health authorities, guaranteeing the territorial activities specifically declared with the respective professional profiles. During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, it was necessary to reallocate all HCWs supporting Hygiene and Public Health Services involved on the front lines of the emergency, in order to perform preventive activities and to take immediate action to fight the spread of the virus. By means of an IT survey consisting of three sections, this study investigated how 960 HVs and EHOs dealt with this reallocation, with the shifting in service assignment, and with the perceived level of fatigue and pressure, through the application of skills acquired from university training. The synergy among the preventive health professions, the ability to work in a multi-professional team, and the complementary training of HCWs represent the main strengths for overcoming future public health challenges, aimed at protecting human health.","Marcotrigiano, Vincenzo, Pattavina, Fabio, Blangiardi, Lorenzo, Salerno, Gerardo, Dalena, Annamaria, Del Bianco, Flavio, Di Fant, Marcella, Fabbro, Anna, Forgiarini, Mariarita, Lanzilotti, Carola, Wachocka, Malgorzata, Marchet, Paola, Mazzurana, Mirko, Rizzi, Roberto, Russo, Carmela, Salerno, Fabiana, Vailati, Mattia, Stingi, Giacomo Domenico, Laurenti, Patrizia, Ferro, Antonio, Cinquetti, Sandro, Napoli, Christian","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10101906","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(10):1906, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40060,""
"Levels of Stress, Anxiety, and Depression in University Students from Spain and Costa Rica during Periods of Confinement and Virtual Learning","Mental health problems, specifically those related to stress, anxiety, and depression, have become more prevalent among college students compared to data available prior to the levels of the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent studies have shown that in different geographical areas, there is a high prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms in university students compared to pre-pandemic levels. Thus, our objective was to establish self-perceived levels of stress, anxiety, and depression in university students earning an education degree at the University of Granada and the University of Costa Rica during periods of confinement and virtual learning associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The final study sample consisted of 942 students from both universities. Two questionnaires were administered: The state trait anxiety inventory and the depression, anxiety, and stress scale 21. Descriptive analyses, mean comparisons, Pearson correlation coefficients, and multivariate regression were performed. Reliability was assessed using Cronbach's alpha, and the effect size was analyzed using Cohen's d. The results indicated that levels of depression, anxiety, and stress were mild or moderate despite the confinement and virtual learning associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Women had higher levels of anxiety than men, and singles had higher levels of anxiety than individuals in other family situations. Younger individuals had higher levels of stress and anxiety.","GijÃ³n Puerta, JosÃ©, GalvÃ¡n MalagÃ³n, MarÃ­a Carmen, Khaled GijÃ³n, Meriem, Lizarte SimÃ³n, Emilio JesÃºs","https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci12100660","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Education Sciences; 12(10):660, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40061,""
"Describing the Function, Disability, and Health of Adults and Older Adults during the Early Coronavirus Restrictions in 2019: An Online Survey","The restrictions in 2019 due to Coronavirus impacted Canadians' daily living, especially those at higher risk of compromised health conditions. This study aimed to describe the physical, psychological, and social well-being of adults with disabilities, and older adults from May to June 2020. Participants from the group of community-dwelling adults (&ge;19 years of age), who communicated in English, lived in British Columbia, and had Internet access via a computer, tablet, or smartphone with special focus on populations who had stroke, spinal cord injury and other disabilities were included. For measurement outcomes, an online survey was used to administer standardized measures of level of participation, mobility, anxiety and depression, boredom, resilience, technology readiness, social support, and social networks. Seventy-two participants were recruited, with a mean age (SD) of 61.2 (13.8). This study was comprised of two groups: the adult group consisted of individuals with disabilities under the age of 65 (48.6%) and the older adult group consisted of individuals over the age of 65 with and without self-identified disability (51.4%). There was no significant difference in the proportion of participation restriction between adult (83%) and older adult' (81%) groups (p = 0.69). In the study population, 27.8% and 16.7% of participants exceeded the anxiety and depression cut-off scores, respectively. Boredom was experienced by 76.4% of participants. Participants' mean (SD) resilience and life space scores were 72.4 (14.0) and 51.9 (24.0), respectively. The older adults (&ge;65 years) showed significantly lower depression (p = 0.012) and better resilience (p = 0.038), social support (p = 0.043), and social network (p = 0.021) than the younger adults. Issues with anxiety, boredom, participation, and life space activity were identified in both study groups.

Although adequate psychometric properties have been demonstrated for this instrument based on classical test theory, the MHCIS has not yet been validated against Rasch measurement theory (RMT). We applied RMT to examine the psychometric properties of the MHCIS using data from 807 Chinese university students. The nominated life event in this study was the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite modest violations of unidimensionality and misfit to the Rasch model, in general, the results supported the validity of the 10-item MHCIS.

"Social Media Mining of Long-COVID Self-Medication Reported by Reddit Users: Feasibility Study to Support Drug Repurposing","Background: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, over 480 million people have been infected and more than 6 million people have died from COVID-19 worldwide. In some patients with acute COVID-19, symptoms manifest over a longer period, which is also called â€œlong-COVID.â€ Unmet medical needs related to long-COVID are high, since there are no treatments approved. Patients experiment with various medications and supplements hoping to alleviate their suffering. They often share their experiences on social media. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of social media mining methods to extract important compounds from the perspective of patients. The goal is to provide an overview of different medication strategies and important agents mentioned in Reddit usersâ€™ self-reports to support hypothesis generation for drug repurposing, by incorporating patientsâ€™ experiences. Methods: We used named-entity recognition to extract substances representing medications or supplements used to treat long-COVID from almost 70,000 posts on the â€œ/r/covidlonghaulersâ€ subreddit. We analyzed substances by frequency, co-occurrences, and network analysis to identify important substances and substance clusters. Results: The named-entity recognition algorithm achieved an F1 score of 0.67. A total of 28,447 substance entities and 5789 word co-occurrence pairs were extracted. â€œHistamine antagonists,â€ â€œfamotidine,â€ â€œmagnesium,â€ â€œvitamins,â€ and â€œsteroidsâ€ were the most frequently mentioned substances. Network analysis revealed three clusters of substances, indicating certain medication patterns. Conclusions: This feasibility study indicates that network analysis can be used to characterize the medication strategies discussed in social media. Comparison with existing literature shows that this approach identifies substances that are promising candidates for drug repurposing, such as antihistamines, steroids, or antidepressants. In the context of a pandemic, the proposed method could be used to support drug repurposing hypothesis development by prioritizing substances that are important to users.","Sarker, A.; Wang, X.; Koss, J.; Bohnet-Joschko, S.","https://doi.org/10.2196/39582","","Database: PMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: JMIR Form Res; 6(10), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40065,""
"Public Health Information Seeking, Trust, and COVID-19 Prevention Behaviors: Cross-sectional Study","Background: Preventative health measures such as shelter in place and mask wearing have been widely encouraged to curb the spread of the COVID-19 disease. Peopleâ€™s attitudes toward preventative behaviors may be dependent on their sources of information and trust in the information. Objective: The aim of this study was to understand the relationship between trusting in COVID-19 information and preventative behaviors in a racially and politically diverse metropolitan area in the United States. Methods: We conducted a web-based cross-sectional survey of residents in St. Louis City and County in Missouri. Individuals aged =18 years were eligible to participate. Participants were recruited using a convenience sampling approach through social media and email. The Health Belief Model and the Socioecological Model informed instrument development, as well as COVID-19â€“related questions from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We performed an ordinary least squares linear regression model to estimate social distancing practices, perceptions, and trust in COVID-19 information sources. Results: Of the 1650 eligible participants, the majority (n=1381, 83.7%) had sought or received COVID-19â€“related information from a public health agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or both. Regression analysis showed a 1% increase in preventative behaviors for every 12% increase in trust in governmental health agencies. At their lowest levels of trust, women were 68% more likely to engage in preventative behaviors than men. Overall, those aged 18-45 years without vulnerable medical conditions were the least likely to engage in preventative behaviors. Conclusions: Trust in COVID-19 information increases an individualâ€™s likelihood of practicing preventative behaviors. Effective health communication strategies should be used to effectively disseminate health information during disease outbreaks.","Governor, S.; Tham, J. S.; Meng, R.; Tetteh, E.

"Training of neurologists for the 21st century: cultural and professional skills","Background: Training of neurologists for the near future is a challenge due to the likely advances in neuroscientific methods, which will change much of our knowledge on diagnosis and treatment of neurological diseases. Objective: To comment on what may be more likely to be a constant in the very near future and to recommend how to prepare the neurologist for the 21st century. Methods: Through a critical review of recent articles on the teaching of Neurology, to present a personal view on the subject. Results: Diagnostic methods and therapeutic resources in Neurology will be greatly improved, but the central core of teaching young neurologists will continue to be the clinical/anatomical correlation. The neurologist must be prepared to be the primary physician in the care of patients with neurological disorders, although the roles of consultant and clinical neuroscientist must also be considered. In addition to technical knowledge, the neurologist must be prepared to discuss not only distressing issues related to the specialty, such as the risks of genetic diseases for family members of their patients, the inexorable progression of some diseases and the need for palliative care, but also problems not directly related to Neurology that cause anxiety and depression in the patient or that are the main reason for the initial consultation. Conclusion: Neurology will be an even more important area of medicine and the neurologist must be well prepared to be the primary doctor to diagnose, treat and follow the patient with neurological disorders. In addition to technical knowledge, training in doctor-patient relations should be highlighted.","Nitrini, R.","https://doi.org/10.1590/0004-282X-ANP-2022-S104","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Arquivos de Neuro-Psiquiatria; 80:1-6, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40067,""

The results should be adjusted to describe how older students were at higher risk of psychological impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic than younger students. These adjustments include changes in the , Results, Discussion and Conclusion. The following describes where results and interpretations are corrected. Again, these are exclusively limited to our findings for older students, rather than younger students, being at higher risk of negative psychological impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. In the Results subsection of the , there is an error in the last sentence. The correct sentence is: Multivariate modeling (mixed-effects logistic regression) showed that being a woman, having fair/poor general health status, being at least 25 years old, spending 8 or more hours on screens daily, and knowing someone infected predicted higher levels of psychological impact when risk factors were considered simultaneously. In the Risk Factors subsection of the Results, there is an error in the third and fourth sentences of the fifth paragraph. The correct sentence is: Students who were women, fair/poor general health, being at least 25 years old, reporting 8 or more hours of screen time, and who knew someone infected with COVID-19 were more likely to be in the high profile. Non-Hispanic Asian students were marginally more likely to be in the high impact profile, p = .059. In the same subsection, there is an error in the first three sentences of the sixth paragraph. The correct sentences are: Sensitivity analyses with a subsample of respondents from the representative sample at North Carolina State University identified a similar set of predictors of psychological impact levels (Table A3 and S1). Gender, age, general health, and knowing someone infected remained significant predictors. In contrast, screen time was no longer significant, but Non-Hispanic Asian and social class were significant, p = .022 and .0038, respectively. In the Key findings and interpretation of results subsection of the Discussion, there is an error in the first sentence of the fourth paragraph. The correct sentence is: In multivariate models controlling, being a woman, being older (at least 25 years old), having poor/fair general health, reporting more screen time, and knowing someone infected were statistically significant risk factors. In the same subsection, the eighth paragraph is incorrect. The correct paragraph is: Our finding that older students were at greater risk than younger students was unexpected. Younger students (i.e., 18 to 24 years old, regardless of academic status) tend to be more worried about their future education and ability to pay for college education than older students [10]. Younger people also engage in social media more than older people during the pandemic [12,82]. Given the dominance of the COVID-19 pandemic in the news, it could have been expected that younger ""always-on"" students were exposed to greater amounts of risk-elevating messages, which could have led to anxiety and poor mental health [16,75]. Since our data suggest the opposite, further investigation into social media use and reactions among younger and older students is called upon to understand why older students were at greater risk of psychological impacts. In the Recommendations for universities subsection of the Discussion, there is an error in the first two sentences of the fourth paragraph. The correct sentences are: Colleges and universities also have a moral obligation to boost their outreach to part cularly vulnerable groupsâ€“that is, populations at risk of high levels of psychological impact from COVID-19 [14]. As documented in the impact profiles of our study, people at increased risk include women, older students, students with pre-existing health concerns, students spending at least one-third of their day (including time spent sleeping) on screens, and students with family or community members who are infected with COVID-19. In the Conclusion section, there is an error in the first sentence. The correct sentence is: Our cross-sectional study found that being a woman, being of older age, experiencing poor/ fair general health, spending extensive time on screens, and knowing someone infected with COVID-19 were risk factors for higher levels of psychological impact during the pandemic among college students in the United States.

"Metabolic disorders and post-acute hospitalization in black/mixed-race patients with long COVID in Brazil: A cross-sectional analysis","Although low-middle income countries have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, there is scarce information about the impact of long COVID on their population. This study aimed to evaluate long COVID symptomatology, complications (hospital readmission and metabolic disorders), and main clinical features that impact Quality of Life (QoL). This cross-sectional study provides a detailed clinical and laboratory picture of individuals who presented residual symptoms after mild to severe acute COVID-19. Between Aug-2020 to Sep-2021, long COVID patients were evaluated in a reference center for long COVID in Bahia State, Brazil. The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire accessed QoL. A total of 1164 (52 Ã‚Â±13.4 years, 57% female, 88% black/mixed-race) were evaluated 2.3 [IQR = 1.6-3.7] months after mild (n = 351, 30.2%), moderate (338, 29.0%) or severe (475, 40.8%) acute illness. Dyspnea (790, 67.9%), fatigue (738, 63.5%), and chest pain (525, 42.9%) were the most frequent residual symptoms regardless of acute severity, affecting the QoL of 88.9% of patients (n/N-826/925), mainly the domains of anxiety/depression and pain/discomfort.

"Quality of life and its related psychological problems during coronavirus pandemic","The prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has endangered the psychological health of individuals. This study aimed to assess the quality of life and its related psychological problems during COVID-19 pandemic. In this cross-sectional study, 559 citizens above the age of 16 years, in Isfahan and Bandar Abbas cities in Iran were selected with a convenient sampling method. An online questionnaire was used to collect the data, which consisted of five sections: demographic information, short health anxiety inventory (SHAI), perceived stress scale (PSS), world health organization quality of life questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF) and Padua inventory. Data were analyzed using statistical tests including t-test, path analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM) using SPSS 24 and Amos 21 statistical software. A total of 559 subjects with the mean age of 37.34 Ã‚Â± 11.19 years participated in this study. Most of the participants were female (78.5%), married (71.6%) and employed (40.9%). The majority of them also had a bachelor's degree (42.9%). There were significant negative correlations between perceived helplessness (r = -.597, p = .000), perceived stress (r = -.715, p = .000), risk of disease (r = -.302, p = .000), negative effect of disease (r = -.424, p = .000), health anxiety (r = -.366, p = .000), contamination obsessions (r = -.187, p = .000) and washing compulsions (r = -.193, p = .000) with quality of life. On other hand, significant positive correlation was found between perceived self-efficacy (r = .665, p = .000) and quality of life. According to our findings, health anxiety, perceived stress and obsessive-compulsive disorder were negatively affected psychological health during COVID-19 which in turn decreased quality of life. Therefore, we suggest considering prevention and treatment of theses psychological problems to diminish the risk of reduced quality of life during COVID-19 global pandemic crisis.","Homayuni, Hosseini, Shahabi, Ezati Rad, Moayedi","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0276841","20221031","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40073,""
"Anxiety and depression among patient's companions during admission to the ICU in the Omicron wave of COVID-19: A cross-sectional study in Aleppo University Hospital","After the COVID-19 pandemic, anxiety and depression have reached high levels, especially after the last wave, Omicron. Healthcare workers in contact with COVID-19 patients or those who come in contact with them may exhibit high levels of anxiety and depression. Therefore, we aimed to assess anxiety and depression symptoms among ICU companions of COVID-19 patients. From 30 November 2021 to 1 March 2022, sixth-year medical students at Aleppo University Hospital conducted interviews with the companions of COVID-19 patients who they brought their patient to the ICU centre as part of a cross-sectional quantitative study using the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 tools to gauge their level of anxiety and depression among companions of COVID-19 patients. The data were analyzed using the SPSS program. In addition, logistic regression models were used to study possible factors of anxiety and depression symptoms during COVID-19. The total number was 997 participants in contact with COVID-19 patients. The mean score of the depression assessment tool (PHQ-9) in our questionnaire was 9.5 with a range of 0 to 27. At the same time, the anxiety assessment tool (GAD-7) had a mean score of 9.1, ranging from 0 to 21. A binary logistic regression was used to predict the relationship between depression and anxiety and various factors. We found that the companions with medical specialties were substantially less likely to develop anxiety than other companions [AOR = 0.459; 95%CI (0.23-0.9)], in addition females were substantially higher likely to develop depression than males [AOR = 1.322; 95%CI (0.992-1.762)]. 45.4% of companions had moderate to severe anxiety, in additon 50.8% of companions had moderate to severe depression. Our research reveals that moderate to severe anxiety and sadness are present in roughly half of the COVID19 patients' companions. Females, people with children, and hard workers were more inclined to feel anxious than others, and those who are not in the medical field were more likely to suffer from depression than others, thus it is critical to assist these groups during the present outbreaks (Omicron and Monkeybox).","Swed, Kashkash, Shoib, Shaheen, Nasif, Motawea, ElHawary, AbdelQadir, Patwary, Alibrahim, Sawaf, Khairy, Bakkour, Muwaili, Muwaili, Abdelmajid, Elkalagi, Elsayed, Ahmed, Khouri","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0273900","20221031","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40074,""
"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Stress and Burnout Levels amongst Emergency Medical Technicians: A Cross-Sectional Study in Spain","Emergency medical technicians (EMTs) are essential health care workers (HCWs). Although they play an extraordinary role during the COVID-19 pandemic, they are mostly exposed to various occupational health and safety risks that have significantly impacted their mental health, giving rise to symptoms, such as stress and burnout. This study aimed to assess the perceived levels of stress and burnout amongst EMTs in relation to their socio-demographic characteristics and to explore the associations between their stress and burnout levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. This work is an observational cross-sectional design study conducted between 29 March and 30 April 2021, with a convenience sample of 280 Spanish EMTs yielding a response rate of 28%. The online survey had 42 items that aimed to determine participants' socio-demographic characteristics, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). The results showed that more than half of the EMTs (53%) perceived a moderate stress level, 37% perceived moderate levels of emotional exhaustion (EE) and 40% had moderate levels of depersonalization (DP). Furthermore, 48% had low levels of personal accomplishment (PA). Gender, age, having personal protective equipment (PPE) and experiencing fear of infection were statistically significant areas where participants experienced greater stress (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). A positive correlation between stress, EE and DP and a negative correlation between stress and the PA subdimension of burnout were found. The COVID-19 pandemic had a tremendous impact on the mental health of ambulance EMTs. Further studies building on this study and others on the psychological status of EMTs before the pandemic and follow-up during the pandemic, as well as deeper investigations on their work conditions, are needed to facilitate the implementation of various interventions. Such efforts can mitigate the negative impacts of the pandemic on their mental health, and prepare them for future disasters.KEY MESSAGEThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected the lives of the majority of the world's population. In particular, it has impacted the mental health of various communities, including HCWs. Highly stressful and insecure work conditions have placed frontline HCWs at a high risk of psychological distress, making them victims and service providers simultaneously.","Amro, Arcos GonzÃƒÂ¡lez, Montero ViÃƒÂ±uales, Castro Delgado","https://doi.org/10.1080/07853890.2022.2137735","20221101","COVID-19; EMT; Spain; burnout; mental health; stress; Humans; Cross-Sectional Studies; Pandemics; Emergency Medical Technicians; COVID-19; Spain; Burnout, Professional; Burnout, Psychological","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40075,""
"Clinical Characteristics of Hospital Follow-up for Patients Hospitalized from SARS CoV-2 (COVID 19) in an Academic Outpatient Internal Medicine Clinic","As of July 2022, there have been more than 91.3 million cases of COVID-19 and nearly 1.03 million deaths in the United States alone. In addition, many people who survived COVID-19 had long-term symptoms, such as fatigue, dyspnea, loss of smell and taste, depression, and anxiety. The purpose of our study is to evaluate the status of COVID-19 patients who were previously hospitalized. We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center and its affiliated University Medical Center under IRB of L21-144. We included all patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and followed up in our Internal Medicine Clinic at any time between April 1, 2020, and April 1, 2021, and reviewed follow-up data for these patients after discharge. A total of 128 patients were included; 59 (46%) were men, and 69 (54%) were women with an average age of 59.7Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°14.8Ã¢â‚¬â€°years. Most of the patients (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°78, 60.9%) identified their race as Hispanic or Latino origin; the next largest group was Caucasian (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°29, 22.65%). The average number of days until post-hospitalization follow-up was 36Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°38Ã¢â‚¬â€°days. The 50% of the patients (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°64) used telemedicine for follow-up visits. Important comorbidities in these patients included diabetes (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°84, 65.6%) and hypertension (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°94, 73.4%). Thirty-four patients (26.6%) reported respiratory symptoms at their follow-up appointments, 24 patients (18.8%) reported constitutional symptoms, 12 patients (9.4%) reported GI symptoms, and 25 patients (19.5%) reported other symptoms, such as paresthesia, lower extremity edema, or psychological symptoms. After hospital discharge, 54 patients had follow-up chest x-rays, and 41 (75.9%) still had abnormal findings consistent with COVID-19 imaging characteristics. Follow-up laboratory tests identified 44 patients (77.2%, 57 tested) with elevated D-dimer levels, 44 patients (78.6%, 56 tested) with high ferritin levels, and 21patients (35.6%, 59 tested) with elevated troponin T HS levels. Long-lasting COVID-19 symptoms in these patients included respiratory symptoms (26.6%), constitutional symptoms (18.8%), GI symptoms (9.4%), and other symptoms, such as paresthesia, lower extremity edema, or psychological symptoms (19.5%). The rate of telehealth follow-up was 50%.

"Mental health and well-being of anaesthetists during the COVID-19 pandemic: a scoping review","The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed substantial burdens on clinicians and there is a need to better understand the impact on mental health and well-being. This scoping review investigates the prevalence of mental health concerns in anaesthetists, risk and protective factors for mental well-being, and anaesthetists' pandemic-related concerns and support. We searched online databases for articles published between January 2020 and May 2022, using search terms related to: anaesthesia; burnout, well-being, mental health or stress; and COVID-19. We identified 20 articles comprising 19 different populations of anaesthetists (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°8680) from 14 countries. Studies identified the prevalence of the following condition in anaesthetists: burnout (14-59%); stress (50-71%); anxiety (11-74%); depression (12-67%); post-traumatic stress (17-25%); psychological distress (52%); and insomnia (17-61%). Significant risk factors for poorer mental health included: direct COVID-19-related issues (fear of self and family exposure to infection; requirement for quarantine); practitioner health factors (insomnia; comorbidities); psychosocial factors (loneliness; isolation; perceived lack of support at home and work); demographic factors (female gender; non-white ethnicity; LGBTQIA+); and workplace factors (redeployment outside area of clinical practice; increased work effort; personal protective equipment shortages). Protective factors identified included: job satisfaction; perceived organisational justice; older age; and male sex. Anaesthetists' self-reported concerns related to: personal protective equipment; resource allocation; fear of infection; fear of financial loss; increased workload; and effective communication of protocols for patient treatment. Support from family, colleagues and hospital management was identified as an important coping mechanism. Findings from this review may support the design of interventions to enhance anaesthetists' psychological health during pandemic conditions and beyond. Future research should include consistent psychological outcome measures and rigorous experimental design beyond cross-sectional studies.","Paterson, Paterson, Ferris","https://doi.org/10.1111/anae.15879","20221031","COVID-19; mental health; pandemic; risk and protective factors; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40077,""
"Perceived Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Physical Activity Among Adult Patients With Rheumatologic Disease","The objective of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical activity (PA) levels of patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) and to examine factors associated with decreased PA. A sample of adult patients with RMDs (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 7,776) was identified through electronic medical records from an academic health care system in North Carolina. Invitations to participate in an online survey were sent between July 2020 and September 2020 to assess self-reported changes in PA during the COVID-19 pandemic. Descriptive statistics, age-adjusted prevalence odds ratios (PORs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed to examine patient characteristics associated with decreased PA. A total of 893 eligible participants completed the survey (mean age 57.8Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°14.9Ã¢â‚¬â€°years, 75.8% female). The most common primary diagnoses reported among participants included rheumatoid arthritis (27.3%), osteoarthritis (16.0%), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (13.0%). More than half of participants (56.8%) reported engaging in less PA since the pandemic began. Factors associated with engaging in less PA included lower self-reported general health (POR, 2.21; CI, 1.64-2.97) and a diagnosis of SLE (POR, 1.57; CI, 1.03-2.38). Comorbidities associated with decreased PA included chronic pain (POR, 1.38; CI, 1.04-1.82), depression (POR, 1.48; CI, 1.09-2.01), and hypertension (POR, 1.44; CI, 1.10-1.90). The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated barriers to PA in patients with RMDs. There is a critical need to provide resources, support, and multifaceted programs to encourage PA in patients with RMDs during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Saxena-Beem, Dickson, Englund, Cleveland, McCormick, Santana, Walker, Allen, Sheikh","https://doi.org/10.1002/acr2.11507","20221031","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40078,""
"Workplace accommodations during the COVID-19 pandemic: A scoping review of the impacts and implications for people with disabilities","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread changes in the way people work. Some of these changes represent the same kinds of work modifications or adjustments that have often been requested as workplace accommodations, and which may improve labour market and employment outcomes for people with disabilities. The aim of this scoping review was to examine the literature on workplace accommodations in the pandemic and their impacts and implications for people with disabilities. Following a search of six international databases, articles were selected by two reviewers, and data were abstracted in accordance with scoping review methodology. A thematic analysis was used to report the relevant findings. Thirty-seven articles met the inclusion criteria, and three main themes were identified: positive impacts of pandemic-related workplace accommodations on people with disabilities (e.g., improved accessibility, reduced stigma around workplace accommodations, rapid implementation of workplace accommodations, opportunities for advocacy); negative impacts (e.g., worsened physical and mental health, new accommodation needs); and action needed and recommendations (e.g., revisit legislation and policy on accommodations, ensure representation of people with disabilities). Overall, our review identified a mixed assessment of the impacts of pandemic-related accommodations on people with disabilities. However, there was a broader consensus regarding the importance of learning from the experiences of the pandemic to improve workplace accommodation policies in the future. The pandemic may present opportunities for improving workplace accommodation policies, but our review also highlights the need for more research examining how workplace changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted people with disabilities.","Fuentes, Lindsay","https://doi.org/10.3233/WOR-220129","20221031","Pandemics; disabled persons; employment; teleworking","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40079,""
"Behavioral design interventions for the promotion of wellbeing among Filipino healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","Frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) in hospitals have been among the most vulnerable members of the population since the COVID-19 pandemic, affecting not only physical but also mental health. Complementary approaches to providing information for HCWs on taking care of their mental health need development and scaling-up. Behaviorally designed interventions take into consideration the context, resistance, and impact in facilitating behavior change in a specific target segment towards an intended aspiration. The behaviorally designed interventions sought to build individual resilience aligned with the Mental Health and Psychosocial Support Services framework. These included strengthening the provision of non-specialized services and community support among the range of interventions that address mental health problems. These benefit the vulnerable sectors of the population who are at most risk of experiencing chronic stress. Scaling-up of low-cost and subtle tools is a worthy investment for government institutions to ensure that HCWs are continuously supported so they can continue to provide adequate and quality care to those afflicted by COVID-19.","Mantaring, Bello, Agulto, Romualdez, Guevara, Lizarondo, Rigor, Barcarlos","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lanwpc.2022.100627","20221031","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40080,""
"How to enhance psychological security of enterprise employees during the COVID-19 pandemic: Based on MRA and fsQCA","The economic impact caused by the outbreak and dynamic evolution of COVID-19 has reduced employees' psychological security (PS), which not only threatens the physical and mental health of employees but also seriously affects the stable operation and sustainable development of enterprises. PS has been determined to be closely related to daily life experiences. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to examine the types and combinations of life events that improve employees' PS during the pandemic. Cross-sectional data came from 764 enterprise employees in 8 provinces and cities in China during the pandemic period. The participants completed the PS scale to evaluate their PS, and the PS events scale to evaluate the different types of daily life events they experienced. Multiple regression analysis (MRA) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) methods were used to test the research hypothesis. The results of MRA suggest that rich leisure activities (RLA), harmonious family relationship (HFR), stable economic order (SEO) and recognition and support from others (RSO) are important life events that enhance employees' PS. The results of fsQCA suggest that the independent role of SEO, the combined role of sound social security system (SSSS), peace and health events (PHE) and HFR, the combined role of PHE, fulfilling work/life status (FWLS), SEO and RSO can substitute for each other to promote employees' high PS. This article reveals the contribution of daily life events to the PS of enterprise employees, and provides an empirical basis for formulating corresponding intervention measures to promote the physical and mental health of enterprise employees and effective enterprise management.","Gao, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-03775-8","20221031","COVID-19; Fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis; Multiple regression analysis; Psychological security","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40081,""
"Cross-sectional analysis of clinical aspects in patients with long-COVID and post-COVID syndrome","Regarding pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, at-risk individuals, and diagnostic methods for stratifying patients for therapeutic approaches, our understanding of post-COVID syndrome is limited. Here, we set out to assess sociodemographic and clinical aspects in patients with the long-COVID and post-COVID syndrome. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of patients presenting at our specialized university hospital outpatient clinic. We assessed patients' clinical presentation, fatigue, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and impairment of smell. A total of 101 patients were included (73.3% female), of whom 78.2% had a mild course of COVID-19. At presentation, 93.1% suffered from fatigue, 82.2% from impaired concentration, and 79.2% from impaired memory, 53.5% had impaired sleep. The most common secondary diagnosis found in our cohort was thyroid disease. Fatigue analysis showed that 81.3% of female and 58.8% of male patients had severe combined fatigue. Female gender was an independent risk factor for severe fatigue (severe cognitive fatigue OR = 8.045, <i>p</i> = 0.010; severe motor fatigue OR = 7.698, <i>p</i> = 0.013). Males suffered from more depressive symptoms, which correlated positively with the duration of symptom onset. 70.3% of patients with anamnestic smell impairment had hyposmia, and 18.9% were anosmic. Most long-COVID patients suffered from severe fatigue, with the female sex as an independent risk factor. Fatigue was not associated with symptoms of depression or anxiety.

"Exploring social complexities of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal anxiety: A mixed-methods observational cohort study","The aim of this mixed-methods, small-scale observational cohort study was to examine if anxiety in pregnant women increased during the COVID-19 pandemic and to examine the subsequent impact on birth outcomes and psychological well-being. This research was conducted across two hospital sites in North London, with participation from 194 pregnant women. The GAD-7 questionnaire assessed for mild, moderate and high anxiety at one time point during the antenatal period and was repeated 6 weeks postnatally. Women with moderate to high scores on the GAD-7 were invited to participate in semi-structured interviews. The primary outcome measure was assessment of antenatal and postnatal anxiety. Secondary outcome measures assessed if women with moderate/high GAD-7 scores were more likely to develop a mental health condition during pregnancy, or up to 6 weeks postnatally, and if risk of preterm birth (&lt;37 weeks gestation) and instrumental birth or cesarean section increased. Pearson's correlation indicated a positive and significant correlation between the COVID-19 pandemic, and increased self-reported antenatal GAD-7 anxiety scores (r=0.47, n=194, p&lt;0.001). GAD-7 scores were higher during pregnancy compared to the postnatal period [t(193)=4.63; p=0.001; 95% CI: 0.87-2.16]. Logistic regression did not show an increased likelihood of preterm birth [Ãâ€¡Ã‚Â²(1, n=184)=0.999; p=0.971] or instrumental/cesarean section birth in women who scored moderately to highly on the antenatal GAD-7 [Ãâ€¡Ã‚Â²(1, n=184)=2.73; p=0.165]. Qualitative analysis was carried out within a social constructionist framework and identified the following themes: anxiety, maternity care, social impact, and coping. Pregnant women self-reported an increase in antenatal anxiety during July 2020 to April 2021 of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Intersecting Race and Gender Across Hardships and Mental Health During COVID-19: A Moderated-Mediation Model of Graduate Students at Two Universities","While the effects of the pandemic on the mental health of college students can vary across race and gender, few studies have explored the role of hardships and university assistance in these disparities, as well as how these disparities can manifest themselves differently across intersections of race and gender. We address this gap by using unique survey data (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°417) from two large graduate schools of social work, public health, and social policy in the United States. Using multi-group structural equation modeling, we explore how material hardships, academic hardships, and university assistance needed mediates the relationship between race and mental health, including depression and anxiety. We also explore how gender moderates these relationships. We find that Black students are directly related to material hardships and-through these hardships-indirectly related to increased depression, indicating mediation. However, material hardships did not mediate the relationship between race and anxiety. Furthermore, while academic hardships mediated the relationships between race and depression, as well as race and anxiety, these relationships were only significant for females, indicating moderated-mediation. Moreover, although university assistance needed mediated the relationship between race and depression for females only, university assistance needed mediated the relationship between race and anxiety for both males and females. We close with implications for policy and practice.","Jabbari, Ferris, Frank, Malik, Bessaha","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12552-022-09379-y","20221031","COVID-19; Gender; Graduate students; Hardships; Intersectionality; Mental health; Race/ethnicity; University assistance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40084,""

Although they were carrying a lot of pain and hurt on their insides, participants demonstrated a sense of professional determination to overcome obstacles. Physicians are currently dealing with their emotional issues, and they should have access to complete professional help to ensure their wellbeing. The COVID-19 pandemic's mental health effects are anticipated to last far longer than the physical health effects. This study is well-positioned to investigate frontline physicians' opinions and attitudes concerning the COVID-19 and its impact on their daily lives and mental health. This research will help implement context-specific innovative mental health solutions to help the frontline workers.","Afshan, Ahmed, Anwer, Shahid, Khuhro","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.920192","20221031","COVID-19; health; psychological wellbeing; stress; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40086,""
"Stressors and difficulties perceived during the pandemic in the teaching activity of nursing professors","The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has prompted several changes in teaching methods in addition to the ways of learning by students. To check whether a relationship between factors, such as resilience, self-esteem, depression, anxiety, academic stressors, and a change in teaching methods and learning since the first epidemic outbreak exists. This study was a cross-sectional descriptive one with a non-random sample of nursing degree teachers who did or did not participate in clinical activities but had been teaching online since the start of the pandemic. Data were collected with online questionnaires validated for self-completion with Google Forms. Regarding the analysis of the descriptive data of each scale, we can verify that data indicate very high levels of resilience and self-esteem in the normal range with minimal levels of depression, moderate anxiety, and finally not worrying about sources of stress in teachers. Also, negative correlations were found between the 10 Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI 2), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Scale of Sources of Stress in Teachers with a statistical significance of <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001. The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale also showed negative correlations with the three previously mentioned scales with a statistical significance of <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001. Finally, positive correlations between the Beck (BDI 2), Beck (BAI), and Sources of Stress in Teachers scales and between the Rosenberg Self-Esteem scale and the 10 CD RISC scale were found (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Our study shows that nursing degree teachers combine teaching with activities and presented moderate levels of anxiety, depression, and tolerance to academic stressors and were able to maintain optimal levels of self-esteem and resilience, indicating that these two factors act as protectors against these stressors. Nursing teachers presented moderate levels of anxiety, depression, and academic stressors due to optimal levels of self-esteem and resilience.","Losa-Iglesias, Jimenez-Fernandez, Corral-Liria, Herraiz-Soria, Rodriguez-Vazquez, Becerro-De-Bengoa-Vallejo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.989279","20221031","academic stressors; anxiety; depression; resilience; teachers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40087,""
"Association of sugar-sweetened beverage consumption with psychological symptoms among Chinese university students during the COVID-19 pandemic","Mental health of college students has become a public health issue of common concern worldwide. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, the problem has become even more acute. The aim of this study was to assess the association between sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) consumption and psychological symptoms among Chinese college students in order to promote their mental health. The study population was 6,120 college students aged 19-22Ã¢â‚¬â€°years from Anhui, Henan and Xinjiang, China. Basic demographic information, covariates and SSB Consumption data were collected through a self-assessment questionnaire. The ""Multidimensional Sub-health Questionnaire of Adolescents"" was used to assess the psychological symptoms of college students. The Chi-square test, one-way ANOVA and logistic regression analysis were used to investigate the differences and associations between SSB consumption and psychological symptoms among Chinese college students. The detection rate of psychological symptoms among Chinese college students was 8.1%. The detection rate of boys students was 9.4% and that of girls students was 7.1%, and the difference was statistically significant in comparison (<i>Ãâ€¡</i> <sup>2</sup>-value was 11.08, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001).

The same trend was found for emotional symptoms, behavioral symptoms, and social adaptation difficulties dimensions. There is an association between SSB consumption and the occurrence of psychological symptoms among Chinese college students. Future measures should be taken to reduce both SSB consumption and the incidence of psychological symptoms.","Wang, Bi, Liu, Lin, Cai, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1024946","20221031","COVID-19; SSB consumption; association analysis; college students; psychological symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40088,""
"Current state and the support system of athlete wellbeing in Japan: The perspectives of the university student-athletes","The optimization of athletes' wellbeing has been increasingly considered essential both in the academic and practical fields of high-performance sports. Various organizations, such as the International Olympic Committee, have highlighted its importance, particularly mental health. Moreover, the increased attention to athlete wellbeing in sport policy debates at the national level has led to the development and implementation of a support system for athletes' mental wellbeing in some countries. Nevertheless, the literature is limited to understanding the case of Japan. Interestingly, only 0.8% of the literature is available on ""athlete"" and ""wellbeing"" in Japanese compared to English journals up to 2019. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify (a) the current state of wellbeing of Japanese university student-athletes, (b) the level of knowledge about athlete wellbeing, and (c) the athletes' perception of the availability of wellbeing support in the national sports federations, (d) the athlete experience of support services, and develop the types of national support athletes expect and need from the government and national sports federations in the future. As a pilot study, a total of 100 Japanese university student-athletes (43 male, 57 female) from 17 Olympic and seven Paralympic sports completed an online survey. Consequently, the state of their wellbeing was self-perceived as good in all dimensions (i.e., physical, mental, educational, organizational, social, and financial). Moreover, the results showed low recognition of the term ""athlete wellbeing"" and a lack of knowledge of the availability and accessibility of appropriate support services. The results also showed that Japanese university student-athletes rarely seek help from experts, while 45% indicated ""no one"" to talk to. Interestingly, however, most athletes considered each dimension of wellbeing important in relation to their performance development. Based on the results, it is necessary to develop an education program, guidelines, and detection systems and improve information accessibility. Given that this pilot study's validity, reliability, and feasibility were verified, further studies should focus more on the wellbeing of Japanese elite athletes in high-performance sports (i.e., Olympic and Paralympic athletes).","Noguchi, Kuribayashi, Kinugasa","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.821893","20221031","Asia; COVID-19; athlete health; athlete support system; high-performance sports; mental health; psychological/mental wellbeing; sport policy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40089,""
"Dispositional Mindfulness and Self-Compassion Buffer the Effects of COVID-19 Stress on Depression and Anxiety Symptoms","The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with a dramatic rise in symptoms of depression and anxiety. Dispositional mindfulness (DM) and self-compassion (SC) have consistently been associated with psychological disorder symptoms and appear to buffer the effects of stressÃ‚Â onÃ‚Â depression and anxiety. Across two studies (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°888), we examined direct and indirect (moderation) relationships of DM, SC, COVID-19-related stress, and symptoms of depression and anxiety. We also examined the differential effects of several DM measures (FFMQ-15; FFMQ-39; MAAS) in the relationships of COVID-19 stress and psychological disorder symptoms. We recruited participants (Study 1 <i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°350; 42.2% cis women; Study 2 <i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°538; 44.3% cis women) online (MTurk) and examined associations of DM, SC, and COVID-19 stress, and emotional impact, and the moderating effect of DM and SC in the relationships of COVID-19-related fears, stress, emotional impacts, and psychological disorder symptoms. DM and SC were moderately and negatively correlated with COVID-19 fears and stress (correlations ranging <i>r</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°.14 to <i>r</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°.42) across studies. Study 1 moderation analyses demonstrated SC, but not DM (FFMQ-15), significantly moderated relationships of COVID-19 fears and emotional impacts with symptoms. Study 2 analyses demonstrated the FFMQ-39, but not the MAAS, significantly moderated relationships of COVID-19 stress and psychological disorder symptoms. These results support the potential protective roles of DM and SC in disrupting pathological trajectories related to naturally elevated pandemic stress. Results also demonstrate the differential associations of several DM measures with COVID-19 stress.

"The Increased Alcohol and Marijuana Use Associated with the Quality of Life and Psychosocial Aspects: a Study During the Covid-19 Pandemic in a Brazilian University Community","The primary practice adopted to reduce Covid-19 contamination is social distancing (SD). SD had significant consequences on alcohol/drug use, quality of life, and psychosocial aspects. In the university community specifically, SD produces a collective traumatic event with changes in the work routine by the suspension of presence. This study aims to identify and analyze the associations of increased alcohol and marijuana consumption on the quality of life and psychosocial aspects of the university community (students, professors, and technical and administrative staff) at a Brazilian public university during SD due to Covid-19 pandemic. This descriptive and cross-sectional study used an online questionnaire to obtain information from 2790 university community participants. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 22. The analysis included descriptive associations performed using Spearman's correlation coefficient and <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05 was taken as statistically significant. The participants' majority was 62% female, 95.4% students, 73% were 17-25Ã‚Â years old, 33.4% had income between 1 and 3 minimum wage, and 48% of the university community ""totally adhered to SD."" The increased alcohol consumption during SD was associated with a worsening in quality of life (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), health satisfaction (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.015), the meaning of life (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.040), ability to concentrate (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), satisfaction with yourself (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.029), and frequency of negative feelings (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001); in contrast, increased alcohol use improved satisfaction with peer support (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.042), as well as increased marijuana use improved satisfaction with sex life (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). The increased alcohol use was higher in women (30.5%) than in men (26.7%) and was negatively associated with more quality of life and psychosocial aspects among women than men. Students were the segment that presented the highest frequency of associations with increased alcohol and/or marijuana use in the three domains analyzed. This study innovated by associating increased alcohol and/or marijuana use with worsening quality of life and psychosocial aspects rather than evaluating them apart. Future studies must identify whether this association between increased alcohol use, mainly, and the worsening quality of life and psychosocial aspects during the SD period is maintained or improved with the return to face-to-face activities at the university, with particular attention to women and students. Psychologists and other mental health professionals should be called upon to develop interventions to meet emerging mental health needs.","Gallassi, Nakano, de Miranda, Dos Santos, da Silva Rodrigues, de Oliveira","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-022-00937-4","20221031","Alcohol use; Covid-19; Marijuana use; Psychosocial aspects; Quality of life; Social distancing; University community","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40091,""
"Determination of the Prevalence of Postcovid Syndrome and Assessment of the Effectiveness of the Drug Cortexin in the Treatment of Neurological Disorders in Patients with Postcovid Syndrome Results of the CORTEX Multicenter Clinical and Epidemiological Observational Program","<b>Objectives.</b> To study the prevalence and clinical manifestations of postcovid syndrome (PCS) in out-patients and to assess the efficacy of treatment with the drug Cortexin at doses of 10 and 20 mg i.m. for 10 days. <b>Materials and methods.</b> A total of 979 patients with PCS from regions of the Russian Federation, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan were studied; mean age was 54.6 Ã‚Â± 4.5 years; duration of COVID-19 was from one month upwards. Investigations involved three visits. The first was on the day of consultation (assessment of complaints, analysis of scale indicators, prescription of drug Cortexin at a dose of 10 or 20 mg i.m. for 10 days). The second visit (telephone consultation) was on day 10-14. The third visit was on day 30 of out-patient treatment. Assessment of patients' status used an asthenia assessment scale (MFI-20), a brief mental state assessment scale (MMSE), the Schulte test, and the Subjective Treatment Quality Assessment Scale. <b>Results.</b> The proportion of patients with PCS was up to 30% of all neurological admissions. The commonest manifestations were: fatigue, general weakness, decreased memory and concentration of attention, vertigo, sleep impairment, irritability, and aggression; less frequent were breathlessness, pain, increased sweating, anosmia, hyposmia, dysgeusia, paresthesia, hair loss, degradation of vision, tachycardia, allergic reactions, menstrual cycle impairments, erectile dysfunction, panic attacks, suicidal ideation, depression and refusal to eat meat. <b>Conclusions:</b> No associations were found between clinical symptomatology and the severity of COVID-19, the volume of lung tissue affected, or different periods of postcovid syndrome. Cortexin was found to be effective at doses of 10 and 20 mg for correcting the cognitive and asthenic manifestations of PCS.

"Experiencing, anticipating, and witnessing discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic: Implications for health and wellbeing among Asian Americans","The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic spurred increased racial animus toward Asians and Asian Americans (A/AA) who have since been contending with increased racism and violence. While some of the harm associated with this increased prejudice may derive from personally experienced discrimination, the COVID-19 pandemic has also been marked by an increase in vicarious exposure to discrimination as well as increased anticipation of discrimination, both of which may be taxing for the mental and physical health of A/AA. The goal of this study, accordingly, was to examine the effects of personal experiences of discrimination, vicarious exposure to discrimination, and anticipated discrimination on depressive symptoms, physical health symptoms, sleep quality, and sleep disturbances among A/AA. Results from our two-wave field survey demonstrated that experiencing and anticipating discrimination were associated with mental and physical health symptoms as well as sleep disturbances. Further, personal experiences of discrimination interacted with vicarious discrimination to determine physical health symptoms such that greater vicarious exposure weakened the relationship between experienced discrimination and physical health symptoms. These findings demonstrate the need to mobilize resources to combat the multipronged, negative implications of the recent rise in anti-Asian prejudice during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Dhanani, Franz, Pham","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.949403","20221101","Asian Americans; COVID-19; discrimination; health; vigilance; Humans; Asian Americans; COVID-19; Pandemics; Racism; Racial Groups; Sleep Wake Disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40093,""
"Positive mental health in Slovenia before and during the COVID-19 pandemic","Mental health has been heavily affected during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Data from two cross-sectional surveys with nationally representative samples of adult population in Slovenia conducted in 2019 (<i>n</i> = 9,047) and in 2021 (<i>n</i> = 3,429) are used. Positive mental health was measured with Mental Health Continuum-Short Form instrument. Logistic regression was used to examine the associations between flourishing and languishing mental health and relevant COVID-19 specific and other health-related factors. There was a substantial decrease in the prevalence of flourishing and an increase in the prevalence of languishing mental health during the pandemic. Distribution of both flourishing and languishing mental health followed the socio-economic gradient. Resilience, COVID-19 literacy and changes in family relations, social interactions, and dietary habits were associated with both flourishing and languishing mental health. Positive mental health of the population worsened during the pandemic, more so in traditionally disadvantaged populations.

"Experiences and Perceptions of Telephone-delivery of the Common Elements Treatment Approach for Mental Health Needs Among Young People in Zambia During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Mental and behavioral health needs are immense in low-to-middle income countries (LMIC), particularly for adolescents and young adults (AYA). However, access to mental health services is limited in LMIC due to barriers such as distance to a health care site, low number of providers, and other structural and logistical challenges. During the COVID-19 pandemic, these barriers were significantly exacerbated and, thus, mental health services were severely disrupted. A potential solution to some of these barriers is remote delivery of such services via technology. Exploration of AYA experiences is needed to understand the benefits and challenges when shifting to remotely delivered services. Participants included 16 AYA (15-29 years) residing in Lusaka, Zambia who met criteria for a mental or behavioral health concern and received telehealth delivery of the Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA). AYA participated in semi-structured qualitative interviews to explore feasibility, acceptability, and barriers to telephone-delivered treatment in this context. Thematic coding analysis was conducted to identify key themes. Three major response themes emerged: 1) Advantages of telehealth delivery of CETA, Disadvantages or barriers to telehealth delivery of CETA, 3) AYA recommendations for optimizing telehealth (ways to improve telehealth delivery in Zambia. Results indicate that logistical and sociocultural barriers i.e., providing AYA with phones to use for sessions, facilitating one face-to-face meeting with providers) need to be addressed for success of remotely delivered services. AYA in this sample reported telehealth delivery reduces some access barriers to engaging in mental health care provision in Zambia. Addressing logistical and sociocultural challenges identified in this study will optimize feasibility of telehealth delivery and will support the integration of virtual mental health services in the Zambian health system.","Munthali-Mulemba, Figge, Metz, Kane, Skavenski, Mwenge, Kohrt, Pedersen, Sikazwe, Murray","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.906509","20221101","CETA; COVID-19; adolescents and young adults; mental health; telehealth; Young Adult; Adolescent; Humans; COVID-19; Zambia; Mental Health; Pandemics; Telephone","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40095,""
"COVID-19 related information seeking: The impact of media on parental concerns","The expansion of information sources and their use has accelerated since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, sometimes provoking significant concern in the daily lives of parents. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between COVID-19 related information sources and the level of concern about COVID-19 among parents of school-aged children. Using factor analysis and hierarchical ascending classification, we constructed groups according to the information sources they used. We performed ANOVA analysis and then binomial logistic regression to compare concern levels among the groups created. Overall, the 3,459 participants were mainly women (79.2%) and 59.5% reported being between 35 and 44 years old. The mean concern score in our sample was 9.5/15 (s.d. = 3.87).

"Emotional impact on children during home confinement in Spain","The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about important changes. On March 14, 2020, a strict home confinement was decreed in Spain. Children did not attend school and were not allowed to leave their homes. The aim of this study was to determine the emotional state of these children, as well as associated factors. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted using an online questionnaire sent by cell phone. This survey includes sociodemographic items and questions concerning the emotional impact of the lockdown. With the questions on emotions, two categories of emotional state were established with the variables fear, irritability, sadness and somatization: those who were less or more emotionally affected. A multivariate logistic model was used to estimate the associations between the variables. A total of 3,890 responses were obtained. The mean age of the children was 6.78 years (range 0 to 16). A score indicating poor emotional state was reported by 40.12%. The multivariate logistic model for poor emotional state was directly associated with having less appetite, sleep disturbances, and with parents' beliefs that their child will have difficulties returning to normal life after lockdown. A better emotional state was associated with being an only child, access to outdoor spaces at home, having pets, and parents informing their children about the pandemic using creative explanations. During strict home confinement, a considerable emotional impact was observed in children as described by their parents. Specific elements were associated with a better or poorer emotional state.","SÃƒÂ¡nchez-Ferrer, Cervantes-GarcÃƒÂ­a, GavilÃƒÂ¡n-MartÃƒÂ­n, Quesada, Cortes-Castell, Nso-Roca","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.969922","20221101","COVID-19; children; confinement; emotional impact; irritability; sadness; Child; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Infant; Child, Preschool; Adolescent; Pandemics; Spain; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Communicable Disease Control; Emotions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40097,""
"Sleep quality and creativity in Chinese college student during the COVID-19 pandemic: The mediating role of executive function","COVID-19 has impacted adolescents' interpersonal relationships, life attitudes, and mental health during the past 3 years. However, previous studies predominantly focused on negative problems, while few studies assessed the situation of teenagers from the perspective of positive psychology. Therefore, this study explores the creativity level of Chinese college students during the COVID-19 pandemic, the relationship between sleep quality and creativity, and the mediating role of executive function. A cross-sectional study was conducted across six colleges in Heilongjiang in China, with a sample of 4,258 college students recruited <i>via</i> stratified cluster sampling. Data were collected through an online survey. A mediation model was constructed, and SPSS PROCESS macro was used to analyze the data. The creativity score of Chinese college students during the COVID-19 pandemic was 106.48 Ã‚Â± 13.61. Correlation analysis demonstrated that sleep quality correlated negatively with creativity (<i>r</i> = -0.08, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.01) but positively with executive function (<i>r</i>=0.45, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.01), whilst executive function correlated negatively with creativity (<i>r</i> = -0.10, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.01). Moreover, the mediation model revealed that executive function partially mediated the relationship between sleep quality and creativity in college students (indirect effec<i>t</i> = -0.017, <i>SE</i> = 0.004, 95% <i>CI</i> = [-0.025, -0.008]). Executive function accounted for 48.6% of the variance in college students' creativity. School administrators should implement measures such as sleep education to enhance students' sleep quality. Concurrently, curriculum and assessment implementation should enhance executive function.

"The relations between different components of intolerance of uncertainty and symptoms of depression during the COVID-19 pandemic: A network analysis","The relations between depression and intolerance of uncertainty (IU) have been extensively investigated during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is a lack of understanding on how each component of IU may differentially affect depression symptoms and vice versa. The current study used a network approach to reveal the component-to-symptom interplay between IU and depression and identify intervention targets for depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 624 college students participated in the current study. An IU-Depression network was estimated using items from the 12-item Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. We examined the network structure, node centrality, and node bridge centrality to identify component-to-symptom pathways, central nodes, and bridge nodes within the IU-Depression network. Several distinct pathways (e.g., ""Frustration when facing uncertainty"" and ""Feelings of worthlessness"") emerged between IU and Depression. ""Fatigue"" and ""Frustration when facing uncertainty"" were identified as the central nodes in the estimated network. ""Frustration when facing uncertainty,"" ""Psychomotor agitation/retardation,"" and ""Depressed or sad mood"" were identified as bridging nodes between the IU and Depression communities. By delineating specific pathways between IU and depression and highlighting the influential role of ""Frustration when facing uncertainty"" in maintaining the IU-Depression co-occurrence, current findings may inform targeted prevention and interventions for depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Feng, Ren, Liu, Li, Wu, Wei, Yuan, Cui, Yang, Li, Yang, Li, Wang, Wang, Liu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.993814","20221031","COVID-19; bridge nodes; central nodes; depression; intolerance of uncertainty; network analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40100,""
"Factors associated with mental health outcomes among caregivers of older adults in long-term care facilities during COVID-19 post-epidemic era in Shandong, China","COVID-19 pandemic has altered the work mode in long-term care facilities (LTCFs), but little is known about the mental health status of caregivers of older adults. A total of 672 formal caregivers of older adults in LTCFs and 1,140 formal patient caregivers in hospitals (comparison group) responded to an online survey conducted from March 25, 2022 to April 6, 2022. Five psychological scales, including Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), The 5-item World Health Organization Wellbeing Index (WHO-5) and Perceived Stress Scale-14 item (PSS-14), were applied to assess participants' mental health status. Factors, including sex, profession, marital status, economic conditions, length of working experience, frequent night shift beyond 1 day per week and having organic diseases, were included in logistic regression analysis to identify associated factors with mental health outcomes of formal caregivers of older adults in LTCFs. Caregivers of older adults in LTCFs developed similar severe psychological symptoms with patient caregivers in hospital setting. For caregivers of older adults in LTCFs, unmarried status was a potent risk factor for insomnia, anxiety, impaired wellbeing and health risk stress, with odds ratios ranging from 1.91 to 3.64. Frequent night shift beyond 1 day per week was associated with higher risks of insomnia, depression and impaired wellbeing. Likewise, having organic disease or inferior economic condition, and being nurses appeared to be independent predictors for multiple mental health-related outcomes. During COVID-19 post-epidemic era, caregivers of older adults in LTCFs had a higher prevalence of psychological symptoms, especially those with particular risk factors. Special attention should be paid to promote their mental health.","Chen, Cao, Lu, Zheng, Kong, Dong, Zhou","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.1011775","20221031","COVID-19; caregivers of older adults; long-term care facility; mental health; nursing home","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40101,""
"Fear of COVID-19, prolonged smartphone use, sleep disturbances, and depression in the time of COVID-19: A nation-wide survey","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a wide range of behavioral and psychological effects on the general population. This study examined the relationship between fear of COVID-19, daily smartphone use, sleep disturbance, and depression in the general population during the early stage of COVID-19. An online nation-wide survey was conducted from March 20 to April 10, 2020. Sociodemographic information, including age, gender, educational attainment, vocation, and duration of self-isolation, was collected; fear of COVID-19 and other objective exposures, daily hours of smartphone use, night sleep duration, sleep disturbance, and depressive symptoms were measured with structured questions and PHQ-9. There were 1,280 questionnaires in total, and 1,250 valid questionnaires remained. The prevalence of sleep disturbance and depression were found to be 13.1 and 10.7%, respectively. Feelings of extreme fear, longer smartphone use, difficulty initiating sleep, and early morning awakening were significant risk factors for depression. Daily hours of smartphone use, difficulty initiating sleep, and early morning awakening partially mediated the association between feeling extremely scared of the pandemic and depression. Psychological interventions in a major public health crisis should focus more on the subjective perception of pandemic fear. At the same time, daily smartphone use and sleep disturbances could serve as targets for monitoring and intervention for depression during a pandemic.","Li, Liu, Qiu, Tang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.971800","20221031","COVID-19; depression; pandemic fear; sleep disturbance; smartphone use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40102,""
"Pandemic experiences and psychopathological aspects in individuals with mood disorders and other mental disorders","Individuals with different personality traits, temperaments, and psychological symptoms have different attitudes toward the pandemic experiences and restrictive measures. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the associations between the psychological factors and the attitudes toward COVID-19, experienced during the third pandemic wave in Italy, in a sample of individuals with psychiatric disorders. Between March and September 2021, 53 patients with mood disorders and other mental disorders completed a survey composed of self-report questionnaires that assessed sleep quality, depressive and hypomanic symptoms, and temperament and personality traits. Positive and negative attitudes toward the pandemic experience were assessed using an <i>ad hoc</i> questionnaire. The results showed that individuals with more severe depressive symptoms were less prone to adhere to government guidelines, and were more convinced that the pandemic was not a real problem. Reduced sleep quality was associated with increased skepticism toward official explanations concerning the causes of COVID-19. Lastly, negative affect and cyclothymic temperament predicted the disposition toward COVID-19 vaccines. In conclusion, these findings highlighted that some psychological aspects and psychiatric symptoms could influence the beliefs about COVID-19 and compliance with government recommendations. Further research is needed to provide indications on how to improve the current healthcare policies.","Del Casale, Lai, Iannuccelli, Ciacchella, Veneziani, Ali, Zocchi, Bilotta, Pompili","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.1039072","20221031","COVID-19; mood disorders; personality; skepticism; temperament","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40103,""

"Does an Online Positive Psychological Intervention Improve Positive Affect in Young Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic?","Meta-analyses indicate that positive psychological interventions are effective at increasing positive affect, as well as reducing anxiety and depression; however, it is unclear how well these effects generalize during periods of high stress. Therefore, the current study tested whether a 2-week online positive psychological intervention delivered during the COVID-19 pandemic, a naturalistic stressor, (1) increased positive affect; (2) improved psychological well-being, optimism, life satisfaction, perceived social support, and loneliness; (3) and reduced negative affect in college students, a group known to have high pandemic distress. Participants (<i>N</i> = 250; 76.9% female) ages 18-45 were recruited from the University of Pittsburgh undergraduate subject pool between September and November of 2020. Participants were randomized to the online positive psychological intervention or active control condition and stratified by trait positive affect, sex, and year in college. Participants in both conditions completed one writing activity every other day for two consecutive weeks. Control participants documented their activities for that day (e.g., meals, going to gym). Intervention participants chose from six positive psychology activities. All outcome variables were assessed pre- and post-intervention by validated questionnaires. Across both conditions, positive and negative affect decreased from pre- to post-intervention. No other psychological factor differed by condition, time, or their interaction. The current null findings are in line with a more recent meta-analysis indicating that positive psychological interventions may have smaller effects on psychological well-being and depressive symptoms than was reported pre-pandemic. Study findings may suggest reduced efficacy of virtual positive psychological interventions under highly stressful circumstances.

"Perceived COVID-19-related Stress Drives Home Gardening Intentions and Improves Human Health in Taiwan","The COVID-19 pandemic has added a layer of mental health problems and perceived stress. Home gardening is considered a good method to reduce perceived stress. The current research evidence is insufficient to understand the relationship and influencing factors between the intentions, behaviors, and benefits of home gardening during short-term COVID-19 events. Although the duration from the onset to stabilization of the outbreak lasted for only 1.5 months from May to June 2021 throughout Taiwan, the significant pandemic changes might have affected the perceived stress along with the intentions, behaviors, and benefits of home gardening. This study explored the relationship between pandemic stress and home gardening through online snowball sampling because of the strict social distancing regulations. A total of 1455 non-follow-up and internet questionnaires throughout Taiwan were collected during the wave onset, peak, easing, and stabilization stages. The questionnaire included questions on personal information, perceived pandemic stress, gardening intentions, gardening behaviors, and gardening benefits. This study showed that perceived stress increased from the pandemic onset to its peak, and decreased from the peak to stabilization stages. Home gardening intentions and behaviors also revealed similar trends. Higher pandemic-perceived stress directly increased home-gardening intentions and indirectly promoted home-gardening behaviors and benefits. Our findings indicated that home gardening is a positive element in reducing perceived stress. Lower gardening intentions and behaviors were observed when the high perceived stress was removed. This study suggests that home gardening was a valuable strategy for staying close to nature and obtaining multiple benefits during the peak pandemic period. Providing small-scale gardening activities and spaces is appropriate for obtaining gardening benefits and avoiding space abandonment after the pandemic. Providing seeds, seedlings, tools, knowledge, online home gardening programs, and small residential and food gardens is a valuable strategy for obtaining multiple benefits during the peak of the pandemic.","Wu, Chou, Huang, Tu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2022.127770","20221031","COVID-19; home gardening; perceived stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40106,""
"Digital phenotyping for classification of anxiety severity during COVID-19","COVID-19 has led to an increase in anxiety among Canadians. Canadian Perspectives Survey Series (CPSS) is a dataset created by Statistics Canada to monitor the effects of COVID-19 among Canadians. Survey data were collected to evaluate health and health-related behaviours. This work evaluates CPSS2 and CPSS4, which were collected in May and July of 2020, respectively. The survey data consist of up to 102 questions. This work proposes the use of the survey data characteristics to identify the level of anxiety within the Canadian population during the first- and second-phases of COVID-19 and is validated by using the General Anxiety Disorder (GAD)-7 questionnaire. Minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) is applied to select the top features to represent user anxiety, and support vector machine (SVM) is used to classify the separation of anxiety severity. We employ SVM for binary classification with 10-fold cross validation to separate the labels of <i>Minimal</i> and <i>Severe</i> anxiety to achieve an overall accuracy of <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mml:mn>94.77</mml:mn> <mml:mo>Ã‚Â±</mml:mo> <mml:mn>0.13</mml:mn> <mml:mtext>%</mml:mtext></mml:math> and <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mml:mn>97.35</mml:mn> <mml:mo>Ã‚Â±</mml:mo> <mml:mn>0.11</mml:mn> <mml:mtext>%</mml:mtext></mml:math> for CPSS2 and CPSS4, respectively. After analysis, we compared the results of the first and second phases of COVID-19 and determined a subset of the features that could be represented as pseudo passive (PP) data.

"Adolescent Loneliness during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Pre-Pandemic Risk Factors","The COVID-19 pandemic is a global mental health crisis that disproportionately impacts adolescents. Loneliness is a particularly salient pandemic psychosocial outcome to understand; however, research to date on this outcome is sparse and largely cross-sectional. In response, we examined pre-pandemic risk factors for pandemic loneliness. Further, we examined how risk may differ based on key demographics, and whether mediation or moderation models best explained potential disparities in experiencing loneliness. Self-reported, pre-pandemic mental health, trauma exposure, and family conflict survey data were collected at Wave 1 in a diverse sample of 369 adolescents (54.5% female, 45.5% male; 30.1% White; 30.9% Black; 18.4% Hispanic; M<sub>age</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°15.04; <i>SD</i> <sub><i>age</i></sub> Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.10). Subsequently, self-reported experiences of loneliness during the pandemic were collected 6Ã‚Â months (April-June 2020) and 12Ã‚Â months (October-December 2020) later. Using a regression-based framework (i.e., PROCESS), we tested (a) which pre-pandemic risks uniquely predicted prospective loneliness and (b) whether loneliness risk was elevated for certain identities (i.e., mediation models) or whether certain identities were more sensitive to specific risks (i.e., moderation models). Overall, pre-pandemic depressive and aggression symptoms predicted early pandemic loneliness (6-month follow-up), whereas anxiety symptoms specifically predicted mid-pandemic loneliness (12-month follow-up). Environmental stressors were moderated by gender, such that females with pre-pandemic trauma exposure were more likely to report pandemic loneliness. Further, pre-pandemic internalizing distress for girls and externalizing symptoms for boys, reflected gender-specific pathways for loneliness.

"Same storm, different boats: the impact of COVID-19 on Black students and academic staff in UK and US higher education","The permanence of systemic racism in the UK and USA means that Black people are disadvantaged in myriad ways, including within the Academy. While the disproportionate impact of COVID-19, alongside the Black Lives Matter movement, has increased awareness of the challenges faced by Black communities, these issues remain, both in and beyond higher education. Furthermore, there is still a paucity of research individualising the experiences of Black people, who are often homogenised with other ethnic minority groups. This paper explores the impact of COVID-19 on UK and US Black students and academic staff, utilising a critical race theory (CRT) framework. Analysis revealed that Black students and staff experienced COVID-19 against the backdrop of racism as a ""pandemic within a pandemic"" (Laurencin and Walker, Cell Systems 11:9-10, 2020), including racial (re)traumatisation, loneliness and isolation. Other themes included precarious employment and exploitation.

"Mental health challenges during COVID-19: perspectives from parents with children with neurodevelopmental disabilities","The global pandemic and subsequent denials, delays, and disruptions in essential daily activities created significant challenges for children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) and their parents. Public health restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic limited access to supports and services required by children with NDDs to maintain their health and well-being. This study sought to understand the impacts of these public health measures and restrictions on mental health from the perspective of parents with children with NDDs to inform pathways for public health policies responsive to the needs of this population. Interpretive descriptive design was used to guide data collection and data analysis. Forty caregivers were interviewed about their experience with pandemic restrictions. Generic policy measures contributed to many gaps in families' social support systems and contributed to mental health challenges for children and their parents. Four themes emerged: 1) lack of social networks and activities, 2) lack of access to health and social supports, 3) tension in the family unit, and 4) impact on mental health for children and their parents. Emergency preparedness planning requires a disability inclusive approach allocating resources for family supports in the home and community.

"Disposable face masks release micro particles to the aqueous environment after simulating sunlight aging: Microplastics or non-microplastics?","This study focuses on characterizing microplastics and non-microplastics released from surgical masks (SMs), N95 masks (N95), KN95 masks (KN95), and childrenâ€™s masks (CMs) after simulating sunlight aging. Based on micro-Raman spectrum analysis, it was found that the dominant particles released from masks were non-microplastics (66.76â€“98.85%). Unfortunately, CMs released the most microplastics, which is 8.92 times more than SMs. The predominant size range of microplastics was 30â€“500Â Âµm, and the main polymer types were PP and PET. Compared with the whole SMs, the microplastic particles released from the cutting-SMs increased conspicuously, which is 12.15 times that of the whole SMs. The main components of non-microplastics include ÃŸ-carotene, microcrystalline cellulose 102, and eight types of minerals. Furthermore, non-microplastics were mainly fibrous and fragmented in appearance, similar to the morphology of microplastics. After 15 days of UVA-aging, the fibers of the face layers had cracks to varying degrees. It was estimated that these four types of masks can release at least 31.5 trillion microplastics annually in China. Overall, this study demonstrated that the masks could release a large quantity of microplastics and non-microplastics to the environment after sunlight aging, deserving urgent attention in the future study.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.130146","20230205","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40113,""

"How Covid-19 restrictions affected young people's well-being and drinking practices: Analyzing interviews with a socio-material approach","Background The Covid-19 restrictions â€“ as they made young people's practices in their everyday life visible for reflection and reformation â€“ provide a productive opportunity to study how changing conditions affected young people's well-being and drinking practices. Methods The data is based on qualitative interviews with 18- to 24-year-old Swedes (n=33) collected in the Autumn 2021. By drawing on the socio-material approach, the paper traces actants, assemblages and trajectories that moved the participants towards increased or decreased well-being during the lockdown. Results The Covid-19 restrictions made the participants reorganize their everyday life practices emphatically around the home and communication technologies. The restrictions gave rise to both worsened and improved well-being trajectories. In the worsened well-being trajectories, the pandemic restrictions moved the participants towards loneliness, loss of routines, passivity, physical barriers, self-centered thoughts, negative effects of digital technology, sleep deficit, identity crisis, anxiety, depression, and stress. In the improved well-being trajectories, the Covid-19 restrictions brought about freedom to study from a distance, more time for significant others, oneself and for one's own hobbies, new productive practices at home and a better understanding of what kind of person one is. Both worsened and improved well-being trajectories were related to the aim to perform well, and in them drinking practices either diminished or increased the participantsâ€™ capacities and competencies for well-being. Conclusions The results suggest that material domestic spaces, communication technologies and performance are important actants both for alcohol consumption and well-being among young people. These actants may increase or decrease young people's drinking and well-being depending on what kinds of relations become assembled.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2022.103895","20221201","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40116,""
"Correlation between psychiatric impact of COVID-19 during pregnancy and fetal outcomes in Egyptian women","The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was examined in 238 pregnant women with (nÂ =Â 146) and without (nÂ =Â 92) coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). Fetal outcomes in the same groups were evaluated using the Apgar score. Anxiety and depression scores were significantly higher in women with COVID-19 but PTSD scores were similar in both groups. Infection with COVID-19 was associated with a higher number of fetal deaths or an Apgar score <7. During the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 46.6% of pregnant women had depression, 5.5% had PTSD, 64.3% had state anxiety, and 60.9% had trait anxiety. Except for PTSD, psychiatric problems and poor fetal outcomes were higher in women with COVID-19 than in those without COVID-19. Lastly, women with COVID-19 were more prone to have a fetus who died or had an Apgar score of <7.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114920","20221101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40117,""

"Coping strategies used by health-care workers during the SARS-COV2 crisis A real-world analysis","The aim of this paper is to analyze the main coping strategies used by frontline teams during the first days of the COVID pandemic confinement in Spain. This information could be necessary in order to carry out training programs that allow a better handling of future emergency situations, as well as acting more effectively and with less negative emotional impact. A questionnaire was used to identify different psychological profiles for coping, and in turn, other relevant variables were analyzed. The most used strategies by health professionals were problem solving, desiderative thinking and social support. Emotional expression and social support were used more by women. Significantly different behaviors were found in desiderative thinking (lower in people of 35â€“50 years old, and social support, higher in people 35 years old). The symptoms most commonly experienced by medical personnel were: sleep disorders, anxiety, tension, depressive symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms and general somatic muscular symptoms. A relationship could be determined between the age/gender of the workers and the participants' overall assessment of their ability to cope with the COVID-19 stress situation they had experienced (men 50 years old and women between 35 and 50 years old, who felt able or very able to cope with the stress caused by the health emergency. However, women <35 years old and >50 years old believed they were able to cope poorly with the circumstances. The advantage of specific training plans in order to help with some stress symptoms could be suggested, aimed at the acquisition of tools based on problem solving, and emotional management in stressful and emergency situations.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114915","20221101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40119,""

"Behavior change after fentanyl testing at a safe consumption space for women in Northern Mexico: A pilot study","Background Fentanyl has led to an increased number of overdose deaths in North America. Testing substances for fentanyl may be a harm reduction strategy to prevent overdose. Little is known about behavior change after fentanyl testing and the attitudes around fentanyl knowledge and testing along the US-Mexico border in the context of a safe consumption site. Methods This was a pilot quantitative and qualitative study with 30 women who use drugs at an unsanctioned safe consumption site in Mexicali, Mexico. Women participated in a quantitative survey, a semi-structured interview, and fentanyl testing of substances. Injection behavior was observed after fentanyl testing results were provided. Qualitative data were collected to explore the meanings participants attributed to fentanyl and fentanyl testing. Results Half of the substances tested positive for fentanyl (n=15, 50%), and all of them were in samples of black tar heroin. Among those participants who tested positive for fentanyl, 7 (47%) subsequently used less of the intended substance, 1 did not use the intended substance, and 7 (47%) did not change their behavior (i.e., used as originally intended). In qualitative interviews, a predominant theme was a description of fentanyl as dangerous and deadly and fentanyl testing as being helpful for modifying drug use behaviors. However, participants recognized that there could be no change in behavior following a positive fentanyl test in the context of not being able to find substances free of fentanyl. Conclusion We observed mixed results related to behavior change after women's intended substance for use tested positive for fentanyl. Fentanyl testing was acceptable to women, but behavior change was hampered by the inability to find substances free of fentanyl. Further research is needed to maximize the potential of fentanyl testing as a harm reduction tool especially in the context of a changing drug supply.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2022.103745","20220801","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40123,""

"Related factors of depressive symptoms vary among adolescents and young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic","Depression represents a public health problem, especially in the adolescent and young adult populations. Studies have shown that during the COVID-19 outbreak, depressive symptoms were associated with economic instability, among other aspects related to isolation. The present study seeks to identify sociodemographic characteristics and situations associated with the presence of depressive symptoms in young people (N = 2058) in an Andean city at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. Logistic regression analysis reveals that the factors predicting depressive symptoms vary between adolescents and young adults. The results show that perceived health status, satisfaction with virtuality, and being a woman are related to depressive symptoms. Likewise, it was found that, in young adults, but not in adolescents, the level of economic income and taking virtual classes were related to symptomatology. Receiving economic income turned out to have a differentiated effect according to age group since this factor increases the probability of developing depressive symptomatology in adolescents, while it reduces this probability in the older age group. Finally, the findings of this study are discussed by evidence from other studies in different countries.","Duban Rafael Romero et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0166-6FE-618","20221031","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; isolation; mental health; depressive symptoms; living conditions; youth","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40125,""
"Association between the Onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Mental Health Outcomes among Patients Enrolled in a Supported Digital Health Intervention","Objective: This study compared mental health outcomes among people enrolled in an evidence-based digital mental health intervention before and during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Growth curve modeling was used to evaluate changes in biweekly depression and anxiety scores from 131 adults who participated pre- (2019; n=51) versus during- (2020; n=80) pandemic onset. Results: Individuals who completed the intervention during the pandemic (2020) had less steep declines in depression symptoms than those who participated pre-pandemic (2019). Despite an initial relative increase in anxiety and depression scores at the onset of the pandemic, differences in overall change in outcomes between the two cohorts were not evident by program completion. Conclusions: Participation in an evidence-based, digital mental health intervention during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with similar magnitudes of symptom improvement as participation before the pandemic.","Adam Khan Pettitt et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E006E-2CC-E70","20221031","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; digital health interventions; mhealth; anxiety; depression; covid","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","",40126,""
