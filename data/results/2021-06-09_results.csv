"Internet use, eHealth literacy and fear of COVID-19 among nursing students in the Philippines","The COVID-19 outbreak brought into focus not only the safety but also the mental well-being of nursing students  At present, the level of fear of COVID-19 and associated factors among nursing students in the Philippines are not well understood  This cross-sectional online survey determined the relationship between Internet use and eHealth literacy with fear of COVID-19  One thousand three hundred and sixty-seven (n=1,367) answered an online survey using the adopted eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS), and Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) administered from May 1 to 15, 2020  Descriptive statistics, tests for differences, and correlational analysis were performed  Results indicated that the composite score of the FCV-19S was 3 65, indicating moderate to high levels of fear  Fear of COVID-19 significantly differed based on sex, year level, and location  A significant inverse relationship was found between the average daily use of the Internet and fear of COVID-19  On the other hand, no significant association was noted between eHealth literacy and fear of COVID-19  The first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in a far-reaching impact on nursing students' psychological well-being  This study highlights the value of the Internet and its use during the outbreak may not always lead to higher fear related to COVID-19  Nursing schools may need to create strategies to promote regulated and responsible Internet use, address students' mental health concerns, and develop interventions to respond proactively to mitigate or reduce fear among nursing students during the pandemic","Oducado, R.

"The impact of social media on young web users' psychological well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic progression","Aim  The present study empirically investigates and theoretically substantiates the results of the impact of social media on young web-users' psychological well-being during the forced self-isolation caused by the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic (N = 254)  Materials and methods  Standardized valid psycho-diagnostic methods, the author's questionnaire (A  Hudimova, 2021), correlation and factor analyses were used to identify young web users' patterns of social media involvement during the forced self-isolation  Results  The results show that during the global COVID-19 pandemic, young web users give preference for passive social media use rather than for communication  The obtained results showed an expansion in the time spent via social media by young web users  It was found that the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic is accompanied by the participants' experience of negative emotions and fears of the unknown (r =  204;p &lt; 01)  It is substantiated that increasing immersion of young web users in social media is a kind of strategy to escape from bad thoughts (r =  271;p &lt; 01)  Significantly, it is stated that uncontrolled use of social media causes sleep disorders during isolation (r =  444;p &lt; 01)  Conclusions  The study proves that young people spend almost all day online due to the obsessive pattern of social media involvement and/or procrastination, which often provokes withdrawal syndrome upon the attempt to distract from them  The lack of controlled time spending on social media during self-isolation provokes an exacerbation of anxiety, apathy, depressed mood, and a sense of isolation from social reality  The obtained results provide evidence that the causal relations of passive social media use provoke an exacerbation of feelings of alienation, disrupt the healthy rhythm of sleep, and psychological state of young web-users during the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic","Hudimova, A.; Popovych, I.; Baidyk, V.; Buriak, O.; Kechyk, O.","https://doi.org/10.34069/ai/2021.39.03.5","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Amazonia Investiga; 10(39):50-61, 2021.; Publication details: Amazonia Investiga; 10(39):50-61, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14460,""

"Preserving and empowering local languages amidst the Covid-19 pandemic Lessons from East Kalimantan","This article brings together two ostensibly separate subjects: language empowerment and the Covid-19 pandemic  It argues that knowledge of local languages can help disseminate health-related information on a regional level  This addresses two problems simultaneously: the problems raised by the intelligibilty of governmental healthcare protocols and the functions of the use of local languages  The article is a case study presenting a number of interventions in the languages of East Kalimantan and can be seen as an inclusive, grassroots example of health communication  The study was initially a modest attempt to generate on-the-ground examples of health information in the dominant languages of the region of East Kalimantan  These studies demonstrate that the local communities of these languages are very enthusiastic about getting involved in the interventions  They also reveal that communication using IT and social media is thriving  One of our observations was that information about this pandemic tends to be understood only by highly educated urban people  This happens because it is conveyed by the government in standard Indonesian, which includes many foreign loanwords  The application of local languages is not just using local language vocabulary, it is instead a trigger to revive the collective memory of disaster management based on local culture  In this case, local languages are recognized and considered useful in helping to break the chain of virus transmission to free Indonesia of the Covid-19 outbreak  There were a number of unexpected developments  We found support for the intervention being rolled out on a national level by Special Task Force for Covid-19 under National Disaster Management Agency (Badan Nasional Penanggulangan Bencana/BNPB)  We also welcomed the online publication by the National Agency for Language Development and Cultivation (Badan Bahasa) of the Handbook for managing behavior about health protocols in seventy-seven local languages  The main thrust of this article should therefore be of interest to anyone working to empower local languages and language vitality","Lauder, A.

"The Impact of The Coronavirus Disease 2019 Outbreak on The Quality of Life of Patients with Epilepsy","Objectives: We aimed to investigate the effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak on the quality of life (QOL) of patients with epilepsy  Methods: A total of 104 epilepsy patients admitted to our hospital during October and November of 2019 were evaluated for their QOL using the QOL in Epilepsy-31 questionnaire  These assessments were repeated in July 2020 and August 2020 to evaluate the impact of the epidemic on the QOL of epilepsy patients in the same group  The data of the patients were analyzed in SPSS  Results: During the pandemic period, overall score values decreased significantly compared to the pre-pandemic period (p=0 049)  Although most of the subscores worsened with the pandemic, the most significant deterioration was observed in emotional well-being (p=0 021)  There were six patients (5 8%) whose seizure frequency increased during the pandemic period  In the multivariate analysis, the only parameter that predicted an increase in seizure frequency during COVID-19 was the overall score  Overall score had a positive correlation with educational level  Disease duration, age, marital status, and number of drugs used were found to be negatively correlated with the overall score of the patients  Conclusion: The COVID-19 epidemic causes a significant deterioration in QOL in patients with epilepsy  During epidemics such as COVID-19, clinicians should consider psychosocial factors  In patients with epilepsy, measures should be taken not only to control seizures but also to prevent deterioration in mental health and QOL","Gul, Z.

"ART AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING IN TIMES OF MANDATORY CONFINEMENT: EVIDENCE TO STRENGTHEN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CULTURAL AND MENTAL HEALTH POLICIES","The coronavirus pandemic has forced governments around the world to enact hitherto unknown measures to curb its worst economic and social consequences  In Spain, Royal Decree 463/2020 of March 14, 2020 declares the state of alarm for the management of the health crisis situation caused by COVID-19  From that moment, the population was confined to their homes in a general way, with minors being locked up between March 14 and April 26, 2020  In this study we identify the behaviors, emotions and physical symptoms that they may have suffered minors derived from confinement  We also analyze whether the development of creative activities during confinement has motivated emotional and behavioral changes in them  The results confirm that the performance of these activities has positive effects, contributing to significantly mitigate some symptoms such as nervousness or excessive attachment to adults, also significantly improving their behavior and attitude in this extraordinary situation  The investigation is completed comparing the effects of confinement with pediatric hospitalization, influencing the attitudinal and sociability changes of minors  Faced with the current trend towards the displacement of artistic education from the curricula, the evidence found reinforces the demands that art occupy a central place in society;a role that goes beyond the narrow space traditionally limited to the Economy of Culture and directed by the market  In conclusion, we reflect on the direction that economic policies should have to relate cultural policy and mental health policies from the early stages","Fernandez, T.

"Prevalence and risk factors of violence against women and children during COVID-19, Germany","Objective To assess the prevalence and exacerbating factors of violence against women and children in Germany during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic  Methods We conducted a representative online survey with partnered women (18-65 years) between 22 April and 8 May 2020, when participants had been under lockdown for a month  We determined the prevalence of several forms of violence within the previous month using both direct elicitation and a list experiment  We conducted a multivariable logistic regression to assess the impact of pandemicassociated risk factors  Findings Of our 3818 survey respondents, 118 (3 09%;95% confidence interval, CI: 2 54 to 3 64) reported incidents of physical conflict, 293 (7 67%;95% CI: 6 83 to 8 52) reported emotional abuse, and 97 (6 58%;95% CI: 5 31 to 7 85) of 1474 respondents with children reported child corporal punishment  We estimated that 3 57% (95% CI: -0 33 to 7 46) had non-consensual intercourse with their partner  Our regression analysis revealed an increased risk of physical conflict with home quarantine (odds ratio, OR: 2 38;95% CI: 1 56 to 3 61), financial worries (OR: 1 60;95% CI: 0 98 to 2 61), poor mental health (OR: 3 41;95% CI: 2 12 to 5 50) and young (&lt; 10 years) children (OR: 2 48;95% CI: 1 32 to 4 64);we obtained similar results for other forms of violence  Awareness and use of pertinent support services was low  Conclusion Our findings of an increased risk of domestic violence during the pandemic should prompt policy-makers to improve the safety of women and children  Interventions to alleviate risks factors and extend support services are required  (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Objetivo

"Evidence of Human-Level Bonds Established With a Digital Conversational Agent: Cross-sectional, Retrospective Observational Study","Background: There are far more patients in mental distress than there is time available for mental health professionals to support them  Although digital tools may help mitigate this issue, critics have suggested that technological solutions that lack human empathy will prevent a bond or therapeutic alliance from being formed, thereby narrowing these solutionsâ€™ efficacy  Objective: We aimed to investigate whether users of a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)â€“based conversational agent would report therapeutic bond levels that are similar to those in literature about other CBT modalities, including face-to-face therapy, group CBT, and other digital interventions that do not use a conversational agent  Methods: A cross-sectional, retrospective study design was used to analyze aggregate, deidentified data from adult users who self-referred to a CBT-based, fully automated conversational agent (Woebot) between November 2019 and August 2020  Working alliance was measured with the Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised (WAI-SR), and depression symptom status was assessed by using the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2)  All measures were administered by the conversational agent in the mobile app  WAI-SR scores were compared to those in scientific literature abstracted from recent reviews  Results: Data from 36,070 Woebot users were included in the analysis  Participants ranged in age from 18 to 78 years, and 57 48% (20,734/36,070) of participants reported that they were female  The mean PHQ-2 score was 3 03 (SD 1 79), and 54 67% (19,719/36,070) of users scored over the cutoff score of 3 for depression screening  Within 5 days of initial app use, the mean WAI-SR score was 3 36 (SD 0 8) and the mean bond subscale score was 3 8 (SD 1 0), which was comparable to those in recent studies from the literature on traditional, outpatient, individual CBT and group CBT (mean bond subscale scores of 4 and 3 8, respectively)  PHQ-2 scores at baseline weakly correlated with bond scores (r=-0 04;P&lt; 001);however, users with depression and those without depression had high bond scores of 3 45  Conclusions: Although bonds are often presumed to be the exclusive domain of human therapeutic relationships, our findings challenge the notion that digital therapeutics are incapable of establishing a therapeutic bond with users  Future research might investigate the role of bonds as mediators of clinical outcomes, since boosting the engagement and efficacy of digital therapeutics could have major public health benefits","Darcy, Alison, Daniels, Jade, Salinger, David, Wicks, Paul, Robinson, Athena","https://doi.org/10.2196/27868","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: JMIR Formative Research; 5(5), 2021.; Publication details: JMIR Formative Research; 5(5), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14490,""
"Social Representations of e-Mental Health Among the Actors of the Health Care System: Free-Association Study","Background: Electronic mental (e-mental) health offers an opportunity to overcome many challenges such as cost, accessibility, and the stigma associated with mental health, and most people with lived experiences of mental problems are in favor of using applications and websites to manage their mental health problems  However, the use of these new technologies remains weak in the area of mental health and psychiatry  Objective: This study aimed to characterize the social representations associated with e-mental health by all actors to implement new technologies in the best possible way in the health system  Methods: A free-association task method was used  The data were subjected to a lexicometric analysis to qualify and quantify words by analyzing their statistical distribution, using the ALCESTE method with the IRaMuTeQ software  Results: In order of frequency, the terms most frequently used to describe e-mental health in the whole corpus are: â€œcareâ€ (n=21), â€œinternetâ€ (n=21), â€œcomputingâ€ (n=15), â€œhealthâ€ (n=14), â€œinformationâ€ (n=13), â€œpatientâ€ (n=12), and â€œtoolâ€ (n=12)  The corpus of text is divided into 2 themes, with technological and computing terms on one side and medical and public health terms on the other  The largest family is focused on â€œcare,â€ â€œadvances,â€ â€œresearch,â€ â€œlife,â€ â€œquality,â€ and â€œwell-being,â€ which was significantly associated with users  The nursing group used very medical terms such as â€œtreatment,â€ â€œdiagnosis,â€ â€œpsychiatryâ€,â€ and â€œpatientâ€ to define e-mental health  Conclusions: This study shows that there is a gap between the representations of users on e-mental health as a tool for improving their quality of life and those of health professionals (except nurses) that are more focused on the technological potential of these digital care tools  Developers, designers, clinicians, and users must be aware of the social representation of e-mental health conditions uses and intention of use  This understanding of everyoneâ€™s stakes will make it possible to redirect the development of tools to adapt them as much as possible to the needs and expectations of the actors of the mental health system","MorgiÃ¨ve, Margot, Mesdjian, Pierre, Las Vergnas, Olivier, Bury, Patrick, Demassiet, Vincent, Roelandt, Jean-Luc, Sebbane, DÃ©borah","https://doi.org/10.2196/25708","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: JMIR Mental Health; 8(5), 2021.; Publication details: JMIR Mental Health; 8(5), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14491,""
"Virtual Overdose Response for People Who Use Opioids Alone: Protocol for a Feasibility and Clinical Trial Study","Background: A recent quarterly report released by Alberta Health reports that on average 2 5 Albertans die every day from accidental overdose deaths, and that between April 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020, the province lost a total of 301 people  In Canada, between January 2016 and March 2020, a total of 16,364 people died due to opioid-related overdose  The World Health Organization reports that 70% of the 0 5 million deaths worldwide caused by drugs are related to opioid overdose  Although supervised consumption sites or safe injection sites have been shown to be effective in reducing the harms associated with the use of illicit substances and increasing uptake of addiction treatment and other health services, there is still significant stigma associated with them, and it is unlikely that all of the people who would benefit from supervised consumption service will ever access a site  Objective: To help prevent deaths in populations that cannot or will not access physical safer consumption services in Alberta, we propose to provide virtual (telephone-based) overdose response services, staffed by people with lived experience The primary outcome for this study is uptake of the service as measured by the number of calls to the service  Secondary outcomes will include patterns of use of the phone line (days of the week and time of calls) and outcomes from the calls (number of emergency medical services dispatches for overdoses from the service and the results of those dispatches)  Methods: This phase 1 clinical study is set to officially launch in early May 2020  The service will be available to up to 15 participants who self-disclose as using opioids unobserved and have given informed consent for both data collection and interviews  This group will have access to a toll-free telephone number and be invited to call when they plan to use opioids alone  Results: The analysis will include mixed methods  To improve the design of the service and ensure safety of all involved, quantitative data will be collected on phone calls and participant health care usage, while qualitative data will be collected from both participants and virtual overdose response operators Conclusions: This clinical trial aims to test the feasibility of a service that provides virtual overdose response in order to help prevent deaths in populations that cannot or will not access physical supervised consumption services in Alberta  Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials gov NCT04391192;https://www clinicaltrials gov/ct2/show/NCT04391192 International Registered Report Identifier (IRRID): DERR1-10 2196/20183","Bristowe, Sean Kristina, Ghosh, Sumantra Monty, Trew, Michael, Canadian Mental Health Association - Calgary, Region","https://doi.org/10.2196/20183","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: JMIR Research Protocols; 10(5), 2021.; Publication details: JMIR Research Protocols; 10(5), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14492,""
"Understanding of COVID-19 Vaccine Knowledge, Attitude, Acceptance, and Determinates of COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance Among Adult Population in Ethiopia","Introduction: Although many vaccines are in development and clinical trials, and at least seven vaccines have been distributed worldwide, the world has faced a huge challenge in line with the willingness to accept a COVID-19 vaccine in a different country including Ethiopia  However, no study has been conducted on the knowledge, attitudes, acceptance, and determinates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in Ethiopia  Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate the knowledge, attitudes, acceptance, and determinants of acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine among the adult population in Ethiopia  Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 492 study participants from March 1 to March 15, 2021  A multistage sampling technique was used to recruit study participants  Six skilled and qualified data collectors had participated to gather the data using a pretested structured-administered questionnaire  A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine  P-value &lt; 0 05 was considered to indicate statistically significant association  Results: This study revealed that the level of good knowledge, positive attitude and intention to accept the COVID-19 vaccine were 74%, 44 7%, and 62 6%, respectively  Moreover, having an age = 46 years with an adjusted odds ratio of 2 36 [95% CI, 1 09â€“ 5 39], attended secondary and above education adjusted odds ratio 2 59 [95% CI, 1 52â€“ 4 39], having a chronic disease adjusted odds ratio of 3 14 [95% CI, 1 21â€“ 8 14], and having good knowledge about COVID-19 vaccine adjusted odds ratio 2 59 [95% CI, 1 67â€“ 4 02] were significantly associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance  Conclusion: In this study, the level of good knowledge, positive attitude, and intention to accept the COVID-19 vaccine were 74%, 44 7%, and 62 6%, respectively  Thus, health education and communication from government sources are very crucial methods to alleviate the negative attitude of the COVID-19 vaccine","Abebe, Haimanot, Solomon, Shitu, Ayenew, Mose","https://doi.org/10.2147/IDR.S312116","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Infection and Drug Resistance; 14:2015-2025, 2021.; Publication details: Infection and Drug Resistance; 14:2015-2025, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14493,""

"Emergency visits for nonfatal opioid overdose during the COVID-19 pandemic across six United States health care systems","Background and Objectives: People with opioid use disorder (OUD) are uniquely vulnerable to disruptions in healthcare and social supports resulting from the novel coronavirus 19 (COVID-19)  While individual communities have reported increased rates of opioid overdose, the extent and subsequent changes in Emergency Department (ED) utilization following a nonfatal opioid overdose during COVID-19 remain unknown  Understanding changes in ED utilization after a nonfatal opioid overdose is critical to help allocate treatment resources during COVID-19, as an index nonfatal opioid overdose is the strongest predictor of a future fatal overdose  Our objective was to determine changes in ED visits for nonfatal opioid overdose during COVID-19 compared to historical controls across the United States (US)  Methods: Opioid overdoses were retrospectively identified among adult visits to 25 EDs in 6 US-based healthcare systems from January to September of 2018-2020  An ED visit for an opioid overdose was defined by the presence of an International Classification of Disease code for opioid poisoning/overdose (T40 0*, T40 1*, T40 2*, T40 3*, T40 4*, T40 6*)  Overdose visit counts and rates per 100 all-cause ED visits during COVID-19 were compared to levels predicted based on 2018-2019 visits using both graphical analysis and an epidemiological outbreak detection CUSUM algorithm  Results: Overdose visit counts increased by 11 3% (95% CI: 3 52%-19 1%;p = 0 004) in 2020 (N = 2639 visits) compared to 2018-2019 (N = 2302 and 2439, respectively) despite a 14% decline in all-cause Emergency Department visits  Opioid overdose rates increased 30 1% (95% CI: 24%-36 42%;p &lt; 0 001) from 0 25 per 100 Emergency Department visits in 2018-2019 to 0 33 per 100 Emergency Department visits in 2020  While all 6 health systems had increased overdose Emergency Department visit rates in 5 or more of the first 39 weeks of 2020, two health systems experienced sustained outbreaks during the COVID-19 pandemic  Conclusion: Despite decreases in overall ED visits, the number and rates of opioid overdose-related ED visits in 6 healthcare systems increased during the first 9 months of 2020, suggesting a widespread worsening in opioid-related complications during COVID-19  Expanded community and hospital-based interventions are needed to support people with OUD and save lives during COVID-19","Soares, W.

"The effectiveness of psychological interventions alone, or in combination with phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, for the treatment of erectile dysfunction:A systematic review","Objectives: To highlight the efficacy of various psychological interventions (PI) when used in combination with, or in place of, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE-5i), as compared to the traditional treatment of men with erectile dysfunction (ED) with PDE-5i alone  Methods: A comprehensive literature review for the years 2005â€“2020 via MEDLINE and PubMed  We included randomised controlled trials that compared the use of either PDE-5i alone, PI alone or a combination of PDE-5i and PI in the treatment of psychogenic ED  All studies included were performed in adults aged 19â€“55Â years and were written in English  Results: A total of 13 articles, with an overall sample of 597 men, were included in this systematic review  The results show that the combination of PI and PDE-5i was more effective than either PI or PDE-5i alone, on erectile function and long-term sexual satisfaction in men with psychogenic ED  Combined interventions were found to be significantly superior to medical treatment in seven studies and to PI alone in one study  In comparing PI to PDE-5i, two studies found PI to be significantly superior to PDE-5i use  In three other studies, PI was found significantly superior to no treatment at all, although some participants in the control group had taken PDE-5i  Conclusions: The combination of PDE-5i with PI shows real promise for the treatment of psychogenic ED  However, no conclusions could be made about what PI is more promising than the other and larger studies are needed to confirm these initial findings  Abbreviations: CBT: cognitive behavioural therapy;CBST: cognitive behavioural sex therapy;COVID-19: coronavirus disease 2019;ED: erectile dysfunction;EDITS: Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction;GPT, group psychotherapy: IIEF(-EF) (-OS) (-SD): International Index of Erectile Function (erectile functioning) (overall sexual satisfaction) (level of sexual desire);ITP: integrative treatment protocol;MHI: Mental Health Inventory;PDE-5i: phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors;PI, psychological interventions;QoL: quality of life;RCT: randomised controlled trial;SHIM: Sexual Health Inventory for Men","Atallah, S.; Haydar, A.; Jabbour, T.; Kfoury, P.; Sader, G.","https://doi.org/10.1080/2090598X.2021.1926763","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Arab Journal of Urology;2021.; Publication details: Arab Journal of Urology;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14518,""

"Remote supervision and training in suicide prevention during the time of the coronavirus pandemic: Recommendations for training programs and supervisors","The Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19) has led to a widespread surge in need for mental health services  At the same time, trainees in health service psychology rapidly transitioned to remote work to protect the safety of themselves, colleagues, and patients from the pandemic  This abrupt switch has led to pioneering advancements in the use of remote technologies which can improve access for patients and trainees alike  However, the existing guidelines for telehealth lack specific recommendations for training programs and supervision  Further, the literature is especially lacking in information on training in suicide risk assessment and management for when both supervision and treatment are conducted virtually  Trainees commonly experience relatively high anxiety when working with high-risk patients, and close supervision and support are paramount  This review provides information on available technologies that can aid suicide prevention, highlights gaps in existing guidelines and literature for telehealth as these may apply to trainees' work with high-risk patients, and delineates recommendations for training programs and supervisors to optimally support trainees' learning with regard to suicide prevention, and to ensure that trainees provide their patients with optimal treatment  (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement Public Significance Statement -This review highlights key challenges for trainees working with patients at high risk for suicide while working remotely during the Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19)  Presently, there is a dearth of specific guidance to aid training programs during this time  The authors of this paper, representing trainees at multiple stages, conducted an extensive review of the current status of telehealth services specific to training and suicide prevention, and in this manuscript delineate specific recommendations for training programs and supervisors that can have immediate applicability to the psychology field  (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","Hausman, Catherine, Vescera, Kristen, Bacigalupi, Rachel, Giangrasso, Valerie, Bongar, Bruce","https://doi.org/10.1037/tep0000379","","Database: APA PsycInfo; Publication details: Training and Education in Professional Psychology;: No Pagination Specified, 2021.; Publication details: Training and Education in Professional Psychology;: No Pagination Specified, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14520,""

"A satellite-based investigation into the algae bloom variability in large water supply urban reservoirs during COVID-19 lockdown","Here we report the first case study of the significant algae blooming in large reservoirs in relation to the COVID-19 lockdown in Sao Paulo, Brazil  Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and phycocyanin (PC) concentrations were estimated for the Guarapiranga and Billings reservoirs, which supply daily water use for over 20 million people and receives treated wastewater  We employed field-calibrated Sentinel 2 MSI and Landsat 8 OLI images to map the spatial patterns of Chl-a and PC over the two periods: before the lockdown (April, August and October 2019) and after the lockdown in SÃ£o Paulo (April 2020)  We found a significant increase in algae pigments (Chl-a and PC) in both reservoirs in April 2020, compared to the same month of 2019  We show that the episodic algae blooming is strongly related to the increased inflows of the residential wastewater from the surrounding watersheds, because the household water use has increased ~3 2% in April 2020, while the runoff into the reservoirs driven by the rainfall was much lower in 2020 compared to the previous year for the same month  In the case of Guarapiranga Reservoir, PC increased nearly 500% in April 2020 compared to April 2019  Given the importance of Billings and Guarapiranga reservoirs for the water supply of the Metropolitan Region of Sao Paulo (MRSP), the abrupt occurrence of cyanobacteria blooms related to the stateâ€™s lockdown should be considered a major concern for public and environmental health of the region  Although several environmental consequences have been reported due to the COVID-19 worldwide, this study is the first to report the impact of COVID-19 on the trophic state in the tropical reservoirs","Alcantara, Enner, Coimbra, Keyla, Ogashawara, Igor, Rodrigues, Thanan, Mantovani, JosÃ©, Rotta, Luiz Henrique, Park, Edward, Fernandes Cunha, Davi Gasparini","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rsase.2021.100555","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Remote Sensing Applications: Society and Environment;: 100555, 2021.; Publication details: Remote Sensing Applications: Society and Environment;: 100555, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14523,""
"Psychosocial impact on health-related and non-health related university students during the COVID-19 pandemic Results of an electronic survey","ABSTRACT Introduction: The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused feelings of anxiety, confusion, and panic among the world population  Due to these psychological changes resulting from the stress produced by the disease, we sought to investigate the psychological impact of the pandemic on the university student community  Material and methods: 1,283 students were surveyed, of which 1,149 students were selected  The majority of the subjects were female, and the overall average age was of 20 years  They were provided with an 82-question online questionnaire divided into four sections;looking for the prevalence of significant symptomatology of major depression and generalised anxiety using the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scales;and factors that potentially affect the mental health of our university population  Results: We found a high prevalence of significant depression (47 08%) and anxiety (27 06%) symptomatology, considering a score of 10 or more as cut-off point  There was no significant difference in depression and anxiety symptomatology between the health-care students and non-health-care students  Conclusions: Our results, together with what is observed in the literature, allow us to conclude that the college student population has a high risk of mental illness, and these should be taken into consideration for the search of effective strategies for detection and control of mental health illnesses  Undoubtedly, the COVID-19 pandemic is a red flag that shows the need to upgrade mental health programmes in universities and to validate virtual instruments  RESUMEN IntroducciÃ³n y objetivos: La actual pandemia de SARS-CoV-2 ha causado sentimientos de ansiedad, confusiÃ³n y pÃ¡nico entre la poblaciÃ³n mundial  Debido a estos cambios psicolÃ³gicos derivados del estrÃ©s que produce la enfermedad, se buscÃ³ investigar el impacto psicolÃ³gico de la pandemia en la comunidad estudiantil universitaria  Material y mÃ©todos: Se encuestÃ³ a 1 283 estudiantes, de los que se seleccionÃ³ a 1 149  La mayorÃ­a eran mujeres y la media de edad fue 20 aÃ±os  Se les proporcionÃ³ un cuestionario en lÃ­nea de 82 preguntas divididas en 4 secciones para indagar la prevalencia de sÃ­ntomas significativos de depresiÃ³n mayor y ansiedad generalizada utilizando las escalas PHQ-9 y GAD-7, ademÃ¡s factores que pueden afectar a la salud mental de nuestra poblaciÃ³n universitaria  Resultados: Se hallÃ³ una alta prevalencia de sÃ­ntomas significativos de depresiÃ³n (47,08%) y ansiedad (27,06%), considerando como umbral un total de 10 o mÃ¡s puntos  No hubo diferencias significativas entre los estudiantes relacionados con la salud y los no relacionados con la salud  Conclusiones: Nuestros resultados, en conjunto con lo observado en la literatura, muestran que la comunidad universitaria es una poblaciÃ³n en riesgo de enfermedades mentales, por lo que el Gobierno deberÃ­a considerar la creaciÃ³n de estrategias efectivas para la detecciÃ³n de problemas de salud mental;sin duda alguna, la actual pandemia de COVID-19 es un foco rojo sobre las necesidad de mejores programas de salud mental en universidades y validaciÃ³n de instrumentos virtuales","GarcÃ­a-Espinosa, Patricio, Ortiz-JimÃ©nez, XÃ³chitl, Botello-HernÃ¡ndez, Edgar, Aguayo-Samaniego, Rebeca, Leija-Herrera, Jorge, GÃ³ngora-Rivera, Fernando","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcp.2021.04.008","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Revista Colombiana de PsiquiatrÃ­a;2021.; Publication details: Revista Colombiana de PsiquiatrÃ­a;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14524,""
"Intervenciones para la salud mental de estudiantes universitarios durante la pandemia por COVID-19: una sÃ­ntesis crÃ­tica de la literatura","RESUMEN IntroducciÃ³n: Los estudiantes de educaciÃ³n superior son una poblaciÃ³n vulnerable a los trastornos mentales, mÃ¡s aÃºn durante la pandemia por COVID-19  Su salud mental se ha visto afectada por el confinamiento, las dificultades en el desarrollo de las actividades acadÃ©micas y las exigencias de las nuevas modalidades pedagÃ³gicas  Se planteÃ³ entonces la pregunta: en las instituciones de educaciÃ³n superior, Â¿cuÃ¡les acciones en torno a a) promociÃ³n y prevenciÃ³n, b) atenciÃ³n a sÃ­ntomas mentales y c) adaptaciones pedagÃ³gicas pueden desarrollarse con el fin de mejorar la salud mental de sus estudiantes? MÃ©todos: SÃ­ntesis crÃ­tica a partir de la revisiÃ³n sistemÃ¡tica de la literatura  Se realizÃ³ la bÃºsqueda de artÃ­culos cientÃ­ficos de alcance descriptivo, analÃ­tico, experimental o evaluativo, asÃ­ como recursos web de organizaciones relacionadas con el tema  Se realizÃ³ una sÃ­ntesis en funciÃ³n de los 3 focos de la pregunta mediante comparaciÃ³n constante, hasta realizar la agrupaciÃ³n de acciones por similitud en los actores que las ejecutarÃ­an y recibirÃ­an  Se anticipÃ³ una baja calidad de la evidencia, por lo que no se realizÃ³ evaluaciÃ³n estandarizada  Resultados: Se exploraron 68 artÃ­culos y 99 recursos web  DespuÃ©s de la revisiÃ³n del texto completo se incluyeron 12 artÃ­culos cientÃ­ficos y 11 recursos web  Como lineamentos generales, se encontrÃ³ que la propuesta mÃ¡s frecuente es el diseÃ±o de un programa estructurado especÃ­fico para el tema de salud mental en las instituciones educativas, que sea multidisciplinario, incluyente, dinÃ¡mico y sensible a la cultura  Las acciones deben ser divulgadas periÃ³dicamente para que los estudiantes y demÃ¡s miembros de la comunidad educativa las tengan claras, e idealmente se propone mantenerlas hasta el periodo pospandÃ©mico e incluir a los egresados  Para a) la promociÃ³n y prevenciÃ³n, se encontrÃ³ la psicoeducaciÃ³n por vÃ­a electrÃ³nica, donde se expliquen estilos de vida saludable, reacciones emocionales en pandemia, estrategias de afrontamiento y signos de alarma  Se propone la participaciÃ³n de los pares como estrategia de apoyo y espacios de interacciÃ³n social que no se enfoquen Ãºnicamente en aspectos acadÃ©micos  Se reporta la necesidad de cribar sÃ­ntomas mentales por medio de envÃ­o frecuente de formularios en lÃ­nea o aplicaciones mÃ³viles, donde tambiÃ©n se indague por la satisfacciÃ³n de las necesidades bÃ¡sicas y tecnolÃ³gicas  En cuanto a b) atenciÃ³n de sÃ­ntomas mentales, una de las acciones que se encontrÃ³ con mayor frecuencia es disponer de un centro de consultorÃ­a que sea capaz de realizar atenciÃ³n en salud mental por vÃ­a telefÃ³nica, por tecnologÃ­as e incluso presencial, con atenciÃ³n permanente las 24 h o equipos de respuesta rÃ¡pida ante una situaciÃ³n de crisis, como la conducta suicida y la violencia domÃ©stica  Para c) las adaptaciones pedagÃ³gicas, se seÃ±ala como requisito indispensable la comunicaciÃ³n fluida para tener instrucciones claras sobre el desarrollo de las actividades acadÃ©micas para disminuir la incertidumbre y, por ende, la ansiedad y favorecer la gestiÃ³n del tiempo por el estudiante  Los profesores y pedagogos de la instituciÃ³n pueden ofrecer asesorÃ­as directas (por videollamadas o reuniones de grupos en lÃ­nea) para proveer apoyo en hÃ¡bitos de estudios, materias propias de cada carrera y salud mental  Conclusiones: Los recursos incluidos proponen que la instituciÃ³n educativa cree un programa que aborde especÃ­ficamente la salud mental de los estudiantes  Esta sÃ­ntesis puede proveer lineamientos que faciliten la toma de decisiones, sin perder de vista que la instituciÃ³n y el estudiante estÃ¡n inmersos en un contexto complejo, con circunstancias y otros actores en varios niveles que tambiÃ©n intervienen en la salud mental  Se requieren investigaciones sobre la evoluciÃ³n de la situaciÃ³n de salud mental y el efecto de las acciones que se vayan tomando  ABSTRACT Background:

"Interleukin-6 as potential mediator of long-term neuropsychiatric symptoms of COVID-19","The majority of COVID-19 survivors experience long-term neuropsychiatric symptoms such as fatigue, sleeping difficulties, depression and anxiety  We propose that neuroimmune cross-talk via inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) could underpin these long-term COVID-19 symptoms  This hypothesis is supported by several lines of research, including population-based cohort and genetic Mendelian Randomisation studies suggesting that inflammation is associated with fatigue and sleeping difficulties, and that IL-6 could represent a possible causal driver for these symptoms  Immune activation following COVID-19 can disrupt T helper 17 (TH17) and regulatory T (Treg) cell responses, affect central learning and emotional processes, and lead to a vicious cycle of inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction that amplifies the inflammatory process and results in immuno-metabolic constraints on neuronal energy metabolism, with fatigue being the ultimate result  Increased cytokine activity drives this process and could be targeted to interrupt it  Therefore, whether persistent IL-6 dysregulation contributes to COVID-19-related long-term fatigue, sleeping difficulties, depression, and anxiety, and whether targeting IL-6 pathways could be helpful for treatment and prevention of long COVID are important questions that require investigation  This line of research could inform new approaches for treatment and prevention of long-term neuropsychiatric symptoms of COVID-19  Effective treatment and prevention of this condition could also help to stem the anticipated rise in depression and other mental illnesses ensuing this pandemic","Kappelmann, Nils, Dantzer, Robert, Khandaker, Golam M.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2021.105295","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Psychoneuroendocrinology;: 105295, 2021.; Publication details: Psychoneuroendocrinology;: 105295, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14529,""

"Does serotonin deficiency lead to anosmia, ageusia, dysfunctional chemesthesis and increaed severity of illness in COVID-19?","Different mechanisms forwarded to understand anosmia and ageusia in coronavirus patients are not adequate to explain reversible anosmia and ageusia, which are resolved quickly  In addition, the reason behind the impaired chemesthetic sensations in some coronavirus patients remains unknown  In the present paper it is proposed that SARS-CoV-2 patients suffer from depletion of tryptophan, as ACE2, a key element in the process of absorption of tryptophan from the food, is significantly reduced in the patients as coronavirus uses ACE2 as the receptor to enter the host cells  The tryptophan depletion leads to a deficit of serotonin (5-HT) in SARS-COV-2 patients because tryptophan is the precursor in the synthesis of 5-HT  Such 5-HT deficiency can explain anosmia, ageusia and dysfunctional chemesthesis in COVID-19, given the fact that 5-HT is an important neuromodulator in the olfactory neurons, taste receptor cells and transient receptor potential channels (TRP channels) involved in chemesthesis  In addition, 5-HT deficiency worsens silent hypoxemia and depresses hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction leading to increased severity of the disease  Also, the levels of anti-inflammatory melatonin (synthesized from 5-HT) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+, produced from niacin whose precursor is the tryptophan) might decrease in coronavirus patients resulting in the aggravation of the disease  Interestingly, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may not be of much help in correcting the 5-HT deficiency in COVID-19 patients, as their efficacy goes down significantly when there is depletion of tryptophan in the system  Hence, tryptophan supplementation may herald a radical change in the treatment of COVID-19 and accordingly, clinical trials (therapeutic / prophylactic) should be conducted on coronavirus patients to find out how tryptophan supplementation (oral or parenteral, the latter in severe cases where there is hardly any absorption of tryptophan from the food) helps in curing, relieving or preventing the olfactory, gustatory and chemesthetic dysfunctions and in lessening the severity of the disease","Sen, Amarnath","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2021.110627","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Medical Hypotheses;: 110627, 2021.; Publication details: Medical Hypotheses;: 110627, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14538,""

"Bushmeat, wet markets, and the risks of pandemics: Exploring the nexus through systematic review of scientific disclosures","The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is the third coronavirus this century to threaten human health, killing more than two million people globally  Like previous coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is suspected to have wildlife origins and was possibly transmitted to humans via wet markets selling bushmeat (aka harvested wild meat)  Thus, an interdisciplinary framework is vital to address the nexus between bushmeat, wet markets, and disease  We reviewed the contemporary scientific literature to: (1) assess disease surveillance efforts within the bushmeat trade and wet markets globally by compiling zoonotic health risks based on primarily serological examinations;and (2) gauge perceptions of health risks associated with bushmeat and wet markets  Of the 58 species of bushmeat investigated across 15 countries in the 52 articles that we analyzed,one or more pathogens (totaling 60 genera of pathogens) were reported in 48 species, while no zoonotic pathogens were reported in 10 species based on serology  Burden of disease data was nearly absent from the articles resulting from our Scopus search, and therefore was not included in our analyses  We also found that perceived health risks associated with bushmeat was low, though we could not perform statistical analyses due to the lack of quantitative perception-based studies  After screening the literature, our results showed that the global distribution of reported bushmeat studies were biased towards Africa, revealing data deficiencies across Asia and South America despite the prevalence of the bushmeat trade across the Global South  Studies targeting implications of the bushmeat trade on human health can help address these data deficiencies across Asia and South America  We further illustrate the need to address the nexus between bushmeat, wet markets, and disease to help prevent future outbreaks of zoonotic diseases under the previously proposed â€œOne Health Frameworkâ€, which integrates human, animal, and environmental health  By tackling these three pillars, we discuss the current policy gaps and recommend suitable measures to prevent future disease outbreaks","Peros, Colin Scott, Dasgupta, Rajarshi, Kumar, Pankaj, Johnson, Brian Alan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2021.05.025","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Environmental Science & Policy; 124:1-11, 2021.; Publication details: Environmental Science & Policy; 124:1-11, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14553,""

"Food insecurity and lower viral suppression in burmese migrants living with hiv","Background: With Thailand regarded as food secure for nearly a decade, at-risk groups including migrant workers still face food insecurity and have higher risk of acquiring HIV infection  People living with HIV and facing food insecurity have been documented to have higher risk of poor health and HIV treatment outcomes, notably altered risk behaviours and decreased adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART)  However, research on direct links between food insecurity and treatment outcomes such as viral suppression is scarce  The aim of this study was to investigate how food insecurity are associated with income, viral suppression, ART treatment and ART adherence in Burmese migrant workers living with HIV in Chiang Mai province of northern Thailand  Methods: Data collected through face-to-face survey was combined with routine laboratory tests in a cohort of 316 migrants (113/203 M/F) living with HIV  11 treatment centers for HIV in rural and urban Chiang Mai gathered data on ART use and adherence, physical and mental health, sexual behaviour, socio-demographics and food security (Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS-III))  Using a step-down multivariate logistic regression, we calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusting for confounders, including ART regimen  Results: In this cross-sectional study, 48 7% (n=162) of migrant workers living with HIV reported food insecurity, and 14 2% (n=45) fulfilled criteria for severe food insecurity  Most respondents were ART-adherent 96 8% (n=305), and virally suppressed 93 5% (n=290), with 4 1% (n=13) expressing symptoms of clinical depression  In adjusted analysis, food insecurity was associated with lack of viral suppression [OR=4 13, CI=1 22-14 00] and perceived poverty/lack of income [OR=5 96, CI=2 58-13 76]  Conclusion: Burmese migrant workers living with HIV in Chiang Mai report high adherence to ART and are mostly virally suppressed  Food insecurity is here linked to viremia and poverty or lack of income, suggesting that a subset of migrants face multiple burdens that increase their likelihood of becoming viremic  With food insecurity and poverty rising as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic this may end up negatively impacting HIV treatment outcomes","SjÃ¶land, C.

"Reversibility of sleep disturbances after switching from DTG/3TC/ABC TO DRV/C/FTC/TAF","Background: Evidence supports switching DTG/3TC/ABC in patients complaining about insomnia  However, there is unknown if the benefit observed could also apply to non-complaining patients displaying sleep disturbances in self-reported questionnaires used as screening tools, such as the Pittsburg sleep quality index (PSQI)  Methods: We designed the DETOX study, as an open label, randomized (1:1), multicenter, pilot clinical trial, to evaluate the reversibility of sleep disturbances detected with the PSQI in well-suppressed patients on DTG/3TC/ABC (&gt;12 weeks) not complaining of insomnia  Participants with a PSQI &gt;5 were randomized either to switch to DRV/c/FTC/TAF for 8 weeks (arm 1) or either to continue 4 weeks on DTG/3TC/ABC and then switch to DRV/c/FTC/TAF for 8 weeks (arm 2)  Every 4 weeks, participants self-reported using the PSQI, the Hospital Anxiety & Depression Scale (HADS) and a questionnaire exploring about 11 neuropsychiatric adverse events (AE)  Raw scores on PSQI and HADS, along with an average score from adding the grade of each neuropsychiatric AE, were normalized (0-100)  Then we compared changes at week 4 (between study arms) and after participants completed 4 and 8 weeks on DRV/c/FTC/TAF  Additional analyses included virological outcomes  Results: The study included 72 participants (arm 1: n=37;arm 2: n=35)  Both arms had similar baseline characteristics  Three discontinued prematurely before week 4 (arm 1: none;arm 2: 1 COVID-19, 1 loss of follow up (LFU) and 1 consent withdrawal)  At week 4, we observed significant improvements (arm 1 vs  arm 2) in PSQI (mean changeÂ±SD: 11 5Â±10 2 vs  0 6Â±8 9;p&lt;0 001), HADs anxiety scale (14Â±16 9 vs  1 9Â±15 6;p=0 003) and AE (13 7Â±13 3 vs  1 3Â±8 6;p&lt;0 001) scores  Sixty-nine participants switched to DRV/c/FTC/TAF: 37 at baseline (arm 1) and 32 at week 4 (arm 2)  All except 3 who discontinued prematurely (2 LFU and 1 due to AE nausea) completed 8 weeks of follow up  Pooled analysis showed significant improvements in most neuropsychiatric scores and symptoms (table), with no virologic failures reported  After switching to DRV/c/FTC/TAF, 26 participants (37 7%) reported any AE (all grade 1-2)  Most common AE were headache (7 2%) and dyslipidemia (7 2%)  Conclusion: Sleep disturbances detected through self-reported screening tools seem to be associated with patients on DTG/3TC/ABC not complaining of insomnia  These disturbances, among other neuropsychiatric symptoms such as anxiety or depression, could improve after switching to DRV/c/FTC/TAF","Perez-Valero, I.; De La Fuente, S.; Mican, R.; Mena, M.

"The forgotten path: Adult stakeholder perceptions on the transition from residential treatment facility schools to neighborhood schools","Youth with emotional/behavioral disorders (E/BD) may be negatively impacted by their behavioral excesses and deficits across domains requiring more intensive supports and treatment than can be provided in a typical school  As a result, some of these youth will receive their supports and treatment from placement in a residential treatment facility (RTF) that provides around-the-clock services  Once a youth completes their treatment at the facility, they will integrate back into the community, including for some, enrollment in a neighborhood school  This transition from the RTF to the neighborhood school can be difficult due to the change in supports (e g , small group to large group instruction, fewer treatment options related to mental health)  Such a transition is an emerging pathway that was the focus of this qualitative inquiry  A focus group, interviews, and record reviews were conducted at an RTF serving students with E/BD in a Southeastern state  These RTF stakeholders shared their perspectives on the transition process from their facility to neighborhood schools  Using an intrinsic, instrumental, descriptive case study design, data were analyzed through the lens of sociocultural theory, a priori coding, and inductive analyses  The constructed themes (i e , collaboration, communication, education, individualization, and involvement) align with the transition literature for best practices of different pathways  Limitations and future directions are provided within a lens of disruption as the novel coronavirus pandemic and facility access restrictions occurred during data collection limiting facility access to a single facility and limited time of contact with transition stakeholders  (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","Odom, Kimberly Paige","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+forgotten+path:+Adult+stakeholder+perceptions+on+the+transition+from+residential+treatment+facility+schools+to+neighborhood+schools","","Database: APA PsycInfo; Publication details: Dissertation Abstracts International Section A: Humanities and Social Sciences; 82(9-A):No Pagination Specified, 2021.; Publication details: Dissertation Abstracts International Section A: Humanities and Social Sciences; 82(9-A):No Pagination Specified, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14579,""

"Loneliness as a Downstream Concern in a Pandemic (and Post-Pandemic) World","While the implementation of physical distancing practices and renewed awareness of our ability to spread communicable diseases to one another were (and remain) important in mitigating the spread of infection, a downstream effect of the pandemic that is still not fully appreciated may be the long-term impact of these changes on mental health, specifically as a contributing factor to loneliness 1 Even as the world begins to emerge from the worst of the pandemic in terms of immediate danger to life and physical well-being, a full understanding of the overall impact of the last year on our mental health and wellness is just beginning  The negative effects of loneliness and social isolation are not limited to mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety, but also include physical maladies such as heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and even higher overall mortality 5-7 The risk of a person developing one or more of these illnesses because of loneliness is comparable to that incurred from other, more well-known factors such as smoking and obesity, and in many studies, loneliness has been shown to be independently associated with the outcome 8,9 Especially important for the pharmacy student population, young people (ages 18-30 years) and students are at greater risk of experiencing loneliness, both prior to and during the pandemic, with the incidence of loneliness higher in these groups than in other demographic populations 10 Cross-sectional studies of different age groups have shown that upwards of 60% of older adults have never reported feeling lonely, whereas the rates of severe loneliness among young adults range from 20%-48% 11 Researchers theorize that, because loneliness is the distress experienced when there is a discrepancy between the expected and perceived quantity and quality of an individual's social interactions, loneliness may not be as closely tied to social isolation in older adults who have more fully developed and mature brains as it is in adolescents and young adults 12 Former US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy's book, Together: The Healing Power ofConnection in a Sometimes Lonely World, published in April 2020, details his experience in learning about the wide-ranging effects of loneliness on mental as well as physical health and its pervasive and growing presence in society, even prior to the pandemic 13 As he traveled across the United States speaking to different groups about public health issues such as cancer, smoking, and opioid use disorder, Murthy was surprised at the numbers of people across demographic groups and geographic areas who discussed with him their struggles with loneliness and feeling alone  In addition to disenfranchised grief over the loss of normal life, there can be a natural tendency to compare our own plight to that of others and employ the idea that ""things could be worse,"" an act known as comparative suffering}1 As discussed by author Brene Brown on her podcast Unlocking Us in the early stages of the pandemic, comparative suffering was a natural coping mechanism employed by many individuals in a noble attempt to encourage gratefulness both internally and externally 18 However well-intentioned, the challenge with comparative suffering over the long term is that it devalues and underappreciates the impact of our own emotions and suffering and buries or pushes them away to be dealt with at another time  Whether intentional or not, the message sent and received is that our feelings are wrong, causing some to even experience shame for feeling them  Because clinical loneliness can stem from the subjective experience of our social connections being inadequate to our needs, it is understandable how the pandemic and its aftermath may have set us up to experience loneliness","Malcom, Daniel R.

"KEYS TO TREATING ANXIETY, IN TIMES OF COVID-19","One of the effects of COVID-19 is associated with the increase in psychological disorders resulting from the extreme measures that condition the fight to contain this pandemic  In particular, confinement, along with hygiene precautions and human distancing, also extends to psychological disorders such as anxiety  The analysis of this disorder and the ideas that must be assumed to control it in times of COVID 19 is the objective of this work  From the methodological point of view, a methodology based on theoretical systematization and reflections that, from the author's professional experience, help to confirm the need to prepare people so that they can face the problems and effects of anxiety caused by this pandemic  As conclusions, it is ensured that anxiety in times of pandemic can be considered natural and beneficial but it is planned to avoid the excesses that are assumed as a implication of prolonged periods of isolation, therefore it is prices to compromise all professionals and students of psychology and staff that include in their therapies the communication of key ideas that can reduce the effect of anxiety and achieve improvements in mental health in the face of COVID 19","Choez, X.

"RCT of an online mental health intervention among older plwh during COVID-19 pandemic","Background: Older adults (=50 y) living with HIV (OALWH) may experience elevated levels of depression, anxiety, and loneliness  Online mindfulness lessons have the potential to ameliorate these problems and enhance access, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic  The objective of this randomized controlled trial was to determine the effectiveness of online mindfulness lessons in reducing feelings of depression, anxiety, and loneliness among OALWH  Methods: The study was conducted between May and August 2020  Individuals with any degree of self-reported loneliness at baseline were eligible to participate  Outcomes of interest included depression, measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-10), anxiety measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), and loneliness measured using both the Three-item Loneliness Scale (3IL) and a Daily Diary that asked â€œHow lonely do you feel today?â€ Two sample t-tests were used to compare group scores at follow-up  Results: Of 214 participants who were randomized, the mean (SD) age was 60 4 (5 9) years, 89% were male, 69% were white, and 74% were gay or lesbian  At the end of the 25-day intervention, the intervention group demonstrated reduced levels of depression (2 6 point improvement;p&lt;0 01), and reduced levels of anxiety (1 5 point improvement;p=0 03) compared to the control group (Table 1)  Among the subset of participants with elevated baseline depression scores (defined as CES-D-10 = 8), the between-group improvement in depression scores was greater (4 2 point improvement;p&lt;0 01)  Similarly, among the subset of participants with elevated baseline anxiety scores (defined as GAD-7 = 5), the between-group improvement in anxiety scores was greater (2 4 point improvement;p&lt;0 01)  Loneliness improved significantly, as indicated by the Daily Diary, for those with at least moderate loneliness at baseline (0 7 point improvement;p&lt;0 01)  Conclusion: This randomized controlled trial is the first to show that a series of brief, online mindfulness audio lessons improves mental health outcomes among OALWH who report some degree of loneliness  For many patients, this intervention may offer emotional relief, particularly with regard to depression and anxiety, even in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic","Berko, J.; Mazonson, P.; Short, D.; Gutner, C.; Karris, M.; Huhn, G.; Ehui, L.

"Risk factors for hospitalization in people with HIV and COVID-19","Background: People living with HIV are thought to be at higher risk for poor outcomes (including higher hospitalization and mortality rates) from SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection  Whether risk is linked to HIV-related factors, demographics or comorbid burden is unclear  We examine risk factors and outcomes of those living with HIV who acquired COVID-19 and received care within two large healthcare systems in Denver, CO  Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted for all individuals with HIV diagnosed with COVID-19 at the two largest Colorado HIV care centers between 1 March and 31 October 2020  COVID-19 diagnosis required a positive PCR result;HIV diagnosis was extracted from the medical record  Risk factors forhospitalization and longer hospital length of stay (LOS) were examined and compared via univariate and multivariable analysis  Results: Among 94 patients, 81% were male, with a mean age of 46 (SD 13 5) years  The majority had HIV-1 RNA levels 500 cells/mm3 (55%)  Most (75%) had =1 comorbidity;64% were overweight or obese  39% of patients were admitted to the hospital (17% to intensive care)  Increased odds of hospitalization were associated with increased age, lower CD4 count, and increased number of comorbidities (including diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, chronic pulmonary disease, cardiac disease, mental health concerns, and obesity) (Table)  In multivariable analyses, only lower CD4 count (OR 1 28) and comorbidity count (OR 1 62) remained significant  Among hospitalized patients, longer LOS was univariately associated with age (52% longer LOS per 10 year age increase [95% CI 16,101%], p=0 004) but not CD4 count (-8%, [95% CI-18, 5%] % change in LOS per 100 cell/mm3 increase, p=0 21), HIV-1 viral load =200 copies/mL (-33% [95% CI-77, 90%], p=0 44), or comorbidity count (10% [95% CI-17, 43%] change in LOS per additional comorbidity, p=0 49)  Sensitivity analyses excluding 9 patients hospitalized for non-COVID reasons provided similar findings  Conclusion: Lower CD4 count was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization among patients with concurrent HIV and COVID-19, suggesting that successful HIV treatment remains a key component to decreasing HIV-related morbidity  (Figure Presented)","Barbera, L.

"""Missing in Action"" in Psychiatric Nursing History: The Role of Chief Nurse Adele S Poston and Her Band of Nurses During World War I","This is the first nursing journal article to introduce the pioneering work of American psychiatric nurse leader, Adele S. Poston. Poston supervised a team of nurses as they cared for soldiers serving with the American Expeditionary Forces during World War I in France. Poston and her nurses worked in the first American specialized neuropsychiatric hospital in a war. The soldiers they treated primarily had functional nervous disorders described at that time as ""shell shock"" or ""war neuroses."" The traumatized officers and enlisted men were considered capable of being cured and returned to active duty based on research done by American psychiatrists among British troops during the first 3 years of the war. The story of Poston's career prior, during, and after the war and her work with other nurses during a global war are significant in psychiatric nursing history. Bringing this hitherto missing piece of psychiatric and nursing history into the light gives us a unique opportunity to recognize Poston and the nurses who served with her, even as today we recognize the nurses who serve during the global COVID-19 pandemic.

"Initial Training for Mental Health Peer Support Workers: Systematized Review and International Delphi Consultation","BACKGROUND: Initial training is essential for the mental health peer support worker (PSW) role. Training needs to incorporate recent advances in digital peer support and the increase of peer support work roles internationally. There is a lack of evidence on training topics that are important for initial peer support work training and on which training topics can be provided on the internet. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to establish consensus levels about the content of initial training for mental health PSWs and the extent to which each identified topic can be delivered over the internet. METHODS: A systematized review was conducted to identify a preliminary list of training topics from existing training manuals. Three rounds of Delphi consultation were then conducted to establish the importance and web-based deliverability of each topic. In round 1, participants were asked to rate the training topics for importance, and the topic list was refined. In rounds 2 and 3, participants were asked to rate each topic for importance and the extent to which they could be delivered over the internet. RESULTS: The systematized review identified 32 training manuals from 14 countries: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Scotland, Sweden, Uganda, the United Kingdom, and the United States. These were synthesized to develop a preliminary list of 18 topics. The Delphi consultation involved 110 participants (49 PSWs, 36 managers, and 25 researchers) from 21 countries (14 high-income, 5 middle-income, and 2 low-income countries). After the Delphi consultation (round 1: n=110; round 2: n=89; and round 3: n=82), 20 training topics (18 universal and 2 context-specific) were identified. There was a strong consensus about the importance of five topics: lived experience as an asset, ethics, PSW well-being, and PSW role focus on recovery and communication, with a moderate consensus for all other topics apart from the knowledge of mental health. There was no clear pattern of differences among PSW, manager, and researcher ratings of importance or between responses from participants in countries with different resource levels. All training topics were identified with a strong consensus as being deliverable through blended web-based and face-to-face training (rating 1) or fully deliverable on the internet with moderation (rating 2), with none identified as only deliverable through face-to-face teaching (rating 0) or deliverable fully on the web as a stand-alone course without moderation (rating 3). CONCLUSIONS: The 20 training topics identified can be recommended for inclusion in the curriculum of initial training programs for PSWs.

"Community Readiness to Align and Better Support Families with Perinatal Substance Use Issues and the Impacts of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Progress","Problem: Drug overdose is the leading cause of maternal death in Texas  More than 60% of children in custody of Texas Child Protective Services (CPS) have substance use listed as a contributing factor in their CPS case, compared to the national rate of 34%  Pregnant and postpartum women and infants are a special population impacted by substance use and require a coordinated response from multiple sectors to ensure optimal outcomes for both the mother and her infant  Purpose: In 2018, needs and readiness assessments were conducted in Houston, Texas, focused on improving care and service coordination for pregnant women with substance use disorder (SUD)  The purpose of this paper is to briefly describe the results of the assessments and discuss how the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted implementation of the recommendations  Methods: In late 2018, 59 stakeholders from 5 different sectors were interviewed to assess the current system of care and identify recommendations they felt would improve outcomes for pregnant women with SUD  These interviews were followed by 5 collaborative meetings with stakeholders to finalize the recommendations, and a readiness assessment (n=25) to determine the feasibility of implementing the recommendations  The goals of this survey were to determine which of these recommendations were most important, had organizational support for implementation, and would result in improvements within a year of being implemented  Interviews were conducted again in 2020 (n=9) to describe the progress that had been made on the recommendations and assess the impact the Covid-19 pandemic has had on implementing programs and initiatives that support peripartum women with SUDs  Results/Discussion: The stakeholder interviews revealed substantial cross-sector misunderstanding about each sectorâ€™s roles and responsibilities  Further, several barriers to coordination were identified  Interviews and collaborative meetings led to the development of 25 recommendations that would improve cross-sector collaboration  There were 25 completed responses to the readiness survey focused on implementing these recommendations  Of the recommendations, 9 had above-average ratings on importance and had ratings indicating substantial short-term impact for pregnant women  Six additional recommendations had above-average ratings on importance, but it was determined that their benefits take longer to be seen  Progress made towards 8 of the recommendations and how the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted this progress are described  Implications: The Covid-19 pandemic has created both opportunities and barriers to progress in the treatment and care of pregnant women with SUD  This analysis identifies resulting changes that must be considered for future planning and intervention implementation","Van Horne, Bethanie S.; Mandell, Dorothy, Keefe, Rachael J.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Community+Readiness+to+Align+and+Better+Support+Families+with+Perinatal+Substance+Use+Issues+and+the+Impacts+of+the+Covid-19+Pandemic+on+Progress","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of Applied Research on Children; 11(2), 2020.; Publication details: Journal of Applied Research on Children; 11(2), 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14606,""
"Social stigma towards nurses taking care of patients with COVID-19 in Indonesia: A mixed-methods study","Background: The condition of the Indonesians' unpreparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic has caused anxiety and fear  The public's fears of COVID-19 cases have led to a negative stigma  As part of health workers in disaster management's main pillars in health services, nurses are most vulnerable to infection and not free from the stigma  Objective: This study aimed to describe the social stigma against nurses taking care of patients with COVID-19 and experiencing suspected or probable or confirmed COVID-19 cases in Indonesia  Methods: This study was a mixed-method study using a sequential explanatory design-participant selection model  The selection of respondents used the convenience sampling technique  The number of respondents in the quantitative stage was 118 respondents  For qualitative data, selected participants were respondents with a stigma score of more than 21 nurses and willing to continue the interview process  There were 11 participants in the qualitative stage  This study used the modified Stigma Scale of the Explanatory Model Interview Catalog for quantitative data and four semi-structured questions to obtain qualitative data  Quantitative data were processed in descriptive statistics, and a thematic analysis was performed to analyze the qualitative data  Results: The highest stigma score of 118 respondents was 37, and the lowest score was zero  The stigma score had a mean of 12 28 (SD +/- 7 9)  The higher the score obtained leads to a higher level of stigma received  From a total of 11 participants interviewed, four main themes emerged: rejection, feeling down and afraid, sources of support, and professional vigilance  Conclusion: The social stigma experienced by nurses comes from colleagues and society and impacts psychological distress  Support from families and colleagues strengthens nurses in facing social stigma  Nevertheless, nurses uphold the values to remain grateful and carry out professional responsibilities in taking care of patients  Nurses should be provided with psychological support and be prepared for disasters to provide excellent health services and reduce adverse mental health","Manik, M.

"Existential Foundations of the Clinical and Psychological Picture of Our Time Tragedy","The study presents a model of the clinical and psychological picture of our contemporaries' experience of tragic events related to the COVID-19 pandemic  It is shown that the deformation of everyday life under the influence of threatening circumstances sharpened the features of the clinical and psychological picture of everyday life of our contemporaries  As the most significant features, the authors note experiences of the type of traumatic stress (fear of losing a job, experience of limited movement, concern about the problems of the near and distant future, in connection with the transition to remote work, fear of the lack of clear prospects for the future), as well as experiences that create a risk of reducing social interest (a decrease in the level of direct interpersonal contacts, boredom due to a decrease in social and intellectual activity, feelings of helplessness and impotence, fear of loss of autonomy and independence)  It is shown that the psychological characteristics of modern people, especially young people and adolescents (representatives of Y and Z generations), create obstacles to the application of the experience of coping with the difficulties of previous generations due to the widespread postmodern worldview with its characteristic features  The tendency of modern existential psychotherapy and positive psychology to accept suffering as an experience necessary for personal growth is shown  As a metaphor for the spiritual life of a contemporary and the inability to help people in need of help, the authors cite the images of the film ""Mirror for the Hero"" (1987) because of their special relevance in our time  The directions of psychological assistance that allows to release the resources of coping with the situation are revealed  The prospects of studying the clinical and psychological picture of the mental life of people during the COVID-19 pandemic are considered","Ermolaeva, M.

"Psychosocial Intervention Model of Kerala, India During Pandemic COVID-19: ""Ottakkalla Oppamundu (You're not alone, we're with you)""","Globally, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in several psychosocial manifestations across all socioeconomic strata. This study attempted to explore the details of a psychosocial support system implemented in Kerala, India, to address psychosocial issues during this pandemic. It employed a descriptive approach using qualitative and quantitative methods. The results can be summarized into 4 overarching themes: (1) process of implementation, (2) issues addressed, (3) experiences, and (4) success stories. This intervention targeted the whole population, with a specific focus on quarantined/isolated individuals and selected vulnerable groups. COVID pandemic has sowed several negative emotions, such as anxiety; and stigma and fearful thoughts, including suicidal ideations; trepidation regarding family members; and misinfodemics in general. Social and religious corollaries of the pandemic have intensified the psychological agony. The study provides an overview of the psychosocial intervention adopted by the state during the pandemic, which has helped both the beneficiaries and the providers. It has also helped to promote positive thinking and change the attitude toward the disease among the beneficiaries. It is highly commendable that timely intervention could obviate quite a few psychiatric emergencies, including suicides and aggressive behaviors. Considering its efficiency, flexibility, and sustainability, this model can be replicated in any setting.","Ravindran, Rekha M; Anjali Krishnan, R; Kiran, P S; Mohan, Bindhu; Shinu, K S","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00207314211019240","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Health Serv;: 207314211019240, 2021 May 26.; Publication details: Int J Health Serv;: 207314211019240, 2021 May 26.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14622,""
"Measuring the impact of COVID-19 on the quality of life of the survivors, partners and family members: a cross-sectional international online survey","OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to measure the impact of COVID-19 on the quality of life (QoL) of survivors and their partners and family members. DESIGN AND SETTING: A prospective cross-sectional global online survey using social media. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with COVID-19 and partners or family members (age &#8805;18 years). INTERVENTION: Online survey from June to August 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The EuroQol group five dimensions three level (EQ-5D-3L) to measure the QoL of survivors of COVID-19, and the Family Reported Outcome Measure (FROM-16) to assess the impact on their partner/family member's QoL. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 735 COVID-19 survivors (mean age=48 years; females=563) at a mean of 12.8 weeks after diagnosis and by 571 partners and 164 family members (n=735; mean age=47 years; females=246) from Europe (50.6%), North America (38.5%) and rest of the world (10.9%). The EQ-5D mean score for COVID-19 survivors was 8.65 (SD=1.9, median=9; range=6-14). 81.1% (596/735) reported pain and discomfort, 79.5% (584/735) problems with usual activities, 68.7% (505/735) anxiety and depression and 56.2% (413/735) problems with mobility. Hospitalised survivors (20.1%, n=148) and survivors with existing health conditions (30.9%, n=227) reported significantly more problems with mobility and usual activities (p<0.05), with hospitalised also experiencing more impact on self-care (p&#8804;0.001). Among 735 partners and family members, the mean FROM-16 score (maximum score=highest impact =32) was 15 (median=15, range=0-32). 93.6% (688/735) reported being worried, 81.7% (601/735) frustrated, 78.4% (676/735) sad, 83.3% (612/735) reported impact on their family activities, 68.9% (507/735) on sleep and 68.1% (500/735) on their sex life. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 survivors reported a major persisting impact on their physical and psychosocial health. The lives of their partners and other family members were also severely affected. There is a need for a holistic support system sensitive to the needs of COVID-19 survivors and their family members who experience a major 'secondary burden'.","Shah, Rubina; Ali, Faraz M; Nixon, Stuart J; Ingram, John R; Salek, Sam M; Finlay, Andrew Y","https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-047680","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMJ Open;11(5): e047680, 2021 05 25.; Publication details: BMJ Open;11(5): e047680, 2021 05 25.; Quality of Life; Adolescent; Cross-Sectional Studies; Europe; Family; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; North America; Prospective Studies; Surveys and Questionnaires; Survivors; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14623,""

"COVID-19 pandemic and mental health in Spain: An analysis of their relationship using Google Trends; Pandemia por COVID-19 y salud mental en EspaÃ±a: un anÃ¡lisis de su relaciÃ³n utilizando Google Trends","INTRODUCTION: This study aims to examine the public interest that exists on Internet regarding various mental health topics and its relationship with evolution of COVID-19 pandemic in Spain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Google Trends was used to explore relative search volume (RSV) for the following terms related with mental health (TRMH): ""anxiety"", ""depression"", ""stress"", ""insomnia"" and ""suicide""; between January and December 2020. The cross-correlation function was performed to assess association between new COVID-19 cases and RSV levels for TRMH. Finally, Mann-Whitney test was used to examine differences between RSV values for TRMH before and after of state of alarm declarations on March and October 2020. RESULTS: The ""anxiety"" term showed the highest RSV indices. A significant correlation was found between new COVID-19 cases and RSV for ""anxiety"" with a time-lag of +1 week (r=0.49; p<.05). Was found an increase of SRV for ""anxiety"" (U=0.00; p=.01) and a decrease of SRV for ""depression"" (U=1.00; p=.04) between 4-week period before and after state of alarm of March 2020. Regarding the state of alarm of October 2020, a higher RSV for ""anxiety"" (U=0.50; p=.02) was found in the four weeks after it compared with a similar previous period. CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety is the mental health topic of greatest public interest on Internet in context of COVID-19 pandemic. Public concern about anxiety rises one week after the increase in COVID-19 cases and is greater after introduction of control measures that entail any type of mobility restriction or activity limitation. There is a greater general need for information on anxiety at specific times in the pandemic evolution.","Becerra-GarcÃ­a, Juan Antonio; SÃ¡nchez-GutiÃ©rrez, Teresa; Barbeito, Sara; Calvo, Ana","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2021.05.001","","Country: ES; ESPANHA; SPAIN; ESPAÃ‘A; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Rev Psiquiatr Salud Ment;2021 May 15.; Publication details: Rev Psiquiatr Salud Ment;2021 May 15.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14625,""

The objective was to assess the depressive and anxiety symptoms during lockdown in hemodialysis patients and their caregivers. METHODS: We sent, during lockdown period, between April and May 2020, self-questionnaires to voluntary subjects (patients and caregivers), treated by hemodialysis or who worked in hemodialysis in one of the 14 participating centers in France. We analyzed their perception of dialysis sessions (beneficial or worrying), their stress level (VAS rated from 0 to 10), their anxiety and depressive symptoms (Hospital anxiety and depression scale). Factors associated with stress, anxiety and depression were analyzed with multiple linear regression models. RESULTS: 669Â patients and 325Â caregivers agreed to participate. 70Â % of participants found it beneficial to come to dialysis during confinement. The proportions of subjects with a stress level &#8805;Â 6 linked to the epidemic, confinement, fear of contracting COVID-19 and fear of infecting a loved one were respectively 23.9%, 26.2%, 33.4% and 42%. 39.2% presented with certain (13.7%) or doubtful (19.2%) anxious symptoms. 21.2% presented a certain (7.9%) or doubtful (13.3%) depressive symptomatology. Age, gender, history of psychological disorders and perception of dialysis sessions were associated with levels of stress, anxiety and depression.

"Litigating in the Time of Coronavirus: Mental Health Tribunals' Response to COVID-19","People with mental health and addiction issues are disproportionately affected by COVID-19 given the elevated risk of contracting COVID-19 within psychiatric facilities  The impact of the pandemic on this extraordinarily vulnerable population includes the potential for large outbreaks and multiple deaths  There is also the increased risk of serious psychological harm, exacerbating preexisting mental health and substance use issues and in turn elevating their risk to themselves and/or others  In Part I of this paper, we analyze the procedural barriers to access to justice that arose as a result of the initial responses to COVID-19 by the Consent and Capacity Board [CCB] and the Ontario Review Board [ORB]  In Part V, we include a brief report on how appeals taken from both tribunals have been handled throughout COVID-19 to date  In Part VI, we analyze the discretionary and systemic barriers experienced by people with mental health and addiction issues appearing before the CCB and ORB during COVID-19  We critique recent mental health law cases during COVID-19 where deprivations of liberty interests and substantive equality have occurred, and access to justice for people with mental health and addictions issues has been denied, suspended or impaired  Through a legal analysis of how the pandemic has impacted this vulnerable community of litigants, we hope this research will result in further advocacy and education to prevent outbreaks and death, improve health care practices, and increase access to justice Alternate abstract:Les personnes qui ont des problÃ¨mes de santÃ© mentale et de toxicomanie sont touchÃ©es de faÃ§on disproportionnÃ©e par la COVID-19, vu le risque Ã©levÃ© de contracter la COVID-19 dans les Ã©tablissements psychiatriques  Les rÃ©percussions de la pandÃ©mie sur cette population extrÃªmement vulnÃ©rable comprennent la possibilitÃ© d'Ã©closions importantes et de dÃ©cÃ¨s multiples  Il y a Ã©galement le risque accru de prÃ©judice psychologique grave, qui exacerbe les problÃ¨mes de santÃ© mentale et de toxicomanie prÃ©existants et qui augmente les risques que les personnes souffrant de ces problÃ¨mes posent pour elles-mÃªmes ou pour d'autres personnes  Dans la partie I du prÃ©sent document, nous analysons les obstacles procÃ©duraux Ã  l'accÃ¨s Ã  la justice qui sont apparus Ã  la suite des rÃ©ponses initiales Ã  la COVID-19 par la Commission du consentement et de la capacitÃ© [CCC] et la Commission ontarienne d'examen [COE]  Dans la partie V, nous prÃ©sentons un bref rapport sur la faÃ§on dont les appels interjetÃ©s Ã  l'encontre des dÃ©cisions des deux tribunaux ont jusqu'Ã  prÃ©sent Ã©tÃ© traitÃ©s pendant la pandÃ©mie de COVID-19  Dans la partie VI, nous analysons les obstacles discrÃ©tionnaires et systÃ©miques auxquels se heurtent les personnes ayant des problÃ¨mes de santÃ© mentale et de toxicomanie qui comparaissent devant la CCC et la COE pendant la pandÃ©mie de COVID-19  Nous critiquons de rÃ©centes affaires en matiÃ¨re de santÃ© mentale qui ont Ã©tÃ© instruites pendant la pandÃ©mie de COVID-19, dans lesquelles des privations de libertÃ© et des dÃ©nis d'Ã©galitÃ© rÃ©elle ont eu lieu et oÃ¹ l'accÃ¨s Ã  la justice pour les personnes ayant des problÃ¨mes de santÃ© mentale et de toxicomanie a Ã©tÃ© refusÃ©, suspendu ou compromis  GrÃ¢ce Ã  une analyse juridique des effets de la pandÃ©mie sur la communautÃ© vulnÃ©rable de plaideurs qui nous intÃ©resse, nous espÃ©rons que nos recherches mÃ¨neront Ã  d'autres activitÃ©s de sensibilisation et d'Ã©ducation visant Ã  prÃ©venir les Ã©closions et les dÃ©cÃ¨s, Ã  amÃ©liorer les pratiques de soins de santÃ© et Ã  Ã©largir l'accÃ¨s Ã  la justice","Dhand, Ruby, Szigeti, Anita, Kotob, Maya, Kennedy, Michael, Ye, Rebecca","https://doi.org/10.22329/wyaj.v37i0.6565","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: The Windsor Yearbook of Access to Justice = Recueil Annuel de Windsor d'Acce`s a` la Justice; 37:132, 2020.; Publication details: The Windsor Yearbook of Access to Justice = Recueil Annuel de Windsor d'Acce`s a` la Justice; 37:132, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14627,""

"â€œThe Greedy I That Givesâ€- The Paradox of Egocentrism and Altruism: Terror Management and System Justification Perspectives on the Interrelationship Between Mortality Salience and Charitable Donations Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic","Abstract Why do people give and help others in face of their own mortality salience? The existential struggle with the awareness of death impacts the gamut of human cognition, emotion, and behavior  This multi-method research (SNÂ =Â 1,219) explains the psychosocial impact of COVID-19-related mortality salience on altruism  Drawing from terror management theory, two studies tested death-thought accessibility, mortality salience, and anxiety buffer hypotheses  Study 1 (cross-sectional survey), using structural equation modeling, confirms death anxiety and fear are predictors of powerlessness and materialism which, in turn, predict charitable donations  Study 2 (between-subjects experiment) confirms the causal effects of COVID-19-induced mortality salience on altruism  Controlling income and socioeconomic status, people in the mortality salience treatment condition indicate greater monetary donations ($), ratio of prosocial (altruistic) to proself (egocentric) spending (%), donation of time (hour), monetary valuation of time (hourly rateÂ =Â $/hour), and economic value of donated time (hourly rate*hour) than the controls  These effects are mediated by powerlessness  Moderating effects of relevant individual difference factors are significant: the greedier, more selfish, narcissistic, materialistic, and system-justifying the donor is, the higher monetary donations, volunteer time, and perceived value of donated time are, only when the COVID-19-induced mortality is made salient but not in the controls  Environmental and dispositional factors jointly influence vulnerability to mortality salience  The paradox of egocentrism and altruism, as an evolutionarily adaptive protective buffer against existential insecurity for social and cultural animals, can help revitalize resilience, thus shedding some lights on the socio-psychological mechanism of consumers' subjective well-being  Implications for consumer affairs, social marketers, and policymakers are discussed","Jin, S.

"COVID-19 Blues: Lockdowns and Mental Health-Related Google Searches in Latin America","Rationale Stress process theory considers that actual and perceived isolation, caused by mobility restrictions from attempted containment of the COVID-19 pan- demic, deteriorates mental health  Objective We examine the relationship between the COVID-19 lockdowns and mental health-related Google searches in 11 Latin American countries  We include the following countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay  We also explore how changes in search patterns relate to income support policies and to the pandemicâ€™s intensity, measured by the COVID-19 death rate in each of these 11 Latin American coun- tries  Method Using Google Trends data and an event-study design, as well as difference- in-difference analysis, we investigate the association between country specific stay- at-home orders and internet searches including the following words: insomnia, stress, anxiety, sadness, depression, and suicide  Results We find three main patterns  First, searches for insomnia peak but then decline  Second, searches for stress, anxiety, and sadness increase and remain high throughout the lockdown  Third, there is no substantial change in depression- related or suicide-related searches after the lockdown  In terms of potential mech- anism, our results suggest that searches declined for suicide and insomnia follow- ing the passage of each countryâ€™s income support, while in countries with higher COVID-19-related death rates, searches for insomnia, stress, and anxiety increased by more  Conclusions Combined, our results suggest that, in Latin America, Google searches for words associated with mild mental health disorders increased during the COVID- 19 stay-at-home orders  Nonetheless, these conclusions should not be construed as a general population mental health deterioration, as we cannot verify that search indicators are accurately related to the usersâ€™ current feelings and behaviors, and as internet users may not be representative of the population in this region","Silverio-Murillo, Adan, Hoehn-Velasco, Lauren, Tirado, Abel Rodriguez, Balmori de la Miyar, Jose Roberto","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114040","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Social Science & Medicine;: 114040, 2021.; Publication details: Social Science & Medicine;: 114040, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14636,""

"A Mobile Intervention to Promote Low-risk Drinking Habits in Young Adults: Study Protocol for A Randomized Controlled Trial","BACKGROUND: Young adults' drinking habits commonly exceed recommendations for low risk drinking. Exceeding these guidelines may have a negative effect on young adults' mental, social, and physical health. As smartphones are highly accessible to young adults, mobile applications could be used to support them to develop low-risk drinking habits and to improve their general health. We designed a study protocol for the evaluation of a self-guided mobile application based on healthy lifestyle-related components that aim to develop and maintain low-risk drinking habits among young adults. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of Boozebuster, a mobile phone-based app on drinking behavior in young adults. METHODS: This is a two-arm, parallel group randomized controlled trial to investigate whether a 6-week self-guided mobile intervention (Boozebuster) targeting drinking behavior is more effective than a minimal intervention consisting of an educational website on the effects and consequences of drinking. To assess the effectiveness of Boozebuster we will recruit 506 young adults aged between 18 and 30 years via an open recruitment strategy in the Netherlands from an open access website. All outcomes are self-assessed through questionnaires. The primary outcome is the quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption in standard drinks (10g ethanol per standard drink) per month (TLFB). Secondary outcomes include binge-drinking sessions per month, alcohol-related problem severity (RAPI), cannabis use frequency and quantity in grams (TLFB), depressive symptoms (CES-D), perceived stress (PSS), engagement (TWEETS), readiness to change (RCQ), mental wellbeing (WEMBIS), trauma and COVID-related trauma (PCL-5-SF), impulsivity (UPPS-P), study and work performance (IWPQ), and treatment adherence. The assessments will be conducted at baseline, 6-week (post-baseline), and 3-months post-baseline, and will be analyzed on the basis of the intention-to-treat principle using multilevel mixed modelling analyses. RESULTS: Our study began recruitment in November 2020. We received 933 registrations on our study information website. From these registrations, 506 participants have completed the baseline assessment, 336 participants have completed the 6-week post-baseline assessment (T1), and 308 participants have completed the 3-month post-baseline assessment (T2). The study is still in progress. Results will be reported in 2021 and 2022. CONCLUSIONS: Self-guided mobile interventions based on a lifestyle approach might be an attractive approach for young adults due to their preference on self-reliance, healthy living, and increased perceived anonymity. This type of intervention are yet understudied while it is known that interventions addressing solely problem drinking are less appealing to young adults. We hypothesize that the Boozebuster mobile application will effectively reduce drinking levels compared to a brief alcohol educational website condition. If effective, our intervention could be an inexpensive and scalable public health intervention to improve drinking habits in young adults.

"Changes in presentations with features potentially indicating cancer in primary care during the COVID-19 pandemic: a retrospective cohort study","OBJECTIVES: To investigate how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the number of people aged 50+ years presenting to primary care with features that could potentially indicate cancer, and to explore how reporting differed by patient characteristics and in face-to-face vs remote consultations. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort study of general practitioner (GP), nurse and paramedic primary care consultations in 21 practices in South-West England covering 123 947 patients. The models compared potential cancer indicators reported in April-July 2019 with April-July 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Potential indicators of cancer were identified using code lists for symptoms, signs, test results and diagnoses listed in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence suspected cancer referral guidance (NG12). RESULTS: During April-July 2019, 17% of registered patients aged 50+ years reported a potential cancer indicator in a consultation with a GP or nurse. During April-July 2020, this reduced to 11% (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.64, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.67, p<0.001). Reductions in potential cancer indicators were stable across age group, sex, ethnicity, index of multiple deprivation quintile and shielding status, but less marked in patients with mental health conditions than without (IRR 0.75, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.79, interaction p<0.001). Proportions of GP consultations with potential indicators of cancer reduced between 2019 and 2020 for face-to-face consultations (IRR 0.84, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.92, p<0.001) and increased for remote consultations (IRR 1.17, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.29, p=0.001), although it remained lower in remote consulting than face-to-face in April-July 2020. This difference was greater for nurse/paramedic consultations (face-to-face: IRR 0.61, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.83, p=0.002; remote: IRR 1.60, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.333, p=0.014). CONCLUSION: The number of patients consulting with presentations that could potentially indicate cancer reduced during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients should be encouraged to continue contacting primary care for persistent signs and symptoms, and GPs and nurses should be encouraged to probe patients for further information during remote consulting, in the absence of non-verbal cues.","Scott, Lauren J; Murphy, Mairead; Price, Sarah; Lewis, Rhys; Denholm, Rachel; Horwood, Jeremy; Palmer, Tom; Salisbury, Chris","https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-050131","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMJ Open;11(5): e050131, 2021 05 24.; Publication details: BMJ Open;11(5): e050131, 2021 05 24.; Neoplasms; England/epidemiology; Humans; Middle Aged; Neoplasms/epidemiology; Pandemics; Primary Health Care; Retrospective Studies; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14646,""
"Inaccuracy of Official Estimates of Public Health Spending in the United States, 2000-2018","Objectives. To examine the accuracy of official estimates of governmental health spending in the United States.Methods. We coded approximately 2.7 million administrative spending records from 2000 to 2018 for public health activities according to a standardized Uniform Chart of Accounts produced by the Public Health Activities and Services Tracking project. The official US Public Health Activity estimate was recalculated using updated estimates from the data coding.Results. Although official estimates place governmental public health spending at more than $93 billion (2.5% of total spending on health), detailed examination of spending records from state governments shows that official estimates include substantial spending on individual health care services (e.g., behavioral health) and that actual spending on population-level public health activities is more likely between $35 billion and $64 billion (approximately 1.5% of total health spending).Conclusions. Clarity in understanding of public health spending is critical for characterizing its value proposition. Official estimates are likely tens of billions of dollars greater than actual spending.Public Health Implications. Precise and clear spending estimates are material for policymakers to accurately understand the effect of their resource allocation decisions.","Leider, Jonathon P; Resnick, Beth; McCullough, J Mac; Alfonso, Y Natalia; Bishai, David","https://dx.doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2020.305709","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Am J Public Health;110(S2): S194-S196, 2020 07.; Publication details: Am J Public Health;110(S2): S194-S196, 2020 07.; Public Health/economics; State Government; Health Expenditures/statistics & numerical data; Humans; United States; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14647,""

"Turbulent Airflow Costume Compromises Occupational Safety and Infection Control: A Hospital Risk Management Case Report","Objectives: To inform hospital infection control, risk management, hospital administrators, and healthcare workers about a new and surprising threat to infection control: air-powered costumes  Background: Air-powered costumes use a small motor to create positive pressure within the costume  This mechanism is similar to Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR) 1 However, unlike a PAPR the air-powered costume does not filter the incoming air through a HEPA filter  Nor does it capture the air inside a contained space and filter it before it is released into the environment  The affect is that droplets from the person in the costume or from air that is drawn into the costume, which would normally be too heavy to travel farther than 6 feet, are aerosolized by traveling through the turbulent blower  These small particles can easily penetrate the thin fabric that makes the costume  This creates an infection control problem by aerosolizing the particles and then propelling them with the force of positive pressure "" Case Description: In January of 2021, a Covid-19 outbreak in San Jose, CA, was contact traced back to a surprising source  On Christmas day, a worker wishing to lift spirits, unknowingly spread Covid-19 via an air-powered Christmas tree costume  The worker did not have symptoms of SARS-COV-2 and did not know they were infected  The result is tragic  In San Jose, at least 60 people were infected, and one person died "" Conclusion: This case manifests a tragic outcome to what was meant to be a benevolent action  All evidence points to lack of information guiding this well-intentioned action  What was meant to decrease the stress and burden of the pandemic, became a greater stress and burden  Tragically with a loss of life and unknown morbidity  Further, there is the potential for a psychologic toll on the person who thought they were helping others, only to learn that they had harmed them  Given that these costumes in hospitals are rare, further tragedies such as this one should be preventable  Covid-19 is not the only pathogen that could theoretically be spread by this mechanism  Hospital should have a policy that restricts the use of these costumes  Education about the danger of these costumes should be provided to staff  Given that personal may act by finding replacement, risk management and infection control should create an adequate policy to address the mental health needs of staff and patients, while maintain appropriate infection control  Now that there is documentation of this methods of pathogenic spread, hospitals may face liability if they fail to establish a reasonable policy and education regarding turbulent flow air-powered costumes","Diekman, Sarah J.

"Alcohol and substance use in pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on alcohol and substance use has been a topic of concern  Pregnant women are currently experiencing elevated anxiety and depression symptoms, which may increase risk of substance use, and potentially result in poor perinatal and neurodevelopmental outcomes for children  Methods Survey results were analyzed from an ongoing study of 7470 pregnant individuals in Canada: Pregnancy during the COVID-19 Pandemic  Participants were asked about current use of alcohol and substances, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and COVID-19 concerns: how much they worry about COVID-19 threatening their babyâ€™s life, threatening their own life, care for themselves or the baby, feelings of social isolation, and financial difficulties  Results The percentage of participants who reported use during pregnancy was 6 7% for alcohol, 4 3% for cannabis, 4 9% for tobacco, and 0 3% for illicit drugs;2 6% were using multiple substances  Higher depression symptoms and financial difficulties were associated with more cannabis and/or tobacco use as well as the co-use of substances  There were no associations between alcohol use and mental health or COVID-19 concerns  Conclusions Self-reported rates of use and co-use were lower or comparable to previous research, perhaps reflecting pandemic-related circumstances or the demographics of this sample  Depression symptoms and pandemic-related financial difficulties were associated with more tobacco use, cannabis use, and substance co-use  Thus, it remains important to maintain access to perinatal, mental health, and financial supports during the pandemic to mitigate prenatal alcohol and substance use and prevent poor perinatal and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes for children","Kar, Preeti, Tomfohr-Madsen, Lianne, Giesbrecht, Gerald, Bagshawe, Mercedes, Lebel, Catherine","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108760","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Drug and Alcohol Dependence;: 108760, 2021.; Publication details: Drug and Alcohol Dependence;: 108760, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14653,""
"Forecast modeling to identify changes in pediatric emergency department utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objective To identify trends in pediatric emergency department (ED) utilization following the COVID-19 pandemic  Methods We performed a cross-sectional study from 37 geographically diverse US children's hospitals  We included ED encounters between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2020, transformed into time-series data  We constructed ensemble forecasting models of the most common presenting diagnoses and the most common diagnoses leading to admission, using data from 2010 through 2019  We then compared the most common presenting diagnoses and the most common diagnoses leading to admission in 2020 to the forecasts  Results 29,787,815 encounters were included, of which 1,913,085 (6 4%) occurred during 2020  ED encounters during 2020 were lower compared to prior years, with a 65 1% decrease in April relative to 2010â€“2019  In forecasting models, encounters for depression and diabetic ketoacidosis remained within the 95% confidence interval [CI];fever, bronchiolitis, hyperbilirubinemia, skin/subcutaneous infections and seizures occurred within the 80â€“95% CI during the portions of 2020, and all other diagnoses (abdominal pain, otitis media, asthma, pneumonia, trauma, upper respiratory tract infections, and urinary tract infections) occurred below the predicted 95% CI  Conclusion Pediatric ED utilization has remained low following the COVID-19 pandemic, and below forecasted utilization for most diagnoses  Nearly all conditions demonstrated substantial declines below forecasted rates from the prior decade and which persisted through the end of the year  Some declines in non-communicable diseases may represent unmet healthcare needs among children  Further study is warranted to understand the impact of policies aimed at curbing pandemic disease on children","Ramgopal, Sriram, Pelletier, Jonathan H.; Rakkar, Jaskaran, Horvat, Christopher M.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2021.05.047","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: The American Journal of Emergency Medicine;2021.; Publication details: The American Journal of Emergency Medicine;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14654,""

"Adjustment to the COVID-19 Pandemic in Israel: Demographics, Behavioral and Psychological Factors","Background: Israel's strategy for dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic was to keep the general population in home quarantine and to maintain social distancing  This strategy can lead to psychological and behavioral symptoms known to have detrimental long-term effects on health  This study examines the prevalence of these symptoms among the general, non-infected community in comparison to people with adjustment difficulties, and investigates whether psychological and behavioral symptoms and demographic characteristics are associated with levels of adjustment  Method: In the first two weeks of April, when restrictions were at their most severe, we surveyed adjustment (ADNM-4), anxiety, depression, and stress (DASS21), sleep quality (PSQI), and emotional eating (DEBQ) among 421 participants  We used a snowball sampling strategy via social media  Comparisons in outcome measures between adjustment difficulties groups (with/without) were analyzed via one-way ANCOVA, with age as a covariate  Results: Significant psychological and behavioral effects on coping strategies were found among the full sample and differences between the group with adjustment difficulty and the group without in anxiety, depression, stress, sleep quality, and emotional eating  The group with adjustment difficulties included more women, more avid news consumers, and more people whose economic situation was affected by COVID-19  Conclusions: These results suggest that the quarantine strategy unintentionally created risk groups of potential future morbidity  Gathering more information about people with adjustment difficulties is essential in order to accelerate diagnosis and treatment","Hadar-Shoval, D.; Asraf, K.; Tannous-Haddad, L.; Tzischinsky, O.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Adjustment+to+the+COVID-19+Pandemic+in+Israel:+Demographics,+Behavioral+and+Psychological+Factors","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Israel Journal of Psychiatry and Related Sciences; 58(1):4-13, 2021.; Publication details: Israel Journal of Psychiatry and Related Sciences; 58(1):4-13, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14657,""

"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on wellness among vascular surgeons","ABSTRACT The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has placed significant strain on the health and welfare of all health care professionals, including vascular surgeons  This review summarizes the implications of the pandemic on the health and wellness of surgeons and trainees, with a particular focus on those in vascular surgery (VS)  A literature review was completed using common resource databases  We provide a brief history of burnout in VS and explore burnout and wellness in VS during this unprecedented pandemic  We then offer recommendations to address mental health needs by the VS workforce and highlight opportunities to address the gaps in the literature  The impact of COVID-19 on the professional and personal lives of surgeons and trainees in VS is notable  More than half of vascular surgeons reported some degree of anxiety  Factors associated with anxiety and burnout include COVID-19 exposure, moral injury, practice changes, and financial impacts  Trainees appeared to have more active coping strategies with dampened rates of anxiety compared to those in practice  Women appear to be disproportionately affected by the pandemic, with higher rates of anxiety and burnout  Groups underrepresented in medicine seemed to have more resilience when it came to burnout, but struggled with other inequities in the health care environment, such as structural racism and isolation  Strategies for addressing burnout include mindfulness practices, exercise, and peer and institutional support  The COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial mental health impact on the VS workforce globally, as shifts were made in patient care, surgical practice, and workâ€“home life concerns","Drudi, Laura M.; Nishath, Thamanna, Ma, Xiya, Mouawad, Nicolas J.; O'Banion, Leigh Ann, Shalhub, Sherene","https://doi.org/10.1053/j.semvascsurg.2021.04.003","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Seminars in Vascular Surgery;2021.; Publication details: Seminars in Vascular Surgery;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14666,""
"Service Work in the Pandemic Economy","The rapid spread of COVID-19 interacted with long-unfolding economic trends to set a global tinder box aflame  Over the past thirty years, the world's workforce has increasingly found employment in low-wage, low-productivity jobs in the global services sector  The pandemic lockdowns hit these sorts of activities the hardest  Opportunities to work evaporated, spreading both poverty and hunger around the world  The same rise in global service sector employment shares, which amplified the pandemic lockdown's destructive effects, will now slow the pace of the recovery  The transition to a services-based economy has accelerated, due to what JosÃ© Antonio Ocampo and Tomasso Faccio call â€œtoo much excess capacity and too little certainty about future demand,â€ which have depressed levels of investment and ushered in a period of economic stagnation  COVID-19 will make these tendencies worse  Weak economic recoveries will further entrench an economic order in which employers pay little attention to workersâ€™ demands, deepening employment insecurity and economic inequality  The future for labor looks bleak  What that means for the future of working people remains an open question  Their fight for dignity, in the midst of the pandemic and post-pandemic eras, will prove decisive","Benanav, Aaron","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0147547920000216","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: International Labor and Working Class History; 99:66-74, 2021.; Publication details: International Labor and Working Class History; 99:66-74, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14667,""
"Using the job demands-resources model to understand and address employee well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic","Telecommuting during COVID-19 and the JD-R model Previous research has demonstrated that telecommuting can positively affect employee well-being when it provides employees with greater flexibility, reduces the stress and time costs of commuting, increases employee productivity, and allows employees to better balance their home and work lives (for a review of the benefits of telecommuting, see Mann & Holdsworth, 2003)  Job demands refer to the physical, social, or organizational characteristics of the work itself (e g , role overload, ambiguity, time pressure) that require prolonged physical and/or mental effort by employees and are subsequently associated with significant decrements in employee health and performance over time  Both role ambiguity, defined as a lack of information or unclear information about a given workerâ€™s job or expectations, and role conflict, defined as an individualâ€™s experience of incompatible demands from the different roles they have (e g , employee and parent), have been consistently associated with decreased job satisfaction and commitment, as well as increased mental health issues (e g , depression, anxiety;Fisher & Gitelson, 1983;Tubre & Collins, 2000)  [   ]it is important for managers to be as transparent and clear as possible when communicating with their teams about how project timelines, priorities, and tasks may be affected during this time","Bilotta, Isabel, Cheng, Shannon, Davenport, Meghan K.; King, Eden","https://doi.org/10.1017/iop.2021.43","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Industrial and Organizational Psychology; 14(1-2):267-273, 2021.; Publication details: Industrial and Organizational Psychology; 14(1-2):267-273, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14668,""

"Antidrug Resistance in the Indian Ambient Waters of Ahmedabad during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic increases the consumption of antimicrobial substances (ABS) due to the unavailability of approved vaccine(s)  To assess the effect of imprudent consumption of ABS during the COVID-19 pandemic, we compare the 2020 prevalence of antidrug resistance (ADR) of Escherichia coli (E  coli) with a similar survey carried out in 2018 in Ahmedabad, India using SARS-CoV-2 gene detection as a marker of ABS usage  We found a significant ADR increase for in 2020 compared to 2018 in ambient water bodies, harbouring a higher incidence of ADR E Coli towards non-fluoroquinolone drugs  Effective SARS-CoV-2 genome copies were found to be associated with the ADR prevalence  The prevalence of ADR depends on the efficiency of WWTPs (Wastewater Treatment Plants) and the catchment area in its vicinity  In year 2018 study, prevalence of ADR was discretely distributed, and the maximum ADR prevalence recorded was ~60%;against the current homogenous ADR increase, and up to 85% of maximum ADR among the incubated E coli isolated from the river (Sabarmati) and lake (Chandola and Kankaria) samples  Furthermore, wastewater treatment plants showed less increase in comparison to the ambient waters, which eventually imply that although SARS-CoV-2 genes and faecal pollution may be diluted in the ambient waters, as indicated by low Ct-value and E coli count, the danger of related aftermath like ADR increase cannot be nullified  Also, Non-fluoroquinolone drugs exhibited overall more resistance than the quinolone drugs  Overall, this is probably the first ever study that traces the COVID-19 pandemic imprints on the prevalence of antidrug resistance (ADR) through wastewater surveillance and hints at monitoring escalation of other environmental health parameters  This study will make public and policyholders concerned about the optimum use of antibiotics during any kind of treatment","Kumar, Manish, Dhangar, Kiran, Thakur, Alok Kumar, Ram, Bhagwana, Chaminda, Tushara, Sharma, Pradeep, Kumar, Abhay, Raval, Nirav, Srivastava, Vaibhab, Rinklebe, JÃ¶rg, Kuroda, Keisuke, Sonne, Christian, Barcelo, Damia","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.126125","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Hazardous Materials;: 126125, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Hazardous Materials;: 126125, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14675,""
"Anxiety and associated factors among Ethiopian health professionals at early stage of COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia","In late 2019, a new coronavirus disease known as COVID-19 (novel coronavirus disease 2019) was identified. As there is no any drug to treat this pandemic, the healthcare professionals are disproportionately at higher risk. The mental health outcome is expected to be high. Anxiety is expected to have a significant impact on health professionals, especially among those who work without adequate resources for self-protection. The objectives of this research was to assess self-reported anxiety symptoms and associated factors among Ethiopian healthcare professionals in the early stages of the pandemic. We have conducted an online cross-sectional study to collect information from healthcare professionals in Ethiopia during the early stage of the outbreak from April 7, 2020 to May 19, 2020. GAD-7 was used for measurement of anxiety. We have used a cut of point of 10 and above to report anxiety symptoms. We have used Google Forms for online data collection and SPSS-22 for analysis. To determine associated factors for anxiety, a binary logistic regression model was used. Variables with p-value &lt; 0.2 during the bivariable binary logistic regression were exported for further analysis in the multivariable binary logistic regression. Finally, variables with p-value &lt;0.05 were considered as significantly associated with the outcomes. Three hundred and eighty-eight healthcare professionals filled the online questionnaire; Majority (71.1%) were males. Significant number of respondents (78.9%) reported lack of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) at the work place. The prevalence of anxiety was 26.8%. Being female (AOR: 1.88; 95% C.I:1.11, 3.19), visiting/treating 30-150 patients per day (AOR: 3.44; 95% C.I:1.51, 7.84), those employed at private healthcare institutions (AOR: 2.40; 95% C.I:1.17, 4.90), who do not believe that COVID-19 is preventable (AOR: 2.04; 95% C.I:1.04, 4.03) and those who reported lack of PPE (AOR: 1.98; 95% C.I:1.04, 3.79) were more likely to be anxious. The anxiety prevalence among healthcare professionals in Ethiopia during early stage of COVID-19 pandemic was high. This study shows that lack of preventive equipment, being female, contact with many patients, low self-efficacy and working in private health facilities were risk factors for anxiety. Anxiety prevention among health professionals during COVID-19 pandemic requires a holistic approach including provision of sufficient PPE, improving self-efficacy and addressing problems both at public and private institutions and focusing more on female health professionals.","Dagne, Atnafu, Alemu, Azale, Yitayih, Dagnew, Maru Alemayehu, Andualem, Mequanent Sisay, Tadesse, Hailu Chekol, Mengistu Mamo, Simegn","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252664","20210608","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14676,""
"Well-being during COVID-19 pandemic: A comparison of individuals with minoritized sexual and gender identities and cis-heterosexual individuals","Preliminary empirical data indicates a substantial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on well-being and mental health. Individuals with minoritized sexual and gender identities are at a higher risk of experiencing such negative changes in their well-being. The objective of this study was to compare levels of well-being among cis-heterosexual individuals and individuals with minoritized sexual and gender identities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using data obtained in a cross-sectional online survey between April 20 to July 20, 2020 (N = 2332), we compared levels of well-being (WHO-5) across subgroups (cis-individuals with minoritized sexual identities, individuals with minoritized gender identities and cis-heterosexual individuals) applying univariate (two-sample t-test) and multivariate analysis (multivariate linear regression). Results indicate overall lower levels of well-being as well as lower levels of well-being in minoritized sexual or gender identities compared to cis-heterosexual individuals. Further, multivariate analyses revealed that living in urban communities as well as being in a relationship were positively associated with higher levels of well-being. Furthermore, a moderation analysis showed that being in a relationship reduces the difference between groups in terms of well-being. Access to mental healthcare for individuals with minoritized sexual and gender identities as well as access to gender-affirming resources should be strengthened during COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare services with low barriers of access such as telehealth and online peer support groups should be made available, especially for vulnerable groups.","Buspavanich, Lech, Lermer, Fischer, Berger, Vilsmaier, Kaltofen, Keckstein, Mahner, Behr, Thaler, Batz","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252356","20210608","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14677,""

"Changes in Language Style and Topics in an Online Eating Disorder Community at the Beginning of the Global COVID-19 Pandemic: Observational Study","The novel 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has affected individuals with lived experience of eating disorders (ED) strongly with many reporting higher psychological distress, higher prevalence of ED symptoms and compensatory behaviors. The COVID-19 pandemic and the health and safety measures taken to contain its spread also disrupted routines and reduced access to familiar coping mechanisms, social support networks, and healthcare services. Social media and the ED communities on social media platforms have been an important source for support for individuals with ED in the past. So far it is unknown how discussions in online ED communities changed as offline support networks were disrupted and people spent more time at home in the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of our study was to identify changes in language content and style in an online ED community during the initial onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We extracted posts and their respective comments from the ED community on the social media website Reddit and concatenated them to comment threads. To analyze these threads, we applied top-down and bottom-up language analysis methods based on topic modeling with Latent Dirichlet allocation and 13 indicators from the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) program, respectively. Threads were split into a pre-pandemic (before 11th March 2020) and mid-pandemic (after 11th March 2020) group. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated to estimate change between pre- and mid-pandemic threads. N = 17,715 threads (n = 8,772 (49.5%) pre-pandemic threads, n = 8,943 (50.5%) mid-pandemic threads) were extracted from the ED community and analyzed. The final topic model contained 21 topics. Confidence intervals excluding zero were found for SMDs of 15 topics and nine LIWC categories covering themes such as ED symptoms, mental health, treatment for ED, cognitive processing, social life, and emotions. While we observed a reduction in discussions about ED symptoms an increase of mental health and treatment-related topics was observed at the same time. This points to a change in the focus of the ED community from promoting potentially harmful weight loss methods to bringing attention to mental health and treatments for ED. These results together with heightened cognitive processing, increased social references, and reduced inhibition of negative emotions detected in discussions indicate a shift in the ED community towards a pro-recovery orientation.","Feldhege, Moessner, Wolf, Bauer","https://doi.org/10.2196/28346","20210608","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14679,""

To abridge physical distance between patients and healthcare providers, while limiting exposure to COVID-19, telepsychiatry has been widely adopted to provide services to patients with pre-existing mental health disorders. Though telepsychiatry has become more mainstream in delivering mental health services during COVID-19, evaluation studies of the rapid conversion of care delivery from face-to-face to telepsychiatry have been limited. The aim of this study was to review the literature on the transition of mental health service delivery to telepsychiatry during COVID-19. The findings of the current review showed that a majority of patients and healthcare providers were satisfied with telepsychiatry services, and suggest that telepsychiatry is feasible and appropriate for supporting patients and healthcare providers during COVID-19.","Li, Glecia, Kent-Wilkinson, Leidl, Kleib, Risling","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-021-09926-7","20210608","COVID-19; Healthcare providers; Mental health service delivery; Patients; Telepsychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14682,""
"Risk and resilience of vulnerable families in Hong Kong under the impact of COVID-19: an ecological resilience perspective","Hong Kong has experienced four waves of COVID-19 since the first case was confirmed in January 2020. Several studies have highlighted the psychological impacts of the outbreak in Hong Kong but have largely ignored the protective factors that contribute to resilience among vulnerable families. This study adopted an ecological resilience framework to explore the impact of this epidemic on members of families with youth with a delinquent tendency/mental health concerns and the ecological protective factors for these vulnerable families. Random sampling based on a sampling frame provided by one of the largest local social service organizations in Hong Kong led to the recruitment of 407 respondents who were interviewed using a battery of standardized questionnaires. The results showed that 30.6% and 11.5% of respondents reported a moderate and a severe level of psychological distress, respectively, almost double the percentages reported in a previous study conducted in Hong Kong before the COVID-19 outbreak. Around 36.6% of respondents indicated they had encountered financial problems and almost 40% indicated aggravated financial circumstances since the outbreak. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that financial stress was the strongest predictor of psychological distress. Structural equation modeling indicated that family support, indoor leisure activities and community resources significantly mediated the negative influence of COVID-19-related stressors on psychological distress of family members. Family leisure activities, family support, community spirit and mutual help within the context of social-distancing restrictions may need to be promoted to benefit vulnerable families in Hong Kong under the COVID-19 epidemic.","Zhuang, Lau, Chan, Lee, Wong","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-021-02117-6","20210608","COVID-19; Community resources; Ecological resilience model; Family support; Vulnerable families","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14683,""
"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and health behaviors in Swedish adolescents","There is an urgent need to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescent mental health and health behaviours. To date, there are no such studies on Swedish adolescents. As COVID-19 emerged in the middle of our ongoing 2-year follow-up examination of the Study of Adolescence Resilience and Stress, we had the unique opportunity to use the corona outbreak as a 'natural experiment' to study the impact of COVID-19 on 15-year-old adolescents in Sweden. Adolescents (baseline age 13.6Ã‚Â±0.4 years) were recruited from schools in western Sweden (during the COVID-19 outbreak schools were kept open for those under 16 years of age). The COVID-19 pandemic reached Sweden on 31 January 2020. A total of 1316 adolescents answered the 2-year follow-up survey before (unexposed to COVID-19 pandemic, controls) and 584 after 1 February 2020 (COVID19-exposed). Data on stress, psychosomatic symptoms, happiness, relationships with parents and peers, school and health behaviours were collected. Adolescents reported higher levels of stress and psychosomatic symptoms and lower levels of happiness at follow-up compared to baseline. These changes occurred to a similar extent in both the control and COVID-19-exposed groups. Likewise, the COVID-19-exposed group showed no deterioration in peer relations or relations with parents versus controls. We did not find any significant differences between groups regarding sleep duration and physical activity. <b>Conclusions: Swedish adolescents exposed to COVID-19 during most of 2020 showed no differences in longitudinal changes in mental health, relationships with parents and peers, and health behaviours compared to those not exposed to COVID-19</b>.","Chen, Osika, Henriksson, Dahlstrand, Friberg","https://doi.org/10.1177/14034948211021724","20210608","Adolescents; COVID-19; happiness; health behaviours; longitudinal; psychosomatic symptoms; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14684,""
"Effects of COVID-19 pandemic curfew on orthopedic trauma in a tertiary care hospital in Turkey","This study aimed to investigate whether various curfew practices affect trauma prevalence, epidemiological differences among the population admitted to hospital because of trauma, and treatment practices used after trauma. Patients who suffered from fractures or soft-tissue trauma between March 21, 2020, and June 1, 2020, (group pandemic) and during the same period in 2019 (control group) were included in our single-center retrospective study. Each group was also divided into 3 subgroups according to the age of patients (Ã¢â€°Â¤ 20 years, 21-64 years, and Ã¢â€°Â¥ 65 years). Data including anatomical region subjected to trauma, place of admission, mechanism of trauma, location of trauma, mode of treatment, type of surgery (if performed), duration of hospitalization (if hospitalized), time elapsed until surgery, and duration of postoperative hospitalization were collected and compared between groups. A total of 361 patients were admitted to the hospital with new trauma during the pandemic, and 708 patients had been admitted during the same period in 2019. The number of admissions decreased significantly by 50.9% (P &lt; 0.001). The mechanism of trauma that occurred with low energy was significantly increased in the pandemic group (73.9%) compared with the control group (47.6%) (P &lt; 0.001). Similarly, the distribution of trauma throughout the skeletal system, especially in the upper extremity, was significantly increased in the pandemic group (49.9% vs. 30.5%, P &lt; 0.001). However, there was no significant decrease in individuals aged above 65 years (P = 0.115). Similar to the general outlook, the 3 groups differed in terms of the mechanism of trauma, location of trauma, and distribution of the anatomical region subjected to trauma (P &lt; 0.001). Majority of the patients received inpatient treatment in all 3 groups (P &lt; 0.001). The results of this study showed that the pandemic dramatically reduced the number of hospital admissions related to orthopedic trauma. The rate of low energy, upper extremity traumas that occurred indoors increased during the pandemic period compared with that of the previous year. However, the rate of hospital admissions did not differ in the Ã¢â€°Â¥65-year-old subgroup during the pandemic period compared with that of the previous year.","Kalem, KocaoÃ„Å¸lu, Merter, Karaca, Ãƒâ€“zbek, KÃ„Â±nÃ„Â±k","https://doi.org/10.5152/j.aott.2021.20263","20210608","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14685,""

"Providing Effective Mental Health Support for Oncology Health-Care Workers in the COVID-19 Era: Responding Quickly but Carefully","Oncology health-care workers (HCWs) are facing substantial stressors during the current coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, resulting in a wide range of acute stress responses. To appropriately meet the growing mental health needs of HCWs, it is imperative to differentiate expectable stress responses from posttraumatic stress disorder and mental illness, because traditional mental health interventions may pathologize healthy stress reactions and risk retraumatizing HCWs under acute duress. Further, HCWs are experiencing protracted forms of acute stress as the pandemic continues, including moral injury, and require mental health interventions that are flexible and can adapt as the acuity of stressors changes. Previously developed frameworks to support people experiencing acute stress, such as Psychological First Aid, are particularly relevant for HCWs in the ongoing pandemic. Acute stress interventions like Psychological First Aid are guided by the Stress Continuum Model, which conceptualizes stress reactions on a continuum, from a zone of normal readiness and expectable consequences to a zone of more persistent and extreme reactions such as posttraumatic stress disorder and major depression. Key principles of the Stress Continuum Model include the expectation that emotional reactivity does not lead to psychiatric problems, that interventions need to be appropriately targeted to symptoms along the stress continuum, and that people will return to normal recovery. Various core actions to reduce acute stress include delivering practical assistance, reducing arousal, mobilizing support, and providing targeted collaborative services. This nonpathologizing approach offers a valuable framework for delivering both individual and organizational-level interventions during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.","Major, Recklitis, Bober","https://doi.org/10.1093/jncics/pkab031","20210608","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14688,""
"Postpartum mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic: a population-based, repeated cross-sectional study","It is unclear whether the clinical burden of postpartum mental illness has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to compare physician visit rates for postpartum mental illness in Ontario, Canada, during the pandemic with rates expected based on prepandemic patterns. In this population-based, repeated cross-sectional study using linked health administrative databases in Ontario, Canada, we used negative binomial regression to model expected visit rates per 1000 postpartum people for March-November 2020 based on prepandemic data (January 2016-February 2020). We compared observed visit rates to expected visit rates for each month of the pandemic period, generating absolute rate differences, incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The primary outcome was a visit to a primary care physician or a psychiatrist for any mental disorder. We stratified analyses by maternal sociodemographic characteristics. In March 2020, the visit rate was 43.5/1000, with a rate difference of 3.11/1000 (95% CI 1.25-4.89) and an IRR of 1.08 (95% CI 1.03-1.13) compared with the expected rate. In April, the rate difference (10.9/1000, 95% CI 9.14-12.6) and IRR (1.30, 95% CI 1.24-1.36) were higher; this level was generally sustained through November 2020. From April-November, we observed elevated visit rates across provider types and for diagnoses of anxiety, depressive and alcohol or substance use disorders. Observed increases from expected visit rates were greater for people 0-90 days postpartum compared with 91-365 days postpartum; increases were small among people living in low-income neighbourhoods. Public health units in the northern areas of the province did not see sustained elevations in visit rates after July; southern health units had elevated rates through to November. Increased visits for mental health conditions among postpartum people during the first 9 months of the COVID-19 pandemic suggest an increased need for effective and accessible mental health care for this population as the pandemic progresses.","Vigod, Brown, Huang, Fung, Barker, Hussain-Shamsy, Wright, Dennis, Grigoriadis, Gozdyra, Corsi, Walker, Moineddin","https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.210151","20210608","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14689,""
"The effect of COVID-19 lockdown on psychiatric admissions: role of gender","The UK went into nationwide lockdown on 24 March 2020, in response to COVID-19. The direct psychiatric effects of this are relatively unknown. We examined whether the first UK lockdown changed the demographics of patients admitted to psychiatric hospitals (to include gender, legality, route of admission and diagnoses), independent of seasonal variation.. We conducted an anonymous review of psychiatric admissions aged Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years in the 6-month period after the announcement of the first UK lockdown (March to August 2020), and in the previous year (March to August 2019), in Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust in-patient facilities. The number of admissions were compared, along with factors that may help to explain the psychological effects of national lockdown. There was no significant increase in total number of admissions or the gender percentage. However, there was a 11.8% increase in formal sectioning under the Mental Health Act 1983. This increase was sustained and statistically significant across all 6 months. A sustained decrease in admissions via the crisis team was also observed as being statistically significant. Separate diagnoses saw changes in percentage of admissions between March and May. The most statistically significant was schizophrenia admissions for men in April (18.7%), and women in March (18.4%). Our findings highlight the effect of COVID-19 on the legal status of psychiatric admissions, and emphasise the importance of having a robust, adaptable and open psychiatric service that caters to the ongoing needs of patients, regardless of government restrictions.","Davies, Hogarth","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.927","20210608","COVID-19; Epidemiology; admissions; gender; legal status","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14690,""
"Heart rate variability moderates the effects of COVID-19-related stress and family adversity on emotional problems in adolescents: Testing models of differential susceptibility and diathesis stress","The COVID-19 pandemic is a unique period of stress, uncertainty, and adversity that will have significant implications for adolescent mental health. Nevertheless, stress and adversity related to COVID-19 may be more consequential for some adolescents' mental health than for others. We examined whether heart rate variability (HRV) indicated differential susceptibility to mental health difficulties associated with COVID-19 stress and COVID-19 family adversity. Approximately 4 years prior to the pandemic, we assessed resting HRV and HRV reactivity to a well-validated stress paradigm in 87 adolescents. During the pandemic, these adolescents (ages 13-19) reported on their health-related stress and concerns about COVID-19, family adversity related to COVID-19, and their recent emotional problems. The association between COVID-19 stress and emotional problems was significantly stronger for adolescents who previously exhibited higher resting HRV or higher HRV reactivity. For adolescents who exhibited lower resting HRV or HRV augmentation, COVID-19 stress was not associated with emotional problems. Conversely, lower resting HRV indicated vulnerability to the effect of COVID-19 family adversity on emotional problems. Different patterns of parasympathetic functioning may reflect differential susceptibility to the effects of COVID-19 stress versus vulnerability to the effects of COVID-19 family adversity on mental health during the pandemic.","Miller, Chahal, Kirshenbaum, Ho, Gifuni, Gotlib","https://doi.org/10.1017/S095457942100033X","20210608","COVID-19; adolescence; biological sensitivity to context; diathesis stress; differential susceptibility; heart rate variability","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14691,""
"Maternal low-intensity psychosocial telemental interventions in response to COVID-19 in Qatar: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial","As COVID-19 is spreading, new psychological health problems are suspected to be emerging among pregnant women. Higher maternal mental health distress, including perinatal anxiety, depression, and COVID-19-specific phobia, is supposed to be increasing during the pandemic, which impacts pregnant women's health and their infants and calls for intervention. Due to the social distancing protocols posed by the pandemic, telemental health interventions have fast become the most common form of psychosocial support for maternal mental health. However, there is no evidence of the effectiveness of maternal low-intensity psychosocial telemental interventions in improving mental health outcomes. The trial's objective is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of telemental low-intensity psychosocial interventions in pregnant and postpartum women attending the Women Wellness and Research Centre in Qatar in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. The clinical trial is randomized in which pregnant women will be assigned equally through block randomization between two arms: (1) a control group and (2) an intervention group. The primary endpoint is the perinatal psychological distress, including perinatal depression, anxiety, and COVID-19 phobia in their third trimester; the secondary, tertiary, fourth, and fifth endpoints will be in the postnatal period (3-5Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks, 2-4Ã¢â‚¬â€°months, 5-7Ã¢â‚¬â€°months, and 8-10Ã¢â‚¬â€°months). This trial involves pregnant women in their second trimester with no mental health illness history who communicate in English and Arabic and consent to participate. A sample size of 58 (29 participants per arm) is targeted. This study will provide recommendations about the efficacy of low-intensity psychosocial maternal telemental interventions to be implemented as a preventive service. 2a-ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04594525 .

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on migraine in Japan: a multicentre cross-sectional study","To assess the impacts of social situation changes due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on headache-related disability and other symptoms in patients with migraine in Japan. We conducted a multicentre, cross-sectional study including 659 outpatients with migraine diagnosed by headache specialists. The participants were asked about the impacts of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on headache-related disability, headache days, headache intensity, stress, physical activity, hospital access and their work and home lives. For headache-related disability, the total Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) score and part A and B scores were analysed. Multivariate stepwise linear regression analysis was performed to identify the clinical predictors of changes in the total MIDAS score before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the factors related to new-onset headache during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, 606 migraine patients (73Ã‚Â M/533 F; age, 45.2Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°12.0 years) were included in the study, excluding those with incomplete data.

The total MIDAS and A and B scores did not significantly change after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. New-onset headache, which was observed in 95 patients (15.7Ã¢â‚¬â€°%), was associated with younger age and worsened mood and sleepÃ‚Â in the logistic regression analysis. The multivariate stepwise linear regression analysis ofÃ‚Â changes in the total MIDAS score before and during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic identified worsened sleep, increased acute medication use, increased stress, medication shortages, comorbidities, the absence of an aura and new-onset headache were determinants of an increased total MIDAS score during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this multicentre study, clinical factors relevant to headache-related disability, such as new-onset headache, stress and sleep disturbances, were identified, highlighting the importance of symptom management in migraine patients during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Suzuki, Takeshima, Igarashi, Imai, Danno, Yamamoto, Nagata, Haruyama, Mitsufuji, Suzuki, Ito, Shibata, Kowa, Kikui, Shiina, Okamura, Tatsumoto, Hirata","https://doi.org/10.1186/s10194-021-01263-1","20210608","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Headache-related disability; Migraine; Sleep disturbances","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14693,""
"Evaluating the mental health and well-being of Canadian healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak","During the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare systems have been under extreme levels of stress due to increases in patient distress and patient deaths. While additional research and public health funding initiatives can alleviate these systemic issues, it is also important to consider the ongoing mental health and well-being of professionals working in healthcare. By surveying healthcare workers working in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic, we found that there was an elevated level of depressive symptomatology in that population. We also found that when employees were provided with accurate and timely information about the pandemic, and additional protective measures in the workplace, they were less likely to report negative effects on well-being. We recommend that healthcare employers take these steps, as well as providing targeted mental health interventions, in order to maintain the mental health of their employees, which in turn will provide better healthcare at the population level.","Wilbiks, Best, Law, Roach","https://doi.org/10.1177/08404704211021109","20210608","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","",14694,""
