"Trends in Suicide Mortality in Canada by Sex and Age Group, 1981 to 2017: A Population-Based Time Series Analysis: Tendances de la mortalitÃ© par suicide au Canada selon le sexe et le groupe d'Ã¢ge, 1981 - 2017 : Une analyse de sÃ©ries chronologiques dans la population","OBJECTIVES: Suicide is a complex global public health issue. The objective of this study was to assess time trends in suicide mortality in Canada by sex and age group. METHODS: We extracted data from the Canadian Vital Statistics Death Database for all suicide deaths among individuals aged 10 years and older based on International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Ninth Revision (E950-959; 1981 to 1999) and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (X60-X84, Y87Â·0; 2000 to 2017) for a 37-year period, from 1981 to 2017. We calculated annual age-standardized, sex-specific, and age group-specific suicide mortality rates, and used Joinpoint Regression for time trend analysis. RESULTS: The age-standardized suicide mortality rate in Canada decreased by 24.0% from 1981 to 2017. From 1981 to 2007, there was a significant annual average decrease in the suicide rate by 1.1% (95% confidence interval, -1.3 to -0.9), followed by no significant change between 2007 and 2017. From 1981 to 2017 and from 1990 to 2017, females aged 10 to 24 and 45 to 64 years old, respectively, had a significant increase in suicide mortality rates. However, males had the highest suicide mortality rates in all years in the study; the average male-to-female ratio was 3.4:1. CONCLUSION: The 3-decade decline in suicide mortality rates in Canada paralleled the global trend in rate reductions. However, since 2008, the suicide rate in Canada was relatively unchanged. Although rates were consistently higher among males, we found significant rate increases among females in specific age groups. Suicide prevention efforts tailored for adult males and young and middle-aged females could help reduce the suicide mortality rate in Canada.","Varin, MÃ©lanie; Orpana, Heather M; Palladino, Elia; Pollock, Nathaniel J; Baker, Melissa M","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0706743720940565","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Can J Psychiatry;: 706743720940565, 2020 Jul 14.; Publication details: Can J Psychiatry;: 706743720940565, 2020 Jul 14.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-14","",4722,""
"Future Directions for Infant Identification and Intervention for Autism Spectrum Disorder from a Transdiagnostic Perspective","By the time they are typically detected, neurodevelopmental disorders like autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are already challenging to treat. Preventive and early intervention strategies in infancy are critical for improving outcomes over the lifespan with significant cost savings. However, the impact of prevention and early intervention efforts is dependent upon our ability to identify infants most appropriate for such interventions. Because there may be significant overlap between prodromal symptoms across neurodevelopmental disorders and child psychopathology more broadly which may wax and wane across development, we contend that the impact of prevention and early intervention efforts will be heightened by identifying early indicators that may overlap across ASD and other commonly co-occurring disorders. This paper summarizes the existing literature on infant symptoms and identification of ASD to demonstrate the ways in which a transdiagnostic perspective could expand the impact of early identification and intervention research and clinical efforts, and to outline suggestions for future empirical research programs addressing current gaps in the identification-to-treatment pipeline. We propose four recommendations for future research that are both grounded in developmental and clinical science and that are scalable for early intervention systems: (1) development of fine-grained, norm-referenced measures of ASD-relevant transdiagnostic behavioral domains; (2) identification of shared and distinct mechanisms influencing the transition from risk to disorder; (3) determination of key cross-cutting treatment strategies (both novel and extracted from existing approaches) effective in targeting specific domains across disorders; and (4) integration of identified measures and treatments into existing service systems.","Talbott, Meagan R; Miller, Meghan R","https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15374416.2020.1790382","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Clin Child Adolesc Psychol;: 1-15, 2020 Jul 23.; Publication details: J Clin Child Adolesc Psychol;: 1-15, 2020 Jul 23.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-14","",4723,""
"Nurses' Attitudes and Perceptions towards Hand Hygiene in Mental Health and Medical Inpatient Settings: Comparative, Cross-Sectional Study","Poor hand hygiene is a major contributor to hospital acquired infection. In this study, a comparison of the related attitudes of psychiatric and non-psychiatric nurses was made using a cross-sectional survey design. N = 79 nurses who work in psychiatric or non-psychiatric hospital wards completed questionnaires regarding intended compliance with hand-washing protocols and potential cognitive predictors of compliance. Perceived ease of compliance and behavioural norms, and working in a non-psychiatric ward, predicted superlative intended compliance. Working in psychiatry did not in itself predict outgroup membership suggesting that psychiatric ward-related factors, rather than psychiatric nurse-related factors are most relevant in determining between-group differences. Consideration of factors unique to psychiatry wards during service design could improve compliance.","Dickens, Geoffrey L; Goko, Charlotte; Ryan, Emina","https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01612840.2020.1757796","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Issues Ment Health Nurs;: 1-8, 2020 Jul 20.; Publication details: Issues Ment Health Nurs;: 1-8, 2020 Jul 20.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-14","",4724,""
"A Virtual Standardized Patient-Based Assessment Tool to Evaluate Psychiatric Residents' Psychopharmacology Proficiency","OBJECTIVES: A virtual standardized patient-based assessment simulator was developed to address biases and practical limitations in existing methods for evaluating residents' proficiency in psychopharmacological knowledge and practice. METHODS: The simulator was designed to replicate an outpatient psychiatric clinic experience. The virtual patient reported symptoms of a treatment-resistant form of major depressive disorder (MDD), requiring the learner to use various antidepressants in order for the patient to fully remit. Test scores were based on the proportion of correct responses to questions asked by the virtual patient about possible side effects, dosing, and titration decisions, which depended upon the patient's tolerability and response to the learner's selected medications. The validation paradigm included a novice-expert performance comparison across 4th year medical students, psychiatric residents from all four post-graduate year classes, and psychiatry department faculty, and a correlational analysis of simulator performance with the PRITE Somatic Treatments subscale score. Post-test surveys evaluated the test takers' subjective impressions of the simulator. RESULTS: Forty-three subjects completed the online exam and survey. Total mean scores on the exam differed significantly across all the learner groups in a step-wise manner from students to faculty (F = 6.10, p = 0.0001). Total mean scores by residency class correlated with PRITE Somatic Therapies subscale scores (p < 0.01). The post-test survey mean Likert results ranged from 3.33 Â± 1.20 to 4.4 Â± 0.79, indicating neutral to favorable responses for use of the simulator. CONCLUSIONS: This simulator demonstrated strong construct validity and high participant acceptability for assessing proficiency in the psychopharmacologic treatment of MDD.","Rakofsky, Jeffrey J; Talbot, Thomas B; Dunlop, Boadie W","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40596-020-01286-x","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Acad Psychiatry;2020 Jul 17.; Publication details: Acad Psychiatry;2020 Jul 17.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-14","",4725,""
"Going digital: how technology use may influence human brains and behaviorÃ¢<U+0080>Â©","The digital revolution has changed, and continues to change, our world and our lives. Currently, major aspects of our lives have moved online due to the coronavirus pandemic, and social distancing has necessitated virtual togetherness. In a synopsis of 10 articles we present ample evidence that the use of digital technology may influence human brains and behavior in both negative and positive ways. For instance, brain imaging techniques show concrete morphological alterations in early childhood and during adolescence that are associated with intensive digital media use. Technology use apparently affects brain functions, for example visual perception, language, and cognition. Extensive studies could not confirm common concerns that excessive screen time is linked to mental health problems, or the deterioration of well-being. Nevertheless, it is important to use digital technology consciously, creatively, and sensibly to improve personal and professional relationships. Digital technology has great potential for mental health assessment and treatment, and the improvement of personal mental performance.Ã¢<U+0080>Â©.","Hoehe, Margret R; Thibaut, Florence","https://dx.doi.org/10.31887/DCNS.2020.22.2/mhoehe","","Country: FR; FRANÃ‡A; FRANCE; FRANCIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Dialogues Clin Neurosci;22(2): 93-97, 2020 06.; Publication details: Dialogues Clin Neurosci;22(2): 93-97, 2020 06.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-14","",4726,""
"Salud mental y salud ambiental Una visiÃ³n prospectiva Informe SESPAS 2020; [Mental health and environmental health A prospective view SESPAS Report 2020]","Since the dawn of psychiatry, the environment has been an essential factor in the study and understanding of mental illness. Traditionally, the interrelationship between genome and environment has been a central theme in research on the etiopathogenesis of mental health problems and in the very conception of mental health. In its application to psychopathology and mental health, psychiatric enviromics was defined as Â«the study of environmental conditions and processes that promote mental health or increase the risk of developing mental disordersÂ¼. However, environmental health -at least in Spain and in connection with its powers within the Spanish General Health System- has paid attention to aspects pertaining to risks associated with the physical, chemical and biological pollution of the air, the water and the ground, as well as to its correlation with food pollution. Although environmental risks such as air quality, extreme temperatures, noise, climate change and various environmental toxicants can play a particularly important role, they can hardly be identified as single etiopathogenic elements. This work reviews the recent literature on environmental research and problems of psychiatric morbidity and mortality. Although the results are inconclusive, future lines of research should consider a more agile interdisciplinary collaboration, allowing, on the one hand, a better understanding of mental illness and, on the other hand, to be able to shiftÂ from ""traditional"" environmental health to an environmental health that takes social environmental factorsÂ into accountÂ and seriously addresses the still little studied concept of ""social pollution"".","OrdÃ³Ã±ez-Iriarte, JosÃ© MarÃ­a","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gaceta.2020.05.007","","Country: ES; ESPANHA; SPAIN; ESPAÃ‘A; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Gac Sanit;2020 Jul 17.; Publication details: Gac Sanit;2020 Jul 17.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-14","",4727,""
"El impacto de la Gran RecesiÃ³n en la salud mental en EspaÃ±a; [Impact of Great Recession on mental health in Spain]","The objective of this article is to identify the effects of the Great Recession on the mental health of people residing in Spain. After presenting a conceptual framework on the mechanisms through which economic crises affect mental health, we describe the main results of 45 papers identified in our search. Studies indicate a worsening of mental health in Spain in the years of economic crisis, especially in men. Working conditions (unemployment, low wages, instability, precariousness) emerge as one of the main channels through which mental health is put at risk or deteriorates. This deterioration occurs with intensity in particularly vulnerable groups, such as immigrant population and families with economic burdens. In the case of suicides, the results were inconclusive. Regarding the use of health care services, an increase in the consumption of certain drugs seems to be identified, although the conclusions of all the studies are not coincidental. Social inequalities in mental health do not seem to have remitted. We conclude that Spain needs to improve information systems to a better understanding of the health effects of economic crises. In terms of public policies, together with the reinforcement of health services aimed at addressing mental health problems, an income guarantee network for people in vulnerable situations should be promoted, as well as the development of policies aimed at the labour market.","Oliva, Juan; LÃ³pez-VarcÃ¡rcel, Beatriz GonzÃ¡lez; PÃ©rez, Patricia Barber; PeÃ±a-Longobardo, Luz MarÃ­a; Garrido, Rosa M Urbanos; GonzÃ¡lez, NÃ©boa Zozaya","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gaceta.2020.05.009","","Country: ES; ESPANHA; SPAIN; ESPAÃ‘A; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Gac Sanit;2020 Jul 13.; Publication details: Gac Sanit;2020 Jul 13.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-14","",4728,""
"Implementing Logotherapy in Its Second Half-Century: Incorporating Existential Considerations Into Personalized Treatment of Adolescent Depression","Although biological processes have been directly targeted to substantial advantage in effective treatments for major depression, the evidence base for addressing potential ""existential"" contributions to depressive syndromes has lagged behind that related to other tractable mediators of the condition, such as cognitive bias, nonadaptive learned behavior, and variation in monoamine neurotransmission. Whether the experience of existential conflict is a cause or an effect of these phenomena is incompletely understood. Here, we provide a clinical update on knowledge surrounding a psychotherapeutic tradition that addresses existential issues but has not consistently been invoked in contemporary approaches to adolescent depression, and we consider whether the evolution of this approach, in concert with parallel advances in positive psychology, is nearing readiness for more systematic implementation in the treatment of adolescent depression. The goal of this article is to briefly summarize the state of the literature on logotherapy and to consider ways in which its implementation might be incorporated to advantage in the approach to treating adolescent depression.","Baumel, W Thomas; Constantino, John N","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2020.06.006","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry;59(9): 1012-1015, 2020 Sep.; Publication details: J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry;59(9): 1012-1015, 2020 Sep.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-14","",4729,""
"Urban regeneration policies and mental health in a context of economic crisis in Andalusia (Spain)","Literature suggests that urban regeneration policies might contribute towards improving mental health of residents, but to date there is a lack of empirical research on how these policies and downward social mobility can interact and influence health outcomes. The current study aims to explicitly test whether regeneration policies implemented in deprived Andalusian urban places (southern Spain) moderate the use of anxiolytics and/or antidepressants, taking into consideration families' downward social mobility during the recent period of economic crisis in Spain. We designed a post intervention survey to retrospectively compare the evolution of psychotropic drug consumption in target and comparison areas. We observe a general increase in the use of anxiolytics and/or antidepressants from 2008 to 2015, specifically for people in whose families the economic crisis had the greatest impact (odds ratio = 2.18; p value < 0.001). However, better evolution is observed among residents of the target areas compared with residents of similar urban areas where this kind of polices have been not in force (odds ratio = 0.50; p value < 0.05). Therefore, urban regeneration policies might act as moderators of the risk of mental health, particularly when people are subject to the loss of individual/family resources in urban vulnerable contexts.","Zapata Moya, Ãngel R; Navarro YÃ¡Ã±ez, Clemente J","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10901-020-09774-0","","Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Hous Built Environ;: 1-13, 2020 Aug 19.; Publication details: J Hous Built Environ;: 1-13, 2020 Aug 19.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-14","",4730,""
"""Nothing Hurts Less Than Being Dead"": Psychological Pain in Case Descriptions of Psychiatric Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide from the Netherlands: Â« Rien ne fait moins mal qu'Ãªtre mort Â¼: La douleur psychologique dans les descriptions de cas d'euthanasie et de suicide assistÃ© psychiatrique aux Pays-Bas","OBJECTIVES: Euthanasia and assisted suicide (EAS) of individuals with mental disorders is a growing practice in several countries, including the Netherlands. Here, we aimed to identify the most frequent dimensions of and associated factors to psychological pain, which has been associated with suicidality, in individuals undergoing psychiatric EAS. METHODS: An exploratory retrospective content analysis of the English translation of 66 digital case records of individuals who died by EAS in the Netherlands between 2011 and 2014 was performed. Nine standard psychological pain dimensions (irreversibility, loss of control, emptiness, emotional flooding, freezing, social distancing, narcissistic wounds, confusion, and self-estrangement), illness, and sociodemographic variables were evaluated by 2 independent raters using a premade data abstraction form (Kohen &#954; > 0.8 in all cases). RESULTS: The mean number of dimensions was 4.64 Â± 1.20 (median = 5), out of 9. The most frequent dimensions were irreversibility, loss of control, emptiness, and emotional flooding, in decreasing order. Past treatment refusal and the mention of social connections in case descriptions were related to the higher number of psychological pain dimensions (4.89 Â± 1.24 vs. 4.31 Â± 1.07, P = 0.03 and 5.05 Â± 1.17 vs. 4.43 Â± 1.17, P = 0.03, respectively). Emotional flooding was the only dimension specifically associated with specific psychiatric conditions, namely posttraumatic phenomena and personality disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Numerous psychological pain dimensions were detected in case descriptions of individuals who underwent EAS before the procedure. Subjective nature of the study precludes definite conclusions but suggest that future studies should explore psychological pain and the role of interventions targeting it in patients requesting EAS.","Lengvenyte, Aiste; Strumila, Robertas; Courtet, Philippe; Kim, Scott Y H; OliÃ©, Emilie","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0706743720931237","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Can J Psychiatry;65(9): 612-620, 2020 Sep.; Publication details: Can J Psychiatry;65(9): 612-620, 2020 Sep.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-14","",4731,""
"Early Childhood Education Programs as Protective Experiences for Low-Income Latino Children and Their Families","Research is accelerating toward a deeper understanding of early childhood education (ECE) environments as protective experiences for Latino children; however, more work remains. This paper provides a review of the evidence that ECE environments benefit Latino children and mitigate the impact of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and other poverty-related risks; however, Latino families face numerous barriers to accessing ECE opportunities for their children. While enrollment by Latino children in ECE programs has grown in prior decades, further increases in access to ECE are needed to benefit Latino children, who are disproportionately impacted by poverty. In addition, ECE programs, especially high-quality and dual generation-focused programs like Early Head Start and Head Start, are in a strong position to help offset the risk for poor educational and mental health outcomes due to Latino's children's exposure to stressors such as discrimination and ACEs. Gaps remain in how well ECE is serving Latino families due to a combination of factors including parental work schedules, heritage language and cultural factors, and the lack of affordable and available ECE programs in Latino communities. To remedy these gaps, researchers must continue to further elucidate the needs, preferences, and gaps regarding access to early care and education opportunities for Latino children. For those studying trauma and ACEs among low-income children, greater attention to how preventative interventions or treatments that are embedded in ECE settings serve Latino populations is warranted, as this has the tremendous potential to mitigate the long-term impact of ACEs on Latino children. The paper concludes with a set of early childhood practice and policy recommendations for enhancing protective experiences for low-income Latino children.","Smith, Julia Mendez","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42844-020-00013-7","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Advers Resil Sci;: 1-14, 2020 Aug 13.; Publication details: Advers Resil Sci;: 1-14, 2020 Aug 13.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-14","",4732,""
"Milling with ceramic inserts of austempered ductile iron (ADI): process conditions and performance","In the work here presented, the high performance of ceramic insert tools in milling of ADI 1000 iron casting is analyzed. Austempered ductile irons (ADI) are ductile iron castings with strength and mechanical properties enhanced after specific heat treatment, achieving 1000 MPa or even more. Sintered carbide tools are state of the art in many industrial applications, including iron casting machining, but ceramic inserts are a feasible and promising option since cutting speed can be improved by 5 or even 10 times. A complete testing campaign was performed, starting with coated sintered carbides and aiming at the use of whisker reinforced Al2O3 ceramics and Si3N4 tools. The two most important conclusions are as follows: firstly, that the milling type so-called up-milling (or conventional) is more recommended than down-milling, also known as climb milling, and secondly, that dry machining enhances ceramics performance in comparison with using emulsion coolants (oil in water). Finally, results regarding economic aspects were analyzed based on the tools cost-performance ratio.","LÃ³pez de Lacalle, L N; FernÃ¡ndez Valdivielso, A; Amigo, F J; Sastoque, L","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00170-020-05942-2","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Adv Manuf Technol;: 1-9, 2020 Aug 17.; Publication details: Int J Adv Manuf Technol;: 1-9, 2020 Aug 17.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-14","",4733,""
"Effects of 12Â months of detraining on health-related quality of life in patients receiving hemodialysis therapy","PURPOSE: Limited data exist regarding the effects of detraining on functional capacity and quality of life (QoL) in the hemodialysis population. The aim of the current study was to assess whether the discontinuation from a systematic intradialytic exercise training program will affect aspects of health-related QoL and functional capacity in hemodialysis patients. METHODS: Seventeen hemodialysis patients (12 Males/5 Females, age 60.8 Â± 13.6Â year) participated in this study. Patients were assessed for functional capacity using various functional capacity tests while QoL, daily sleepiness, sleep quality, depression and fatigue were assessed using validated questionnaires at the end of a 12-month aerobic exercise program and after 12Â months of detraining. RESULTS: The detraining significantly reduced patients' QoL score by 20% (P = 0.01). More affected were aspects related to the physical component summary of the QoL (P < 0.001) rather than those related to the mental one (P = 0.096). In addition, the performance in the functional capacity tests was reduced (P < 0.05), while sleep quality (P = 0.020) and daily sleepiness scores (P = 0.006) were significantly worse after the detraining period. Depressive symptoms (P = 0.214) and the level of fatigue (P = 0.163) did not change significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Detraining has a detrimental effect in patients' QoL, functional capacity and sleep quality. The affected physical health contributed significantly to the lower QoL score. It is crucial for the chronic disease patients, even during emergencies such as lockdowns and restrictions in activities to maintain a minimum level of activity to preserve some of the acquired benefits and maintain their health status.","Rosa, Clara Suemi Costa; Giannaki, Christoforos D; Krase, Argyro; Mplekou, Meropi; Grigoriou, Stefania S; Stefanidis, Ioannis; Lavdas, Eleftherios; Pappas, Aggelos; Bloxham, Saul; Karatzaferi, Christina; Sakkas, Giorgos K","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11255-020-02560-5","","Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int Urol Nephrol;52(9): 1771-1778, 2020 Sep.; Publication details: Int Urol Nephrol;52(9): 1771-1778, 2020 Sep.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-14","",4734,""

"Examining the implementation of the Icelandic model for primary prevention of substance use in a rural Canadian community: a study protocol","BACKGROUND: The Icelandic Prevention Model (IPM) is a collaborative upstream model that was designed to influence risk and protective factors related to substance use within the community, school, peer and family contexts. By engaging whole communities, the IPM has been found to be effective in reducing youth substance use behaviours across Iceland. As an extension to the IPM's participatory approach, this research will examine how youth involvement can enhance outcomes. In addition, this research will evaluate whether the IPM approach is beneficial for mental health promotion and general youth wellbeing. METHODS: The present research protocol applies the bioecological model within a participatory mixed-method case study design to examine the implementation of the IPM in a rural community in Canada. This study was designed to identify whether the Icelandic substance use prevention model is effective in reducing substance use and promoting mental health and development for Canadian youth.

"The Impact of Co-occurring Anxiety and Alcohol Use Disorders on Video Telehealth Utilization Among Rural Veterans","Co-occurring anxiety and alcohol use disorders lead to poorer treatment outcomes for both disorders. Compounding risk for poor outcomes related to these disorders, individuals living in rural areas face barriers receiving evidence-based mental health treatment. Video to home telehealth (VTH) has been implemented broadly within the Veterans Health Administration to improve access to care for rural veterans. However, VTH may not be utilized equally across disorders and comorbidities, including co-occurring anxiety and alcohol use disorders, potentially contributing to gaps in care that are not available in person. A cohort of veterans who received at least one VTH mental health visit between fiscal years 2016-2019 was compiled from VA administrative data. Multilevel linear growth curve models were used to examine growth in VTH use over time among veterans with anxiety only, alcohol use disorder only, and co-occurring disorders. Fixed effects were significant for both time and diagnosis group and a significant interaction between time and group. For each subsequent fiscal year, the percentage of total MH visits that were VTH increased for all groups but less so for those with co-occurring anxiety and alcohol use diagnoses. Despite VTH being an important tool to reach underserved rural veterans, rural veterans with AUD and co-occurring anxiety and AUD are at risk for not receiving care using this modality. Findings suggest that veterans with co-occurring anxiety and AUD are especially at risk for being underserved, given that a major goal of VTH is to increase access to mental health services.","Ecker, Anthony H; Amspoker, Amber B; Hogan, Julianna B; Lindsay, Jan A","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s41347-020-00150-x","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Technol Behav Sci;: 1-6, 2020 Aug 06.; Publication details: J Technol Behav Sci;: 1-6, 2020 Aug 06.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-14","",4738,""
"Psychological resilience and positive coping styles among Chinese undergraduate students: a cross-sectional study","BACKGROUND: Psychological resilience and coping strategies have been found to be related to various psychological and mental health problems. Evaluations of the relationship between resilience and coping style among university students are important for developing effective health promotion strategies focused on resilience intervention to benefit students' health and well-being. The relationship between psychological resilience and coping styles has usually been examined among adults and patients. Very few studies have investigated the relationship between resilience and coping style in university students. The present study aimed to investigate the associations between psychological resilience, students' characteristics (gender, major and grade) and coping styles among undergraduate students. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among undergraduate students in Shandong Province, China. Undergraduate students were randomly selected from 6 universities in 3 cities of the province using a stratified random sampling method. The questionnaire included questions on the participants' demographic information, including gender, grade and major, measures of psychological resilience and coping style. Coping style was measured by the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ). The Asian Resilience Scale (ARS) was applied to evaluate undergraduates' psychological resilience. Multivariable regression analysis was used to examine the relationships between resilience, students' characteristics and positive coping styles. RESULTS: A sample of 1743 undergraduates was analysed. The mean psychological resilience score was 70.41. The mean score for positive coping style was 24.72. Multiple regression analysis showed that three factors of psychological resilience, mood control, self-plasticity and coping flexibility, were all significant factors for positive coping styles (regression coefficient = 0.34, 0.35, 0.14, p < 0.01 for the three factors, respectively). Medical students and females had higher scores for positive coping styles than non-medical students and males (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The research revealed that females and medical students are more likely than males and non-medical students to adopt positive coping styles. Higher psychological resilience is associated with a better positive coping style. The findings suggest that psychological education and health promotion programmes that target strengthening psychological resilience among undergraduate students may help foster positive coping styles to benefit their mental health and psychological well-being.","Wu, Yu; Yu, Wenzhou; Wu, Xiuyun; Wan, Huihui; Wang, Ying; Lu, Guohua","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40359-020-00444-y","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMC Psychol;8(1): 79, 2020 Aug 06.; Publication details: BMC Psychol;8(1): 79, 2020 Aug 06.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-14","",4739,""

"Adults' expectations on children's earthquake-related emotions and coping strategies","Natural disasters such as earthquakes have a highly traumatic impact on psychological functioning. Recently, the study of children's earthquake-related emotions and coping strategies has gathered attention. However, little is known on the corresponding adults' representation, adults who in case of disasters are frequently key informants on children's reactions. Examining the influence of earthquake experience, we explored adults' expectations on children's earthquake-related emotions and coping strategies. The participants were 572 Italian university students. Referring to what happens during and after earthquakes, they were asked to list children's (a) expected emotions, and (b) coping strategies for diminishing fear and sadness. We coded (a) number of fear, sadness, and anger terms; (b) presence of 13 coping strategies. We used Generalized Linear Mixed Models. Fear was more frequent than sadness, and more frequent during vs. after earthquakes (and vice versa for sadness). Some coping strategies were reported rarely, while others were more salient (i.e. problem-solving, information-seeking, self-reliance, support-seeking, and accommodation). Earthquake experience had a marginal impact. Our findings enable us to deepen knowledge on the emotional representation of earthquakes. At an applied level, they can help professionals to develop training programs aimed at increasing children's emotional preparedness.","Raccanello, Daniela; Barnaba, Veronica; Rocca, Emmanuela; Vicentini, Giada; Hall, Rob; Burro, Roberto","https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2020.1800057","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Psychol Health Med;: 1-13, 2020 Aug 05.; Publication details: Psychol Health Med;: 1-13, 2020 Aug 05.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-14","",4741,""

Using the culturally based Framework of Historical Oppression, Resilience, and Transcendence (FHORT), the purpose of this article was to examine AI alcohol use from a sex-specific wellness approach, exploring its associated physical, behavioral, and mental risk and protective factors. METHOD: Data were drawn from a cross-sectional survey with 479 AI adults in South Dakota. We employed a series of multiple hierarchical regression analyses to assess the associations of demographic (sex, age, marital status, income, and educational attainment), physical (Body Mass Index and cardiovascular risk), behavioral (smoking and health self-efficacy) and mental (depressive symptoms) factors with alcohol use. RESULTS: Results indicated that surveyed males tended to drink three times that of females, and depressive symptoms were associated with higher levels of alcohol use.

"Lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic: People's experiences and satisfaction with telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia","Objectives: To determine how participants perceived telehealth consults in comparison to traditional in-person visits, and to investigate whether people believe that telehealth services would be useful beyond the pandemic. Design: A national cross-sectional community survey. Participants: Australian adults aged 18 years and over (n=1369). Main outcome measures: Telehealth experiences. Results: Of the 596 telehealth users, the majority of respondents (62%) rated their telehealth experience as ""just as good"" or ""better"" than a traditional in-person medical appointment. On average, respondents perceived that telehealth would be moderately to very useful for medical appointments after the COVID-19 pandemic is over (M=3.67 out of 5, SD=1.1). Being male (p=0.007), having a history of both depression and anxiety (p=0.037), or lower patient activation (individuals' willingness to take on the role of managing their health/healthcare) (p=0.037) were associated with a poorer telehealth experience. Six overarching themes were identified from free-text responses of why telehealth experience was poorer than a traditional in-person medical appointment: communication is not as effective; limitations with technology; issues with obtaining prescriptions and pathology; reduced confidence in doctor; additional burden for complex care; and inability to be physically examined. Conclusions: Telehealth appointments were reported to be comparable to traditional in-person medical appointments by most of our sample. Telehealth should continue to be offered as a mode of healthcare delivery while the pandemic continues and may be worthwhile beyond the pandemic.","Jennifer MJ Isautier; Tessa Copp; Julie Ayre; Erin Cvejic; Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz; Carys Batcup; Carissa Bonner; Rachael Dodd; Brooke Nickel; Kristen Pickles; Samuel Cornell; Thomas Dakin; Kirsten J McCaffery; Aboubacar Sidiki Magassouba; Arsen Arakelyan","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.10.20192336","","Database: PREPRINT-MEDRXIV; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-14","",4743,""
"The impact of asthma on mental health & wellbeing during COVID-19 lockdown","Abstract Introduction The global SARS CoV2 pandemic resulted in social isolation measures with unintended negative impacts, particularly on mental health. We hypothesised that people with asthma are likely to be more vulnerable to worse mental health during lockdown. Methods We examined COVID-19 surveys (completed April/May 2020), nested within two generations of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC): index-generation ALSPAC-G1 (n= 2942, mean age=28) and the parents generation ALSPAC-G0 (n=3737, mean age=59). We used Poisson and logistic regression models to estimate the effect of asthma on wellbeing, anxiety and depression, and factors related to COVID-19 and lockdown. Models were adjusted for validated pre-pandemic measures of mental health and socio-economic factors. Results Asthma was associated with a 13% increase in depression score in ALSPAC-G1 (p=0.005) and 15% increase in ALSPAC-G0 (p=0.05) compared to participants without asthma, anxiety scores increased by 14% in ALSPAC-G1 (p=0.005) and by 16% in ALSPAC-G0 (p=0.02). Asthma was associated with a similar increase of anxiety and depression scores during COVID-19 in both generations (Z test p values >0.80). Discussion People with asthma have worse mental health & wellbeing during lockdown compared to people without asthma. Although the effect of asthma on mental health is of similar magnitude between the generations, younger participants with asthma declined to lower levels of mental health despite reporting less symptoms, COVID-19 infection and self-isolation. This has important implications given repeated lockdowns. Young people with asthma should be closely monitored and supported to mitigate the impact of lockdown on their mental health.","Daniel H Higbee; George Nava; Alex S F Kwong; James W Dodd; Raquel Granell; Gustavo G Davanzo; Lauar B Monteiro; Joao V Virgilio-da-Silva; Mayla GS Borba; Gabriela F Souza; Nathalia Zini; Flora A Gandolfi; Stefanie P Murano; Jose L Proenca-Modena; Fernando A Val; Gisely C Melo; Wuelton M Monteiro; Mauricio L Nogueira; Marcus VG Lacerda; Pedro M Moraes-Vieira; Helder I Nakaya","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.10.20190793","","Database: PREPRINT-MEDRXIV; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-14","",4744,""

"A descriptive study of the psychological experience of health care workers in close contact with a person with COVID-19","COVID-19 has the potential to affect the mental health of health care workers (HCWs). It is known that HCWs who serve as front-liners during the COVID-19 pandemic experience stress and have the fear of contracting the infection. Little is known of how being a positive contact affects HCWs. We examined the experience of HCWs who were quarantined following a close unprotected contact with a COVID-19 positive colleague and explore the psychological impact especially as the timing of the quarantine coincided with the Eid (annual Muslim festival) celebration in Malaysia. This was a cross-sectional on-line questionnaire study, involving HCWs exposed to a COVID-19 positive colleague in Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre, a teaching hospital. Data on demographics, levels of depression, anxiety and stress using a validated depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS-21) questionnaire, aspects of quarantine, wearing of masks, hand hygiene practice and swab experience were collected. Twenty-two HCWs participated. Eighteen (81.8%) were between 30-39 years and 17 (77.3%) were women. Majority 19 (86.3%) were Malays. There were twelve (54.5%) medical officers, 5 (22.7%) specialists and 5(22.7%) allied health staff. Eighteen out of 22 (81.8%) felt they were able to do home quarantine adequately. All tested negative with a mean (Standard Deviation) hour of contact of 2.56Ã‚Â±2.38 hours. Eighteen reported their biggest concern was infecting their families. HCWs undergoing contact swabbing and quarantine are vulnerable to depression, anxiety and stress. The ability of the HCW to adequately home quarantine should not be taken for granted. Psychological support should be offered to HCWs who are positive contacts.","Ng, Nuratiqah, Faisal, Soo, Low, Najma, Periyasamy, Mustafa, Andrea","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+descriptive+study+of+the+psychological+experience+of+health+care+workers+in+close+contact+with+a+person+with+COVID-19.","20200912","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-14","",4746,""
"Mental health and quality of life among healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic in India","The COVID-19 pandemic has placed healthcare professionals (HCP) in stressful circumstances with increased patient loads and a high risk of exposure. We sought to assess the mental health and quality of life (QoL) of Indian HCPs, the fourth highest-burden country for COVID-19. Using snowball sampling, we conducted an online survey in May 2020 among HCPs. Data were collected on demographics, depression, and anxiety using validated tools, quality of life, and perceived stressors. Multivariable logistic regression and principal component analysis were performed to assess risk factors associated with mental health symptoms. Of 197 HCPs assessed, 157 (80%) were from Maharashtra, 130 (66%) from public hospitals, 47 (24%) nurses, 66 (34%) physicians, 101 (52%) females, and 81 (41%) Ã¢â€°Â¤30Ã‚Â years. Eighty-seven percent provided direct COVID-19 care with 43% caring for &gt;10 patients/day. A large proportion reported symptoms of depression (92, 47%), anxiety (98, 50%), and low QoL (89, 45%). Odds of combined depression and anxiety were 2.37 times higher among single HCPs compared to married (95% CI: 1.03-4.96). Work environment stressors were associated with 46% increased risk of combined depression and anxiety (95% CI: 1.15-1.85). Moderate to severe depression and anxiety were independently associated with increased risk of low QoL [OR: 3.19 (95% CI: 1.30-7.84), OR: 2.84 (95% CI: 1.29-6.29)]. Our study demonstrated a high prevalence of symptoms of depression and anxiety and low QoL among Indian HCPs during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an urgent need to prevent and treat mental health symptoms among frontline HCPs.","Suryavanshi, Kadam, Dhumal, Nimkar, Mave, Gupta, Cox, Gupte","https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.1837","20200912","COVID-19; India; healthcare professionals; mental health; quality of life; stressors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-14","",4747,""

"Physical Activity and Sedentary Lifestyle in University Students: Changes during Confinement Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic","Regular physical activity is related to many factors in a university student's environment. The coronavirus pandemic and the resulting lockdown have restricted many elements of our environment. The aim of this study was to evaluate students' physical activity and sedentary behaviour at two points in time: before and during the coronavirus lockdown. As a secondary aim, we also wanted to look at changes resulting from other factors (alcohol, tobacco, diet, stages of change, symptoms of anxiety/depression and sociodemographic characteristics). We conducted an observational, cross-sectional, pre-post study with two cut-off points. Two hundred and thirteen students took part in the study. The main dependent variables were physical activity and sitting time, measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF). Parametric and non-parametric tests were used for paired and unpaired data, as well as group-stratified analysis. During lockdown, both weekly physical activity (MD: -159.87; CI: -100.44, -219.31) and weekly sitting time increased (MD: -106.76; CI: -71.85, -141.67). In the group analysis, differences were observed in relation to gender, year of study, BMI, alcohol consumption, tobacco use, symptoms of anxiety/depression, Mediterranean diet, living situation and stage of change. The results showed an increase in both physical activity and sitting time globally and by group.","Romero-Blanco, RodrÃƒÂ­guez-Almagro, Onieva-Zafra, Parra-FernÃƒÂ¡ndez, Prado-Laguna, HernÃƒÂ¡ndez-MartÃƒÂ­nez","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17186567","20200912","COVID-19; college student; healthy lifestyle; lockdown; physical activity; sedentary behaviour","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-14","",4750,""

"Chasing the Curve: Program Description of the Geisinger Primary Care Behavioral Health Virtual First Response to COVID-19","Objective: In response to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, an initiative to rapidly transition to a telebehavioral health (TBH) service delivery model was developed to maintain access to primary care behavioral health (PCBH) services at Geisinger across a wide, predominantly rural, geographic range. Methods: In line with the â€œVirtual Firstâ€ approach employed by the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health, we describe how we prepared for and implemented TBH services while facilitating communication and collaboration among PCBH providers, staff, and trainees, and supported our Geisinger colleagues. Results: We present operational and clinical outcomes of our approach through June 2020, as well as provider surveys of acceptability of the TBH platform used. We found that we were able to attain or surpass comparable patient access and utilization implementing TBH services compared with inperson services over the last two years. We did not observe an increase in proportion of patients with Depression and Anxiety diagnoses during the pandemic. The TBH platform was acceptable overall based on provider ratings. Conclusion: Our Virtual First approach enabled us to maintain access and utilization of PCBH services during a time of widespread uncertainty and vulnerability. We conclude with a discussion of the limitations of the approach used as well as identified next steps in navigating the â€œnew normalâ€ of behavioral healthcare in the age of COVID-19.","Sean O'Dell et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B5-A88-4BA","20200914","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; rural mental health; primary care behavioral health; integrated care; telebehavioral health; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-14","",4753,""
