"Mental Health, Substance Use, and the Importance of Religion during the COVID-19 Pandemic","COVID-19 impacted multiple facets of life, with implications on physical, mental, and societal health. Specifically, long COVID and related losses have exacerbated complex and prolonged grief responses and mental disorders including depression and anxiety. These mental health concerns are in turn associated with increased detrimental coping strategies including substance use disorders (SUD). The social and interpersonal implications of SUD are varied. Secondary data analyses from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) collected during the COVID-19 pandemic revealed an increase in substance use behaviors and mental health problems. Self-reported religious activities had a positive meditating effect on reducing substance use behaviors. Accordingly, we explored the importance of one's religion and faith in coping with stress, grief, and mental health challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the impact of religion and faith in bringing hope and purpose during periods of loss, grief, mental health challenges, and SUD.","Ji-Yeun Park; Thushara Galbadage; Hyuna Lee; David C Wang; Brent M Peterson","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.11.29.22282907","20221130","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-01","",41894,""
"The mental health impact of COVID-19 on pre-registration nursing students in Australia: Findings from a national cross-sectional study","The study aimed to measure and describe the mental health impact of COVID-19 on Australian pre-registration nursing students. The COVID -19 pandemic has had a swift and significant impact on nursing students across the globe. The pandemic was the catalyst for the closure of schools and universities across many countries. This necessary measure caused additional stressors for many students, including nursing students, leading to uncertainty and anxiety. There is limited evidence available to identify the mental health impact of COVID-19 on Australian pre-registration nursing students currently. A cross-sectional study was conducted across 12 Australian universities. Using an anonymous, online survey students provided demographic data and self-reported their stress, anxiety, resilience, coping strategies, mental health and exposure to COVID-19. Students' stress, anxiety, resilience, coping strategies and mental health were assessed using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, the Brief Resilience Scale, the Brief Cope and the DASS-21. Descriptive and regression analyses were conducted to investigate whether stress, anxiety, resilience and coping strategies explained variance in mental health impact. Ethical Approval was obtained from the University of New England Human Research Ethics Committee (No: HE20-188). All participating universities obtained reciprocal approval. Of the 516 students who completed the survey over half (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;300, 58.1%) reported mental health concerns and most students (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;469, 90.9%) reported being impacted by COVID-19. Close to half of students (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;255, 49.4%) reported signs of post-traumatic stress disorder. Mental health impact was influenced by students' year level and history of mental health issues, where a history of mental health and a higher year level were both associated with greater mental health impacts. Students experienced considerable disruption to their learning due to COVID-19 restrictions which exacerbated students' distress and anxiety. Students coped with COVID-19 through focusing on their problems and using strategies to regulate their emotions and adapt to stressors. The COVID-19 pandemic has considerably impacted pre-registration nursing students' mental health. Strategies to support nursing students manage their mental health are vital to assist them through the ongoing pandemic and safeguard the recruitment and retention of the future nursing workforce. This study adds an Australian understanding to the international evidence that indicates student nurses experienced a range of negative psychosocial outcomes during COVID-19. In this study, we found that students with a pre-existing mental health issue and final-year students were most affected. The changes to education in Australian universities related to COVID-19 has caused distress for many nursing students. Australian nursing academics/educators and health service staff need to take heed of these results as these students prepare for entry into the nursing workforce. The study was designed to explore the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of undergraduate nursing students in Australia. Educators from several universities were involved in the design and conduct of the study. However, the study did not include input from the public or the intended participants.","Usher Am, Jackson, Massey, Wynaden, Grant, West, McGough, Hopkins, Muller, Mather, Byfield, Smith, Ngune, Wynne","https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.15478","20221201","COVID-19; clinical placement; mental health; nurse education; nursing; students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-01","",41895,""
"Neuro faces of beneficial T cells: essential in brain, impaired in aging and neurological diseases, and activated functionally by neurotransmitters and neuropeptides","T cells are essential for a healthy life, performing continuously: immune surveillance, recognition, protection, activation, suppression, assistance, eradication, secretion, adhesion, migration, homing, communications, and additional tasks. This paper describes five aspects of normal beneficial T cells in the healthy or diseased brain. First, normal beneficial T cells are essential for normal healthy brain functions: cognition, spatial learning, memory, adult neurogenesis, and neuroprotection. T cells decrease secondary neuronal degeneration, increase neuronal survival after central nervous system (CNS) injury, and limit CNS inflammation and damage upon injury and infection. Second, while pathogenic T cells contribute to CNS disorders, recent studies, mostly in animal models, show that specific subpopulations of normal beneficial T cells have protective and regenerative effects in several neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. These include Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), stroke, CNS trauma, chronic pain, and others. Both T cell-secreted molecules and direct cell-cell contacts deliver T cell neuroprotective, neuroregenerative and immunomodulatory effects. Third, normal beneficial T cells are abnormal, impaired, and dysfunctional in aging and multiple neurological diseases. Different T cell impairments are evident in aging, brain tumors (mainly Glioblastoma), severe viral infections (including COVID-19), chronic stress, major depression, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, ALS, MS, stroke, and other neuro-pathologies. The main detrimental mechanisms that impair T cell function are activation-induced cell death, exhaustion, senescence, and impaired T cell stemness. Fourth, several physiological neurotransmitters and neuropeptides induce by themselves multiple direct, potent, beneficial, and therapeutically-relevant effects on normal human T cells, via their receptors in T cells. This scientific field is called ""Nerve-Driven Immunity"". The main neurotransmitters and neuropeptides that induce directly activating and beneficial effects on na&#xef;ve normal human T cells are: dopamine, glutamate, GnRH-II, neuropeptide Y, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and somatostatin. Fifth, ""Personalized Adoptive Neuro-Immunotherapy"". This is a novel unique cellular immunotherapy, based on the ""Nerve-Driven Immunity"" findings, which was recently designed and patented for safe and repeated rejuvenation, activation, and improvement of impaired and dysfunctional T cells of any person in need, by ex vivo exposure of the person's T cells to neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. Personalized adoptive neuro-immunotherapy includes an early ex vivo personalized diagnosis, and subsequent ex vivo &#x2192; in vivo personalized adoptive therapy, tailored according to the diagnosis. The Personalized Adoptive Neuro-Immunotherapy has not yet been tested in humans, pending validation of safety and efficacy in clinical trials, especially in brain tumors, chronic infectious diseases, and aging, in which T cells are exhausted and/or senescent and dysfunctional.","Levite","https://doi.org/10.4103/1673-5374.357903","20221201","Personalized Adoptive Neuro-Immunotherapy; T cells; aging; dopamine; glutamate; nerve-driven immunity; neurological diseases; neuropeptides; neurotransmitters","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-01","",41896,""
"Evaluation of Perceived Depression, Anxiety, Stress Levels and Emotional Eating Behaviours and Their Predictors among Adults during the COVID-19 Pandemic","This study aimed to (1) evaluate the prevalence and predictors of perceived depression, anxiety, stress (DAS) levels and emotional eating behaviours, (2) determine the correlations between DAS levels and emotional eating behaviours during the pandemic. An online cross-sectional study included questions about demographic and anthropometric characteristics, dietary habits, Emotional Appetite Questionnaire (EMAQ), and Depression Anxiety Stress Scales. The snowball sampling method was used. Turkiye. The study population was 2002 adults aged &#x2265;18 years. The mean age was 27.1&#xb1;9.52 years (72.1% females, 27.9% males). The prevalence of moderate to severe depression, anxiety, and stress was reported as 27.8%, 30.5%, and 30.7%, respectively. Skipping meals (OR=1.32, 95% CI=1.14-1.49) was associated with depression. Weight gain (OR=1.43, 95% CI =1.19-1.66; OR=1.30, 95% CI=1.14-1.49; OR=1.39, 95% CI=1.14-1.64), weight loss (OR=1.45, 95% CI = 1.20-1.70; OR=1.37, 95% CI=1.11-1.62; OR=1.46, 95% CI=1.20-1.72), exercising at least 150 minutes per week (OR=0.64, 95% CI = 0.46- 0.83; OR= 0.73, 95% CI = 0.55-0.92; OR=0.83, 95% CI =0.63-1.02), and maintaining an adequate and balanced diet (OR=0.52, 95% Cl=0.33-0.71; OR=0.53, 95% CI =0.34-0.73; OR=0.63, 95% CI =-0.15-0.35) were associated with depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively.

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown measures on the management, health, and behavior of the cystic fibrosis population in France during 2020 (MUCONFIN)","Most of the studies on cystic fibrosis (CF) focused on SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and suggested a low incidence of infection in this population. We aimed to assess the impact of the pandemic and related lockdown measures implemented in May 2020 in response to the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection on healthcare access, health, and behavior in CF patients. A national questionnaire opened online from May 15th, 2020 to June 11<sup>th</sup>, 2020 was completed by 751 CF-patients, aged 14 years and over. It comprised questions about access to healthcare, anxiety and depression, smoking, alcohol, drug and psychotropic drug consumption, adherence to CF treatment, and constraints. A semi-structured comprehensive interview was performed no later than 1 month after the end of the lockdown in 16 CF-patients. The mean age of the population was 28.0 [interquartile range (IQR) 20.0-37.0] years old. More than 75% of in-person consultations scheduled during the lockdown were canceled. Alternatively, 27% were postponed, and telehealth consultations were proposed and accepted in almost 40% of cases. More than 75% of the scheduled physiotherapy sessions were canceled and replaced mainly by self-drainage. Annual follow-up clinic visits were consistently postponed whereas required hospitalizations at CF centers for exacerbation were maintained in most cases. While 43.2% CF-patients had signs of anxiety, 51.0% presented symptoms of depression, both associated with increased use of psychotic medications and inversely correlated to COVID-19 prevalence. Among the lower and lower middle classes, very little medical information was obtained or requested by the patient, participation to sports or other activities was low, while excessive home confinement and isolation were more frequent. In contrast, in the upper middle and upper classes, individuals solicitated help to their CF centre, had more physical activities, and maintained contact with friends or families. The first lockdown in France had only minimal impact on the management care of CF-patients but was associated with increased symptoms of anxiety and depression, together with behavioral changes that varied with social class.

"The Iranian Corona Stress Study: Psychological Impacts of COVID-19 Pandemic in an Iranian Population","To assess the psychological consequences of changes during the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the Iranian population. We performed an anonymous online survey in the first 3 weeks of March 2020. Individuals older than 14 who could read Persian, and lived in Iran, were eligible for the study. The participants had to rate their stress levels and depressive symptoms (using a nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire PHQ-9) during the last 2 weeks and before the pandemic retrospectively. The changes in the psychological measurements and their association with the sociodemographic factors and burdens due to confinement were assessed. Overall, among the 3,210 subjects who participated in our study, both the stress levels and average depression scores increased. However, about 23% of the subjects reported a decrease in their stress levels. The burden of childcare, restrictions in private life, and thoughts about the future were positively correlated with the changes in the stress levels and depression scores (|r| &gt; 0.15). However, feeling relieved in the pandemic condition, and enjoying more family time were associated with less change in the stress and depression scores. Being religious (odds ratio [OR] [CI]: 1.5 [1.3-1-8]) and older age (OR [CI]: 2.9 [1.8-4.6] for &gt;55 years old) were identified as the resilience factors, whereas being a student (OR [CI]: 2.1 [1.6;2.7]), seeking a job (OR [CI]: 2.6 [1.8;3.9]), and history of a psychiatric disorder (OR [CI]: 3.2 [2.6;4]) were identified as the risk factors for depression. The stress levels and depressive symptoms have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic and this increase is related to different social and personal burdens due to the confinement conditions.","Sabouhi, Vaezi, Sharbafchi, Aerni, Bentz, Coynel, de Quervain, Fehlmann, Freytag, Gerhards, Papassotiropoulos, Schicktanz, Schlitt, Zimmer, Zuber, Amini","https://doi.org/10.4103/ijpvm.ijpvm_281_21","20221201","COVID-19; depression; epidemiology; psychological; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-01","",41899,""
"COVID-19 pandemic and adolescent mental health in China: Micro evidence and socioeconomic mechanisms","Although the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescent mental health has received sufficient attention in the medical and public health fields, analysis from the social science perspective is still lacking. By regarding the shock of COVID-19 pandemic as a quasi-natural experiment, this study adopts the Difference-in-Differences (DID) model and large microdata from Shandong Province, China, to identify the causal effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of senior high school students. We find that the COVID-19 pandemic results in an increase of 2.5677 points in adolescent psychological problem scores, equivalent to an average decrease of 29.93% in mental health. Furthermore, results of mechanism tests show that this negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescent mental health can be explained by a reduction in social trust, as well as widening inequalities caused by the digital divide and family income gap. Moreover, the estimates suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has a greater negative influence on the mental health of boys and urban adolescents. Our study complements the research field on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescent mental health and the potential socioeconomic mechanisms from a new perspective. These findings provide insights into how to safeguard adolescent mental health in China and other countries in the pandemic prevention and post-pandemic era.","Chen, Zhao, Li, Liu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1041376","20221201","COVID-19 pandemic; China; Difference-in-Differences model; adolescents; mental health; socioeconomic mechanisms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-01","",41900,""
"Evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 mutational spectrum","SARS-CoV-2 evolves rapidly in part because of its high mutation rate. Here we examine whether this mutational process itself has changed during viral evolution. To do this, we quantify the relative rates of different types of single nucleotide mutations at four-fold degenerate sites in the viral genome across millions of human SARS-CoV-2 sequences. We find clear shifts in the relative rates of several types of mutations during SARS-CoV-2 evolution. The most striking trend is a roughly two-fold decrease in the relative rate of G&#x2192;T mutations in Omicron versus early clades, as was recently noted by Ruis et al (2022). There is also a decrease in the relative rate of C&#x2192;T mutations in Delta, and other subtle changes in the mutation spectrum along the phylogeny. We speculate that these changes in the mutation spectrum could arise from viral mutations that affect genome replication, packaging, and antagonization of host innate-immune factors-although environmental factors could also play a role. Interestingly, the mutation spectrum of Omicron is more similar than that of earlier SARS-CoV-2 clades to the spectrum that shaped the long-term evolution of sarbecoviruses. Overall, our work shows that the mutation process is itself a dynamic variable during SARS-CoV-2 evolution, and suggests that human SARS-CoV-2 may be trending towards a mutation spectrum more similar to that of other animal sarbecoviruses.","Bloom, Beichman, Neher, Harris","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.11.19.517207","20221201","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-01","",41901,""
"Rumination and ""hot"" executive function of middle school students during the COVID-19 pandemic: A moderated mediation model of depression and mindfulness","The outbreak of COVID-19 had a widely negative effect on adolescents' academics, stress, and mental health. At a critical period of cortical development, adolescents' cognition levels are highly developed, while the ability of emotion control is not developed at the same pace. Faced with negative emotions such as stress and social loneliness caused by COVID-19, adolescents' ""hot"" executive function encounters severer emotional regulation challenges than ever before. The present study established a moderated mediation model to investigate the impact of rumination on ""hot"" execution function among Chinese middle school students during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the specific role of depression and mindfulness in the association. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 650 students recruited from a province in central China. The participants completed questionnaires and experiment between July 2021 and August 2021. Rumination Responses Scales, Self-rating Depression Scale, and Mindful Attention Awareness Scale were used to measure the level of rumination, depression, and mindfulness. The reaction time and accuracy of the emotional conflict experiment were recorded to reflect the ""hot"" executive function. The results of the moderated mediation model indicated that rumination of middle school students significantly and positively predicted depression in adolescents (&#x3b2; = 0.26, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Meanwhile, the indirect effect of depression on the relationship between rumination and ""hot"" executive function was significant; depression partially mediated this relationship (word-face congruent condition: &#x3b2; = -0.09, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01; word-face incongruent condition: &#x3b2; = -0.07, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, mindfulness buffered the association between rumination and depression, according to moderated mediation analysis (&#x3b2; = -0.11, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). For adolescents with low levels of mindfulness, the relationship was substantially stronger. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, middle school students' rumination would lead to depression, which can negatively impact their ""hot"" executive function. Besides, mindfulness could resist the adverse effect of rumination on depression. The educators should pay more attention to students' mental health, provide targeted strategies that boost mindfulness to promote their cognitive flexibility, and thus protect the normal development of their executive function during crisis events.","Li, Qu, Kong, Ma, Cao, Li, Wang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.989904","20221201","COVID-19; depression; executive function; mindfulness; rumination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-01","",41902,""

"Factors affecting the mental health of medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study","The coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak has impacted many educational institutions by imposing restrictions on offline or in-person lessons. Many students were stressed by ""the loss of everyday life"" due to the pandemic, and it is important to examine the impact of this loss on adolescents' mental health. This study aimed to investigate the factors that affect students' mental health during the pandemic from various perspectives. A total of 166 medical students participated in this study. Participants completed questionnaires about their demographics, life stress, mental health, and stress factors during in-person and online lecture days. Participants were divided into 2 groups, those with low and high mental health. The researchers compared independent variables between the groups using the &#x3c7;2 test or Fisher's exact test. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed, with mental health as the dependent variable. The multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that increased time spent online was significantly associated with mental health (P&#x2005;&lt;&#x2005;.05). Human relations and the inability to meet/talk with friends trended toward a significant association with mental health (P&#x2005;&lt;&#x2005;.1). The students who were not stressed about the increased time spent online were at a risk of low mental health. The students who appreciated interacting with others experienced more stress during the lockdown.

"Depressive symptoms and physical function among the elderly in nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic in China: A cross-sectional study","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has placed a heavy burden on global healthcare. Depressive symptoms and physical function impairment are 2 common health problems among the elderly, but the association between depressive symptoms and physical function in nursing homes have not been extensively investigated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to investigate the current status of depressive symptoms and physical function and analyze the prevalence and related factors of depression among elderly people in nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. A cross-sectional study was conducted. 381 elderly people were included in 4 nursing homes who were 60 to 100 years old with more than 3 months' residential in Weifang City, Shandong Province using convenience cluster sampling. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was performed to evaluate geriatric depression, the Barthel Index (BI) was administered to assess the activities of daily living, and a self-designed demographic data questionnaire was used to collect the demographic data. Multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted. 103 (27.0%) old residents reported depression according to PHQ-9. 279 (73.2%) old residents reported impaired self-care ability according to BI. The mean score of PHQ-9 and BI in the elderly was 3.56 &#xb1; 3.76 and 5.76 &#xb1; 7.05. The total PHQ-9 score of the elderly in nursing homes was positively correlated with the total activities of daily living score (R = 0.503, P &lt; .01). Regression analysis showed that gender, self-care ability, more chronic diseases and medicines, especially Alzheimer's disease and cataract were risk factors for depression among elderly people in nursing homes (P &lt; .05). Our study showed 27.0% depression rate among old residents in nursing homes in China in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Depression is relatively prevalent among the elderly in China, and we should pay attention to those with poor self-care ability and more chronic diseases and medicines.","Gao, Yang, Liu, Xin, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000031929","20221201","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-01","",41906,""
"Effectiveness of massage therapy on anxiety and depression of COVID-19 convalescent: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis","Novel coronavirus pneumonia was first detected in Wuhan, China, in late December 2019. Its widespread infectivity and strong pathogenicity has posed a great threat to public health, seriously affecting social production and life. The disease caused by this virus has been officially named COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) by the World Health Organization (WHO). Tuina (massage) therapy is 1 of the widely employed complementary and alternative medicine interventions in the world. As a useful therapy implemented on human's skin, muscles and joints, tuina (massage) has unique advantages in the field of medicine.

"The efficacy and safety of acupuncture in the treatment of taste disorders after rehabilitation from COVID-19: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis","Since the outbreak of the new crown pneumonia epidemic, although it has had a serious impact on people's lives and health in itself, the sequelae that accompany coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have also had a serious impact on people's mental health and quality of life. Taste disorder (TD) is one of the sequelae of COVID-19. Patients may experience reduced or even absent taste sensation, which seriously affects their real life. The efficacy of acupuncture in the treatment of taste disorders has been well reported, but there is a lack of evidence-based medical evidence. Therefore, this study set out to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in the treatment of post-COVID-19 taste disorder. According to the retrieval strategies, randomized controlled trials on the acupuncture for COVID-19 TD were obtained from Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, the Chinese Scientific Journal Database and the Wanfang Database, regardless of publication date, or language. Studies were screened based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the Cochrane risk bias assessment tool was used to evaluate the quality of the studies. The meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager (RevMan 5.4) and StataSE 15.0 software. Ultimately, the evidentiary grade for the results will be evaluated. This systematic evaluation protocol is registered in PROSPERO under the registration ID CRD42022364653. The results of this meta-analysis will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication. This meta-analysis will evaluate the effect of acupuncture and moxibustion on TD caused by sequelae of COVID-19, providing evidence as to the treatment in these patients.","Chao, Zhang, Chen, Chen, Yu, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000031649","20221201","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-01","",41908,""
"Risk of COVID-19 infection and the associated hospitalization, ICU admission and mortality in opioid use disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Opioid use disorder (OUD) as a common drug use disorder can affect public health issues, including the COVID-19 pandemic, in which patients with OUD may have higher risk of infection and severe disease. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the risk of COVID-19 and the associated hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality in patients with OUD. A comprehensive systematic search was performed on PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science to find studies which compared the infection rate and outcomes of COVID-19 in OUD patients in comparison with the normal population. A random effects meta-analysis model was developed to estimate odd ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) between the outcomes of COVID-19 and OUD. Out of 2647 articles identified through the systematic search, eight were included in the systematic review and five in the meta-analysis. Among 73,345,758 participants with a mean age of 57.90&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;13.4&#xa0;years, 45.67% were male. The findings suggested no significant statistical relationship between COVID-19 infection and OUD (OR (95% CI): 1.18 (0.47-2.96), p-value: 0.73). Additionally, patients with OUD had higher rate of hospitalization (OR (95% CI) 5.98 (5.02-7.13), p-value&lt;0.01), ICU admission (OR (95% CI): 3.47 (2.24-5.39), p-value&lt;0.01), and mortality by COVID-19) OR (95% CI): 1.52(1.27-1.82), pvalue&lt; 0.01). The present findings suggested that OUD is a major risk factor for mortality and the need for hospitalization and ICU admission in patients with COVID-19.

"Harmful by Design-a Qualitative Study of the Health Impacts of Immigration Detention","The USA has the largest immigration detention system in the world with over 20,000 individuals imprisoned by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) daily. Numerous reports have documented human rights abuses in immigration detention, yet little is known about its health impacts. To characterize how the US immigration detention system impacts health from the perspective of people who were recently detained by ICE. Qualitative study using anonymous, semi-structured phone interviews in English or Spanish conducted between July 2020 and February 2021. Adults who had been detained by ICE for at least 30 days in the New York City metropolitan area within the previous 2 years, and that were fluent in English and/or Spanish. We explored participants' health histories and experiences trying to meet physical and mental health needs while in detention and after release. We conducted a reflective thematic analysis using an inductive approach. Of 16 participants, 13 identified as male; five as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or queer; and four as Black; they were from nine countries. Participants had spent a median of 20 years living in the USA and spent a median of 11 months in immigration detention. Four themes emerged from our analysis: (1) poor conditions and inhumane treatment, (2) a pervasive sense of injustice, (3) structural barriers limiting access to care, and (4) negative health impacts of immigration detention. The narratives illustrate how structural features of immigration detention erode health while creating barriers to accessing needed medical care. Clinicians caring for immigrant communities must be cognizant of these health impacts. Community-based alternatives to immigration detention should be prioritized to mitigate health harms.","Diaz, Ortiz, Sanchez, Fernandez, Andrade, Akiyama, Ross","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-022-07914-6","20221130","COVID-19; detention; immigration; structural vulnerability","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-01","",41911,""

"Post-covid medical complaints following infection with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron vs Delta variants","The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant has been associated with less severe acute disease, however, concerns remain as to whether long-term complaints persist to a similar extent as for earlier variants. Studying 1 323 145 persons aged 18-70 years living in Norway with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection in a prospective cohort study, we found that individuals infected with Omicron had a similar risk of post-covid complaints (fatigue, cough, heart palpitations, shortness of breath and anxiety/depression) as individuals infected with Delta (B.1.617.2), from 14 to up to 126 days after testing positive, both in the acute (14 to 29 days), sub-acute (30 to 89 days) and chronic post-covid (&#x2265;90 days) phases. However, at &#x2265;90 days after testing positive, individuals infected with Omicron had a lower risk of having any complaint (43 (95%CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;14 to 72) fewer per 10,000), as well as a lower risk of musculoskeletal pain (23 (95%CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;2-43) fewer per 10,000) than individuals infected with Delta. Our findings suggest that the acute and sub-acute burden of post-covid complaints on health services is similar for Omicron and Delta. The chronic burden may be lower for Omicron vs Delta when considering musculoskeletal pain, but not when considering other typical post-covid complaints.","Magnusson, Kristoffersen, Dell'Isola, Kiadaliri, Turkiewicz, Runhaar, Bierma-Zeinstra, Englund, Magnus, Kinge","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-35240-2","20221130","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-01","",41913,""

Surveys were conducted across 128 schools in England with 107 headteachers and 2698 staff-members with reference to autumn term 2020, examining school-level implementation of preventive measures, adherence, and teacher burnout (response rates for headteacher and staff surveys were 84% and 59%, respectively). The median number of measures implemented in primary and secondary schools was 33 (range 23-41), and 32 (range 22-40), respectively; most measures presented challenges. No differences were found regarding number of measures implemented by school-level socio-economic disadvantage. High adherence was reported for staff wearing face-coverings, staff regularly washing their hands, (secondary only) desks facing forwards, and (primary only) increased cleaning of surfaces and student hand-washing. Adherence to most measures was reported as higher in primary than secondary schools. Over half of school leaders and 42% (517/1234) of other teaching staff suffered from high emotional exhaustion. Higher teacher-reported school-wide adherence with measures was consistently associated with lower burnout for leaders and other teaching staff. Findings indicate a tremendous effort in implementing preventive measures and an urgent need to support investments in improving teacher wellbeing.","Sundaram, Abramsky, Oswald, Cook, Halliday, Nguipdop-Djomo, Sturgess, Ireland, Ladhani, Mangtani, Langan, Hargreaves, Bonell","https://doi.org/10.1111/josh.13264","20221130","COVID-19; burnout; disease control; mental health; preventive measures; schools","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-01","",41914,""

"Experiences of medical and dental students of Pakistan during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown: a qualitative study","The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in medical institutes being shut down. Face-to-face activities were shifted to online medium. The unpredictability of the situation impacted medical faculty and students alike, creating panic and anxiety. Since these students are to take hold of the healthcare system of the country soon, it is important to learn their perspective on how COVID impacted them. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the lived experiences of Pakistani medical students in-depth by a qualitative observation of their personal and educational experiences. A phenomenological qualitative study interviewing medical students of Pakistan was conducted. This study was designed to interview medical and dental students from various cities in Pakistan using a semistructured, open-ended questionnaire. A total of 34 interviews were recorded and transcripts were prepared. All authors (SI, SS, IA and MS) were involved in the thematic analysis of the data, whereby transcripts were read thoroughly, and codes were developed. Similar codes were then combined to generate themes. Three major themes emerged after the analysis of results. The students' 'diverse experiences' of panic and anxiety or excitement were high initially but gradually reduced as time progressed. The 'unprecedented academic experiences' of students included teaching/learning, communication and technical challenges that they faced during online classes. Despite facing a lot of challenges, the students still saw 'light at the end of the tunnel' and looked forward to going back to their college. The effects of COVID on the physical, psychological, social and academic life of medical students were enormous. It is highly recommended that institutes and faculty provide support for personal and professional development of students in these unprecedented times in the form of counselling, provision of technical facilities or leniency in fee process. Peer support is also considered crucial in reducing anxiety among students.","Iftikhar, Saleem, Aziz, Sana","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-066442","20221130","COVID-19; education &amp; training (see medical education &amp; training); medical education &amp; training; mental health; quality in healthcare","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-01","",41916,""

"Loneliness and mood disorders: consequence, cause and/or unholy alliance?","People with persistent depressive disorders and with bipolar disorder are more likely to feel lonely than people in the general population. This evidence update focused on studies in the last 2 years, characterized by the COVID-19 pandemic and consequent social distancing directives. Longitudinal studies identified that people who feel lonely are more likely to become depressed or to experience relapse of mood disorders. There is emerging evidence that feelings of loneliness or mandatory social isolation can precede manic episodes. Hence the relationship between loneliness and mood disorders is complex and bidirectional. Interventions were developed to reduce loneliness in people with mental health problems, including depressive disorders, through cognitive modification and/or supported socialisation. No loneliness-focused interventions have been specifically tailored to people with bipolar disorder. Studies carried out before and during the COVID-19 pandemic found that feelings of loneliness can be both consequences and precursors of persistent depression and bipolar disorder. Mood symptoms and loneliness have a cumulative negative effect on physical and mental health outcomes. Conceptual overlaps and relations between loneliness and mood symptoms should be clarified in qualitative studies. Theory-driven intervention models should be developed and tested in methodologically robust studies.","Giacco","https://doi.org/10.1097/YCO.0000000000000832","20221201","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-01","",41918,""

"Positive mental health and mindfulness as protective factors against addictive social media use during the COVID-19 outbreak","The outbreak of COVID-19 caused high psychological burden for many people. Some people tend to excessive social media use (SMU) to escape the negative emotions which can foster addictive tendencies. The present study investigated positive mental health (PMH) and mindfulness as protective factors that could reduce the risk for addictive SMU. Data of 1,049 participants from Germany were assessed via online surveys in autumn 2021. The current results reveal a positive relationship between COVID-19 burden and addictive SMU. Both were negatively linked to PMH and mindfulness. In a moderated mediation analysis, the relationship between COVID-19 burden and addictive SMU was mediated by PMH. Mindfulness moderated the association between PMH and addictive SMU. The COVID-19 situation can be burdensome and contribute to dysfunctional coping strategies such as addictive SMU. However, PMH and mindfulness serve as protective factors. The protective effect of mindfulness could be especially important for persons with low PMH.","Brailovskaia, Margraf","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0277631","20221130","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-01","",41920,""
"Association Between College Course Delivery Model and Rates of Psychological Distress During the COVID-19 Pandemic","College students in the US have been heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to increased rates of depression and anxiety, college students have faced unprecedented stressors, such as geographic relocation and abrupt conversion from in-person classes to online classes. To study the association between course delivery model and psychological distress among US college students. This cross-sectional analysis used national data from the American College Health Association-National College Health Assessment III data set. Data were gathered from a web-based survey administered from January to early June 2021 to full-time US college students attending 4-year programs. Course delivery model was self-reported. Psychological distress was measured using the Kessler Screening Scale for Psychological Distress. This study evaluated 59&#x202f;250 full-time undergraduate students (68.1% women; 51.5% White students; mean [SD] age, 21.2 [4.3] years); 3.5% attended fully in-person classes, 61.2% attended fully online classes, and 35.3% attended a mixed format of in-person and online classes. Students who attended classes fully online reported higher levels of psychological distress than those who attended a mix of online and in-person classes (b&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.76 [99% CI, 0.64-0.88]; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001).

The findings of this study suggest that mental health professionals may wish to consider the association of course delivery models with mental health outcomes when working with college students. Colleges should be aware of the mental health burden associated with attending fully online classes and consider possible in-person components and supports for students.","ElTohamy, Wang, Chen, Stevens, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.44270","20221130","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-01","",41921,""
"Relationship between the spread of COVID-19, social frailty, and depressive symptoms in patients with heart failure","In community-dwelling older people, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been reported to be associated with the development of frailty and depressive symptoms. We aimed to investigate whether the spread of COVID-19 is associated with the development of frailty in patients with heart failure (HF). The presence of the multi-domain of frailty in 257 patients with HF was assessed at hospital discharge. The spread of COVID-19 was significantly associated with the development of social frailty and depressive symptoms. Evaluation of these symptoms during hospitalization would support disease management and understanding of their social and psychological conditions.","Shakuta, Yamashita, Kamiya, Hamazaki, Ueno, Nozaki, Uchida, Noda, Maekawa, Yamaoka-Tojo, Matsunaga, Ako","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00380-022-02203-y","20221130","Coronavirus disease 2019; Depressive symptoms; Heart failure; Social frailty","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-01","",41922,""
"What makes us more susceptible to false memories in the era of COVID-19? A focus on vaccines and Green Pass","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was accompanied by an overabundance of fake news increasing the risk of developing false memories (FMs). Previous studies have shown that the relationship between fake news and FMs could be mediated by some individual variables, including attitudinal biases. We explored the role of these variables in true memories (TMs) and FMs formation, with special emphasis on vaccine- and Green Pass (GP)-related topics. We set up a large online survey exploring several constructs including media usage, attitude toward vaccines and GP, perceived (PK) and objective knowledge (OK) about COVID-19-related information, fear of the disease, depression and anxiety symptoms, coping mechanisms, and reasoning skills. Then, we asked participants whether they remembered certain news (true or fake), providing confidence ratings. Data from 289 respondents (198 females) from the general population were analyzed. Participants with positive attitude reported a greater fear that their loved ones contracted the COVID-19, a more frequent use of traditional media, and a higher PK when compared with respondents with negative attitude. On the whole sample, participants reported higher confidence levels when required to judge their memory of true than fake news; however, participants with positive attitude reported a higher confidence for both true and fake news. The relationship between attitude and TM confidence was mediated by the PK, whereas the relationship between attitude and FM confidence was probably affected by OK. Attitude can modulate individual behaviors in the context of health issues. The PK and OK may interact with attitude in the memory formation.","Scuotto, Ilardi, Maggi, Ilardi, Gamboz, Staiano, Borrelli, La Marra, Perrella","https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.2815","20221130","COVID-19; attitude; fake news; false memories","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-01","",41923,""
"Demographic and Psychosocial Factors associated with Internet Addiction among the Pakistani Population during COVID-19: A Web-Based Survey","This study aims to determine the burden of COVID19-induced internet addiction and related psychosocial factors among the Pakistani sample. A web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted from January to March 2021. An analytical cross-sectional survey was broadcast on the internet via a Google form completed by 1145 Pakistanis. Individuals aged 13&#x2009;years and above with competency to comprehend English or Urdu language, currently residing in any province of Pakistan, having access to the questionnaire, and willing to participate were eligible to participate. Overseas Pakistanis were excluded from the study. The outcome is COVID19-induced internet addiction was measured using the validated tool Young's Internet Addiction Test (IAT). In addition, symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, and other psychosocial factors were assessed using the validated tool Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). Adjusted odds ratios with a 95% confidence interval were reported using multinomial logistic regression. Most participants were females and youth (between 20 and 24&#x2009;years). The prevalence of problematic internet users (PIU) and addictive internet users (AIU) was 27.3% and 11.3%, respectively. The odds of extremely severe anxiety among AIU were approximately three times (Adj OR: 2.6 (1.1-7.1), followed by the odds of having extremely severe stress being about five times higher among AIU (Adj OR: 5.4 (1.6-17.6)) as compared to normal internet users (NIU). Amid COVID-19, the burden of internet addiction has surged among the Pakistani populace. This study identified that gender, marital status, depression, stress, anxiety, work situation, and mood changes during the COVID-19 pandemic are significantly correlated with problematic and addictive internet use. Preventative measures against the addictive use of the internet are needed to avoid or mitigate any serious mental health problems.","Lakhdir, Hameed, Hasnani, Angez, Nawaz, Khan, Peerwani, Nathwani, Azam","https://doi.org/10.1177/00469580221138671","20221201","COVID-19; Internet; addiction; anxiety; depression; stress; survey; Female; Adolescent; Humans; Male; Internet Addiction Disorder; COVID-19; Pakistan; Cross-Sectional Studies; Pandemics; Internet; Surveys and Questionnaires; Demography","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-01","",41924,""
"Prevalence of enteric viruses in wastewater in Egypt after the COVID-19 pandemic","People's hygienic habits greatly affect the spreading rate of enteric viruses. After the COVID-19 pandemic, many people followed announced precautions and improved their hygienic status to protect themselves from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we studied if this indirectly affected the prevalence of enteric viruses in Egypt. A total of 21 samples (one sample per week) were collected from the Zenin wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) through the period between August 2021 and March 2022. Detection of adenovirus, hepatitis A virus (HAV), and rotavirus showed their presence in 66, 14.3, and 9.5% of the collected samples, respectively. Comparing those percentages to previously published data concerned with the detection of the same viruses from the same WWTP or others revealed a remarkable decrease in the prevalence of the three viruses after the COVID-19 pandemic. This allows the conclusion that safety precautions against SARS-CoV-2 lead indirectly to a reduction of adenovirus, HAV, and rotavirus prevalence rates.","Abd-Elshafy, Nadeem, Bahgat","https://doi.org/10.2166/wh.2022.223","20221201","Humans; Waste Water; COVID-19; Egypt; Prevalence; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Rotavirus; Adenoviridae","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-01","",41925,""

"Protocol for a Study on DÃ­a de los Muertos, Loss, Funerals, and Mental Health Among Mexican-Origin Adults in the United States","DÃ­a de los Muertos is a traditional celebration takes place early in November and is one of the most intricate death-related ritual in Mexican culture in which families welcome the return of their loved ones who died. Funerals are important rituals following the death of a person that provide the bereaved with an opportunity to say farewell to the departed in company of family, friends, and community. DÃ­a de los Muertos and funerals can help process grief and loss following the COVID-19 pandemic, a global event that disproportionally affected Mexican-origin adults in the U.S. Although research has shown the cultural importance of participating in DÃ­a de los Muertos and funerals, less is known about their connection to each other, as well as grief, mental health, and wellbeing among those who experienced loss during the pandemic. In this protocol, we describe the rationale for a cross-sectional survey, a study using a correlational design, and present the research questions, sample characteristics, procedure, instrument, and data analysis plan. In Study 1, we will investigate the association between DÃ­a de los Muertos participation and attitudes with levels of grief, mental health, and wellbeing among those who experienced loss during the pandemic. In Study 2, we will examine the association between funeral participation and attitudes with levels of grief, mental health, and wellbeing among those who experienced loss during the pandemic.","JosÃ© M.
