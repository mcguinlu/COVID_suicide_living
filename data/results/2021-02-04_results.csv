"Changes in Characteristics of Opioid Overdose Death Trends during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background and Aims: There are limited reports analyzing opioid overdose (OD) mortality data during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is also great heterogeneity in outcomes across states, necessitating assessments of the effects of COVID-19 on OD deaths on a state-by-state level. This report aims to analyze overall trends in OD deaths in Massachusetts during COVID-19. Design: Using individual-level death records in Massachusetts, we identified and analyzed OD mortality trends during the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to 2018 and 2019. We analyzed the period between March 24 (stay-at-home order in 2020) and August 11 (latest reliable data). We also estimated the correlation between OD deaths and COVID-19 case fatality rates at the county level. Setting: Massachusetts. Participants: A total of 2,342 OD deaths were analyzed. Measurements: The outcomes studied were OD deaths and COVID-19 case fatality rates. Findings: OD deaths involving cocaine and amphetamines increased from 2019 to 2020, by 20% (276 vs. 330; P<0.01) and 79% (33 vs. 59; P<0.01), respectively, but were steady from 2018 to 2019. Heroin's presence continued to decrease (238 in 2018, 161 in 2019, 102 in 2020; P<0.001); however, fentanyl was present in more than 90% of OD deaths, reflecting its continued domination of the illicit opioid supply in Massachusetts. Prescription opioid presence was stable. 79% of OD decedents were White and 6% were Black in 2019, as compared to 74% and 10% in 2020 (P=0.01). We found no significant correlation between COVID-19 case fatality and OD death rates. Conclusions: Increased deaths involving stimulants and alcohol reflect concerning trends in the era of COVID-19. Rising OD death rates among Black residents underscore that interventions focused on racial equity are necessary. Surveillance efforts must utilize up-to-date data to measure COVID-19 impacts on OD death and respond to imminent threats in real time.","Catherine DiGennaro; Gian-Gabriel Garcia; Erin Stringfellow; Sarah Wakeman; Mohammad S.

"Evaluation of Depression, Anxiety and Sleep Quality in the Brazilian Population During Social Isolation Due to the New Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic: the DEGAS-CoV Study","Introduction: The new coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has caused distress and repercussions in mental and physical health of individuals. Depression, anxiety and worsening of sleep quality have been reported in several recent articles that surveyed populations all over the globe. Our work meant to access, through a cross-sectional study, these disorders in the Brazilian population, through the application of an online questionnaire conducted on the second trimester of 2020. Materials and Methods: We applied an online questionnaire, filled with questions regarding social, economic, financial, educational and health status, as well as questions from the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD), and from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Results: We collected 2,695 valid answers, from April 24th to May 31st, 2020. Age ranged from 18 to 79 years, mean of 31.3. Women were 76.3%, men 23.7%. Symptoms of Anxiety were found in 56.5%, of depression in 46.1%, and of bad sleep in 49.2%. Some groups were more prone than others to one or more of those conditions, such as: younger people, women, mestizos, Northeasterners, people with lesser years of education, of lower income or whose income dropped significantly during the pandemic, caregivers, students, sedentary or people practicing less physical activity, people who followed more hours of news of COVID-19 and those less engaged in social and instrumental activities. Conclusion: anxiety, depression and bad sleep quality were significantly high in our survey. Mental and sleep health is heterogeneously affected among individuals, depending on social, economic, financial, educational and health status.","Paulo Afonso Mei; Amanda Sasse; Ana Lara Navarrete Fernandez; Barbara Neiva Perri; Breno Alexander Bispo; Giselly Brito Santana; Gabriela Sakita Munhos; Giovanni Giuliani Verghetti; Guilherme Barbosa de Almeida Oliveira Martins; Jennifer Pereira da Rocha; Jessyca Rosa Lopes Mendonca; Julia Patel Lebl; Valdemiro Da Rolt Jr; Lais Grabner Ruivo; Laura Loeb; Marielly Isepon; Marina Joseane Pachecco; Cintia Zonta Baptista; Fabio Soares Nespoli; Paloma Ricciardi de Castro; Paola Ricciardi de Castro; Rafaela Dotta Brustolin; Taysa Maria Pimentel Goncalves Gomes Silva; Victoria Gomes Andreata; Amilton Santos Jr; Tania Marchiori de Oliveira Cardoso","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250825","20210203","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-04","",10224,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on anxiety and depression symptoms of young people in the Global South: evidence from a four-country cohort study","ABSTRACT Objective To provide evidence on the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of adolescents and young adults who grew up in poverty in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs). Design A phone survey implemented August-October 2020 to participants of a population-based cohort study since 2002 comprising two cohorts born in 1994-5 and 2001-2 in Ethiopia, India (Andhra Pradesh and Telangana), Peru and Vietnam. We examined associations between mental health and pandemic-related stressors, as well as structural factors (gender, location, wealth); and lifelong protective/risk factors (parent and peer relationship, past household wealth, long-term health problems, past emotional problems and subjective well-being) measured at younger ages. Setting A diverse, poverty focused sample, reaching those without mobile phones or internet access. Participants 10,496 individuals were approached, 9,730 participated. Overall, 8,988 individuals were included in this study, 4,610 (51%) male and 4,378 (49%) female. Non-inclusion was due to non-location or missing data. Main outcome measures At least mild anxiety and depression were measured by Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7, [&ge;]5) and Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8, [&ge;]5). Results Rates of symptoms of at least mild anxiety (depression) were highest in Peru at 41% (32%) [95% CI, 38.63-43.12; (29.49-33.74)], and lowest in Vietnam at 9% (9%) [95% CI, 8.16- 10.58; (8.33- 10.77)], mirroring COVID-19 mortality rates. Females were most affected in all countries but Ethiopia. In all countries, pandemic-related stressors were associated with increased rates of anxiety and depression, though with varying levels of importance across countries. Prior parent and peer relationships were protective factors for mental health while having a long-term health problem or prior emotional problems were risk factors. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic presents significant risks to the mental health of young people. Mental health support is limited in LMICs and young people have to date been lower priority for COVID-19 interventions.","Catherine Porter; Marta Favara; Annina Hittmeyer; Douglas Scott; Alan Sanchez Jimenez; Revathi Ellanki; Tassew Woldehanna; Le Thuc Duc; Michelle G Craske; Alan Stein","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250897","20210203","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-04","",10225,""
"Impact of social restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical activity levels of older adults: an analysis of the CHARIOT COVID-19 Rapid Response Study","Objectives: Physical inactivity is more common in older adults, is associated with social isolation and loneliness, and contributes to increased morbidity and mortality. We examined the effect of social restrictions, implemented to reduce transmission of COVID-19 in the UK (lockdown), on physical activity (PA) levels of older adults, and the demographic, lifestyle and social predictors of this change. Design: Baseline analysis of a survey-based prospective cohort study Setting: Adults enrolled in the Cognitive Health in Ageing Register for Investigational and Observational Trials (CHARIOT) cohort from GP practices in North West London were invited to participate from April to July 2020. Participants: 6,219 cognitively healthy adults aged 50 to 92 years completed the survey. Main outcome measures: Self-reported PA before and after lockdown, as measured by Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) minutes. Associations of PA with demographic, lifestyle and social factors, mood and frailty. Results: Mean PA was significantly lower following lockdown, from 3,519 MET minutes/week to 3,185 MET minutes/week (p<0.001). After adjustment for confounders and pre-lockdown PA, lower levels of PA after lockdown were found in those who were over 85 years old (640 [95% CI: 246 to 1034] MET minutes/week less); were divorced or single (240 [95% CI: 120 to 360] MET minutes/week less); living alone (277 [95% CI: 152 to 402] MET minutes/week less); reported feeling lonely often (306 [95% CI: 60 to 552] MET minutes/week less); and showed symptoms of depression (1007 [95% CI: 1401 to 612] MET minutes/week less) compared to those aged 50-64 years, married, co-habiting, and not reporting loneliness or depression, respectively. Conclusions and Implications: Markers of social isolation, loneliness and depression were associated with lower PA following lockdown in the UK. Interventions to improve PA in older adults should take account of social and community factors, and targeted strategies to increase physical activity in socially isolated, lonely and depressed older adults should be considered.","David Salman; Thomas Beaney; Catherine Robb; Celeste A. de Jager Loots; Parthenia Giannakopoulou; Chi Udeh-Momoh; Sara Ahmadi-Abhari; Azeem Majeed; Lefkos T Middleton; Alison H McGregor","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.26.21250520","20210126","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-04","",10226,""

"The role of faecal microbiota transplantation: looking beyond Clostridioides difficile infection","Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is the transfer of screened and minimally processed faecal material from a â€˜healthyâ€™ donor to â€˜diseasedâ€™ recipient  It has an established role, and is recommended as a therapeutic strategy, in the management of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI)  Recognition that gut dysbiosis is associated with, and may contribute to, numerous disease states has led to interest in exploiting FMT to â€˜correctâ€™ this microbial imbalance  Conditions for which it is proposed to be beneficial include inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, liver disease and hepatic encephalopathy, neuropsychiatric conditions such as depression and anxiety, systemic inflammatory states like sepsis, and even coronavirus disease 2019  To understand what role, if any, FMT may play in the management of these conditions, it is important to consider the potential risks and benefits of the therapy  Regardless, there are several barriers to its more widespread adoption, which include incompletely understood mechanism of action (especially outside of CDI), inability to standardise treatment, disagreement on its active ingredients and how it should be regulated, and lack of long-term outcome and safety data  Whilst the transfer of faecal material from one individual to another to treat ailments or improve health has a history dating back thousands of years, there are fewer than 10 randomised controlled trials supporting its use  Moving forward, it will be imperative to gather as much data from FMT donors and recipients over as long a timeframe as possible, and for trials to be conducted with rigorous methodology, including appropriate control groups, in order to best understand the utility of FMT for indications beyond CDI  This review discusses the history of FMT, its appreciable mechanisms of action with reference to CDI, indications for FMT with an emerging evidence base above and beyond CDI, and future perspectives on the field  Â© The Author(s), 2021","D.

"Sleep and mental health in athletes during COVID-19 lockdown","The global coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) pandemic and associated lockdown restrictions resulted in the majority of sports competitions around the world being put on hold. This includes the National Basketball Association, the UEFA Champions League, Australian Football League, the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, and regional competitions. The mitigation strategies in place to control the pandemic have caused disruption to daily schedules, working environments, and lifestyle factors. Athletes rely on regular access to training facilities, practitioners, and coaches to maintain physical and mental health to achieve maximal performance and optimal recovery. Furthermore, participation in sport at any level increases social engagement and promotes better mental health. It is, therefore, critical to understanding how the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown measures have affected the lives of athletes. We surveyed elite and sub-elite athletes (n = 565) across multiple sports. Significant disruptions were reported for all lifestyle factors including social interactions, physical activity, sleep patterns, and mental health. We found a significant increase in total sleep time and sleep latency, as well as a delay in mid-sleep times and a decrease in social jetlag. Training frequency and duration significantly decreased. Importantly, the changes to training and sleep-related factors were associated with mental health outcomes. With spikes in COVID-19 cases rising around the world and governments reinstituting lockdowns (e.g. United Kingdom; Melbourne, Australia; California, USA) these results will inform messaging and strategies to better manage sleep and mental health in a population for whom optimal performance is critical.","Facer-Childs, Hoffman, Tran, Drummond, Rajaratnam","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsaa261","20210203","COVID-19; athletes; chronotype; elite; exercise; lockdown; mental health; pandemic; sleep; sports psychology; training","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-04","",10262,""
"Exploratory study on the psychological impact of COVID-19 on the general Brazilian population","The COVID-19 pandemic has become one of the main international concerns regarding its impact on mental health. The present study aims to investigate the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms, and behavioral aspects amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in a Brazilian population. An online survey was administered from May 22 to June 5, 2020 using a questionnaire comprising of sociodemographic information, the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), and the Coping Strategies Inventory. Participants comprised 3,000 people from Brazil's 26 states and the Federal District, with an average age of 39.8 years, women (83%), married (50.6%), graduates (70.1%) and employees (46.7%). Some contracted the virus (6.4%) and had dead friends or relatives (22.7%). There was more consumption of drugs, tobacco, medication, and food (40.8%). Almost half of participants expressed symptoms of depression (46.4%), anxiety (39.7%), and stress (42.2%). These were higher in women, people without children, students, patients with chronic diseases, and people who had contact with others diagnosed with COVID-19. The existence of a group more vulnerable to situations with a high stress burden requires greater attention regarding mental health during and after the pandemic. That said, it should be emphasized that these findings are preliminary and portray a moment still being faced by many people amid the pandemic and quarantine measures. Therefore, we understand that the magnitude of the impacts on mental health will only be more specific with continuous studies after total relaxation of the quarantine.","Serafim, DurÃƒÂ£es, Rocca, GonÃƒÂ§alves, Saffi, Cappellozza, Paulino, Dumas-Diniz, Brissos, Brites, Alho, Lotufo-Neto","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245868","20210203","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-04","",10263,""
"Mental health and psychosocial support strategies in highly contagious emerging disease outbreaks of substantial public concern: A systematic scoping review","Acute disease outbreaks such as the COVID-19 pandemic cause a high burden of psychological distress in people worldwide. Interventions to enable people to better cope with such distress should be based on the best available evidence. We therefore performed a scoping review to systematically identify and summarize the available literature of interventions that target the distress of people in the face of highly contagious disease outbreaks. MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science (January 2000 to May 7, 2020), and reference lists were systematically searched and screened by two independent reviewers. Quantitative and qualitative studies investigating the effects of psychological interventions before, during, and after outbreaks of highly contagious emerging infectious diseases, such as SARS, MERS, Ebola, or COVID-19 were included. Study effects were grouped (e.g. for healthcare professionals, community members, people at risk) and intervention contents at the individual and organizational level summarized. We assessed the level of evidence using a modified scheme from the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine and the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council. Of 4030 records found, 19 studies were included (two RCTs). Most interventions were delivered during-exposure and face-to-face, focused on healthcare workers and crisis personnel, and combined psychoeducation with training of coping strategies. Based on two high-quality studies, beneficial effects were reported for resilience factors (e.g. positive cognitive appraisal) and professional attitudes of healthcare workers, with mixed findings for mental health (e.g. depression). Across all studies, there was positive qualitative feedback from participants and facilitators. We identified seven ongoing studies mostly using online- and mobile-based deliveries. There is preliminary evidence for beneficial effects of interventions to enable people to better cope with the distress of highly contagious emerging disease outbreaks. Besides the need for more high-quality studies, the summarized evidence may inform decision makers to plan interventions during the current pandemic and to develop pandemic preparedness plans.","Kunzler, Stoffers-Winterling, Stoll, Mancini, Lehmann, Blessin, Gilan, Helmreich, Hufert, Lieb","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244748","20210203","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-04","",10264,""
"Repurposing of Tetracyclines for COVID-19 Neurological and Neuropsychiatric Manifestations: A Valid Option to Control SARS-CoV-2-Associated Neuroinflammation?","The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has gained considerable attention worldwide due to its increased potential to spread and infect the general population. COVID-19 primarily targets the human respiratory epithelium but also has neuro-invasive potential. Indeed, neuropsychiatric manifestations, such as fatigue, febrile seizures, psychiatric symptoms, and delirium, are consistently observed in COVID-19. The neurobiological basis of neuropsychiatric COVID-19 symptoms is not fully understood. However, previous evidence about systemic viral infections pointed to an ongoing neuroinflammatory response to viral antigens and proinflammatory mediators/immune cells from the periphery. Microglia cells mediate the overproduction of inflammatory cytokines, free radicals, and damage signals, culminating with neurotoxic consequences. Semi-synthetic second-generation tetracyclines, including minocycline (MINO) and doxycycline (DOXY), are safe bacteriostatic agents that have remarkable neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties. Promising results have been obtained in clinical trials using tetracyclines for major psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and major depression. Tetracyclines can inhibit microglial reactivity and neuroinflammation by inhibiting nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) signaling, cyclooxygenase 2, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). This drug class also has a broad profile of activity against bacteria associated with community-based pneumonia, including atypical agents. COVID-19 patients are susceptible to secondary bacterial infections, especially those on invasive ventilation. Therefore, we suggest tetracyclines' repurposing as a potential treatment for COVID-19 neuropsychiatric manifestations. These drugs can represent a valuable multi-modal treatment for COVID-19-associated neuroinflammatory alterations based on their broad antimicrobial profile and neuroinflammation control.","Chaves Filho, GonÃƒÂ§alves, Mottin, Andrade, Fonseca, Macedo","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11481-021-09986-3","20210203","COVID-19; Doxycycline; Drug repurposing; Minocycline; Neuroinflammation; SARS-CoV-2 infection","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-04","",10265,""
"Trends in US Emergency Department Visits for Mental Health, Overdose, and Violence Outcomes Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, associated mitigation measures, and social and economic impacts may affect mental health, suicidal behavior, substance use, and violence. To examine changes in US emergency department (ED) visits for mental health conditions (MHCs), suicide attempts (SAs), overdose (OD), and violence outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional study used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Syndromic Surveillance Program to examine national changes in ED visits for MHCs, SAs, ODs, and violence from December 30, 2018, to October 10, 2020 (before and during the COVID-19 pandemic). The National Syndromic Surveillance Program captures approximately 70% of US ED visits from more than 3500 EDs that cover 48 states and Washington, DC. Outcome measures were MHCs, SAs, all drug ODs, opioid ODs, intimate partner violence (IPV), and suspected child abuse and neglect (SCAN) ED visit counts and rates. Weekly ED visit counts and rates were computed overall and stratified by sex. From December 30, 2018, to October 10, 2020, a total of 187Ã¢â‚¬Â¯508Ã¢â‚¬Â¯065 total ED visits (53.6% female and 46.1% male) were captured; 6Ã¢â‚¬Â¯018Ã¢â‚¬Â¯318 included at least 1 study outcome (visits not mutually exclusive). Total ED visit volume decreased after COVID-19 mitigation measures were implemented in the US beginning on March 16, 2020. Weekly ED visit counts for all 6 outcomes decreased between March 8 and 28, 2020 (March 8: MHCsÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°42Ã¢â‚¬Â¯903, SAsÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5212, all ODsÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°14Ã¢â‚¬Â¯543, opioid ODsÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4752, IPVÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°444, and SCANÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1090; March 28: MHCsÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°17Ã¢â‚¬Â¯574, SAsÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4241, all ODsÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°12Ã¢â‚¬Â¯399, opioid ODsÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4306, IPVÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°347, and SCANÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°487). Conversely, ED visit rates increased beginning the week of March 22 to 28, 2020. When the median ED visit counts between March 15 and October 10, 2020, were compared with the same period in 2019, the 2020 counts were significantly higher for SAs (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4940 vs 4656, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.02), all ODs (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°15Ã¢â‚¬Â¯604 vs 13Ã¢â‚¬Â¯371, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), and opioid ODs (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5502 vs 4168, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001); counts were significantly lower for IPV ED visits (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°442 vs 484, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and SCAN ED visits (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°884 vs 1038, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). Median rates during the same period were significantly higher in 2020 compared with 2019 for all outcomes except IPV.

"Dental personnel in Israel, Canada, and France during the COVID-19 pandemic: attitudes, worries, emotional responses, and posttraumatic growth","The spread of COVID-19 has posed significant challenges for dental professionals worldwide. The aims of the present study were twofold: (i) to study the attitudes, emotional responses, and worries among the dental personnel; and (ii) to look for the ability of dental personnel to experience posttraumatic self-growth as a result of the distress caused by the pandemic. A cross-sectional online survey using an anonymous questionnaire was performed simultaneously in Israel, Canada, and France during the initial lockdown period. Israeli dental practitioners were less worried about their physical health, mental health, or relationships with family and friends than their Canadian and French counterparts. The Canadian dental practitioners were most committed and most willing to treat their patients, as well as most concerned about not being able to treat patients in the same personal way as before the lockdown. French dental practitioners showed the highest level of fear to treat patients. There were no differences in dental practitioners' levels of anxiety, depression, or posttraumatic growth among the countries. Dental practitioners' posttraumatic growth was significantly associated with worries regarding their physical health. Responses of dental personnel to the COVID-19 pandemic varied worldwide. Despite the differences, evidence exists that some of the dental practitioners' worries and concerns are associated with psychologic growth as a result of the pandemic. Better understanding and acknowledgment of dental personnel's worries and concerns can facilitate growth and enable positive functioning under the continuous situation of uncertainty.","Uziel, Gilon, Meyerson, Levin, Khehra, Emodi-Perlman, Eli","https://doi.org/10.3290/j.qi.b936999","20210203","COVID-19; dental; pandemic; posttraumatic growth; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-04","",10268,""

Comparisons of distance of droplet and bone dust contamination and surgeon contamination were made under differing conditions. Irrigation speed, use of microscope and drill burr size and type were compared. Measurement of the distance of field contamination whilst performing simulated mastoidectomy and location of surgeon contamination. There was a greater distance field contamination and surgeon contamination without the use of the microscope. Contamination was reduced by using a smaller drill burr and by using a diamond burr when compared to a cutting burr. The use of goggles and a face mask provided good protection for the surgeon however the microscope alone may provide sufficient protection to negate the need for goggles. While the risks of performing mastoid surgery during the coronavirus pandemic cannot be completely removed, they can be mitigated. Such factors include using the microscope for all drilling, using smaller size drill burrs and creating a safe zone around the operating table.","Markey, Leong, Vaughan","https://doi.org/10.1111/coa.13725","20210203","COVID-19; Mastoidectomy; PPE; aerosol generating procedure; droplet contamination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-04","",10269,""
"Psychological impact and social support in pregnant women during lockdown due to SARS-CoV2 pandemic: A cohort study","Anxiety and depression during pregnancy can lead to adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. The SARS CoV-2 pandemic, and the complete lockdown required during the first wave in most countries are stressors for pregnant women and can lead to anxiety and depression during pregnancy. The aim of this study was to explore depression and anxiety symptoms, and social support in pregnant women during the SARS CoV-2 lockdown, as well as to explore demographic risk factors. A prospective cohort study was performed at Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, including pregnant women attending the antenatal clinic during the SARS-CoV2 lockdown period. Three questionnaires were administered to study depression (EPDS), anxiety (STAI) and Social Support (MOS-SSS). STAI state (STAIs) described the actual state of anxiety and the STAI trait (STAIt) described the trait of anxiety. A cut-off of 10 for EPDS and 40 for STAI was considered to be clinically relevant. The main outcome measures were depression and anxiety symptoms. A total of 217 women were invited to participate, and 204 accepted (94%). From these, 164 filled in the EPDS, 109 STAI and 159 MOS-SSS questionnaires: 37.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 30.5%-45.7%) (62/164) of women showed an EPDS result Ã¢â€°Â¥10, 59.6% (95% CI 49.8%-68.8%) (65/109) a STAI state (STAIs) Ã¢â€°Â¥40, and 58.7% (95% CI 48.9%-67.9%) (64/109) a STAI trait (STAIt) Ã¢â€°Â¥40. Regression analysis showed that mental health disorder, Latin American origin and lack of social support were independent risk factors for anxiety symptoms in the STAIs (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .032, PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .040 and PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .029, respectively).

"Covid-19 Conspiracy Beliefs And Containment-Related Behaviour: The Role Of Political Trust","The roles of conspiracy beliefs and political trust for public health behaviour have seldomly been studied prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we tested whether conspiracy beliefs affect containment-related behaviour in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic and whether this relationship is mediated by political trust, preference for saving the economy or for saving lives. The data were collected at two time points, at the beginning of the epidemic and after the state of emergency was introduced. The sample consisted of 790 adults from Serbia (349 at time 1 and 441 at time 2), of which around 60% were female, with a mean age of around 33. The results indicate that holding more conspiracy beliefs is related to less adherence to containment-related behaviour, both directly and indirectly, via decreased political trust. Preference for saving lives has a direct effect on containment-related behaviour, while preference for saving economy plays no important role in this relationship, although it has a negative zero-order association with containment-related behaviour. The findings are interpreted in light of the importance of governmental pandemic management for containing, i.e. preventing the spread of infectious diseases.","KariÃ„â€¡, MeÃ„â€˜edoviÃ„â€¡","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.110697","20210203","COVID-19; conspiracy beliefs; containment-related behaviour; pandemic; political trust","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-04","",10275,""

"Viral time capsule: a global photo-elicitation study of child and adolescent mental health professionals during COVID-19","To examine, through photo-elicitation, the personal and professional impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health professionals working with children and adolescents around the globe. We invited the submission of images collected about the pandemic between May and August 2020. We encouraged participants to yoke personal reflections or voice memos to their images. Using snowball sampling, we began with two invitations, including one to the graduates of a mentorship program continuously hosted since 2004 by the International Association of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Allied Professions (IACAPAP). We analyzed de-identified images and anonymized transcripts through iterative coding using thematic analysis informed by rich picture analysis and aided by NVivo software. We collected submissions from child and adolescent mental health professionals (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°134) working in 54 countries spread across the five continents. We identified four overarching domains with component themes that revealed both the commonality and the uniqueness of the pandemic experience around the globe: (1) Place (adjusting to emptiness and stillness; shifting timeframes; blending of spaces); (2) Person (disruption to life rhythms; emotional toll; positives of the pandemic); (3) Profession (changing practices; outreach efforts; guild pride-and guilt); and (4) Purpose (from pandemic to syndemic; from lamenting to embracing; planning toward a better tomorrow). Photo-elicitation provided a disarming and efficient means to learn about individual, regional, and global similarities and differences regarding the professionals charged with addressing the mental health needs of children and adolescents around the globe. These findings may help inform practice changes in post-pandemic times.","Herrington, Clayton, Benoit, Prins-Aardema, DiGiovanni, Weller, Martin","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13034-021-00359-5","20210203","COVID-19 pandemic; Mental health professionals; Photo-elicitation; Professional identity; Qualitative methods; Rich picture analysis; Thematic analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-04","",10277,""
"Validation of the Brazilian Portuguese version of the Obsession with COVID-19 Scale (BP-OCS) using a large University Sample in Brazil","We aimed to validate a Brazilian Portuguese version of the Obsession with COVID-19 Scale (BP-OCS) using a large sample of university students in Brazil (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1454). The scale showed solid psychometric characteristics in terms of internal consistency (<i>ÃŽÂ±</i> = .78), test-retest reliability (ICC = .86), factorial validity (PAF and CFA support), and construct validity. Additionally, BP-OCS scores were found to be higher among females, participants with diagnosed depression, anxiety, and self-reported anxiety. These findings suggest that the BP-OCS is a reliable and valid measure of persistent and disturbed thinking about COVID-19 for Brazilian university students.","Andrade, Pereira, Orlando, Peixoto, Lee, Castelo","https://doi.org/10.1080/07481187.2021.1879319","20210203","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-04","",10278,""
"Brazilian Adaptation of the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale: A Psychometric Investigation of a Measure of Coronaphobia","This study examined the psychometric properties of a Brazilian adapted version of the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS-BR) in a sample of adults in Brazil. Confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated that the CAS-BR produces a reliable (ÃŽÂ±Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.84), unidimensional construct whose structure was shown to be invariant across gender, race, and age. However, some items of the CAS-BR were stronger indicators of the coronavirus anxiety construct for women and younger adults. Although the CAS-BR demonstrated evidence of discrimination ability for functional impairment (AUCÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.77), Youden indexes were low to identify a clinical cut-score. Construct validity was demonstrated with correlations between CAS-BR scores and measures of functional impairment, generalized anxiety, and depression. Exploratory analyses revealed that CAS-BR total scores were higher among women and participants with a history of anxiety disorder. These findings are consistent with previous investigations and support the validity of CAS-BR for measuring coronavirus anxiety with Brazilian adults.","Padovan-Neto, Lee, GuimarÃƒÂ£es, Godoy, Costa, Zerbini, Fukusima","https://doi.org/10.1177/0030222821991325","20210203","Brazil; COVID-19; anxiety; coronaphobia; coronavirus","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-04","",10279,""
"Mental Health and Psychosocial Characteristics Associated With COVID-19 Among US Adults","This study examined psychosocial and mental health characteristics associated with COVID-19 infection. An online survey that asked about COVID-19 status, social support, and mental health was used to recruit a national sample of 6,607 low- and middle-income adults; 354 reported a positive COVID-19 test, 1,819 reported a negative test, and 4,434 reported not being tested in May or June 2020. Psychiatric history and current social support and mental health were not statistically significantly associated with testing positive for COVID-19 after analyses controlled for other characteristics. In order of magnitude, having any friends or family who had COVID-19, being a veteran, having a greater number of close friends or relatives, having any history of homelessness, having an advanced degree, or being a student was significantly associated with testing positive for COVID-19. Clinical risk for COVID-19 infection and the medical needs of veterans and of unstably housed populations should be considered.","Tsai, Huang, Elbogen","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202000540","20210203","COVID-19 pandemic; Homelessness; Mental health; Veteran","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-04","",10280,""
