"Assessment of level of depression and associated factors among COVID-19 recovered patients: a cross sectional study","Objectives: The Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has psychological consequences such as increased risk of depression, anxiety, and stress problems, exacerbating human health disparities. This study aimed to analyze depression and its causes in COVID-19-recovered patients in Bangladesh. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted on COVID-19 recovered patients, who attended for follow-up after 14 days to 3 months at Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) and Dhaka North City Corporation Hospital (DNCCH), Dhaka, Bangladesh from 1st January to 31st December, 2021. Respondents were face-to-face interviewed with a semi-structured questionnaire after written agreement. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to assess respondents' depression, and data were analyzed using SPSS version-23, with p < 0.05 indicating statistical significance. Results: A total of 325 COVID-19 recovered patients aged from 15 to 65 years (mean 44.34 {+/-}13.87 years) of age were included in this study, highest 23.1% of them belonged to 46-55 years, and majority (61.5%) of them were male. There were 69.5% of respondents had no signs of depression while 31% of them had with 26.7% being mildly depressed, 2.5% being extremely depressed, and 1.2% being severely depressed. Diabetes mellitus, hospitalization duration, social distancing, the social media post on COVID-19, loss of employment, family damage, and fear of re-infection were significantly associated with depression level of respondents. Conclusion: This study gives us a glimpse into the psychological health of COVID-19 recovered patients, and its findings highlight the imperative of alleviating their psychological anguish in Bangladesh.","Mst.Khadeza Khatun; Nasreen Farhana","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.11.14.22282128","20221115","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-16","",41144,""
"The impact of COVID-19 on children and adolescents' mental health","Children and adolescents are more susceptible to the formation of mental health issues, since their brains are still developing. The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic response measures have disrupted daily life and left individuals socially isolated, including children and adolescents. In view of this, this study aimed to give a narrative review of the literature on the pandemic's effects on children's and adolescents' mental health, associated risks, and successful intervention strategies. There are still issues to be resolved to give children and adolescents in many regions of the world with quality, rights-based, and culturally relevant mental health care. It is difficult to predict how the COVID-19 pandemic may affect children's and adolescents' mental health in the short- and long-term. To address the mental and social health needs of children and adolescents after the pandemic, it is urgently necessary to perform longitudinal and developmental studies and introduce evidence-centered action plans and interventions.","Hafiz, Aljadani","https://doi.org/10.15537/smj.2022.43.11.20220481","20221115","COVID-19; adolescents; children; interventions; mental health; psychological impact","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-16","",41145,""
"Mental health indicators in Sweden over a 12-month period during the COVID-19 pandemic - Baseline data of the Omtanke2020 Study","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the lives of people globally and is expected to have profound effects on mental health. Here we aim to describe the mental health burden experienced in Sweden using baseline data of the Omtanke2020 Study. We analysed self-reported, cross-sectional baseline data collected over a 12-month period (June 9, 2020-June 8, 2021) from the Omtanke2020 Study including 27,950 adults in Sweden. Participants were volunteers or actively recruited through existing cohorts and, after providing informed consent, responded to online questionnaires on socio-demographics, mental and physical health, as well as COVID-19 infection and impact. Poisson regression was fitted to assess the relative risk of demonstrating high level symptoms of depression, anxiety, and COVID-19 related distress. The proportion of persons with high level of symptoms was 15.6Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%, 9.5Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% and 24.5Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% for depression, anxiety, and COVID-19 specific post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), respectively. Overall, 43.4Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% of the participants had significant, clinically relevant symptoms for at least one of the three mental health outcomes and 7.3Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% had significant symptoms for all three outcomes. We also observed differences in the prevalence of these outcomes across strata of sex, age, recruitment type, COVID-19 status, region, and seasonality. While the proportion of persons with high mental health burden remains higher than the ones reported in pre-pandemic publications, our estimates are lower than previously reported levels of depression, anxiety, and PTSD during the pandemic in Sweden and elsewhere.","Lovik, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-HijÃƒÂ³n, KÃƒÂ¤hler, ValdimarsdÃƒÂ³ttir, Frans, Magnusson, Pedersen, Hall, Czene, Sullivan, Fang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.11.004","20221115","Anxiety symptoms; COVID-19; Depressive symptoms; General population; Mental health; Omtanke2020 Study; Stress; Sweden","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-16","",41146,""
"Cascading disasters and mental health inequities: Winter Storm Uri, COVID-19 and post-traumatic stress in Texas","Previous research on health effects of extreme weather has emphasized heat events even though cold-attributable mortality exceeds heat-attributable mortality worldwide. Little is known about the mental health effects of cold weather events, which often cascade to produce secondary impacts like power outages, leaving a knowledge gap in context of a changing climate. We address that gap by taking a novel ""cascading disaster health inequities"" approach to examine winter storm-associated post-traumatic stress (PTS) using survey data (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 790) collected in eight Texas metro areas following Winter Storm Uri in 2021, which occurred against the backdrop of COVID-19. The incidence of storm-related PTS was 18%. Being Black (odds ratio [OR]: 6.6), Hispanic (OR: 3.5), or of another non-White race (OR: 4.2) was associated with greater odds of PTS compared to being White, which indicates substantial racial/ethnic inequities in mental health impacts (all pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05). Having a disability also increased odds of PTS (OR: 4.4) (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05). Having piped water outages (OR: 1.9) and being highly impacted by COVID-19 (OR: 3.3) increased odds of PTS (both pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05). When modelling how COVID-19 and outages cascaded, we compared householders to those with no outages and low COVID-19 impacts. PTS was more likely (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05) if householders had a water or power outage and high COVID-19 impacts (OR: 4.4) and if they had water and power outages and high COVID-19 impacts (OR: 7.7). Findings provide novel evidence of racial/ethnic inequities and cascading effects with regard to extreme cold events amid the COVID-19 pandemic.","Grineski, Collins, Chakraborty","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.115523","20221115","Cascading disasters; Extreme weather events; Health inequities; Post-traumatic stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-16","",41147,""
"Low-dose naltrexone reduced anxiety in persons with multiple sclerosis during the COVID-19 pandemic","Persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) have been considered at high risk for vaccination and/or acquisition of COVID-19 related to their reduced immune systems and daily regimen of immune suppressing therapy. Substantiated and unsubstantiated reports on these unknown circumstances increased anxiety and depression. Low-dose naltrexone (LDN) is a potentially effective off-label therapy shown to be effective at controlling fatigue for several autoimmune disorders including MS. This study utilized a small population of PwMS from central Pennsylvania in order to determine whether LDN therapy altered their perceived anxiety or depression during the early months of COVID-19. Utilizing mailed surveys, self-reported anxiety and depression scores were found to be significantly lower for PwMS who were prescribed LDN either alone or as an adjuvant to a standard disease modifying therapy (DMT) in comparison to those on oral disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). The data suggest that the non-toxic, inexpensive biotherapeutic may be beneficial in lessening anxiety.","McLaughlin, Odom, Arnett, Orehek, Thomas, Zagon","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2022.109438","20221115","Anxiety; Depression; Disease-modifying therapy; Low dose naltrexone; Multiple sclerosis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-16","",41148,""
"Life stressors significantly impact long-term outcomes and post-acute symptoms 12-months after COVID-19 hospitalization","Limited data exists evaluating predictors of long-term outcomes after hospitalization for COVID-19. We conducted a prospective, longitudinal cohort study of patients hospitalized for COVID-19. The following outcomes were collected at 6 and 12-months post-diagnosis: disability using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), activities of daily living assessed with the Barthel Index, cognition assessed with the telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment (t-MoCA), Neuro-QoL batteries for anxiety, depression, fatigue and sleep, and post-acute symptoms of COVID-19. Predictors of these outcomes, including demographics, pre-COVID-19 comorbidities, index COVID-19 hospitalization metrics, and life stressors, were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression. Of 790 COVID-19 patients who survived hospitalization, 451(57%) completed 6-month (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 383) and/or 12-month (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 242) follow-up, and 77/451 (17%) died between discharge and 12-month follow-up. Significant life stressors were reported in 121/239 (51%) at 12-months. In multivariable analyses, life stressors including financial insecurity, food insecurity, death of a close contact and new disability were the strongest independent predictors of worse mRS, Barthel Index, depression, fatigue, and sleep scores, and prolonged symptoms, with adjusted odds ratios ranging from 2.5 to 20.8. Other predictors of poor outcome included older age (associated with worse mRS, Barthel, t-MoCA, depression scores), baseline disability (associated with worse mRS, fatigue, Barthel scores), female sex (associated with worse Barthel, anxiety scores) and index COVID-19 severity (associated with worse Barthel index, prolonged symptoms). Life stressors contribute substantially to worse functional, cognitive and neuropsychiatric outcomes 12-months after COVID-19 hospitalization. Other predictors of poor outcome include older age, female sex, baseline disability and severity of index COVID-19.","Frontera, Sabadia, Yang, de Havenon, Yaghi, Lewis, Lord, Melmed, Thawani, Balcer, Wisniewski, Galetta, Agarwal, Andino, Arena, Baskharoun, Bauman, Bell, Berger, Bhagat, Bokhari, Bondi, Canizares, Chervinsky, Czeisler, Dygert, Fang, Flusty, Friedman, Friedman, Fuchs, Granger, Gratch, Gurin, Gutman, Hasanaj, Holmes, Horng, Huang, Ishii, Jauregui, Ji, Kahn, Koch, Krieger, Kvernland, Lalchan, Lillemoe, Lin, Liu, Madhavan, Medicherla, Millar-Vernetti, Morgan, Olivera, Omari, Park, Patel, Ristic, Rosenthal, Sonson, Snyder, Stainman, Sunwoo, Talmasov, Tamimi, Thomas, Valdes, Zhou, Zhu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2022.120487","20221115","Anxiety; COVID-19; Cognition; Depression; Disability; Long-COVID; Long-hauler; Outcomes; Post-COVID syndrome; Post-acute sequelae of COVID; Predictors; Quality of life; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-16","",41149,""
"Spotting as a risk mitigation method: A qualitative study comparing organization-based and informal methods","To explore the similarities and differences of organization-based and informal spotting (remote supervision of substance use) from the perspectives of spotters and spottees across Canada. Spotters and spottees who spot informally and for organizations were recruited across Ontario and Nova Scotia. We interviewed 20 informal and 10 organization-based participants by phone using semi-structured interviews between 08/2020 and 11/2020. Participants were asked about each methods benefits and limitations. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed thematically. Benefits of informal spotting included its ability to strengthen social connections and foster autonomy in overdose response planning. The lack of support for informal spotters created stress and burnout. Organization-based spotters enjoyed the spotting training and support provided. However, regulations surrounding having to call ambulance in overdose events deterred many people from wanting to work for or call these services. Both organization-based and informal spotting have a role in mitigating harms associated with the overdose crisis. Moving forward, further research is needed on how to optimize these services for all people who use drugs in varying jurisdictions internationally.","Perri, Guta, Kaminski, Bonn, Kolla, Bayoumi, Challacombe, Touesnard, Gagnon, McDougall, Strike","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2022.103905","20221115","COVID-19; Harm reduction; Overdose response; Spotting","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-16","",41150,""

The purpose of the program was to engage youth in research on a social issue relevant to them during an unprecedented year marked by two public health crises, COVID-19 and anti-Black racial violence. Results of an analysis of curriculum and archival program materials lend support for online strategies for youth engagement including individualized support and online audiovisual presentations with avatars. Racial justice and trauma-informed adaptations were designed to be responsive to youth needs for flexible programming and safe spaces. Themes captured in the first online gallery of youth photos include (1) tools for mental health, (2) meaningful connection, and (3) community advocacy, bringing attention to structural issues as well as family and community strengths.

"Effectiveness of Liu-zi-jue exercise on coronavirus disease 2019 in the patients: a randomized controlled trial","The aim of this study was to examine the effect of Liu-zi-jue exercise on the respiratory symptoms, quality of life, and mental health of patients with mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A single-center randomized controlled trial was conducted with 104 patients with mild COVID-19. The patients were randomly assigned to the Liu-zi-jue plus conventional therapy group and conventional therapy group. The outcome measures included Modified Borg Dyspnea Scale (MBDS) score, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score, Fatigue Scale-14 (FS-14), respiratory symptoms, and vital signs. Data were collected on the first and sixth days of hospitalization and on the discharge day. Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed that the whole scales all showed a downward trend in the two groups (all 0.05). The results of single-group effect suggested that the whole scale score in the intervention group was significantly lower than that in the control group at the sixth day of hospitalization. Compared with the control group, only the MBDS, expectoration, and FS-14 scores showed significantly lower scores at the discharge day ( 0.001, 0.011, 0.002).

"Stemming the tide of mental health problems in young people: Challenges and potential solutions","One in five people experience clinically relevant mental health problems before the age of 25Ã¢â‚¬â€°years. Furthermore, in Australia, one in seven children are reported to experience a mental health disorder. Consequently, there has been a steady increase in demand for mental health services for children and young people, and this has been compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, currently many children and young people with mental health difficulties are not accessing appropriate and/or timely care, with individuals and families finding it increasingly difficult to access and navigate suitable services. In part, this is related to the fragmented and isolated manner in which child mental health services are operating. To address the current issues in access to appropriate child and adolescent mental health care in Australia, a novel Integrated Continuum of Connect and Care model is proposed to integrate relevant services along a tiered care pathway. The aim of this model is to facilitate timely access to mental health services that meet the specific needs of each child/young person and their family. This model will function within co-located service hubs that integrate health care through a comprehensive assessment followed by a link up to relevant services. The Integrated Continuum of Connect and Care has the potential to pave the way for unifying the fragmented child and youth mental health system in Australia.","Eapen, Stylianakis, Scott, Milroy, Bowden, Haslam, Stathis","https://doi.org/10.1177/00048674221136037","20221115","Child; adolescent; integrate services; mental health; model of care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-16","",41156,""
"Happiness in pre-pandemic Europe: correlates of individual happiness prior to Covid","To identify levels and key correlates of happiness across Europe in 2018, prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. We used data from the European Social Survey to determine levels of happiness in individuals (n = 49,419) from 29 European countries and identify associations between happiness and age, gender, satisfaction with income, employment status, community trust, satisfaction with health, satisfaction with democracy, religious belief and country of residence. In 2018, self-rated happiness varied significantly across the 29 European countries, with individuals in Denmark reporting the highest levels of happiness (8.38 out of 10) and individuals in Bulgaria reporting the lowest (5.55). Ireland ranked 11<sup>th</sup> (7.7). Happiness had significant, independent associations with younger age, satisfaction with health, satisfaction with household income, community trust, satisfaction with democracy and religious belief. These factors accounted for 25.4% of the variance in happiness between individuals, and, once they were taken into account, country of residence was no longer significantly associated with happiness. Self-rated happiness varied significantly across pre-pandemic. At individual level, happiness was more closely associated with certain variables than with country of residence. It is likely that the Covid-19 pandemic had significant impacts on some or all of these variables. This highlights the importance of further analysis of correlates of happiness in Europe over future years, when detailed happiness data from during and after the pandemic become available.","DiCosimo, Kelly","https://doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2022.47","20221115","Europe; happiness; mental health; psychiatry; psychology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-16","",41157,""

School nurses are the primary health professionals who interact with children daily during the academic year, which positions them to identify risk factors within the social determinants of health that contribute to the development of toxic stress. The Toxic Stress Schema (TSS) provides a framework for assessment and care planning related to social determinants of health and potential sources of stress and/or buffering support for the physical and mental well-being of children. A case study approach is used to demonstrate the application of the TSS to school nursing and provide the basis for conceptualizing a plan of care and identifying resources to support the child's physical and mental health.","Childs, DeSocio, Sloand, Gary, Burke, Outlaw, Snethen, Lewandowski, Bowen","https://doi.org/10.1177/10598405221135186","20221115","bullying; covid-19; mental health; school nurses; screening/Risk identification; social determinants of health; toxic stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-16","",41159,""
"Life and Health Under Israeli Military Occupation During COVID-19: Report from the West Bank, Occupied Palestinian Territory","This qualitative study explores lived experiences of Palestinians in the West Bank during the COVID-19 pandemic intersecting with life under Israeli military occupation, structural violence, and racism. Insight is provided into the pandemic's effect on daily life and health and into coping and support mechanisms employed under apartheid conditions. Forty-three semi-structured interviews were conducted among a stratified sample of Palestinian adults. Interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis. During the pandemic, Palestinian social lives were interrupted, jobs were lost, and incomes declined. Families fell into social and financial crises, with strife, insecurity, uncertainty, and fear negatively affecting physical and mental health. Pandemic effects were compounded by the Palestinian Authority's shortcomings and policies not taking into account citizens' rights and social protection and by Israel's continued colonization of Palestinian land and violation of Palestinian human rights. Social solidarity was instrumental for coping during the pandemic just as it was during intensified political violence. One key feature that helped Palestinians survive promoting their cause for freedom, sovereignty, and self-determination is their social solidarity in times of strife. This has proven to be a crucial component in overcoming threats to the survival of a people during the twentieth century and into the twenty-first century.","Giacaman, Hammoudeh, Mitwalli, Khallawi, Kienzler","https://doi.org/10.1177/00207314221139792","20221115","COVID-19 pandemic; Israeli military rule; Palestinians; West Bank; apartheid; colonization; occupied Palestinian territory","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-16","",41160,""
"Farmers' cognition of the COVID-19 outbreak, risk perception and willingness of green production","Existing literature reports that COVID-19 outbreak may affect people's risk perceptions, with disturbances ranging from mild negative emotional reactions to overall mental health. At the same time, the pneumonia pandemic reveals all the vulnerabilities and weaknesses of our ecosystem and makes people reflect on traditional ecologically harmful production practices. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to review the existing scientific literature on these variables, through a survey and empirical analysis, in order to present and comment on the effects and mechanisms of influence between them. The results showed that: (1) Increasing farmers'cognition of COVID-19 outbreak could significantly enhance the green production willingness. Specifically, the probability of ""Very willing""to participate in green production increased by 29.9% for each unit of increase in cognition. (2) Farmers'cognition of COVID-19 outbreak can significantly enhance the level of risk perception and thus enhance their green production willingness, that is, risk perception is an important transmission medium of this effect. (3)The analysis of inter-generational difference showed that the impact of cognition of COVID-19 outbreak on green production willingness was significant for both the new generation and the old generation. On the basis of this, some policy suggestions are put forward, such as strengthening the propaganda and education of natural ecological environment protection, establishing the propaganda mechanism of green agricultural products market in the later period of epidemic situation, raising farmers'risk perception level through multi-channels and so on.","Luo, Qiao, Wang, Qiu, Liu, Fu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.135068","20221115","COVID-19 outbreak; Econometrics; Environmental economics; Intermediary effect; Risk perception; Willingness of green productions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-16","",41161,""
"Job insecurity and mental health related outcomes among the humanitarian workers during COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study","The COVID-19 remains a public health burden that has caused global economic crises, jeopardizing health, jobs, and livelihoods of millions of people around the globe. Several efforts have been made by several countries by implementing several health strategies to attenuate the spread of the pandemic. Although several studies indicated effects of COVID-19 on mental health and its associated factors, very little is known about the underlying mechanism of job insecurity, depression,Ã‚Â anxiety, and stress in Bangladesh. Therefore, this study determined the prevalence of job insecurity and depression, anxiety, stress as well as the association between job insecurity, mental health outcomes also contributing determinants amongst humanitarian workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. We conducted a web-based cross-sectional study among 445 humanitarian workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in six sub-districts of Cox's bazar district of Bangladesh between April and May 2021. The questionnaire was composed of socio-demographic, lifestyle and work related factors. Psychometric instruments like job insecurity scale and depression, anxiety also stress scale (DASS-21) were employed to assess the level of job insecurity and mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety and stress). STATA software version 14 was employed to perform statistical analyses. The prevalence of job insecurity was 42%. The odds of job insecurity was higher in Kutubdia and Pekua (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.1, 95% CI 1.36, 7.22) Teknaf (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.9, 95% CI 1.33, 6.41), the impact of dissatisfaction on salary (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.3, 95% CI 1.49, 3.58) was evident with job insecurity. The prevalence of moderate to severe depression, anxiety and stress among humanitarian worker were (26%, 7%), (25%, 10%) and (15%, 7%) respectively. Further, the region of work, being female, marital status, work environment, and salary dissatisfaction were contributing factors for poor mental health outcomes. Those with job insecurity were almost 3 times more likely to experience depression (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.7, 95% CI 1.85, 4.04), anxiety (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.6, 95% CI 1.76, 3.71) and stress (AOR: 2.8; 95% CI 1.89, 4.26), respectively. Our findings highlight that job security remains essential to help tackle the severity of depression, anxiety and stress in humanitarian workers. The results reflected the critical importance of local and international NGOs addressing poor mental health conditions of their employees to prevent mental health outbreaks.","Sultana, Asaduzzaman, Siddique, Khatun, Bari, Islam, Tabassum, Mondol, Sayem, Abdullah, Hossain, Biracyaza","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-022-00974-7","20221115","COVID-19; Depression; Humanitarian worker; Job insecurity; Mental health; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-16","",41162,""
"Alcohol use during COVID-19 pandemic on the long run: findings from a longitudinal study in Germany","The impact of COVID-induced stress on mental health and alcohol use has been demonstrated in recent research. However, there is a lack of longitudinal data since most studies reported on cross-sectional data. It remains unclear how alcohol use develops under the dynamic changes of the pandemic. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the general development of alcohol use and the impact of COVID related stress on drinking behavior in a German population-based sample during the pandemic in 2020. In the longitudinal design with three measurements (baseline [T1] and two follow-ups [T2, T3]) an online survey was administered. The survey included the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) as well as the assessment of the drinking days in the last 30Ã‚Â days, the number of alcoholic beverages on each occasion and changes in alcohol use in the previous fourteen days. Further, COVID-19 related concerns, perceived stress, worries about friends and family and worries about the financial situation were also assessed and multiple linear regressions and confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. 1050 participants started the survey, 756 participants (71.4%), 317 (52.7%) participants completed the survey at all three measurements. Seventy six percent (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°241) of the sample were female. An increase in alcohol use in the previous 14Ã‚Â days was reported by 10.9% at T1, 3.9% at T2 and 3.6% at T3. Moreover, a decrease in alcohol use in the previous 14Ã‚Â days was reported by 8.7% at T1, 6.5% at T2 and 4.1% at T3. The number of drinking days was significantly higher at T2 than at baseline (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001; FÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.06, [CI -Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.10, -Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.02]). COVID-19 related concerns and stress were associated with a higher number of drinking days and average number of drinks at a typical occasion. AUDIT score at baseline positively predicted number of drinking days as well as average number of drinks. The significant increases in alcohol use is a public health issue during COVID-19 pandemic. The findings show that especially people who drink more hazardously previously tend to drink more under pandemic conditions. Those individuals are particularly at risk for developing substance-related problems.","Schecke, Bohn, Scherbaum, Mette","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-022-00965-8","20221115","Alcohol use; COVID-19; Longitudinal design; Substance use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-16","",41163,""
"Prevalence of pharmacological and non-pharmacological coping mechanisms for anxiety management during the COVID-19 pandemic: investigating the transition to online learning among medical students","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had a devastating effect on college students worldwide. Here, the authors aimed to determine the prevalence of anxiety and its related coping strategies, provide a theoretical basis for understanding self-prescription, and identify the factors contributing to stress and anxiety in medical students during the pandemic. The authors conducted a cross-sectional study among medical students in Saudi Arabia from September to November 2020. They assessed anxiety using the GAD-7 scale based on seven core symptoms. The authors also examined perceived psychological stress using a single-item measure of stress, the factors contributing to stress during the transition to online learning and examinations, and related coping strategies. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26.0 was used to examine the data for both descriptive and inferential analyses. Chi-square test, one-way ANOVA, and univariate linear regression were used to test the research hypotheses. The authors collected and analyzed data from 7116 medical students distributed across 38 medical colleges. Among them, 40% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms. Pre-clinical and female students experienced more stress than clinical and male students. 12.19% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°868) of respondents reported using medication during their college years. Among those, 58.9% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°512) had moderate to severe anxiety, and the most commonly used drug was propranolol (45.4%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°394). Among the studied sample, 40.4% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°351) decreased their medication use after switching to online teaching. Most students used these medications during the final exam (35.8%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°311) and before the oral exam (35.5%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°308). In terms of coping strategies, males were much more likely to use substances than females, who mainly resorted to other strategies. This study provides a national overview of the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of medical students. The results indicated that the pandemic is associated with highly significant levels of anxiety. These findings can provide theoretical evidence for the need for supportive psychological assistance from academic leaders in this regard.","Almarri, Alaseem, Alanazi, Alyahya, Alsanad, Alswayed, Alanazi, Alharby, Alghamdi","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-04372-6","20221115","Anxiety management; COVID-19 pandemic; Copying mechanism; Medical students; Online learning; Pharmacology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-16","",41164,""
"Needs to address clinicians' moral distress in treating unvaccinated COVID-19 patients","Moral dilemmas have arisen concerning whether physicians and other providers should treat patients who have declined COVID vaccination and are now sick with this disease. Several ethicists have argued that clinicians have obligations to treat such patients, yet providing careÃ‚Â to these patients has distressed clinicians, who have at times declined to do so. Critical questions thus emerge regarding how best to proceed. Providers face moral tensions: whether to place the benefits toÃ‚Â an unvaccinated patient over their duties to protect themselves and their families, staff and other patients, and goals of working collaboratively with patients. Clinicians' duties to treat such patients arguably outweigh claims otherwise, but these obligations are creating moral conflict and distress for providers. Moral distress has been associated with burnout, post-traumatic stress disorder, and interpersonal and work difficulties. Given ongoing vaccine refusals, these problems are unlikely to disappear in the foreseeable future. Society has obligations to address this moral distress due to principles of reciprocity, and implicit social contracts, as part of which physicians risk their lives in caring for patients for the good of society as a whole. Responses are thus urgently needed at several levels: by hospitals, medical schools, professional societies, governments, media, providers and patients. Medical training on professionalism should address these stresses, probing why doctors have duties to treat these patients, but also how moral conflicts can ensue, and how best to address these tensions. Governments and institutions should thus alter relevant policies and devote more resources to addressing clinicians' psychological strains. Institutions should also improve organizational culture. Public health organizations and the media described clinicians, earlier in the pandemic, as heroes, committed to treating COVID patients. This narrative should now be changed to highlight the strains that unvaccinated patients cause-endangering hospital staff and others. Unvaccinated COVID patients should receive care, but multi-level strategies, involving enhanced policies, education and practice are vital to alleviate ensuing moral distress, and thus aid these clinicians and their patients. Ethical arguments that providers must treat these patients have not considered these obligations' effects on clinicians, but should do so.","Klitzman","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12910-022-00859-9","20221115","COVID-19; Medical education; Medical ethics; Medical professionalism; Moral conflict; Moral distress; Policy; Provider mental health; Triage","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-16","",41165,""
"'Space to hide': experiences of remote provision across child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS)","The global COVID-19 pandemic necessitated rapid adoption of remote provision across child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS). The study aimed to understand young people's, parents'/carers', and professionals' experiences of remote provision across CAMHS in one NHS Trust in the North West of England to inform future recovery practice so that remote sessions can continue where they have been well received but re-thought or replaced where they have not. The study sample comprised three groups: (i) young people, (ii) parents/carers, and (iii) clinical staff. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were used to collect data. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Three overarching themes were identified: 'Remote therapeutic experiences'; 'Spaces and places of therapy'; and 'Future of CAMHS'. Although remote appointments increased flexibility within the service, the quality of the relational experience was altered, typically for the worse. Clinicians felt less able to examine vital forms of non-verbal communication, which were considered instrumental in assessing and engaging people experiencing difficulties, leaving some questioning their professionalism. Although some young people suggested that remote provision increased comfort levels, others felt their place of comfort and safety was invaded. Reduced travel time for both clinicians and families may increase capacity, enabling the service to meet the increased demand if clinical effectiveness can be preserved. In considering future models of provision, assessing clinical need, patient and family preference, and access to space and hardware are all critical when deciding which modality to use for the best outcomes for each individual.","Worsley, Hassan, Nolan, Corcoran","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-022-08806-5","20221115","Accessibility; CAMHS; Flexibility; Mental health; Non-verbal communication; Remote provision; Therapeutic relationships","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-16","",41166,""
"The need for a holistic approach toward pandemic control: lessons from a cross-sectional study on COVID-19 in Meghalaya, India","We conducted a community-based cross-sectional survey of 416 participants from Meghalaya, India to assess knowledge, perceptions, and practices toward recommended COVID-19 preventive measures, and to explore health-seeking behavior and stigma during early phase of the pandemic.

"Prescriptions of psychopharmacologic drugs in Austria in 2019 and 2020 - Implications of the COVID-19 pandemic","Measures to reduce the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have an impact on the mental health of the general population. Drug prescription rates can be used as a surrogate marker to estimate help seeking and health parameters of a population. The aim of this study was to compare psychopharmacologic drug prescriptions in Austria from the start of the pandemic in 2020 over time and with the previous year and to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020. Data from the three largest public health insurances in Austria, covering over 98% of the general population, were analyzed. A total of 1,365,294 patients with a prescription of a psychopharmacologic drug in the months March to December in 2019 and 2020 were selected. There was no significant change in prescribed defined daily doses (DDDs) during the lockdowns. However, there was a stockpiling effect before and at the beginning of lockdown 1. The number of new patients initiating psychopharmacologic treatment was significantly reduced during lockdown 1 but not during lockdown 2. The first COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 functioned as a barrier for new psychiatric patients seeking help, whereas the patients with ongoing treatments did not have significant problems. These results have to be taken into account for future planning, but follow-up studies are needed, as our results could be indicative of a change in the effect of the protective measures on the utilization of the healthcare system over time.","Winkler, Reichardt, Rothenberg, Rujescu, Pjrek","https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.2328","20221115","Austria; COVID-19; lockdown; prescriptions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-16","",41168,""
