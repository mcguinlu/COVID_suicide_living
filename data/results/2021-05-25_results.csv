"The COVID in the Context of Pregnancy, Infancy and Parenting (CoCoPIP) Study: protocol for a longitudinal study of parental mental health, social interactions, physical growth, and cognitive development of infants during the pandemic","Introduction While the secondary impact of the COVID pandemic on the psychological wellbeing of pregnant women and parents has become apparent over the past year, the impact of these changes on early social interactions, physical growth and cognitive development of their infants is unknown, as is the way in which a range of COVID related changes have mediated this impact. This study (CoCoPIP) will investigate: i) how parents experiences of the social, medical, and financial changes during the pandemic have impacted pre and postnatal parental mental health and parent-infant social interaction; and (ii) the extent to which these COVID-related changes in parental pre and postnatal mental health and social interaction are associated with fetal and infant development. Methods and analysis The CoCoPIP study is a national online survey initiated in July 2020. This ongoing study (n = 1700 families currently enrolled as of 6th May 2021) involves both quantitative and qualitative data being collected across pregnancy and infancy. It is designed to identify the longitudinal impact of the pandemic from pregnancy to two years of age, with the aim of identifying if stress-associated moderators (i.e., loss of income, COVID-19 illness, access to ante/postnatal support) impact parental mental health, and in turn, infant development. In addition, we aim to document individual differences in social and cognitive development in toddlers who were born during restrictions intended to mitigate COVID-19 spread (e.g., social distancing, national lockdowns). Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was given by the University of Cambridge, Psychology Research Ethics Committee (PREC) (PRE.2020.077). Findings will be made available via community engagement, public forums (e.g., social media,) and to national (e.g., NHS England) and local (Cambridge Universities Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust) healthcare partners. Results will be submitted for publication in peer-reviews journals.","Ezra Aydin; Staci M Weiss; Kevin A Glasgow; Jane Barlow; Topun Austin; Mark H Johnson; Sarah Lloyd-Fox","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.22.21257649","20210524","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-25","",13992,""
"Doxazosin improved COVID-19 associated nightmare in a patient with major depressive disorder: a case report with a positive rechallenge","This article reports on the treatment of a patient with nightmares who was treated with doxazosin of an alpha 1-adrenergic antagonists. A 71-year-old Japanese major depressive disorder (MDD) woman experienced nightmares after the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. She had nightmares about being chased by a coronavirus and catching the corona virus. After adding doxazosin 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°mg daily in the morning, her nightmares led to remission without side effects. We also had a rechallenge regimen with doxazosin. The nightmares ceased on the second night of the rechallenge and did not return with continued treatment. This case report suggests that doxazosin may be a useful therapeutic option to target nightmares in individuals with MDD.","Hori","https://doi.org/10.1097/YIC.0000000000000364","20210524","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-25","",13993,""

An online survey was conducted in 348 HCWs using PHQ-SADS and Brief-COPE inventory. Depression, anxiety and somatic symptoms were present in 54 %, 44.3 % and 54.6 % of HCWs and were more in those working in COVID19 areas.

"Impact of COVID-19 lockdown on individuals under treatment for substance use disorders: Risk factors for adverse mental health outcomes","Individuals with Substance Use Disorders (SUD), are vulnerable to the psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is the first study to assess risk factors of adverse mental health outcomes during lockdown in a SUD population. This was a cross-sectional study, conducted through an online survey that was completed by 303 individuals with SUD, attended in the Addiction Unit of University of Barcelona ClÃƒÂ­nic Hospital. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected and descriptive analyses were carried out. Depending on whether individuals reported a worsening or no change/improvement in anxiety and depression symptoms during lockdown, the sample was divided in two groups. A logistic regression was then carried out to identify risk factors associated with adverse mental health outcomes. Overall, frequency of use for the majority of individuals with SUD remained stable during lockdown in comparison to the pre-lockdown era, although a reduction was found in frequency of tobacco, alcohol, cannabis and cocaine use in a small fraction of individuals with SUD. Symptoms of clinical anxiety were found in 58.7% of the sample while 48.2% of participants scored above the clinical threshold for depression. In addition, 50.3% of the sample reported a deterioration in depression and anxiety symptoms during lockdown that was associated with the following risk factors: previous trauma-exposure, female gender, distress and isolation, income reduction and alcohol use. A high percentage of patients with SUD experienced adverse mental health outcomes during lockdown that were associated with several risk factors, which should be taken into account in policy making and prevention strategies, as well as in clinical practice, in order to provide personalized care to SUD patients during the time of the pandemic.","Blithikioti, NuÃƒÂ±o, Paniello, Gual, Miquel","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.05.006","20210524","COVID-19; Lockdown; Mental health; Risk factors; Substance use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-25","",13995,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on adolescent and emerging adult brain tumor survivors and their parents","The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted unprecedented challenges, contributing to greater difficulties among families of children with special health care needs, such as pediatric brain tumor survivors. We examined the impact of the pandemic on psychosocial functioning of adolescent and emerging adult survivors and their parents. We hypothesized that COVID-19 disruptions and survivor social connectedness would be associated with survivor-reported posttraumatic stress and family outcomes, including family functioning, parenting, and parent mental health. Fifty-five families (44 survivors, 48 parents) were recruited via phone and email to participate in the study. Survivors were ages 13-25 (MÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 19.62, SDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 3.47) and at least 5Ã‚Â years post diagnosis. Parents completed the COVID-19 Exposure and Family Impact Survey (CEFIS), and survivors completed the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) COVID-19 child self-report form, which assessed pandemic impacts on their psychosocial functioning. Parents reported a mean of 7.52 (SDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.83) disruptions to their families' lives. The pandemic negatively affected survivors' life satisfaction (M<sub>diff</sub> Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.46, t(44)Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 3.96, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001), with 92% reporting reduced social connectedness (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 39). Total disruptions due to COVID-19 and survivor social connectedness predicted survivor-reported posttraumatic stress, above and beyond survivors' pre-pandemic psychosocial risk. Most parents reported positive changes in their parenting (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 31, 67.4%) and family cohesion (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 30, 66.7%). However, they also reported worsened mood (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 28, 62.3%) and increased anxiety (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 31, 71.1%). Parents and survivors reported positive and negative impacts of COVID-19, which had downstream consequences on survivor psychosocial functioning. Follow-up care should consider potential adverse effects on social connectedness and stress symptoms.","Fisher, Patronick, Gerhardt, Radonovich, Salloum, Wade","https://doi.org/10.1002/pbc.29116","20210524","COVID-19; adolescent and emerging adult; pediatric brain tumor survivor; psychosocial functioning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-25","",13996,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Pediatric Emergency Service","The aims of this research were to review patients visiting the pediatric emergency department over a 6-month period one year before and during the pandemic, to review pediatric emergency department referral ratios, and to determine whether there were any significant decreases in mortality and morbidity. All patients between the ages of 0-18 years visiting the University of Health Sciences, Ankara Research and Training Hospital, Pediatric Emergency Service between April to October 2019 and April to October 2020 with no missing information in their records were involved in this retrospective cross-sectional study. The total number of pediatric emergency service consultations was 74,739; the number of emergency visits between April-October 2019 was 55,678, whereas it was 19,061 between April-October 2020 in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic period. There was a 67.7% decrease in consultations during the pandemic period. The mean age of participants between April-October 2019 was 8.11Ã‚Â±5.31 years, and 52.4% of cases were male. The mean age between April-October 2020 was 8.58Ã‚Â±5.93 years, and 51% of cases were male. COVID-19 related symptoms were higher during the pandemic period (p&lt;0.05), with fever and gastroenteritis being the most frequently received diagnosis in both periods. During the pandemic period, the newborn consultation ratio was higher (p&gt;0.05), there was a decrease in consultation ratios related to suicide attempts (p&lt;0.05), and a threefold increase in death rates was observed (p&lt;0.05). In Turkey, where emergency consultation rates are quite high, these decreases look fearsome for secondary injuries that can develop in children. For this reason, families should be made aware of the importance of bringing their children to the hospital during emergencies, and that all necessary health precautions are being taken to decrease the spread of infection in hospitals.","Fidanci, TaÃ…Å¸ar, AkintuÃ„Å¸, Fidanci, Bulut","https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14398","20210524","COVID-19; pandemic; pediatric emergency","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-25","",13997,""
"Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) Associated with COVID-19: A Case Series Experience in a Tertiary Care Hospital of Southern Turkey","Aim of the study is to assess the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) Associated with COVID-19. The study comprised 52 children with MIS-C admitted to University of Health Sciences Adana City Training and Research Hospital pediatric wards from September 2020 to April 2021. Demographic characteristics and clinical data were retrospectively collected from patient files. Median age of patients was 9 (5-13) years. Fever (92.3%), abdominal pain (76.9%), rash (48.1%) and vomiting (48.1%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Fever duration was 8 (4.25-10) days in overall. Depressed left ventricular ejection fraction was found in 17.3% of patients. At admission, elevated levels of CRP, procalcitonine, ESR, D-dimer, ferritin were found in 98.1%, 96.2%, 75%, 84.6% and 69.2% of the patients, respectively. Lymphopenia, hyponatremia and hypoalbuminemia were found in 76.9%, 59.6%, 42.3% of the patients. Intravenous immunoglobulin was used in 96.2%, corticosteroids in 71.2% and anakinra in 3.8% of the patients. 28.8% of the patients were admitted to pediatric intensive care (PICU) and 17.3% received vasopressor support. Median duration of hospital length of stay was 12.5Ã¢â‚¬â€°days. Comorbidities were present in 19.2% of the patients. No mortality was recorded. While being rare and treatable, MIS-C is the ugly and mysterious face of the COVID-19 pandemic for children. The increasing number of MIS-C cases shows that this phenomenon is more common than thought. Comprehensive studies are required to understand the pathogenesis of the disease and determine the treatment regimens clearly. While being rare and treatable, Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19 is the ugly and mysterious face of the COVID-19 pandemic for children. MIS-C is now thought to be a post-infectious (SARS-CoV2) hyperinflammatory disease secondary to an abnormal immune response, rather than a complete obscurity. The increasing number of MIS-C cases and new case series reports from all over the world show that MIS-C is more common than thought. Despite our increasing experience, we may encounter a new finding every day in MIS-C patients. Therefore, we want to contribute to literature by presenting the MIS-C cases we treated in our clinic in detail. We have experienced that MIS-C patients can apply with similar but also different and unique characteristics. In case of delayed diagnosis or treatment, morbidity and mortality rates may increase. Therefore, the level of awareness and knowledge of all physicians, especially those dealing with pediatric patients, about MIS-C should be increased. Although the early effects of MIS-C are known, we don't have enough information about the long-term consequences yet. Comprehensive studies are required to understand the pathogenesis of the disease and determine the treatment regimens clearly.","Tolunay, Ãƒâ€¡elik, Arslan, Orgun, Demir, Demir, DaÃ„Å¸delen","https://doi.org/10.1093/tropej/fmab050","20210524","COVID-19; Children; Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C); SARS-CoV2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-25","",13998,""

"Use of Video Telehealth Tablets to Increase Access for Veterans Experiencing Homelessness","Veterans experiencing homelessness face substantial barriers to accessing health and social services. In 2016, the Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system launched a unique program to distribute video-enabled tablets to Veterans with access barriers. Evaluate the use of VA-issued video telehealth tablets among Veterans experiencing homelessness in the VA system. Guided by the RE-AIM framework, we first evaluated the adoption of tablets among Veterans experiencing homelessness and housed Veterans. We then analyzed health record and tablet utilization data to compare characteristics of both subpopulations, and used multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with tablet use among Veterans experiencing homelessness. In total, 12,148 VA patients receiving tablets between October 2017 and March 2019, focusing on the 1470 VA Veterans experiencing homelessness receiving tablets (12.1%). Tablet use within 6 months of receipt for mental health, primary or specialty care. Nearly half (45.9%) of Veterans experiencing homelessness who received a tablet had a video visit within 6 months of receipt, most frequently for telemental health. Tablet use was more common among Veterans experiencing homelessness who were younger (AOR = 2.77; P &lt;.001); middle-aged (AOR = 2.28; P &lt;.001); in rural settings (AOR = 1.46; P =.005); and those with post-traumatic stress disorder (AOR = 1.64; P &lt;.001), and less common among those who were Black (AOR = 0.43; P &lt;.001) and those with a substance use disorder (AOR = 0.59; P &lt;.001) or persistent housing instability (AOR = 0.75; P = .023). Telehealth care and connection for vulnerable populations are particularly salient during the COVID-19 pandemic but also beyond. VA's distribution of video telehealth tablets offers healthcare access to Veterans experiencing homelessness; however, barriers remain for subpopulations. Tailored training and support for these patients may be needed to optimize telehealth tablet use and effectiveness.","Garvin, Hu, Slightam, McInnes, Zulman","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-021-06900-8","20210524","Veterans; health services accessibility; homelessness; mental health; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-25","",14002,""
"Change in modifiable dementia risk factors during COVID-19 lockdown: The experience of over 50s in Tasmania, Australia","Containment measures implemented to minimize the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are reported to be negatively affecting mental health, diet, and alcohol consumption. These factors, as well as poor cardiometabolic health and insufficient physical and cognitive activity, are known to increase the risk of developing dementia. COVID-19 &quot;lockdown&quot; measures may have exacerbated these dementia risk factors among people in mid-to-later life. We compared longitudinal data from before (October 2019) and during (April-June 2020) the first COVID-19 lockdown period in Tasmania, Australia. Participants (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1671) were 50+ years of age and engaged in a public health program targeting dementia risk reduction, with one-third participating in the Preventing Dementia Massive Open Online Course (PD-MOOC). Regression models were used to assess changes in smoking, alcohol use, body mass index (BMI), diet, physical exercise, cognitive and social activity, anxiety and depression, and management of cholesterol, diabetes, and blood pressure. Where significant changes were noted, the moderating influence of being in current employment, living with others, and completing the PD-MOOC was tested. Although friend networks contracted marginally during lockdown, no detrimental effects on modifiable dementia risk factors were noted. Anxiety levels and alcohol consumption decreased, there was no change in depression scores, and small but significant improvements were observed in cognitive and physical activity, smoking, diet, and BMI. Stronger improvements in cognitive activity were observed among people who were cohabiting (not living alone) and both cognitive activity and adherence to the MIND diet (Mediterranean-DASH diet Intervention for Neurological Delay) improved more for people who participated in the PD-MOOC. Longitudinal data did not show widespread negative effects of COVID-19 lockdown on modifiable dementia risk factors in this sample. The results counter the dominant narratives of universal pandemic-related distress and suggest that engaging at-risk populations in proactive health promotion and education campaigns during lockdown events could be a protective public health strategy.","Bartlett, Brady, Farrow, Kim, Bindoff, Fair, Vickers, Sinclair","https://doi.org/10.1002/trc2.12169","20210524","COVIDÃ¢â‚¬Â19; dementia; lockdown; longitudinal; modifiable riskÃ¢â‚¬Âfactors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-25","",14003,""
"Prioritizing the Mental Health and Well-Being of Healthcare Workers: An Urgent Global Public Health Priority","The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on health systems in most countries, and in particular, on the mental health and well-being of health workers on the frontlines of pandemic response efforts. The purpose of this article is to provide an evidence-based overview of the adverse mental health impacts on healthcare workers during times of crisis and other challenging working conditions and to highlight the importance of prioritizing and protecting the mental health and well-being of the healthcare workforce, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. First, we provide a broad overview of the elevated risk of stress, burnout, moral injury, depression, trauma, and other mental health challenges among healthcare workers. Second, we consider how public health emergencies exacerbate these concerns, as reflected in emerging research on the negative mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers. Further, we consider potential approaches for overcoming these threats to mental health by exploring the value of practicing self-care strategies, and implementing evidence based interventions and organizational measures to help protect and support the mental health and well-being of the healthcare workforce. Lastly, we highlight systemic changes to empower healthcare workers and protect their mental health and well-being in the long run, and propose policy recommendations to guide healthcare leaders and health systems in this endeavor. This paper acknowledges the stressors, burdens, and psychological needs of the healthcare workforce across health systems and disciplines, and calls for renewed efforts to mitigate these challenges among those working on the frontlines during public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","SÃƒÂ¸vold, Naslund, Kousoulis, Saxena, Qoronfleh, Grobler, MÃƒÂ¼nter","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.679397","20210524","COVID-19; burnout; healthcare policies; healthcare workers; mental health; psychological interventions; public health emergencies; self-care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-25","",14004,""
"Prevalence of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Among Repatriated Indonesian Migrant Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Introduction:</b> Repatriated Indonesian migrant workers are vulnerable to developing serious mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of depression, anxiety, and stress among these populations during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> Guided by the health belief model, a cross-sectional study design was employed among 335 participants, and primary data were collected through an online survey. Measured using DASS-21, anxiety, depression, and stress were the dependent variables. We performed descriptive and inferential statistical analyses-logistic regression was used to predict independently associated variables. STATA was used to execute all data analyses. <b>Results:</b> The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among repatriated Indonesian migrant workers were 10.15, 9.25, and 2.39%, respectively. The risk of anxiety and depression was low among those aged 21-30 years old, who had completed a university degree, were married, and had quarantined for 14 days. Conversely, the risk of anxiety and depression was high among those who had bad perceived health status, high perceived susceptibility, and negative stigma perception. <b>Conclusion:</b> The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among repatriated Indonesian migrant workers was relatively low compared to the general population. The risk of anxiety and depression was low among young people, educated people, and those under effective quarantine, but the risk was high among those who had negative perceptions about their health, stigma, and susceptibility to the disease.","Harjana, Januraga, Indrayathi, Gesesew, Ward","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.630295","20210524","COVID-19; Indonesia; mental health; migrant worker; prevalence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-25","",14005,""
"Expected Impacts of COVID-19: Considering Resource-Limited Countries and Vulnerable Population","Coronavirus disease in 2019 emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019. After a month, it was declared a global threat to public health. The effects of the pandemic could be socio-economic, undermining the health system and risking livelihoods. Vulnerability to this infection has been associated with underlying comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, chronic respiratory diseases, cancer, and compromised immune systems. Co-morbidity has been common to the elderly, the disabled, and the homeless. In addition, more severe coronavirus disease outcomes have been reported in older males than females. Nonetheless, multiple variables are related to the concept of cultural gender that should be taken into account as women in more affected sectors are economically disadvantageous and over-represented. Similarly, although children are not the face of this pandemic, calamity has a profound effect on their welfare, especially for those living in poor and inconvenient situations. Moreover, the economic influence could be profound and universal when viewed through a migration lens as it is exacerbating xenophobic and discriminatory treatment. Protection measures to mitigate the outbreak of a pandemic, such as social distancing, may reduce social support for certain categories relied on for their day-to-day activities. The mental health of people would definitely be affected by the additional psychosocial burden of the pandemic, particularly in vulnerable groups. Integrated approaches are therefore mandatory to assist these groups and contain the pandemic.","Gashaw, Hagos, Sisay","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.614789","20210524","comorbidity; coronavirus; impact; pandemic; vulnerable","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-25","",14006,""
"Distressed but happy: health workers and volunteers during the COVID-19 pandemic","During the COVID-19 outbreak, many people rose to the occasion by engaging in volunteerism and health work. We conducted two nationwide surveys in the United States (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2931) and China (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2793) assessing volunteers' and health workers' levels of mental distress and happiness. In spite of data being collected at different phases of the COVID-19 outbreak and across two different cultures, the results converged. Volunteers and health workers reported higher mental distress (e.g., depression, anxiety, somatization) than the comparison group. However, volunteers and health workers also reported more happiness than the comparison group. More importantly, in a follow-up in China (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1914) one month later, health workers still reported heightened happiness but were no longer more distressed than the comparison group. The changes in distress were partially mediated by happiness at the first time point, pointing to the potential role of happiness in coping with distress. In sum, the emotional landscape of volunteers and health workers was complicated-they experienced higher distress but also higher happiness than comparison groups. Future research would do well to include longer follow-up periods to examine how experiencing happiness during highly stressful situations predicts mental health over time.

"Media exposure predicts acute stress and probable acute stress disorder during the early COVID-19 outbreak in China","The COVID-19 has led to unprecedented psychological stress on the general public. However, the associations between media exposure to COVID-19 and acute stress responses have not been explored during the early COVID-19 outbreak in China. An online survey was conducted to investigate the relationships between media exposure to COVID-19 and acute stress responses, and to recognize associated predictors of acute stress responses on a sample of 1,450 Chinese citizens from February 3 to February 10, 2020. Media exposure questionnaire related to COVID-19 was developed to assess media exposure time, media exposure forms and media exposure content. The Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire (SASRQ) was used to measure acute stress responses, including continuous acute stress symptom scores and the risk of probable acute stress disorder (ASD). A series of regression analyses were conducted. Longer media exposure time and social media use were associated with higher acute stress and probable ASD. Viewing the situation of infected patients was associated with higher acute stress, whereas viewing the latest news about pandemic data was associated with lower odds of probable ASD. Being females, living in Hubei Province, someone close to them diagnosed with COVID-19, history of mental illness, recent adverse life events and previous collective trauma exposure were risk factors for acute stress responses. These findings confirmed the associations between indirect media exposure to pandemic events and acute stress responses. The governments should be aware of the negative impacts of disaster-related media exposure and implement appropriate interventions to promote psychological well-being following pandemic events.","Luo, He, Wang, Li, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.11407","20210524","Acute stress; Acute stress disorder; COVID-19; Media exposure; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-25","",14008,""
"Medical students' relative immunity, or lack thereof, against COVID-19 emotional distress and psychological challenges; a descriptive study from Jordan","<b>Background:</b> Emotional distress is a major impact of COVID-19 among not only the general public but also healthcare workers including medical students. This study aimed at describing self-reported changes in emotional reactions associated with COVID-19 among medical students in Jordan and to assessing the potential effect of social media utilization on emotional distress among this group. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional design was utilized to collect data early on during the outbreak in Jordan. All medical students in Jordan were eligible to complete an online questionnaire assessing self-reported emotional reactions to COVID-19 that covered four main domains: negative emotion (anxiety, worry, depression, panic, loneliness, and nervousness), positive emotion (happiness, joy, and excitement), sleep disorders (insomnia, shallow sleep, nightmares, and insufficient sleep), and aggression (verbal argument and physical fighting). The frequency of social media utilization as a main source of COVID-19 information was also assessed. <b>Results:</b> 59.9% of participants were females, 64.9% were enrolled at the two major medical schools in Jordan, and 59.6% were in the pre-clinical stage (years). A significant proportion of participants self-reported increased negative emotional levels of anxiety (49.2%), worry (72.4%), depression (23.1%), panic (22.6%), and nervousness (38.2%) and decreased positive emotional levels of happiness (44.8%), joy (47.3%), and feelings of excitement (45.1%). Self-reported sleep disorders were not as common (less than 15% for any of the four items), while arguing with others was at 26.7%. Significant differences by gender and academic year were detected. Almost half of participants reported using social media as a main source of COVID-19 information &quot;most/all-the-times&quot; with a significant effect of such on reducing emotional distress. <b>Conclusion:</b> The results suggest a potential effect of COVID-19 on the emotional distress of medical students. Addressing and mitigating such effects is crucial. The buffering effect of social media should be further investigated.","Kheirallah, Bloukh, Khasawneh, Alsulaiman, Khassawneh, Al-Mistarehi, Alqudah, Elsalem, Al Bashir, Awad, Al-Shatanawi, Saleh","https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.52051.1","20210524","COVID-19; Jordan; SARS-CoV-2.; emotional changes; emotional distress; medical school; medical students; social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-25","",14009,""
"Wellbeing and clinical videoconferencing satisfaction among patients in psychotrauma treatment during the coronavirus pandemic: cross-sectional study","<b>Background</b>: The coronavirus pandemic appears to put psychiatric patients with pre-existing symptomatology at risk of symptom increase, but evidence is scarce. While the pandemic and stringent governmental measures have accelerated the use of clinical videoconferencing (VCT), patient satisfaction with VCT is unclear. <b>Objective</b>: Aim of the study was to assess the wellbeing of patients in psychotrauma treatment during the coronavirus pandemic and to evaluate their use of and satisfaction with VCT. <b>Method</b>: This study used data from a routine outcome monitoring assessment completed by patients in treatment at a specialized psychotrauma institute and administered before the easing of governmental measures in June 2020. Wellbeing (Brief Symptom Inventory, Cantril Ladder, perceived stress level, and symptom change), VCT use and VCT satisfaction, and their association with demographic variables (gender, age, education level, and refugee status) were analysed. <b>Results</b>: Of the 318 respondents (response rate 64.5%), 139 (43.7%) reported a symptom increase, which was associated with a higher coronavirus-related stress level and general psychopathology as well as lower life satisfaction. There were significant effects of age and education level on wellbeing. VCT was reported to have been used by 228 (71.7%) patients. VCT satisfaction ratings were higher among women and those with lower levels of stress (<i>r</i> =Ã‚Â -.20, <i>p</i> &lt;Ã‚Â .01) and general psychopathology (<i>r</i> =Ã‚Â .21, <i>p</i> &lt; .01). No difference in treatment satisfaction was found between patients who used VCT versus those who did not (mean differenceÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -.09 95% CI: -.79 to .62, <i>p</i> =Ã‚Â .81). <b>Conclusions</b>: The coronavirus pandemic has aggravated mental health complaints according to a substantial percentage of patients in psychotrauma treatment. Although VCT was found to be acceptable, face-to-face treatment may remain necessary for specific target groups with limited access to VCT (such as refugees) and patients with high levels of general psychopathology. <b>Antecedentes</b>: La pandemia por el coronavirus parece incrementar el riesgo de un aumento de sÃƒÂ­ntomas a los pacientes psiquiÃƒÂ¡tricos con sintomatologÃƒÂ­a preexistente, pero la evidencia es escasa. Si bien la pandemia y las estrictas medidas gubernamentales han acelerado el uso de la videoconferencia clÃƒÂ­nica (VCT, por sus siglas en inglÃƒÂ©s), la satisfacciÃƒÂ³n del paciente con la VCT no estÃƒÂ¡ clara.<b>Objetivo</b>: El objetivo del estudio fue el de evaluar el bienestar de los pacientes en tratamiento por psicotrauma durante la pandemia por el coronavirus; ademÃƒÂ¡s, evaluar su uso y su satisfacciÃƒÂ³n con la VCT.<b>MÃƒÂ©todo</b>: Este estudio empleÃƒÂ³ los datos de las evaluaciones rutinarias de control clÃƒÂ­nico de un instituto especializado en psicotraumatologÃƒÂ­a completadas por pacientes y realizadas antes de la flexibilizaciÃƒÂ³n de las medidas gubernamentales en Junio del 2020. Se analizaron el bienestar (Inventario Breve de SÃƒÂ­ntomas, Escalera de Cantril, nivel de estrÃƒÂ©s percibido y cambio de sÃƒÂ­ntomas), el uso de la VCT, la satisfacciÃƒÂ³n con la VCT y su asociaciÃƒÂ³n con variables demogrÃƒÂ¡ficas (gÃƒÂ©nero, edad, nivel educacional y condiciÃƒÂ³n de refugiado).<b>Resultados</b>: De los 318 encuestados (tasa de respuesta del 64,5%), 139 (43,7%) reportaron un aumento de sÃƒÂ­ntomas, lo cual se asociÃƒÂ³ con niveles de estrÃƒÂ©s asociado al coronavirus mÃƒÂ¡s altos y con psicopatologÃƒÂ­a general, asÃƒÂ­ como con una menor satisfacciÃƒÂ³n con la vida. Hubo efectos significativos entre la edad y el nivel educativo sobre el bienestar. 228 (71,7%) pacientes reportaron haber usado la VCT. Los ÃƒÂ­ndices de satisfacciÃƒÂ³n con la VCT fueron mÃƒÂ¡s altos entre las mujeres y entre aquellos con menores niveles de estrÃƒÂ©s (<i>r</i> = Ã¢Ë†â€™.20, <i>p</i> &lt; .01) y de psicopatologÃƒÂ­a general (<i>r</i> = .21, <i>p</i> &lt; .01). No se encontraron diferencias entre la satisfacciÃƒÂ³n con el tratamiento en pacientes que usaron la VCT en comparaciÃƒÂ³n con aquellos que no lo usaron (diferencia media = Ã¢Ë†â€™.09 IC del 95%: Ã¢Ë†â€™.79 a .62, <i>p</i> = .81).<b>Conclusiones</b>: La pandemia por el coronavirus ha agravado las quejas de salud mental en un porcentaje importante de pacientes en tratamiento por psicotrauma. A pesar que se hallÃƒÂ³ que la VCT era aceptable, el tratamiento presencial puede seguir siendo necesario para grupos especÃƒÂ­ficos con acceso limitado a la VCT (como los refugiados) y para los pacientes con altos niveles de psicopatologÃƒÂ­a general. <b>Ã¨Æ’Å’Ã¦â„¢Â¯</b>: Ã¥â€ Â Ã§Å Â¶Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦Â¯â€™Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¤Â¼Â¼Ã¤Â¹Å½Ã¤Â½Â¿Ã¥â€¦Ë†Ã¦Å“â€°Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Â²Â¾Ã§Â¥Å¾Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¥Â¢Å¾Ã¥Å Â Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã§Å¡â€žÃ©Â£Å½Ã©â„¢Â©, Ã¤Â½â€ Ã§Â¼ÂºÃ¤Â¹ÂÃ¨Â¯ÂÃ¦ÂÂ®Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Â°Â½Ã§Â®Â¡Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¤Â¸Â¥Ã¦Â Â¼Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦â€Â¿Ã¥ÂºÅ“Ã¦Å½ÂªÃ¦â€“Â½Ã¥Â·Â²Ã¥Å Â Ã¥Â¿Â«Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¤Â¸Â´Ã¥ÂºÅ Ã¨Â§â€ Ã©Â¢â€˜Ã¤Â¼Å¡Ã¨Â®Â® (VCT) Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â½Â¿Ã§â€Â¨, Ã¤Â½â€ Ã¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¥Â¯Â¹VCTÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¦Â»Â¡Ã¦â€žÂÃ¥ÂºÂ¦Ã¥Â°Å¡Ã¤Â¸ÂÃ¦Â¸â€¦Ã¦Â¥Å¡Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§â€ºÂ®Ã§Å¡â€ž</b>: Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¦â€”Â¨Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¤Â¼Â°Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¥â€ Â Ã§Å Â¶Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦Â¯â€™Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¦Å½Â¥Ã¥Ââ€”Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã§Å Â¶Ã¥â€ Âµ, Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¤Â¼Â°Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¥Â¯Â¹VCTÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â½Â¿Ã§â€Â¨Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¦Â»Â¡Ã¦â€žÂÃ¥ÂºÂ¦Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â³â€¢</b>: Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¤Â½Â¿Ã§â€Â¨Ã¥Â¸Â¸Ã¨Â§â€žÃ§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã§â€ºâ€˜Ã¦Âµâ€¹Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¤Â¼Â°Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¥Â¾â€”Ã¥Ë†Â°Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦â€¢Â°Ã¦ÂÂ®, Ã¥Å“Â¨2020Ã¥Â¹Â´6Ã¦Å“Ë†Ã¦â€Â¿Ã¥ÂºÅ“Ã¦Å½ÂªÃ¦â€“Â½Ã¦â€Â¾Ã¦ÂÂ¾Ã¤Â¹â€¹Ã¥â€°ÂÃ§â€Â±Ã¥ÂÂÃ¥Å“Â¨Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¥Â®Â¶Ã¤Â¸â€œÃ¤Â¸Å¡Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã¦Å“ÂºÃ¦Å¾â€žÃ¦Å½Â¥Ã¥Ââ€”Ã¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¥Â®Å’Ã¦Ë†ÂÃ¥ÂÅ Ã§Â®Â¡Ã§Ââ€ Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ¤Âºâ€ Ã¥Â¹Â¸Ã§Â¦ÂÃ¦â€žÅ¸ (Ã§Â®â‚¬Ã§Å¸Â­Ã§â€°Ë†Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã©â€”Â®Ã¥ÂÂ·, Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã§â€°Â¹Ã©â€¡Å’Ã¥Â°â€Ã©ËœÂ¶Ã¦Â¢Â¯Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¡Â¨, Ã¦â€žÅ¸Ã§Å¸Â¥Ã¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¦Â°Â´Ã¥Â¹Â³Ã¥â€™Å’Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã¦â€Â¹Ã¥ÂËœ), VCTÃ¤Â½Â¿Ã§â€Â¨Ã¥â€™Å’VCTÃ¦Â»Â¡Ã¦â€žÂÃ¥ÂºÂ¦, Ã¥ÂÅ Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥ÂÂ£Ã§Â»Å¸Ã¨Â®Â¡Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã¥ÂËœÃ©â€¡Â (Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¥Ë†Â«, Ã¥Â¹Â´Ã©Â¾â€ž, Ã¥Ââ€”Ã¦â€¢â„¢Ã¨â€šÂ²Ã¦Â°Â´Ã¥Â¹Â³Ã¥â€™Å’Ã©Å¡Â¾Ã¦Â°â€˜Ã¨ÂºÂ«Ã¤Â»Â½) Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥â€¦Â³Ã§Â³Â»Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“</b>: Ã¥Å“Â¨318Ã¥ÂÂÃ¥Âºâ€Ã§Â­â€Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¤Â¸Â­ (Ã¥Âºâ€Ã§Â­â€Ã§Å½â€¡Ã¤Â¸Âº64.5Ã¯Â¼â€¦), Ã¦Å“â€°139Ã¥ÂÂ (43.7Ã¯Â¼â€¦) Ã¦Å Â¥Ã¥â€˜Å Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã¥Â¢Å¾Ã¥Å Â , Ã¨Â¿â„¢Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã¥â€ Â Ã§Å Â¶Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦Â¯â€™Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¦Â°Â´Ã¥Â¹Â³Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¨Ë†Â¬Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã§Â²Â¾Ã§Â¥Å¾Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦Â°Â´Ã¥Â¹Â³Ã¨Â¾Æ’Ã©Â«ËœÃ¤Â»Â¥Ã¥ÂÅ Ã§â€Å¸Ã¦Â´Â»Ã¦Â»Â¡Ã¦â€žÂÃ¥ÂºÂ¦Ã¨Â¾Æ’Ã¤Â½Å½Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Â¹Â´Ã©Â¾â€žÃ¥â€™Å’Ã¥Ââ€”Ã¦â€¢â„¢Ã¨â€šÂ²Ã¦Â°Â´Ã¥Â¹Â³Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¥Â¹Â¸Ã§Â¦ÂÃ¦â€žÅ¸Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¦ËœÂ¾Ã¨â€˜â€”Ã¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ£â‚¬â€š 228Ã¥ÂÂ (71.7Ã¯Â¼â€¦) Ã¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¦Å Â¥Ã¥â€˜Å Ã¤Â½Â¿Ã§â€Â¨Ã¤Âºâ€ VCTÃ£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Â¥Â³Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¦Â°Â´Ã¥Â¹Â³Ã¨Â¾Æ’Ã¤Â½Å½ (r = Ã¢Ë†â€™.20, <i>p</i>&lt;.01) Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¨Ë†Â¬Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã§Â²Â¾Ã§Â¥Å¾Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦Â°Â´Ã¥Â¹Â³Ã¨Â¾Æ’Ã¤Â½Å½ (<i>r</i> = .21, <i>p</i> &lt; .01) Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤ÂºÂºÃ§Å¡â€žVCTÃ¦Â»Â¡Ã¦â€žÂÃ¥ÂºÂ¦Ã¨Â¾Æ’Ã©Â«ËœÃ£â‚¬â€šÃ¤Â½Â¿Ã§â€Â¨VCTÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã¦Å“ÂªÃ¤Â½Â¿Ã§â€Â¨VCTÃ¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¤Â¹â€¹Ã©â€”Â´Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¦Â»Â¡Ã¦â€žÂÃ¥ÂºÂ¦Ã¦â€”Â Ã¥Â·Â®Ã¥Â¼â€š (Ã¥Â¹Â³Ã¥Ââ€¡Ã¥Â·Â®Ã¥Â¼â€š= Ã¢Ë†â€™.09 95Ã¯Â¼â€¦CI:- 79Ã¨â€¡Â³.62, <i>p</i>= .81) Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¨Â®Âº</b>: Ã¦Â Â¹Ã¦ÂÂ®Ã¥Â¤Â§Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¦Å½Â¥Ã¥Ââ€”Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦, Ã¥â€ Â Ã§Å Â¶Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦Â¯â€™Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¥Å Â Ã¥â€°Â§Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã©â€”Â®Ã©Â¢ËœÃ£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Â°Â½Ã§Â®Â¡Ã¥Ââ€˜Ã§Å½Â°VCTÃ¦ËœÂ¯Ã¥ÂÂ¯Ã¦Å½Â¥Ã¥Ââ€”Ã§Å¡â€ž, Ã¤Â½â€ Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¤ÂºÅ½Ã©Å¡Â¾Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã¨Å½Â·Ã¥Ââ€“VCTÃ¦Å“ÂºÃ¤Â¼Å¡Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§â€°Â¹Ã¥Â®Å¡Ã§â€ºÂ®Ã¦Â â€¡Ã§Â¾Â¤Ã¤Â½â€œ (Ã¤Â¾â€¹Ã¥Â¦â€šÃ©Å¡Â¾Ã¦Â°â€˜) Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¨Ë†Â¬Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã§Â²Â¾Ã§Â¥Å¾Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦Â°Â´Ã¥Â¹Â³Ã¨Â¾Æ’Ã©Â«ËœÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦, Ã¥ÂÂ¯Ã¨Æ’Â½Ã¤Â»ÂÃ§â€žÂ¶Ã©Å“â‚¬Ã¨Â¦ÂÃ©ÂÂ¢Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã©ÂÂ¢Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã£â‚¬â€š.","Ter Heide, de la Rie, de Haan, Boeschoten, Nijdam, Smid, Wind, Mooren","https://doi.org/10.1080/20008198.2021.1906021","20210524","Coronavirus; clinical videoconferencing; general psychopathology; life satisfaction; psychotrauma; symptom change; treatment satisfaction; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-25","",14010,""
"Studying leaders &amp; their concerns using online social media during the times of crisis - A COVID case study","Online social media (OSM) has emerged as a prominent platform for debate on a wide range of issues. Even celebrities and public figures often share their opinions on a variety of topics through OSM platforms. One such subject that has gained a lot of coverage on Twitter is the Novel Coronavirus, officially known as COVID-19, which has become a pandemic and has sparked a crisis in human history. In this study, we examine 29 million tweets over three months to study highly influential users, whom we refer to as leaders. We recognize these leaders through social network techniques and analyse their tweets using text analysis. Using a community detection algorithm, we categorize these leaders into four clusters: <i>research</i>, <i>news</i>, <i>health</i>, and <i>politics</i>, with each cluster containing Twitter handles (accounts) of individual users or organizations. e.g., the <i>health</i> cluster includes the World Health Organization (@WHO), the Director-General of WHO (@DrTedros), and so on. The emotion analysis reveals that (i) all clusters show an equal amount of <i>fear</i> in their tweets, (ii) <i>research</i> and <i>news</i> clusters display more <i>sadness</i> than others, and (iii) <i>health</i> and <i>politics</i> clusters are attempting to win public <i>trust</i>. According to the text analysis, the (i) <i>research</i> cluster is more concerned with recognizing <i>symptoms</i> and the development of <i>vaccination</i>; (ii) <i>news</i> and <i>politics</i> clusters are mostly concerned with <i>travel</i>. We then show that we can use our findings to classify tweets into clusters with a score of 96% AUC ROC.","Goel, Sharma","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13278-021-00756-w","20210524","COVID-19; Community detection; LDA; OSM; PageRank; Sentiment analysis; Social Network","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-25","",14011,""
"Feasibility of a Brief Online Mindfulness and Compassion-Based Intervention to Promote Mental Health Among University Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic constitutes a global mental health challenge that has disrupted the lives of millions of people, with a considerable effect on university students. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of a brief online Mindfulness and Compassion-based Intervention to promote mental health among first year university students during COVID-19 home confinement. Participants (<i>n</i>=66) were first-year psychology students from a university in Spain with no prior meditation experience. Intervention lasted for 16 days and was designed ad-hoc. Using a pre-post within-subjects design, feasibility was assessed in five domains (acceptability, satisfaction, implementation, practicality, and limited efficacy testing). Participants completed both baseline and post-intervention assessments of perceived stress, anxiety, and self-compassion. The intervention showed to be feasible in all domains evaluated. It was implemented as planned with constrained resources, and limited efficacy testing showed promising results. After the intervention, stress and anxiety levels decreased significantly (<i>p</i>&lt;0.001, Hedges's g=0.5146; <i>p</i>&lt;0.001, Hedges's g=0.6068, respectively) whereas self-compassion levels were augmented significantly (<i>p</i>&lt;0.001, Hedges's g=0.6968). Our findings suggest that a brief online mindfulness and compassion intervention may be a feasible way of promoting mental health among university students during COVID-19 lockdown. Further studies are required to address the limitations of the present study. We conclude that online interventions may constitute a promising pathway to buffer the mental health burden derived from the COVID-19 pandemic.","GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-GarcÃƒÂ­a, ÃƒÂlvarez, PÃƒÂ©rez, Fernandez-Carriba, LÃƒÂ³pez","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12671-021-01632-6","20210524","COVID-19; Compassion; Mental health; Mindfulness; Online; University students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-25","",14012,""
"Alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic in Latin America and the Caribbean","To assess the association between drinking behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine, anxiety symptoms, and sociodemographic characteristics in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Data was collected through a cross-sectional online survey (non-probabilistic sample) conducted by the Pan American Health Organization between May 22 and June 30, 2020, in 33 countries and two territories of LAC. Participants were 18 years of age or older and must not have traveled outside of their country since March 15, 2020 (<i>n</i>= 12 328, <i>M</i> age= 38.1 years, 65% female). Four drinking behaviors (online socializing drinking [OSD], drinking with child present [DCP], drinking before 5 p.m. [DB5]), heavy episodic drinking [HED]) were response variables, and quarantining, anxiety symptoms and sociodemographic covariables were explanatory variables. Quarantine was positively associated with a higher frequency of OSD and with DCP, but negatively associated with a higher frequency of HED. Anxiety symptoms were associated with a higher frequency of HED, more OSD, and DB5. Higher incomes seemed to be more associated with all the studied drinking behaviors. Women tended to report less DB5 and less HED during the pandemic. Quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic seems to affect drinking behavior and mental health indicators like anxiety symptoms. This study is the first effort to measure the consequences of the quarantine on alcohol consumption and mental health in LAC during the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering the associations found, screenings and brief interventions targeting alcohol consumption and mental health are recommended. Evaluar la asociaciÃƒÂ³n entre comportamientos relacionados con el consumo de alcohol durante la pandemia de COVID-19 y la cuarentena, los sÃƒÂ­ntomas de ansiedad y las caracterÃƒÂ­sticas sociodemogrÃƒÂ¡ficas en AmÃƒÂ©rica Latina y el Caribe. Se recopilaron datos mediante una encuesta transversal en lÃƒÂ­nea (muestra no probabilÃƒÂ­stica) realizada por la OrganizaciÃƒÂ³n Panamericana de la Salud entre el 22 de mayo y el 30 de junio del 2020 en 33 paÃƒÂ­ses y 2 territorios de AmÃƒÂ©rica Latina y el Caribe. Los participantes tenÃƒÂ­an 18 aÃƒÂ±os o mÃƒÂ¡s y no tenÃƒÂ­an que haber viajado fuera de su paÃƒÂ­s despuÃƒÂ©s del 15 de marzo del 2020 (<i>n</i>= 12 328, edad <i>M</i>= 38,1 aÃƒÂ±os, 65% mujeres). Las variables de respuesta eran cuatro comportamientos relacionados con el consumo de alcohol: beber socializando en lÃƒÂ­nea, beber en presencia de niÃƒÂ±os, beber antes de las 5 de la tarde o consumo excesivo episÃƒÂ³dico. La cuarentena, los sÃƒÂ­ntomas de ansiedad y las covariables sociodemogrÃƒÂ¡ficas fueron las variables explicativas. La cuarentena se relacionÃƒÂ³ positivamente con una mayor frecuencia de consumo de alcohol socializando en lÃƒÂ­nea y en presencia de niÃƒÂ±os, pero negativamente con una mayor frecuencia de consumo excesivo episÃƒÂ³dico. Los sÃƒÂ­ntomas de ansiedad se relacionaron con una mayor frecuencia de consumo excesivo de alcohol, un mayor consumo de alcohol socializando en lÃƒÂ­nea y con beber antes de las 5 de la tarde. Aparentemente los ingresos mÃƒÂ¡s altos estuvieron mÃƒÂ¡s asociados con todos los comportamientos relacionados con el consumo del alcohol estudiados. Las mujeres tendieron a notificar menos consumo de alcohol antes de las 5 de la tarde y menos consumo excesivo episÃƒÂ³dico de alcohol durante la pandemia. La cuarentena durante la pandemia de COVID-19 parece afectar el comportamiento relacionado con el consumo de alcohol y los indicadores de salud mental, como los sÃƒÂ­ntomas de ansiedad. Este estudio es la primera iniciativa para medir las consecuencias de la cuarentena sobre el comportamiento relacionado con el consumo de alcohol y la salud mental en AmÃƒÂ©rica Latina y el Caribe durante la pandemia de COVID-19. Dadas las asociaciones encontradas, se recomienda llevar a cabo pruebas de tamizaje e intervenciones breves para abordar el consumo del alcohol y la salud mental. Avaliar a associaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o entre comportamentos relacionados ao uso de ÃƒÂ¡lcool durante a pandemia de COVID-19 e quarentena, sintomas de ansiedade e caracterÃƒÂ­sticas sociodemogrÃƒÂ¡ficas na AmÃƒÂ©rica Latina e no Caribe (ALC). Os dados foram coletados em uma pesquisa transversal online (amostra nÃƒÂ£o probabilÃƒÂ­stica) realizada pela OrganizaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o Pan-Americana da SaÃƒÂºde (OPAS) em 33 paÃƒÂ­ses e dois territÃƒÂ³rios da ALC entre 22 de maio e 30 de junho de 2020. Participaram da pesquisa pessoas com 18 anos ou mais de idade que nÃƒÂ£o haviam feito viagens ao exterior desde 15 de marÃƒÂ§o de 2020 (<i>n</i> = 12 328, mediana [<i>M</i>] de idade = 38,1 anos, 65% do sexo feminino). Quatro comportamentos relacionados ao uso de ÃƒÂ¡lcool (socializaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o online com o uso de ÃƒÂ¡lcool, uso de ÃƒÂ¡lcool na presenÃƒÂ§a de crianÃƒÂ§as, uso de ÃƒÂ¡lcool antes das 5 da tarde e episÃƒÂ³dios de consumo excessivo de ÃƒÂ¡lcool) foram as variÃƒÂ¡veis de resposta e quarentena, sintomas de ansiedade e covariÃƒÂ¡veis sociodemogrÃƒÂ¡ficas foram as variÃƒÂ¡veis explicativas. A quarentena teve uma associaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o positiva com uma maior frequÃƒÂªncia de socializaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o online com o uso de ÃƒÂ¡lcool e o uso de ÃƒÂ¡lcool na presenÃƒÂ§a de crianÃƒÂ§as, mas demonstrou uma associaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o negativa com uma maior frequÃƒÂªncia de episÃƒÂ³dios de consumo excessivo de ÃƒÂ¡lcool. Sintomas de ansiedade foram associados a uma maior frequÃƒÂªncia de episÃƒÂ³dios de consumo excessivo de ÃƒÂ¡lcool, socializaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o online com uso de ÃƒÂ¡lcool e uso de ÃƒÂ¡lcool antes das 5 da tarde. Houve uma aparente associaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o entre maior nÃƒÂ­vel de renda e todos os comportamentos relacionados ao uso de ÃƒÂ¡lcool estudados. As mulheres em geral relataram menos uso de ÃƒÂ¡lcool antes das 5 da tarde e menos episÃƒÂ³dios de consumo excessivo de ÃƒÂ¡lcool durante a pandemia. A quarentena durante a pandemia de COVID-19 parece influenciar o comportamento relacionado ao uso de ÃƒÂ¡lcool e indicadores de saÃƒÂºde mental, como sintomas de ansiedade. Este ÃƒÂ© o primeiro estudo que procurou dimensionar a repercussÃƒÂ£o da quarentena no uso de ÃƒÂ¡lcool e na saÃƒÂºde mental das pessoas na ALC durante a pandemia de COVID-19. Diante das associaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂµes observadas, recomenda-se rastrear problemas relacionados ao uso de ÃƒÂ¡lcool e de saÃƒÂºde mental e oferecer intervenÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂµes breves.","Garcia-Cerde, Valente, Sohi, Falade, Sanchez, Monteiro","https://doi.org/10.26633/RPSP.2021.52","20210524","Alcoholism; Americas; alcohol drinking; anxiety; coronavirus infections; mental health; pandemics; quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-25","",14013,""

"Depression and Creativity During COVID-19: Psychological Resilience as a Mediator and Deliberate Rumination as a Moderator","<b>Purpose:</b> The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has had a significant impact on people's lives, has apparently increased the incidence of depression. Although the topic of how depression affects creativity is contested, previous research has revealed a significant relationship between the two. The purpose of this study is to further investigate the relationship and the mechanisms that operate between depression and creativity. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 881 students at an independent college in China completed a questionnaire consisting of the Self-Reported Depression Scale, Runco Ideational Behavior Scale, Psychological Resilience Scale, Deliberate Rumination Scale and demographic information. Among the respondents, 317 (36.0%) were male and 564 (64.0%) were female, all of whom were from the same grade. Correlation analyses were conducted, and then the researchers carried out mediation analysis and developed a moderated mediation model. <b>Results:</b> The results indicated that (a) depression was positively related to creativity (<i>r</i> = 0.085, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05); (b) psychological resilience mediated the relationship between depression and creativity; specifically, psychological resilience was negatively related to depression (<i>r</i> = -0.462, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), which in turn was positively related to creativity (<i>r</i> = 0.198, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01); and (c) deliberate rumination moderated the relationship between depression and psychological resilience, showing a significant negative correlation with depression (<i>r</i> = 0.138, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), psychological resilience (<i>r</i> = 0.078, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), and creativity (<i>r</i> = 0.288, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05); specifically, higher levels of deliberate rumination strengthened the negative correlation between psychological resilience and depression. <b>Conclusion:</b> The results suggest that depression is a positive predictor of creativity and may promote creativity to some extent. Further, individuals with greater psychological resilience are more creative than those with less psychological resilience, as it is a question of whether they can and to what extent they can effectively use depression as an emotional resource. Last, an individual's level of deliberate rumination moderates the mediating process, especially at the stage where depression is associated with psychological resilience. These findings advance understanding of the mechanisms that operate between depression and creativity.","Xu, Shao, Zeng, Wu, Huang, Zeng, Wu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.665961","20210524","college students; creativity; deliberate rumination; depression; moderated mediation model; psychological resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-25","",14015,""
"COVID-19 Pandemic and Physical Exercise: Lessons Learnt for Confined Communities","The novel pandemic called &quot;Coronavirus Disease 2019&quot; (COVID-19), as a global public health emergency and global threat, has affected many countries in unpredictable ways and impacted on physical activity (PA) behaviors to various extents. Specific populations including refugees, asylum seekers, and prisoners, are vulnerable groups with multiple complex health needs and worse health outcomes with respect to the general population worldwide and at high risk of death from the &quot;Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus type 2&quot; (SARS-CoV-2). Governments around the world have been implementing preventive healthcare policies, including physical and social distancing, isolation, and confinement, to mitigate against the burden imposed by the COVID-19 outbreak. This pandemic period is characterized by reduced or lack of movement. During this period of lockdown, PA can represent an immunotherapy and a preventative approach to avoid the harmful effects of inactivity due to the pandemic. Moreover, PA could be prescribed to improve the immune system of specific populations (refugees, asylum seekers, and prisoners), which particularly experience the condition of being confined. The present narrative review discusses the potential impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on these specific populations' health status and the importance of performing PA/exercise to reduce the deleterious effects of COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we aim to provide useful recommendations on PA/exercise for these specific populations to maintain their level of independence, physical, and mental health as well as their wellbeing.","Ghram, Bragazzi, Briki, Jenab, Khaled, Haddad, Chamari","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.618585","20210524","coronavirus; exercise; health; incarcerated; physical activity; prison; sedentary","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-25","",14016,""
"Depression and Suicidal Ideation in a Sample of Malaysian Healthcare Workers: A Preliminary Study During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Objective:</b> The burden of suicidal behavior is anticipated to increase as a sequela of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is limited evidence on suicidal behavior among healthcare workers, an at-risk population. Our study aimed to investigate suicidal ideation in terms of the rate and associated factors in a sample of Malaysian healthcare workers during the early-phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> A subpopulation analysis (<i>N</i> = 171) was conducted within a larger, nation-wide cross-sectional study of Malaysian healthcare worker psychological distress from March 18-21, 2020. Current suicidal ideation was measured with item 9 of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The following independent variables were assessed: socio-demographic profile, occupation and service-related factors, health-anxiety (Health Anxiety Inventory, HAI), lifetime anxiety disorder and severity of depression (PHQ-9). <b>Results:</b> The proportion of healthcare workers with current suicidal ideation (19/171) and clinical depression (17/171) were 11.1 and 9.9%, respectively. Multivariable analysis showed that clinical depression was the most significant factor associated with current suicidal ideation (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, OR = 55.983, 95% CI = 9.015-347.671) followed by mild (subthreshold) depression (<i>p</i> = 0.001, OR = 115.984, 95% CI = 2.977-85.804). Service duration of more than 10 years was associated with significantly less suicidal ideation (<i>p</i> = 0.049, OR = 0.072, 95% CI = 0.005-0.993). <b>Conclusions:</b> Depression (subthreshold and especially within the clinical range) and early-career status (&lt;10 years in service) may be target areas of early intervention for reduction of suicidal ideation amongst healthcare workers who have served during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research is warranted to elucidate specific occupational stressors related to COVID-19 work conditions to tailor appropriate suicide preventive strategies in this population.","Sahimi, Mohd Daud, Chan, Shah, Rahman, Nik Jaafar","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.658174","20210524","COVID-19 pandemic; Malaysia; early phase; health-care workers; suicidal ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-25","",14017,""

The findings of the study show a positive effect of fear of COVID-19 on stress with <i>ÃŽÂ²</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.27, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05, and a negative effect on well-being (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-.13, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). The results also depicted the mediating role of stress between fear of COVID-19 and well-being. Therefore, it is suggested that measures must be taken by individuals, society, and policy makers to include mental health maintenance in the pandemic response activities. Further longitudinal studies in different geographical regions and demographics can provide a more generalized understanding of the relationship between the pandemic and mental health.

"Culture and mental health resilience in times of COVID-19","This paper aims to clarify the role of culture as a public good that serves to preserve mental health. It tests the evolutionary hypothesis that cultural consumption triggers a microeconomic mechanism for the self-defense of mental health from uncertainty. The COVID-19 pandemic offers a natural experiment of cultural consumption under increased uncertainty. Using primary data from a pilot survey conducted online during the pandemic and applying Probit and Heckman selection models, the study analyzes levels of happiness and propensity to help others. The results suggest that past consumption of culture is associated with higher happiness levels during crises. Moreover, spontaneous cultural practices (such as group singing) during times of uncertainty are associated with an increase in the pro-social propensity to help others. These findings highlight culture as a tool for promoting mental health at the micro level and social capital resilience at the aggregate level.","Tubadji","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00148-021-00840-7","20210524","Anxiety; COVID-19; Culture; Happiness; Mental health; Social capital","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-25","",14019,""
"Anxiety effects on quality of life during the COVID-19 outbreak: A parallel-serial mediation model among nurses in Turkey","Nurses experience loneliness, anxiety, fear, fatigue, sleep disorders, and other physical and mental health problems due to their close contact with patients in cases of epidemic diseases. Among nurses in Turkey, we want to explore how anxiety, psychological health, and social isolation affect nurses' quality of life. This study aimed to investigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the quality of life (COVID-19 EQLS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-1 and STAI-2), psychological health, and social isolation among nurses. It also aimed to identify whether the influence of trait anxiety, psychological health, and social isolation are stronger than the direct influence of state anxiety on nurses' quality of life during the pandemic. A cross-sectional study design and STROBE guidelines were implemented. In this study, 638 nurses in Turkey were included using simple random sampling. The participants completed the STAI-1 and STAI-2 and COVID-19 EQLS online-form. The parallel-serial mediation model was used to examine the relationships between the determined variables. Psychological health, psychological effects of social isolation, and trait anxiety fully mediated the relationship between state anxiety and quality of life of nurses. The total indirect effect of the confidence interval of bootstrapping was statistically different from zero. Trait anxiety, psychological health, and social isolation were the main factors with statistically significant indirect effects on the quality of life of Turkish nurses in this study.","Potas, KoÃƒÂ§tÃƒÂ¼rk, Toygar","https://doi.org/10.3233/WOR-205050","20210524","Anxiety; pandemic; psychological health; social isolation; trait anxiety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-25","",14020,""
"The effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on anxiety, depression, and musculoskeletal system complaints in healthcare workers","COVID-19 increased psychological and physical complaints, including anxiety, depression, and pain. We aimed to examine anxiety, depression, and musculoskeletal complaints that may occur in healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were cross-sectional, collected by the online questionnaire method consisted of demographic questions, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Nordic Musculoskeletal System Query (NMQ), and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Among the groups, the number of doctors in the frontline group, the fear of being infected, the number of tests performed, and personal protective equipment were higher than the second-line group (pÃ¢â‚¬Å &lt; Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.05). It was found that 73.4%of the participants had anxiety, 83.5%had depression, and 94.9%had musculoskeletal pain. It was observed that there was no statistically significant difference between the applied scale scores between the groups (pÃ¢â‚¬Å &gt; Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.05). About musculoskeletal system complaints of the participants, neck pain presence was determined as 73.4%in the last 12 months, and upper back pain was the highest with 61.4%in the last week. Neck (pÃ¢â‚¬Å &lt; Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.005) and upper back pain (pÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.04) parameters in the last seven days of the NMQ scale applied to the participants were found to be statistically significantly higher in the contact group. Anxiety, depression, and musculoskeletal pain of healthcare workers were found to be high. While neck and back pain was the most common in musculoskeletal complaints, it was found that these pains were higher in the frontline group.

"'Relieved to be seen'-patient and carer experiences of psychosocial assessment in the emergency department following self-harm: qualitative analysis of 102 free-text survey responses","We sought to explore patient and carer experiences of psychosocial assessments following presentations to hospital after self-harm. Thematic analysis of free-text responses to an open-ended online survey. Between March and November 2019, we recruited 88 patients (82% women) and 14 carers aged Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years from 16 English mental health trusts, community organisations, and via social media. Psychosocial assessments were experienced as helpful on some occasions but harmful on others. Participants felt better, less suicidal and less likely to repeat self-harm after good-quality compassionate and supportive assessments. However, negative experiences during the assessment pathway were common and, in some cases, contributed to greater distress, less engagement and further self-harm. Participants reported receiving negative and stigmatising comments about their injuries. Others reported that they were refused medical care or an anaesthetic. Stigmatising attitudes among some mental health staff centred on preconceived ideas over self-harm as a 'behavioural issue', inappropriate use of services and psychiatric diagnosis. Our findings highlight important patient experiences that can inform service provision and they demonstrate the value of involving patients/carers throughout the research process. Psychosocial assessments can be beneficial when empathetic and collaborative but less helpful when overly standardised, lacking in compassion and waiting times are unduly long. Patient views are essential to inform practice, particularly given the rapidly changing service context during and after the COVID-19 emergency.","Quinlivan, Gorman, Littlewood, Monaghan, Barlow, Campbell, Webb, Kapur","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-044434","20210524","psychiatry; quality in healthcare; suicide &amp; self-harm","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-25","",14022,""

After NAFLD screening in an outpatient Infectious Diseases Clinic, NAFLD patients were randomly allocated to general dietary recommendations (SC group) or to a structured dietary intervention based on the Mediterranean diet (intervention group). During lockdown, follow-up consultations in the intervention group were done by video and/or phone. After 3 months of lockdown, all patients (intervention and SC group) consented to a telephone interview which aimed to characterize eating habits and lifestyle changes and evaluate stress and depression. Biochemical data when available, was compared between the peri-period of confinement. One hundred and twelve patients were screened. From the 55 NAFDL identified, 27 were allocated to dietary intervention and 28 to SC and were followed before lockdown for a mean period of 5.0Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 1.5 months in which SC group gained a median of 0.65Ã‚Â kg vs. a median loss of 1.5Ã‚Â kg in the intervention group (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001).

"Understanding and Promoting Racial Diversity in Healthcare Settings to Address Disparities in Pandemic Crisis Management","Health disparities have become apparent since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. When observing racial discrimination in healthcare, self-reported incidences, and perceptions among minority groups in the United States suggest that, the most socioeconomically underrepresented groups will suffer disproportionately in COVID-19 due to synergistic mechanisms. This study reports racially-stratified data regarding the experiences and impacts of different groups availing the healthcare system to identify disparities in outcomes of minority and majority groups in the United States. Studies were identified utilizing PubMed, Embase, CINAHL Plus, and PsycINFO search engines without date and language restrictions. The following keywords were used: Healthcare, raci*, ethnic*, discriminant, hosti*, harass*, insur*, education, income, psychiat*, COVID-19, incidence, mortality, mechanical ventilation. Statistical analysis was conducted in Review Manager (RevMan V.5.4). Unadjusted Odds Ratios, <i>P</i>-values, and 95% confidence intervals were presented. Discrimination in the United States is evident among racial groups regarding medical care portraying mental risk behaviors as having serious outcomes in the health of minority groups. The perceived health inequity had a low association to the majority group as compared to the minority group (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.41; 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.22 to 0.78; <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.007), and the association of mental health problems to the Caucasian-American majority group was low (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.51; 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.45 to 0.58; <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). As the pandemic continues into its next stage, efforts should be taken to address the gaps in clinical training and education, and medical practice to avoid the recurring patterns of racial health disparities that become especially prominent in community health emergencies. A standardized tool to assess racial discrimination and inequity will potentially improve pandemic healthcare delivery.","Sarfraz, Sarfraz, Barrios, Agadi, Thevuthasan, Pandav, Kc, Sarfraz, Rad, Michel","https://doi.org/10.1177/21501327211018354","20210524","COVID-19; discrimination; ethnicity; health disparities; health inequity; race","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-25","",14027,""
"Prevalence of depression, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms among patients with COVID-19: A meta-analysis of quality effects model","Evidence from previous virus epidemics has shown that infected patients are at risk for developing psychiatric and mental health disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Hence, to collect high-quality data on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 should be the immediate priority. A comprehensive search of Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases was conducted from January 1, 2020 to December 26, 2020 for eligible studies reporting on the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms in patients with COVID-19. Studies meeting the following criteria were included in the analysis: (1) included patients with COVD-19; (2) recorded the prevalence of depression, anxiety, or insomnia symptom; (3) sample size Ã¢â€°Â¥30; (4) with validated screening tools; and (5) passed through the international peer-review process. Data extraction and quality assessment was independently performed by two reviewers. The quality effects meta-analysis was conducted further to calculate the pooled prevalence. Twenty-two studies were included for analysis with a total of 4318 patients. The pooled prevalence of depression, anxiety and insomnia symptoms was 38% (95% CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 25-51), 38% (95% CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 24-52), and 48% (95% CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 11-85), respectively. Neither subgroup analysis nor sensitivity analysis can explain the source of high heterogeneity. In addition, the prevalence estimates of depression, anxiety and insomnia symptoms varied based on different screening tools. The present systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that depression, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms are prevalent in a considerable proportion of patients with COVID-19. Thus, early detection and properly intervention for mental illness in this population are of great significance. Additionally, the quality of included studies to date has been variable, and ongoing surveillance is essential.","Liu, Pan, Li, Li, Ren, Ma","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2021.110516","20210523","Anxiety; COVID-19; Deprssion; Insomnia; Prevalence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-25","",14028,""

"Symptoms of Mental Health Disorders in Critical Care Clinicians Facing the COVID-19 Second Wave: A Cross-Sectional Study","Working in the ICU during the first COVID-19 wave was associated with high levels of mental health disorders. What are the mental health symptoms in healthcare providers (HCPs) facing the second wave? Cross-sectional study (October 30-December 1, 2020) in sixteen ICUs during the second wave in France. HCPs completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R, for posttraumatic stress disorder), and the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). There were 845/1203 (70%) respondents (66% nursing staff, 32% medical staff, 2% other professionals); 487 (57.6%) had managed more than ten new COVID-19 patients in the previous week. Insomnia affected 320 (37.9%) and 7.7% were taking a psychotropic drug daily. Symptoms of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and burnout were reported in 60.0% [95%CI, 56.6-63.3%], 36.1% [32.9-39.5%], 28.4% [25.4-31.6%], and 45.1% [41.7-48.5%] of respondents, respectively. Independent predictors of such symptoms included respondent characteristics (sex, profession, experience, personality traits), work organization (ability to rest and to care for family), and self-perceptions (fear of getting infected or infecting family and friends, feeling pressure related to the surge, intention to leave the ICU, lassitude, working conditions, feeling they had a high risk profession, and missing the clapping). The number of COVID-19 patients managed in the first wave or over the last week was not associated with symptoms of mental health disorders. The prevalence of symptoms of mental health disorders is high in ICU HCPs managing the second COVID-19 surge. The highest tiers of hospital management urgently need to provide psychological support, peer-support groups, and a communication structure that ensure the well-being of HCPs.","Azoulay, Cariou, Bruneel, Demoule, Kouatchet, Reuter, Klouche, Argaud, Barbier, Jourdain, Reignier, Papazian, Resche-Rigon, Guisset, LabbÃƒÂ©, Van Der Meersch, Guitton","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2021.05.023","20210523","anxiety; depression; nurses; pandemic; post-traumatic stress disorder; surge","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-25","",14030,""
"The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the mental health and work morale of radiographers within a conventional X-ray department","There is a plethora of literature that has described the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of healthcare staff worldwide. Our aim was to investigate the physical and mental demands of mobile x-ray imaging on radiographers during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, within a local NHS Trust. A total of 16 participants from 1 NHS Trust took part within this study. Both quantitative and qualitative data was obtained through an online survey. Statistical data was obtained via the Trust Radiology Information System (RIS). Data was gathered for the thirteen weeks from 23rd March to 21st June 2020 (the first wave); direct comparison was made to the same period in 2019. Three key themes emerged from the data. These include mental health challenges/work morale in Radiology, demand of mobile imaging and departmental and Trust-wide mental health support. Results indicate a high demand in mobile imaging which has made a significant difference in the working life of some radiographers. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the mental health of a proportion of radiographers at this Trust. Results indicate high workload and demand in mobile imaging has made a significant difference to the working life of radiographers, specifically the ones who were relatively newly qualified. Two key interventions are proposed from this study. The first one is to provide and promote mental health support within radiology departments. The second is to encourage dual working on mobile x-ray examinations to help manage the emotional and physical burden.","Yasin, Barlow, Milner","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radi.2021.04.008","20210523","Assistant practitioner; Coronavirus; Mobile; Radiography; Survey; UK","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-25","",14031,""
"Older adolescents and young adults willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine: Implications for informing public health strategies","The success in ending the COVID-19 pandemic rests partly on the mass uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine. Little work has been done to understand vaccine willingness among older adolescents and young adults. This is important since this age group may be less likely to adhere to public health guidelines. To understand willingness of getting a vaccine and reasons for vaccine hesitancy among a sample of older adolescents and young adults. Data were from the Well-Being and Experiences study (The WE Study), a longitudinal community-based sample of older adolescents and young adults collected from Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada from 2017 to 2020 (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 664). The study setting was a community-based observational longitudinal study. Participants for the study were aged 14 to 17Ã‚Â years old at baseline in 2016-17 (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1000). Data were also collected on one parent/caregiver. Waves 2 (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 747) and 3 (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 664) were collected in 2019 and 2020, respectively. The main exposures were sociodemographic factors, health conditions, COVID-19 knowledge, and adversity history. The main outcomes were COVID-19 vaccine willingness, hesitancy, and reasons for hesitancy. Willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine was 65.4%. Willingness did not differ by age, sex, or mental health conditions, but did differ for other sociodemographic characteristics, physical health conditions, COVID-19 knowledge, practicing social/physical distancing, and adversity history. The most common reasons for not wanting a vaccine were related to safety, knowledge, and effectiveness. Sex differences were noted. Increasing uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine among older adolescents and young adults may rely on targeting individuals from households with lower income, financial burden, and adversity history, and generating public health messaging specifically aimed at vaccine safety, how it works to protect against illness, and why it is important to protect oneself against a COVID-19 infection.","Afifi, Salmon, Taillieu, Stewart-Tufescu, Fortier, Driedger","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.05.026","20210523","Adolescents; COVID-19; Public health; Vaccine hesitancy; Young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-25","",14032,""

"An investigation of the association between religious coping, fatigue, anxiety and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in Morocco: a web-based cross-sectional survey","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has triggered fear and distress among the public, thus potentiating the incidence rate of anxiety and depression. This study aims to investigate the psychological effect of quarantine on persons living in Morocco when the first COVID-19 cases were identified. The associations between anxiety, depression symptoms, and their predictors (sociodemographics, fatigue, and religious coping) were examined. A web-based cross-sectional survey, with a total of 1435 participants (Ã¢â€°Â¥18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years) recruited anonymously, was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic (from 3 to 30 April 2020). A structured questionnaire was used to assess psychosocial factors, COVID-19 epidemic-related factors, and religious coping. Religious coping, fatigue, and depression, and anxiety were measured by Brief Religious Coping Scale (Brief RCOPE), Chalder Fatigue Scale (CFS), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), respectively. A generalized linear model (logistic regression) was used to determine the predictive factors of depression and anxiety. The prevalence of anxiety and depression was 43.0% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°621) and 53.0% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°766), respectively. Both were associated with female gender, household income decline, tracking COVID-19 news, and fear to contract COVID-19 (aORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.36 to 2.85). Additionally, 32.0% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°453) and 26.0% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°372) reported severe physical fatigue, and mental fatigue, respectively. Both latter factors were significantly and positively associated with depression as well as with anxiety. Depressive and anxious patients used more negative religious coping, while positive religious coping was slightly associated with depression. In this online survey of the general population in Morocco, anxiety and depressive symptoms are prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pandemic and psychosocial factors, such as female gender, income decline, infection fears, massive COVID-19 news exposure, negative religious coping, and fatigue were associated with increased risk of depression and anxiety symptoms. Psychosocial and financial support should be provided to the quarantined population.","Zarrouq, Abbas, Hilaly, Asri, Abbouyi, Omari, Malki, Bouazza, Moutawakkil, Halim, Ragala","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03271-6","20210523","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Fatigue; Morocco; Quarantine; Religious coping","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-25","",14034,""
