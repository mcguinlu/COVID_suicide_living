"Collateral impact of COVID-19 on environmental health derived from improper disposition of masks","The use of masks by the general population as an element of personal protection against COVID-19 continued to rise during the first half of 2020, amid constant updates from the WHO about the target audience, their correct use and possible benefits, but where no protocols were defined for the management of the resulting waste. During the second half of 2020, the world population used 4.3 billion masks daily, of which 78.5% were discarded incorrectly, generating a volume of 2.61 (2.26-2.94;IC = 95%) million tons of waste disseminated in the environment. The plastic components incorporated in the manufacture of masks such as PP, PE and PET can take 400 years to degrade under environmental conditions, gradually fragmenting into microplastics, which affect the flora, fauna, water and soils of their environment. Additionally, some synthetic antioxidant additives (OA) used in the manufacture of plastics can further delay the degradation reactions of discarded masks into the environment, increasing their potential damage. It was calculated that 216.9 (188.5-245.3;IC = 95%) tons of AO168, 190 (165.2-214.9;IC = 96%) tons of AO168O and 442.7 (384.8-500.6;IC = 95%) tons of AO1010 were exposed to the environment due to the incorrect disposal of masks in the second half of 2020. Although the combined mass of these synthetic components only represents 0.017% of the masks discarded in the same period, its concentration is sufficient to increase the risk of damage to the environment.

"Lost Trust? The Experiences of Teachers and Students during Schooling Disrupted by the Covid-19 Pandemic","Namen prispevka je pomagati razumeti, kako se je odnosno zaupanje med ucenci in ucitelji, vgrajeno v proces poucevanja in ucenja, razvijalo med izrednim izobraÅ¾evanjem na daljavo in prilagodljivim hibridnim izobraÅ¾evanjem v Srbiji leta 2020. Opredeljuje tudi situacije v odnosih med ucenci in ucitelji, ki imajo potencial za obnovo in krepitev zaupanja. Da bi odnos med ucencem in uciteljem temeljil na zaupanju ter tako pripomogel k ucenju in dobremu pocutju ucencev, je treba doseci soglasje o pricakovanjih glede vlog. Ker je kriza covida-19 prekinila Å¡olanje in izobraÅ¾evanje, so se udeleÅ¾enci spoprijeli z negotovostjo in dvoumnostjo pri uveljavljanju vlog, poruÅ¡eni pa so bili tudi temelji odnosnega zaupanja. Da bi razumeli kontekst, v katerem je bilo zaupanje postavljeno pod vpraÅ¡aj, nacine, na katere je bilo poruÅ¡eno, in priloÅ¾nosti za njegovo ponovno vzpostavitev, smo se pri zbiranju podatkov oprli na vecvrstni pristop dinamicnega pripovedovanja zgodb, pri obdelavi podatkov pa na analizo vrednot. Skupaj 136 ucencev in 117 uciteljev iz 22 Å¡ol je napisalo 581 pripovedi treh vrst: zgodbe, pisma in proÅ¡nje.

It also identifies niches in student-teacher relationships that hold potential for repairing and building trust. For the student-teacher relationship to be trust-based and thus conducive to students learning and wellbeing, a consensus about role expectations must be achieved. As the Covid-19 crisis interrupted schooling and education, participants faced uncertainties and ambiguities in role enactment, and the cornerstones of relational trust were disrupted. In an effort to understand 1) the context in which trust was challenged, 2) the ways in which trust was disrupted, and 3) the opportunities for its restoration, we relied on a multi-genre dynamic storytelling approach to data collection and values analysis for data processing. A total of 136 students and 117 teachers from 22 schools wrote 581 narratives in three genres: stories, letters and requests. The analysis yielded 22 codes that allowed further understanding of how changes in structural and institutional conditions affected both students and teachers expectations of each other, and how incongruence of these expectations fed into feelings of helplessness for both students and teachers, disengagement from learning for students, and heavy workload and poor performance for teachers. In addition, the narratives account for positive outcomes when these expectations were met, and for opportunities for trust-building if students and teachers perspectives are brought to each others attention and negotiated locally. Finally, recommendations for restoring trust are given.","Zorkic, Tijana Jokic, Micic, Katarina, Cerovic, TÃ¼nde KovÃ¡cs","https://doi.org/10.26529/cepsj.1150","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: CEPS Journal : Center for Educational Policy Studies Journal; 11:1-24, 2021.; Publication details: CEPS Journal : Center for Educational Policy Studies Journal; 11:1-24, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19315,""

"Adherence to physical distancing guidelines on urban recreational trails during a pandemic","Use of urban trails and other green space during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic reached record highs around the world. Although the use of these resource amenities has been documented to have several physical and mental health benefits, the density of their use during the pandemic required managers to is-sue guidance and/or use requirements to mitigate the spread of the virus. Hence, this investigation sought to document adherence to commonly suggested physical distancing guidelines at 14 trails across six states in the United States. Trained research team members unobtrusively observed over 10,000 encounters between trail visitors. Results indicated that over half of visitor groups failed to allow for enough physical distancing between themselves and another party, suggesting a need for trail and green space managers to consider additional messaging and trail design changes to encourage greater adherence to future public health guidelines.

"Cnn applied in public transport for the protection against the covid-19 spread","With the Coronavirus becoming a huge threat, the world is experiencing a very uncertain situation. In Morocco, especially after confinement, the number of cases has increased dramatically;this sudden increase is due to several factors, including public transport. This is where our project derives its interest, because thanks to the many alternatives it offers, it reduces the risk of contamination, which makes it possible to reduce the cases of illnesses linked to Covid-19 as well as to reduce the rate of accidents. To achieve our goal, the transport will be equipped with new technologies boosted by artificial intelligence and other tools, a passenger so that he can board the bus must be wearing a facial mask detected through an artificial intelligence-based mask detector. Covid-19 not only affects the physical health of the person, but it has a major impact on mental health, especially for drivers who are more involved to be infected by the virus. For this, there is an emotion recognition system based on AI and social intelligence that detects the emotions of the driver and generates actions that correct, regulate and stabilize their emotional state.

"Evaluation of psychological status of 82 patients with rectal cancer after operation in Wuhan epidemic area of COVID-19 and the value of WeChat follow-up by doctors","Objective: To investigate the postoperative psychological status of rectal cancer patients during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in Wuhan, and to evaluate the outcomes of WeChat follow-up. Methods: A total of 41 patients with rectal cancer after operation were included into observation group and were followed up by doctors through WeChat, and another 41 postoperative cases without WeChat follow<U+2043>up were set as control group. The Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90), Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were adopted to evaluate all the patients' postoperative psychological status before discharge from hospital and two months later. Results: After two months, the scores of SCL-90, SAS, and SDS, respectively,of all patients showed significantly changes (t=1.487, 1.203, and 1.578, respectively, all P&lt;0.05), and their changes were more significant in observation group than in control group (t=1.267, 0.872, 0.755, respectively, all P&lt;0.05). No significant changes in the total scores of PSQI were found in control group (t=1.022, P&gt;0.05), but the total scores of PSQI in observation group showed a significant decrease after two months' WeChat follow<U+2043>up and were lower than in control group (t=8.369, P&lt;0.05). Conclusion: During the outbreaking of COVID<U+2043>19 epidemic in Wuhan, the scores of SCL-90, SAS, and SDS in the post<U+2043>operative patients were all decreased, but the total scores of PSQI in WeChat follow-up group was significantly lower than that in the control group.

"Stigma Related to COVID-19 Positive Patients in Jeddah - Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during 2020 Pandemic","Background: COVID-19 has contributed to the development of stigma in the community of Jeddah, thus causing negative attitudes and beliefs toward individuals linked to the disease. Objective: To describe stigma related to COVID-19 positive patients and find out factors associated with stigma subscales. Subjects and Methods: Analytical cross-sectional study conducted on COVID-19 positive patients (lab confirmed) in Jeddah. The sample size was 420 patients, and the data was collected using a validated questionnaire adapted from HIV/AIDS stigma instrument (HASI-P). The data were analysed using the statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS, version 27.0). Results: Total number of responses was (419). The median age was 32 (IQR, 25-43). Both genders, Saudi and non-Saudi, were included. The tool used to measure the COVID-19 related stigma of different six subscales. The verbal abuse had a median of (0, IQR=0-0.25), negative self-perception (median=0, IQR=0.02), health care neglect (median=0, IQR=0-0), social isolation (median=0.2, IQR=0-0.6), fear of contagion (median=0.33, IQR=0-0.83) and workplace stigma (median=0, IQR=0-0). Male gender was significantly associated with social isolation and fear of contagion, while working in the health care field was associated with workplace-related stigma. Conclusion: COVID-19-related social stigma was reported by a considerable number of Jeddah healthcare providers, specifically workplace-related stigma. Unexpectedly, males need more attention as regard to social isolation and fear of contagion. The results of this study can be of used to guide supportive social interventions to suppress the COVID-19 related stigma.","Milibary, A. A.; Mandoura, N.

"PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS AN COPING RESPONSES TO CONFINEMENT FOR COVID-19","Introduction Three days after the statement of the global pandemic situation on March 11 by the World Health Organization (WHO, 2020), the government of Spain implemented a state of alarm in order to confine the population (Real Decreto, 463/2020). The confinement of the population and the limitation of social contact, whose objective was the control of community transmission of the pathogen, have had indirect adverse effects on mental health and family relationships that have already been studied (FariÃ±a et al., 2020;Pampliega et al., 2019;RodrÃ­guez-Rey et al., 2020;Rubin & Wessely, 2020;Xiang et al., 2020). At first, research on the management of the COVID-19 pandemic, as a stressful event, focused on the population of health professionals, with controversial results. [...]some studies (Babore et al., 2020;Vagni et al., 2020) found an increase in the use of emotional and cognitive avoidance strategies -maladaptive, passive strategies-, reducing the use of social support strategies;while other studies found that they resorted more to active and problem-focused coping strategies -adaptive, active strategies(Cai et al., 2020;Huang et al., 2020). Taking into account the above, we set out a cross-sectional study in which to analyze the psychological distress caused by confinement in the general population, as well as to know the coping strategies used to manage the stress derived from the pandemic context, so that can be contributed useful knowledge for the design of prevention and empowerment programs for citizens.","Seto, Dolores, Montes, Ãlvaro, Marcos, VerÃ³nica, Sanmarco, Jessica, Novo, Mercedes","https://doi.org/10.5944/ap.18.1.31715","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: AcciÃ³n PsicolÃ³gica; 18(1):189-203, 2021.; Publication details: AcciÃ³n PsicolÃ³gica; 18(1):189-203, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19326,""

We conducted a mixed-methods study to identify the challenges experienced and the resources nurses drew upon during this first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the spring of 2020 in New York City (NYC). The qualitative data presented here are on 591 nurse participants in the qualitative arm of the study. Responses to qualitative questions were reviewed by one of the investigators to identify emerging themes. Two qualitative researchers used both deductive (guided by the Resilience Theory) and inductive approaches to analysis. Challenges identi fied by nurses included concerns about well-being and health risk;mental health symptoms such as depres sion, anxiety, and difficulty sleeping;fears about the ability to care for patients with severe life-threatening symptoms;and home-work challenges such as risk to family and friends;and lack of availability of institutional resources, particularly, personal protec tive equipment (PPE). Facilitators of resilience were institutional resources and support available;social support from coworkers, friends, and family;and positive professional identity. Recommendations for promoting resilience in future disaster/pandemic responses included clarification of disaster-related professional responsibilities, integration of disaster preparedness into professional education, and engage ment of nurses/frontline workers in preparation plan ning for disasters.

"Impact of occupational exposure to COVID-19 on the physical and mental health of an essential workgroup: New York City transit workers","Background and purpose: Early on in the COVID-19 pandemic, New York City (NYC) vowed to â€œkeep the subways runningâ€ despite the lack of plans in place for protecting the health and well-being of transit workers. This study was designed to assess the impact of employment during the early phase of the pandemic on this essential frontline workforce. Methods, settings, and study participants: A convenience sample of members (stratified by job title) of the NYC Transport Workers Union, Local 100, was recruited in August 2020 to participate in an anonymous, cross-sectional, internet-based survey. Results: The demographics of the sample participants (N = 645) reflected union membership, ie, 82 percent male, 29 percent Black;27 percent Hispanic, and 59 percent =age 50 years. At the time of the â€œNYC Pauseâ€ (March 22, 2020) when mandatory stay-at-home orders were issued, transit workers had limited worksite protections. Many reported a lack of such basics as face masks (43 percent), hand sanitizer (40 percent), and disposable gloves (34 percent). A high proportion (87 percent) were concerned about getting infected at work. Lack of certain protections was significantly associated with both fear of contagion at work and mental health symptoms. Nearly 24 percent of participants reported a history of COVID-19 infection. Self-reported infection was significantly correlated with lack of certain protections, including respiratory masks (p &lt; 0.001), disposable gloves (p &lt; 0.001), and hand sanitizer (p &lt; 0.001). Infection was also significantly associated with mental health symptoms (p &lt; 0.001). By August 2020, despite participants reporting that many worksite protections were then in place, 72 percent of workers were still fearful for their safety at work, eg, because of potential exposure due to passengers not wearing masks, and risk of verbal abuse and physical assault by passengers angered when asked to wear face masks. Workers who were fearful for their safety at work were more than six times more likely to report mental health symptoms (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Lack of worksite protections before â€œNYC Pauseâ€ (March 22, 2020) was significantly associated with self-reported infection, fear, and mental health symptoms in TWU, Local 100 members. To reduce the risk of adverse impacts associated with bioevents in all essential work groups, and across all essential occupational settings, infection control preparedness, early recognition of risk, and implementation of tailored risk reduction strategies are imperative. Pandemic preparedness is fundamental to protecting the health and well-being of essential workers and crucial in controlling the spread of disease in the community. Bioevent preparedness for all essential frontline workgroups will also help reduce occupational health inequities. Workers at risk, regardless of setting, deserve and have the right to equal protections under federal and state law. Â© 2021 Weston Medical Publishing. All rights reserved.","Gershon, R.

"The Impact of COVID-19 on Mental Health: Psychosocial Conditions of Students with and without Special Educational Needs","Given the pandemic-induced school lockdown in Germany in the spring of 2020, COVID-19 evidently had a negative impact on child and adolescent mental health and wellbeing. However, there is no evidence regarding the specific problems of students with special educational needs in emotional and behavioral disorders (E/BD) during or after the school lockdown. Thus, this study bridges the gap. A sample of 173 students across Germany was included in the analysis. The students were rated by their teachers in an online survey via a standardized teacher-report form for emotional and behavioral problems and competencies, as well as perceptions of inclusion. Several student- and teacher-level predictors were applied in a stepwise regression analysis. The results showed that the school lockdown marginally impacted E/BD, with small differences between student groups. The strongest predicting variable was studentsâ€™ psychosocial situation. Hence, the psychosocial situation of students should be monitored by teachers and school psychologists to provide sufficient support during lockdown.","Scheer, David, Laubenstein, DÃ©sirÃ©e","https://doi.org/10.3390/socsci10110405","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Social Sciences; 10(11):405, 2021.; Publication details: Social Sciences; 10(11):405, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19336,""
"Adolescent Perspectives on How an Adjunctive Mobile App for Social Anxiety Treatment Impacts Treatment Engagement in Telehealth Group Therapy","Adjunctive mobile mental health apps to supplement mental health treatment have been growing in recent years given their ability to address treatment engagement barriers. However, few studies have explicitly examined how these mobile apps impact treatment engagement, and even fewer have investigated this topic through adolescentsâ€™ perspectives. To this end, we conducted semi-structured interviews with five adolescents who used an adjunctive mobile mental health app in combination with telehealth cognitive behavioral group therapy for social anxiety. Using a multidimensional framework of treatment engagement, we elicited their perspectives on how the app impacted their engagement in telehealth group therapy and gathered their suggestions for improving the app. Using a consensual qualitative research approach, we learned that adolescents felt the app increased their comfort with others in therapy and their expectations about the effectiveness of mental health apps. They also indicated that the app prepared them for in-session participation and facilitated out-of-session skills practice. Adolescents had valuable suggestions such as adding app features to facilitate social connectedness between group members and adding appointment reminders in the app. This preliminary study highlights implications for future adjunctive mobile mental health app developers and researchers to increase adolescentsâ€™ treatment engagement in mental health services.","Lu, Celine, Chu, Wendy, Madden, Shannon, Parmanto, Bambang, Silk, Jennifer Susan","https://doi.org/10.3390/socsci10100397","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Social Sciences; 10(10):397, 2021.; Publication details: Social Sciences; 10(10):397, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19337,""
"Effect of COVID-19 Pandemic-Induced Dietary and Lifestyle Changes and Their Associations with Perceived Health Status and Self-Reported Body Weight Changes in India: A Cross-Sectional Survey","Home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic is accompanied by dramatic changes in lifestyle and dietary behaviors that can significantly influence health. We conducted an online cross-sectional survey to assess COVID-19 pandemic-induced dietary and lifestyle changes and their association with perceived health status and self-reported body weight changes among 1000 Indian adults in early 2021. Positive improvements in dietary habits, e.g., eating more nutritious (85% of participants) and home-cooked food (89%) and an increase in overall nutrition intake (79%), were observed. Sixty-five percent of participants self-reported increased oat consumption to support immunity. There were some negative changes, e.g., more binge eating (69%), eating more in between meals (67%), and increasing meal portion size (72%). Two-thirds of participants reported no change in lifestyles, whereas 21 and 23% reported an increase, and 13 and 10% reported a decrease in physical activity and sleep, respectively. Overall, 64 and 65% of participants reported an improvement in perceived health and an increase in body weight during the COVID-19 period compared to pre-COVID-19, respectively. The top motivations for improving dietary habits included improving physical and mental health and building immunity. In conclusion, the overall perceived health was improved and there was an increase in self-reported body weight in most participants during COVID-19. Diet emerged as the most crucial determinant for these changes.","Madan, Jagmeet, Blonquist, Traci, Rao, Eram, Marwaha, Ankita, Mehra, Joshya, Bharti, Richa, Sharma, Nishi, Samaddar, Ritika, Pandey, Sandhya, Mah, Eunice, Shete, Varsha, Chu, YiFang, Chen, Oliver","https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13113682","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Nutrients; 13(11):3682, 2021.; Publication details: Nutrients; 13(11):3682, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19338,""
"Spatiotemporal Patterns of the Use of Green Space by White-Collar Workers in Chinese Cities: A Study in Shenzhen","White-collar workers, with tremendous work pressure, excessive working hours, and poor physical condition, need green spaces not only to have physical exercise and social gatherings, but also to become closer to nature and to relieve stress for their mental health. In China, the 996 office schedule, working from 09:00 to 17:00 six days a week, has become popular in the workplace;under such high-intensity work and pressure, white-collar workers have limited time to access green space for leisure, and their use of green space for health benefits is compromised. This study selected Shenzhen Futian Central Business District to find out the green space use patterns and preferences of white-collar workers based on GPS data and questionnaire surveys. In addition, the value of green exposure in the time dimension was calculated according to individualsâ€™ actual behaviors. Based on cluster analysis, this study summarized the typical green space use patterns of three groups of white-collar workers, which reflects the hidden inequity of white-collar groups who are subjected to varying degrees of spatiotemporal constraints in using green space. This paper puts forward three directions for the optimization of green space allocation, functional facilities, and improved walkability in employment-intensive urban areas. The results provide certain guiding significance for alleviating the mismatch of time and space in green space enjoyment and for improving the spatiotemporal inclusiveness of green spaces in urban central business districts.","Xie, Xiaohuan, Zhou, Hanzhi, Gou, Zhonghua, Yi, Ming","https://doi.org/10.3390/land10101006","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Land; 10(10):1006, 2021.; Publication details: Land; 10(10):1006, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19339,""
"Chronic Rhinosinusitis and Alzheimerâ€™s Diseaseâ€”A Possible Role for the Nasal Microbiome in Causing Neurodegeneration in the Elderly","Among millions of sufferers of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), the challenge is not only constantly coping with CRS-related symptoms, such as congested nose, sinus pain, and headaches, but also various complications, such as attention difficulties and possible depression. These complications suggest that neural activity in the central nervous system may be altered in those patients, leading to unexpected conditions, such as neurodegeneration in elderly patients. Recently, some studies linked the presence of CRS and cognitive impairments that could further develop into Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD). AD is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly and is characterised by progressive memory loss, cognitive behavioural deficits, and significant personality changes. The microbiome, especially those in the gut, has been recognised as a human organ and plays an important role in the development of various conditions, including AD. However, less attention has been paid to the microbiome in the nasal cavity. Increased nasal inflammatory responses due to CRS may be an initial event that changes local microbiome homeostasis, which may further affect neuronal integrity in the central nervous system resulting in AD. Evidence suggests a potential of ÃŸ-amyloid deposition starting in olfactory neurons, which is then expanded from the nasal cavity to the central nervous system. In this paper, we reviewed currently available evidence that suggests this potential mechanism to advise the need to investigate the link between these two conditions.","Harrass, Sanaa, Chenju, Yi, Chen, Hui","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms222011207","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: International Journal of Molecular Sciences; 22(20):11207, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Molecular Sciences; 22(20):11207, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19340,""
"Mental Health Screening of Healthcare Professionals Who Are Candidates for Psychological Assistance during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Healthcare professionals (HCPs) are among those most affected by the COVID-19 health emergency, with many presenting symptoms of anxiety and depression. Research shows that one of the factors involved in mitigating the impact of stressful situations is the use of cognitive emotional regulation mechanisms. The aims of this study were (a) to describe the functional and dysfunctional cognitive emotional regulation mechanisms (FRMs and DRMs) by gender, (b) to screen the main group of healthcare professionals who are candidates to receive psychological assistance based on FRMs and DRMs, and (c) to determine the HCP profile of candidates for psychological assistance. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted. Data were obtained from an adhoc questionnaireâ€”the Cognitive Emotional Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ-18), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), and the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The representative sample comprised 1452 HCPs. The results revealed significant differences between men and women in the use of DRMs. Women showed a higher use of catastrophizing (=0.001) and rumination (0.008). The screening procedure detected that 7.5% (109 cases) of the HCPs were candidates to receive psychological support. According to the results of this study, age group (30â€“39 years old), professional activity (being a nurse or nursing assistant), and having psychological symptoms of anxiety and depression are variables that independently increase the probability of requiring psychological assistance. The gender variable was not found to be an independent factor when it comes to receiving psychological support. In conclusion, it is necessary to consider the influence of cognitive emotional regulation strategies employed by HCPs in the screening of candidates for psychological assistance and design effective interventions to reverse the emotional distress caused by COVID-19.","SerdÃ , Bernat-Carles, Aymerich, Maria, PatiÃ±o-MasÃ³, Josefina, Cunill, MÃ²nica","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182111167","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(21):11167, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(21):11167, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19341,""
"The Influence of Social Capital on Youthsâ€™ Anti-Epidemic Action in the Field of Epidemic-Preventative Social Distancing in China","Social distancing restrictions for COVID-19 epidemic prevention have substantially changed the field of youthsâ€™ social activities. Many studies have focused on the impact of epidemic-preventative social distancing on individual physical and mental health. However, in the field of social distancing for epidemic prevention, what are the changes in youth anti-epidemic action and states caused by their interpersonal resources and interactions? Responding to this question by studying the impact of the elements of social capital in youthsâ€™ anti-epidemic actions and anti-epidemic states could help identify an effective mechanism for balancing social distancing for effective epidemic prevention and sustainable social-participation development among youth. Bourdieuâ€™s field theory holds that the elements of social capital change with a change in the field. Therefore, we introduced the specific elements of social capital as independent variables and used a multinomal logistic model to analyze and predict the levels of youth anti-epidemic action through an empirical investigation of 1043 young people in Guangdong Province, China. The results show that, first, level of social distancing for epidemic prevention shows differences by occupation status and income level and correlates with social support. Second, social support and social norms play positive roles in promoting youth participation in anti-epidemic activities when social distance is certain. Third, social capital has a significant positive effect on youth social satisfaction and core relationships;however, social trust has a significant negative effect on youth physical and mental health. This study emphasized that social distancing for epidemic prevention is a special social situational state, which is a field where social capital has an impact on the differential changes in the public-participating actions and habitus of youth.","Guo, Peiwen, Zeng, Dong, Yan, Haina, Chan, Kin-Sun, Yin, Yifen","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182111155","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(21):11155, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(21):11155, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19342,""

Body appreciation did not significantly differ between demographic groups. Themes emerging from the qualitative results included changes in general self-image (becoming more restricted or disempowered), changes in sexual self-image (deepening, becoming more sexy/sexual, or less sexy/sexual), and changes in body image (positive, negative, and neutral). Our findings point to positive, negative, and neutral effects on sexual self-image and body image, implying that nuanced approaches are needed to understand how identity has transformed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bowling, Jessamyn, Basinger, Erin, Montanaro, Erika A.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182111063","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(21):11063, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(21):11063, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19343,""
"Compliance of Healthcare Workerâ€™s toward Tuberculosis Preventive Measures in Workplace: A Systematic Literature Review","Despite several guidelines published by the World Health Organization (WHO) and national authorities, there is a general increase in the number of healthcare workers (HCWs) contracting tuberculosis. This review sought to evaluate the compliance of the HCWs toward tuberculosis preventive measures (TPMs) in their workplace. Both electronic databases and manual searches were conducted to retrieve articles regarding the compliance of HCWs in the workplace published from 2010 onwards. Independent reviewers extracted, reviewed, and analyzed the data using the mixed methods appraisal tool (MMAT) 2018, comprising 15 studies, 1572 HCWs, and 249 health facilities. The results showed there was low compliance toward TPMs in the workplace among HCWs and health facilities from mostly high-burden tuberculosis countries. The failure to comply with control measures against tuberculosis was mainly reported at administrative levels, followed by engineering and personnel protective control measures. In addition, low managerial support and negative attitudes of the HCWs influenced the compliance. Further studies are needed to elucidate how to improve the compliance of HCWs toward the preventive measures against tuberculosis in order to reduce the disease burden among HCWs worldwide.","Ismail, Halim, Reffin, Naiemy, Sharifa Ezat Wan, Puteh, Mohd Rohaizat, Hassan","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182010864","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(20):10864, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(20):10864, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19344,""
"The Relationship between the Therapeutic Alliance and Suicidal Experiences in People with Psychosis Receiving Therapy","Few studies have examined the relationship between the therapeutic alliance in therapy and suicidal experiences. No studies have examined this relationship with people with non-affective psychosis. The present study sought to redress this gap in the literature. Sixty-four participants with non-affective psychosis and suicidal experiences who were receiving a suicide-focused cognitive therapy were recruited. Self-reported suicidal ideation, suicide plans, suicide attempts, depression, and hopelessness were collected from participants prior to starting therapy. Suicidal experience measures were collected again post-therapy at 6 months. Therapeutic alliance ratings were completed by clients and therapists at session 4 of therapy. Dose of therapy was documented in number of minutes of therapy. Data were analyzed using correlation coefficients, independent samples t-tests, a multiple hierarchical regression, and a moderated linear regression. There was no significant relationship found between suicidal ideation prior to therapy and the therapeutic alliance at session 4, rated by both client and therapist. However, there was a significant negative relationship between the client-rated therapeutic alliance at session 4 and suicidal ideation at 6 months, after controlling for pre-therapy suicidal ideation, depression, and hopelessness. Furthermore, the negative relationship between the client-rated alliance and suicidal ideation was the strongest when number of minutes of therapy was 15 h or below. A stronger therapeutic alliance developed in the first few sessions of therapy is important in ameliorating suicidal thoughts in people with psychosis. Nevertheless, it is not necessarily the case that more hours in therapy equates to a cumulative decrease in suicidal ideation of which therapists could be mindful. A limitation of the current study was that the alliance was analyzed only at session 4 of therapy, which future studies could seek to redress.","Huggett, Charlotte, Gooding, Patricia, Haddock, Gillian, Pratt, Daniel","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182010706","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(20):10706, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(20):10706, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19345,""
"Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Adjustment Disorder in Lithuanian Healthcare in 2018â€“2020: A Nation-Wide Cohort Study of the Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic","Multiple empirical studies have revealed significant pandemic effects of COVID-19 on mental health in various populations. This study aimed to analyze the incidences of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and adjustment disorder (AjD) in national healthcare in 2018â€“2020 in one of the European countriesâ€”Lithuaniaâ€”and estimate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on PTSD and AjD incidences in 2020. The national healthcare registry was used for estimations of diagnosis of PTSD, AjD, and major depressive disorder (MD). The study revealed that stress-related disorders PTSD and AjD are diagnosed rarely, resulting in a considerable gap between the expected prevalence and incidences of these diagnoses in healthcare in Lithuania. Moreover, a significant decline in mental disorders incidence in healthcare in 2020, in comparison to 2018 and 2019, was found, revealing that the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on access to healthcare services and increased barriers for mental disorders treatment. The study indicates that major developments in building up knowledge about the effects of trauma and life stressors on mental health are needed in Lithuania and other countries to increase awareness about stress-related disorders and improve care for trauma survivors, in particular in the context of the pandemics or other large-scale disasters.","Kazlauskas, Evaldas, Gelezelyte, Odeta, Nomeikaite, Auguste, Zelviene, Paulina","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9111422","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Healthcare; 9(11):1422, 2021.; Publication details: Healthcare; 9(11):1422, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19346,""
"Borderline Personality Symptoms: What Not to Be Overlooked When Approaching Suicidal Ideation among University Students","Suicidal ideation is a serious condition antecedent to suicidal attempts and is highly related not only to depression but also other psychosocial factors. This study aimed to examine the predictive effects of these potential factors for suicidal ideation among young adult university students. A cross-sectional survey was conducted on a sample of university students in Thailand. An online questionnaire employed the perceived stress scale-10 (PSS-10), the patient health questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8), the multidimensional scale of perceived social support (MSPSS), and a screening instrument for borderline personality disorder. An ordinal regression analysis was applied to determine the predictive effects of the independent variables. Of 336 students, the mean age was 20.26 Â± 1.3 years, 80.4% of whom were female;14.3% had suicidal ideation. The significant predictors of suicidal thoughts were perceived stress (AOR 1.11, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.22);depressive symptoms (AOR 1.16, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.22);borderline personality symptoms (AOR 1.19, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.40);and perceived social support (AOR 0.97, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.00). Not only did depressive symptoms contribute to suicidal ideation but they also constituted important variables. Therefore, they should be included in intervention plans to prevent suicidality among university students.","Wongpakaran, Nahathai, Oon-Arom, Awirut, Karawekpanyawong, Nuntaporn, Lohanan, Trustsavin, Leesawat, Thanakorn, Wongpakaran, Tinakon","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9101399","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Healthcare; 9(10):1399, 2021.; Publication details: Healthcare; 9(10):1399, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19347,""
"Using an IT-Based Algorithm for Health Promotion in Temporary Settlements to Improve Migrant and Refugee Health","The application of the electronic algorithm developed by the Mig-Healthcare project was pilot tested in a sample of migrants and refugees in 2 Reception and Identification Centres (RICs), temporary settlements, in Greece using portable devices. The questions relate to health literacy issues, to mental health, to vaccination history, to lifestyle habits such as smoking, alcohol intake, diet, to the presence of diseases such as heart disease or diabetes, to the use of prevention services and to dental care. A total of 82 adults, 50 women and 32 men, participated. Data analysis showed that 67.1% (55) of the respondents had difficulty in understanding medical information and 57.3% (47) did not know where to seek medical help for a specific health problem. Four main areas of health problems were identified and further action is required: (A) mental health concerns, (B) vaccinations, (C) obesity, and (D) dental hygiene. Direct linkage with the â€œRoadmap and Toolboxâ€ section of the projectâ€™s website gave the respondents access to many sources and tools, while through the use of the interactive map, specific referral points of healthcare delivery in their area were identified. IT-based intervention in migrant and refugee populations in Greece are effective in increasing health literacy levels and identifying areas for health promotion interventions in these groups. Through linkage with the projectâ€™s database, access to healthcare provision points and action to seek appropriate healthcare when necessary are encouraged. Given the attenuated vulnerability profile of people living in temporary settlements, this algorithm can be easily used in primary care settings to improve migrant and refugee health.","Riza, Elena, Lazarou, Achilleas, Karnaki, Pania, Zota, Dina, Nassi, Margarita, Kantzanou, Maria, Linos, Athena","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9101284","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Healthcare; 9(10):1284, 2021.; Publication details: Healthcare; 9(10):1284, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19348,""

"Effects of Line Dancing on Mental Health in Seniors after COVID-19 Pandemic","Line dancing is one of the most practiced dance styles by adults and seniors due to the ease of execution of choreography. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic prolonging the restrictions of physical and sports activities, the elderly population has been forced into increased sedentariness and social isolation, resulting in the development of symptoms of depression. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of line dancing practice on the mental state of late second- and third-age dancers. The sample consisted of 14 Italian female dancers with an average age of 65 years old. The Geriatric Depression Scale was used to verify whether 3 months of LD classes were able to produce improvements. Paired Samples T-Test and effect size were performed to test the difference between pre- and post-training protocol. The result was statistically significant (p &lt;0.05). Dancers improved their state of depression;in particular, they felt a better satisfaction in their life (d = 0.6), a greater interest in activities (d = 1), less boredom (d = 0.8), a good mood most of the time (d = 0.8), greater happiness throughout the day (d = 0.7), and the perception of a wonderful life (d = 0.5).

Building upon the framework of Jickling and Wals (2008) of identifying how to teach about environmental education in transformative ways, this study examined how the experiences and perspectives of seven faculty and staff members at a K-12 International Baccalaureate school in Singapore impacted how they taught about sustainability issues. It also investigated how they work to empower students to become change agents by employing concepts and strategies such as hands-on learning, systems thinking, and service learning. Qualitative interview data revealed four overarching key themes: (1) importance of local context (both the school and the broader socio-political context), (2) pedagogy in relation to student psychology, (3) teacher and staff views on effective pedagogy for teaching about climate crises, and (4) mental health, as experienced by both students and their educators. Teachers and their students regularly struggled with tensions of authority (e.g., school/government, parent/child, teacher/student) and outlook (e.g., â€œdoomismâ€/hope, empowered/disempowered). Nonetheless, they expressed a variety of thoughtful ways to cultivate their studentsâ€™ lifelong advocacy for the environment and other related social justice issues.","Jimenez, Jeremy, Moorhead, Laura","https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci11100593","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Education Sciences; 11(10):593, 2021.; Publication details: Education Sciences; 11(10):593, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19352,""
"â€œI Feel Therefore I Decideâ€: Effect of Negative Emotions on Temporal Discounting and Probability Discounting","Temporal and probability discounting are considered two fundamental constructs in economic science, as they are associated with phenomena with major societal impact and a variety of sub-optimal behaviors and clinical conditions. Although it is well known that positive and negative affective states bear important cognitive/behavioral consequences, the effect of emotional experiences on decision-making remains unclear due to the existence of many conflicting results. Inspired by the need to understand if and to what extent the current COVID-19 pandemic has determined changes in our decision-making processes by means of the unusual, prolonged experience of negative feelings, in this study we investigate the effect of anger, fear, sadness, physical and moral disgust on intertemporal and risky choices. Results show that all emotions significantly increase subjectsâ€™ preferences for immediate rewards over delayed ones, and for risky rewards over certain ones, in comparison to a â€œneutral emotionâ€ condition, although the magnitude of the effect differs across emotions. In particular, we observed a more pronounced effect in the case of sadness and moral disgust. These findings contribute to the literature on emotions and decision-making by offering an alternative explanation to the traditional motivational appraisal theories. Specifically, we propose that the increased preference for immediate gratification and risky outcomes serves as a mechanism of self-reward aimed at down-regulating negative feelings and restore the individualâ€™s â€œemotional balanceâ€.","Calluso, Cinzia, Devetag, Maria Giovanna, Donato, Carmela","https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11111407","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Brain Sciences; 11(11):1407, 2021.; Publication details: Brain Sciences; 11(11):1407, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19353,""

We revealed significant differences concerning post-traumatic growth, sleep-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and sleep measures between groups obtained as a function of the changes in the oneiric frequency between the first and second waves. We also found significant correlations between qualitative/emotional dream features and COVID-19-related factors (job change, forced quarantine, having COVID-19 infected relatives/friends, or asking for mental health help). Overall, we found that the second wave affected fewer quantitative features of dream activity and there was less emotional intensity. Moreover, we confirmed the relationship between nightmares and the high risk of PTSD when subjects were grouped as a function of the increasing/decreasing frequency. Finally, our findings are partly coherent with the continuity hypothesis between oneiric and waking experiences.","Scarpelli, Serena, Alfonsi, Valentina, Gorgoni, Maurizio, Musetti, Alessandro, Filosa, Maria, Quattropani, Maria C.; Lenzo, Vittorio, Vegni, Elena, Borghi, Lidia, Margherita, Giorgia, Freda, Maria Francesca, Saita, Emanuela, Cattivelli, Roberto, Castelnuovo, Gianluca, Manari, Tommaso, Plazzi, Giuseppe, De Gennaro, Luigi, Franceschini, Christian","https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11111375","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Brain Sciences; 11(11):1375, 2021.; Publication details: Brain Sciences; 11(11):1375, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19354,""
"School and Employment-Related Barriers for Youth and Young Adults with and without a Disability during the COVID-19 Pandemic in the Greater Toronto Area","Purpose: Youth and young adults are particularly vulnerable to the socio-economic impacts of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). The purpose of this study was to explore barriers to school and employment for youth with and without a disability during the pandemic. Methods: This qualitative comparison study involved in-depth interviews with 35 youth and young adults (18 with a disability;17 without), aged 16â€“29 (mean age 23). An interpretive, thematic analysis of the transcripts was conducted. Results: Our findings revealed several similarities and some differences between youth and young adults with and without disabilities regarding barriers to school and employment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Key themes related to these barriers involved: (1) difficult transition to online school and working from home (i.e., the expense of setting up a home office, technical challenges, impact on mental health), (2) uncertainty about employment (i.e., under-employment, difficult working conditions, difficulty finding work, disability-related challenges) and (3) missed career development opportunities (i.e., canceled or reduced internships or placements, lack of volunteer opportunities, uncertainties about career pathway, the longer-term impact of the pandemic). Conclusion: Our findings highlight that youth and young adults with disabilities may need further support in engaging in meaningful and accessible vocational activities that align with their career pathway.","Lindsay, Sally, Ahmed, Hiba","https://doi.org/10.3390/adolescents1040034","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Adolescents; 1(4):442-460, 2021.; Publication details: Adolescents; 1(4):442-460, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19355,""
"Electronic cigarette use among adolescents and young adults in Nigeria: Prevalence, associated factors and patterns of use","Background Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have emerged in the Nigerian market, and if used without supervision, may have damaging effects on the physical and mental health of users. Therefore, there is a need to determine the patterns of use, especially among adolescents and young adults. This study aims to assess the prevalence and factors associated with electronic cigarette use, as well as the relationship between their use and anxiety among adolescents and young adults in Lagos, Nigeria. Method An online cross-sectional study among participants aged between 15â€“35 years. The survey had three sections: sociodemographic information, the pattern of e-cigarette use, and a 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with e-cigarette use. P-values &lt;0.05 were considered significant. Statistical analysis was done using STATA-15.0 software. Results Data from a total of 949 respondents was analysed. Participants had a mean age of 23.36 years (Â±3.97) and were predominantly female (55.64%). The prevalence of e-cigarette ever-use was 7.9% (95% CI: 5.8,10.0). Older age and being male were independently associated with higher odds of e-cigarette use. After adjusting for age and sex, alcohol use (p&lt;0.001), friendâ€™s use (p&lt;0.001), and other tobacco product or substance use (p:0.05) remained significantly associated with higher odds of e-cigarette use. There was no association between anxiety levels and e-cigarette use. Conclusion These findings suggest a higher likelihood of e-cigarette use among alcohol consumers, poly-tobacco or substance users and individuals with friends who use e-cigarettes. Health providers and policy makers in Nigeria might consider preventive measures aimed at young adults with the identified risk factors, as well as close monitoring of trends in e-cigarette use in the coming years.","Erinoso, Olufemi, Afolabi, Oyapero, Amure, Mary, Osoba, Moyosoore, Osibogun, Olatokunbo, Wright, Kikelomo, Akin, Osibogun","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0258850","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: PLoS One; 16(10), 2021.; Publication details: PLoS One; 16(10), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19356,""

"COVID-19 Stress and the Health of Black Americans in the Rural South","Black Americans have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. To better understand changes in and predictors of their mental and physical health, in the current study, we used three waves of data (two prepandemic and a third during summer 2020) from 329 Black men and women in the rural South. Results indicated that health worsened after the onset of the pandemic, including increased depressive symptoms and sleep problems and decreased self-reported general health. Greater exposure to COVID-19-related stressors was significantly associated with poorer health. Prepandemic stressors (financial strain, racial discrimination, chronic stress) and prepandemic resources (marital quality, general support from family and friends) were significantly associated with exposure to COVID-19-related stressors and with health during the pandemic. Findings underscore how the pandemic posed the greatest threats to Black Americans with more prepandemic psychosocial risks and highlight the need for multifaceted interventions that address current and historical stressors among this population.","Adesogan, Olutosin, Lavner, Justin A.; Carter, Sierra E.; Beach, Steven R.

"Education, Financial Stress, and Trajectory of Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic","In this preregistered study, we examined educational disparities in the trajectory of mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic and whether such educational disparities would be mediated by financial stress associated with the pandemic. Data were drawn from the Love in the Time of COVID project (N = 2,204;four waves collected between March and June 2020). Results suggested educational disparities in eudaimonic well-being, negative affect, and psychological distress and showed significant associations between lower education and worse mental-health outcomes at baseline. However, education did not amplify mental-health disparities over time and exhibited no associations with the rates of change in mental health. Financial stress mediated the associations between education and mental health at baseline, and there were no temporal variations in the mediation effect. These results highlight persistent educational disparities in mental health, and such educational disparities may be partially explained by financial stress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.","Jiang, Yanping, Zilioli, Samuele, Balzarini, Rhonda N.; Zoppolat, Giulia, Slatcher, Richard B.","https://doi.org/10.1177/21677026211049374","","Database: Sage; Publication details: Clinical Psychological Science;: 21677026211049374, 2021.; Publication details: Clinical Psychological Science;: 21677026211049374, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19359,""
"Applying a Health-Risk Behavior Lens to Understand Individual Differences in COVID-19 Containment Behavior Among Young Adults","COVID-19 containment behaviors (CCBs) remain important methods for reducing contagion. Theoretical frameworks to understand engagement in health-risk behaviors among young people may help identify individuals with elevated risk for non-adherence to CCBs. We aimed to elucidate individual differences in CCBs by evaluating if CCBs fit into an established health-risk behavior framework. Using a cross-sectional sample of 1374 young adults, we examined CCBs? associations with personality antecedents to health-risk behaviors and to actual engagement in other health-risk behaviors. Results identified risk seeking, negative urgency, lack of premeditation, and extraversion as risk factors for less CCB adherence, while agreeableness and neuroticism were protective factors. Less CCB adherence was positively associated with binge drinking, more sexual partners, and risky driving, while negatively associated with purging and self-injury. Results suggest CCBs may be understood as a type of health-risk behavior and can contribute to the development of strategies for increasing public health guideline adherence.","Wallace, Gemma T.; Weishaar, Megan G.; Henry, Kimberly L.; Conner, Bradley T.","https://doi.org/10.1177/21676968211044553","","Database: Sage; Publication details: Emerging Adulthood;: 21676968211044553, 2021.; Publication details: Emerging Adulthood;: 21676968211044553, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19360,""
"The well-being of music educators during the pandemic Spring of 2020","The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted many aspects of life, including the instructional practices of music educators. The purpose of this study was to examine music teachers' well-being following the disruptions in schooling that resulted from the pandemic in the Spring of 2020. We also investigated how disruptions may have affected music teachers' perceptions of their efficacy and the status of the profession. A questionnaire was completed by 2,023 music teachers who were members of the National Association for Music Education. We collected data related to (a) demographic and institutional information, (b) well-being, (c) teaching efficacy, (d) the impact of the pandemic upon the profession, and (e) the impact of the pandemic upon student learning. The questionnaire included the PERMA Profiler, a measure of well-being, and a portion of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Both PK-12 and collegiate teachers reported significantly lower levels of overall well-being and significantly higher levels of depression than published norms. Additional analyses examined the relationship of individual difference and teaching context variables to the well-being measures, perceptions of teaching efficacy, and perceptions of the pandemic's impact on student learning.","Miksza, P.; Parkes, K.; Russell, J.

"The Pandemic as a Catalyst for Reimagining the Foundations of Location-Based Games","Mainstream location-based games (LBGs) highlight three foundations-exercise, exploration, and social interaction-which were hugely disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. This genre has already had access issues depending on the player's region, identity, ability, and technology, which the pandemic also amplified. Thus, the pandemic provided a unique opportunity to re-imagine the design of LBGs to preserve player benefits while challenging these foundations. We conducted a two-week diary study with 11 LBG players coping with difficult life circumstances, followed by remote co-design sessions. Participants continued to play primarily to maintain community connection while adjusting the mode of socialization, finding meaning through virtual exploration, and support mental health and personal growth. Participants discussed ways to enhance the experience by expanding the range of physical activities during social distancing, reimagining proximity-based social interactions, and exploring via social construction of places while expanding beyond how the three foundations are currently supported in LBGs.

"Stress status of healthcare drivers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia","IntroductionThe pandemic of COVID-19 has brought a disastrous impact on every single aspect of human life and activities. The economic and health sectors are most affected by restriction on public movement, daily activities, and burden of coronavirus infection through increased infection and hospitalisation rate. Most research focused on front liners but they overlooked ambulance and healthcare drivers.ObjectivesTo determine the stress status of healthcare drivers in Malaysia and its associated factors during the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsThis cross-sectional study was conducted among randomly selected 163 healthcare drivers in Negeri Sembilan State Health Department, Malaysia, using self-reported validated questionnaires.ResultsA majority of healthcare drivers were male (100%), married (90.1%) with their highest education consisting of a high school certificate (90.1%). Ethnically, they consisted of Malay (95.7%), Indian (3.7%) and Chinese (0.6%). Three out of ten healthcare drivers were ambulance drivers, while the rest were non ambulance drivers. The prevalence of stress among healthcare drivers was 7.4% (95% CI: 3.7, 11.7). Higher prevalence was found among ambulance drivers compared to non ambulance drivers;10.6% and 6.0% respectively. There was a significant association between stress and smoking status, performing on-call and duration of working hours in a similar unit.ConclusionThe study revealed that there was a low prevalence of stress among healthcare drivers in Malaysia during the pandemic. The reduced life threatening tasks, fewer emergency incidents and lesser assigned tasks throughout the movement control order during the COVID-19 pandemic could have contributed to the low prevalence statistics among the healthcare drivers in Malaysia. In addition, the effort by the Occupational and Environmental Health Unit, Negeri Sembilan State Health Department in providing consistent safety and health training including stress management might have assisted healthcare drivers to cope with the stressed situation both mentally and physically.","Abdul Aziz, Harith, Zuraida, Mohamed, Azyyati, Mohammad, Griffiths, Rob, Lim, Kuang Kuay, Dahlan, Nofi Yuliani, Ismail, Shahida, Reffin, Naiemy, Malindawati Mohd, Fadzil, Mahjom, Maznieda","https://doi.org/10.1136/OEM-2021-EPI.249","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Occupational and Environmental Medicine; 78(Suppl 1):A92, 2021.; Publication details: Occupational and Environmental Medicine; 78(Suppl 1):A92, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19364,""
"The Mental Health of Chilean teachers in times of Forced Telework: how many, who and why are they in worse health?","IntroductionThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education resulted in school closures and the forced implementation of virtual teaching and teleworking. This situation together with the diversity of social and economic contexts in schools, has emphasized inequality in access to quality education and increased stress and anxiety among teachers.ObjectivesThis study aims to explore the mental health of teachers forced to telework because of COVID-19 and analyze its relationship with sociodemographic, teacher-related and working conditions.MethodsThe sample was 278 Chilean classroom teachers who teleworked more than 50% during the 2020 academic year. The dependent variable was mental health measured through the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). The independent variables were sociodemographic, teacher-related and work conditions. The internal structure of the mental health construct was evaluated using the Rasch model. Crude (cOR) and adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were estimated using logistic regression models. The analyzes were stratified by years of teaching experience and sex.ResultsA high prevalence of poor mental health was found in teachers (58%). Working in a private-subsidized school (aOR = 2.89;95% CI: 1.16 - 7.22), working two or more unpaid overtime hours (aOR = 2.25;95% CI: 1.11 - 4.59) and having sickness absence (aOR = 3.82;95% CI: 1.53 - 9.58) were associated with poor mental health. Working 35 hours or more weekly among less experienced teachers (6â€“10 years: aOR = 0.07;95% CI: 0.01 - 0.51) and being a tutor teacher among women (aOR = 0.48;95% CI: 0.23 - 1.0) had a protective effect on mental health.ConclusionThis study contributes to the recognition of a high prevalence of poor mental health among Chilean teachers and its associated contextual and labour factors.

"COVID-19 infection and mental wellness in a Canadian cohort study of healthcare workers","IntroductionHealthcare workers (HCW) working through the pandemic are in the front line for infection, psychological pressure and overwork.ObjectivesTo identify modifiable work factors associated with COVID-19 infection and mental distress, and to assess the effectiveness of provisions to mitigate their impact.MethodsA cohort study of HCWs was set up in the first weeks of the pandemic in Canada. HCWs from British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, and Quebec completed an online questionnaire in the spring/summer of 2020, and a Phase 2 questionnaire from October 2020. They also provided a blood sample to assess SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. HCWs reporting a COVID-19 infection after the Phase 2 questionnaire were matched on job-type and province to 4 referents for a nested case-referent (C-R) study concentrating on exposures immediately prior to infection. Phase 3 is underway, with a final contact planned for March 2022.Results5135 HCWs completed the Phase 1 questionnaire with 93% (4539/4857) of those eligible completing Phase 2. By March 1st 2021, 157 cases had been confirmed by PCR and a further 10 found positive only on antibody testing (an overall rate of 3.3%). The odds of infection doubled for working one-on-one with known COVID-19 patients. Rates were lower in physicians and nurses, compared to personal support workers, health care aides, and licensed practical nurses. HCWs in a hospital setting had lower rates than those working in the community, where shortages of personal protective equipment were more widespread. High rates of anxiety (on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) were recorded in both Phase 1 and 2. Only 1 in 4 HCW had used available mental health supports. By May 2021, 100 cases with 389 referents had been recruited to the on-going C-R study.ConclusionInformation collected prospectively has the potential to improve HCWs protection during this and future epidemics.","Cherry, Nicola, LabrÃ¨che, France, Adisesh, Anil, Burstyn, Igor, Chattu, Vijay Kumar, Durand-Moreau, Quentin, Galarneau, Jean-Michel, Mhonde, Trish, Ruzycki, Shannon, Summerfield, Tansi","https://doi.org/10.1136/OEM-2021-EPI.34","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Occupational and Environmental Medicine; 78(Suppl 1):A13, 2021.; Publication details: Occupational and Environmental Medicine; 78(Suppl 1):A13, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19366,""
"An umbrella review of the work and health impacts of working in a pandemic environment","IntroductionThe effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on work, employment and health are considerable. There is a need for actionable and targeted evidence that policy-makers, employers, workers and other stakeholders can use to ensure that work is safe and healthy not only during the COVID-19 pandemic, but also in its aftermath.ObjectivesThe purpose of this umbrella review is to inform evidence-based decision making and best practices for the work and health of workers during an epidemic/pandemic;and to identify research gaps to inform evidence needs for future studies and research funding priorities. We examined the evidence on the work and health impacts of working in an epidemic/pandemic environment;factors associated with these impacts;and possible risk mitigation or intervention strategies that address these factors or outcomes.MethodsWe examined review articles published in MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Embase between 2000 and 2020. Data were extracted and analyzed using a narrative synthesis.ResultsThe search yielded 1,524 unique citations, of which 31 were included. The search yielded a large volume of reviews on mental health and infection risk to health care workers. Reviews identified a variety of individual, social, organizational and risk mitigation factors that influenced study outcomes. Equity considerations were only tangentially referenced in the included studies. Only a few reviews examined intervention strategies in the workplace, and none included long-term outcomes of exposure or work during an epidemic/pandemic.ConclusionFindings suggest a number of critical research and evidence gaps, including the need for reviews on occupational groups potentially exposed to or impacted by the negative work and health effects of COVID-19 in addition to health care workers, the long-term consequences of transitioning to the post-COVID-19 economy on work and health, and research with an equity or social determinants of health lens.","Fan, Jonathan, Senthanar, Sonja, Macpherson, Robert, Sharpe, Kimberly, Peters, Cheryl, Koehoorn, Mieke, McLeod, Chris","https://doi.org/10.1136/OEM-2021-EPI.30","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Occupational and Environmental Medicine; 78(Suppl 1):A11, 2021.; Publication details: Occupational and Environmental Medicine; 78(Suppl 1):A11, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19367,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on key workers in England: findings from the Health and Employment After Fifty (HEAF) Study","IntroductionIn the UK, workers who were essential to maintain communications, travel, food and healthcare were deemed â€˜key workersâ€™. There is scarce evidence about the effect that the pandemic had on this group of workers as compared with people who were home working, furloughed or retired.ObjectivesTo compare measures of health and lifestyle amongst older key workers as opposed to other older adults working or not working during the pandemic.MethodsIn February 2021 participants in the Health and Employment After Fifty (HEAF) study (aged 55â€“73) were sent an online survey, enquiring about changes to their mental/physical health and lifestyle during the first UK lockdown (starting late March 2020). Logistic regression was used to explore the association between being a keyworker (healthcare/not healthcare) and adverse outcomes, with adjustment for age and sex. Participants in work but not identifying themselves as key workers were used as the reference category.ResultsA total of 2,040 (46%) returned a usable questionnaire and completed the question about key worker status. 281 were in work but not as key workers;50 were key workers in healthcare;298 were key workers not in healthcare;1,411 were retired. Key workers were predominantly women. Key workers not in healthcare were more likely to see a worsening of mental health (OR=1.6;95%CI 1.0 to 2.4) physical health (OR=1.5;95%CI 1.0 to 2.3), to report that their diet was less healthy (OR=1.8;95% CI 1.2 to 2.8) and to report eating more than pre-lockdown (OR=1.6;95%CI 1.1 to 2.4) compared with participants in work but not as key workers.

"The complex association of perceived workplace safety, work environment, and national factors with the mental health of aging workers in Europe during the COVID-19 pandemic","IntroductionThe widespread COVID-19 contagion in workplaces has created a new workplace hazard, albeit investigated mainly among health care workers. Work-environment factors are related to workplace infection risks and individual vulnerability factors, like older age, predispose workers to severe illness. The stress and anxiety associated with the concerns regarding workplace safety and COVID-19 repercussions are jeopardizing aging workersâ€™ mental health (MH).ObjectivesWe aimed at investigating the individual and macro-level factors associated with declines in the MH of aging workers from different industry sectors. We hypothesize that higher perceived workplace safety is crucial in protecting their MH and mediates the work-environment influences.MethodsUsing the Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) data from COVID-19 survey (summer 2020) from 27 countries in Europe and Israel and additional data collected from pre-pandemic waves, we performed multi-level and mediation analyses to characterize work-environment, safety perception, socio-demographic, clinical, and national-level factors associated with MH among workers aged 50â€“70.ResultsMulti-level analyses demonstrated that 24% of the aging workers experience MH declines characterized by East-West geographical European gradient associated with disease burden. The perceived workplace safety, which is low among 10% of the workers, is the strongest predictor- explaining 30% of their MH status and mediates the effects of work-environment aspects, such as workplace contagion risk. Being a woman, having financial difficulties, a higher vulnerability index (comorbidities and age&gt;60), pre-existing mental morbidity, and the national high burden of COVID-19 are associated with declines in MH, whereas exclusively working on-site is protective.ConclusionEvaluating workplace conditions and screening vulnerable sub-groups among the aging workers who are more prone to MH declines are imperative. Workplace interventions, integrated with individual targeted approaches to reduce the influence of work-environment factors on infection risks and mental distress, hence elevating workplace safety perception, are recommended.","Lilah Rinsky, Halivni, Christiani, David, Bramli-Grinberg, Shuli","https://doi.org/10.1136/OEM-2021-EPI.4","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Occupational and Environmental Medicine; 78(Suppl 1):A2, 2021.; Publication details: Occupational and Environmental Medicine; 78(Suppl 1):A2, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19369,""
"The impact of COVID-19 lockdown on perceived stress: The role of defence mechanisms and coping strategies","Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic represents a unique global challenge. To deter its spread, several countries have put lockdown and physical distancing measures in place that could have potentially harmful consequences on people's mental health. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the relationship between anxiety and perceived stress in individuals who were experiencing the COVID-19 lockdown measures, while also analyzing the impact of coping strategies interacting with defence mechanisms. A sample of 1408 individuals (Mage?=?34.69;SD?=?11.87) completed the Ten Item Perceived Stress Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory?Form X3, Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced and Forty-Item Defense Style Questionnaire, after providing written informed consent. Results highlighted the significant impact of state anxiety levels on perceived stress, both directly and indirectly. The indirect pathways have been explored by performing three mixed serial-parallel mediation analyses, where significant associations between coping strategies (Social Support, Avoidance Strategies, Positive Attitude, Problem-solving and Turning to Religion) and mature, neurotic, or immature defences have been found. These findings may contribute to orientate prevention and intervention activity during the several management phases of COVID-19.","Gori, Alessio, Topino, Eleonora, Caretti, Vincenzo","https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-5973.12380","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Journal of Contingencies and Crisis Management; n/a(n/a), 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Contingencies and Crisis Management; n/a(n/a), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19370,""
"The development of posture supporting soft exosuit design for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis","Purpose: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a three-dimensional deformity of the spine. Orthoses are the most commonly used treatment material in AIS. However, the physiological and psychological problems that arise due to these orthoses' rigid structures prevent their use by patients. Due to these problems, the authors have developed a posture supporting garment (soft exosuit) design for individuals aged 10â€“18, with Cobb angles of 25Â°â€“40Â°, which is the most rapidly progressing stage of the disease. Design/methodology/approach: Soft exosuit prepared with experimental research method and user-centered design approach. The posture supporting effect is achieved by pattern engineering using fabric, belts, baleens and a gradual zipper system for to increase functionality, ease of use and fit. Findings: The first six-month clinical trial in prototype use was carried out with a female patient with a 29Â° scoliosis Cobb angle and suitable wearing a rigid corset due to AIS. The patient was satisfied with the prototype and its functionality, ease of use, fit and comfort. Cosmetic body deformity due to scoliosis was not observed, and the Cobb angle was decreased by 10.7% at the end of the sixth month. Soft exosuit has been found effective in supporting the posture of individuals who had ongoing spinal growth. Research limitations/implications: The most important limitation of this study is that, despite a large number of prototype and prototype studies, trials could not be conducted on a large number of patients with different characteristics due to the COVID-19 pandemic. More experimental studies are needed to generalize the product to large audiences. The first goal is to investigate more patients with different spinal deformities in the future. The second goal is to measure the materials used and the quantitative measurement of body responses with the biomechanics field. It is planned to increase the soft exosuit functionality with smart textiles by adding wearable devices with future research. Practical implications: This study is important because it constitutes the basis for future studies on pattern cutting soft materials' positioning. Social implications: It is thought that the study will contribute to functional solutions for different spinal deformities. Originality/value: It is an entire functional soft garment without an actuator. It is customizable and modular for patients with spinal deformities. It is thought that the study will contribute to functional solutions for spinal deformities. Â© 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cakmak, S.; Cegindir, N. Y.; Yilmaz, H.

"Quality of Life and Sleep Among Brazilian Speech-Language Pathology Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Purpose: The aim of this study was to identify the factors that are related to the quality of life and sleep of Brazilian speechlanguage pathology students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: This study adopted a cross-sectional, descriptive observational design. A total of 161 undergraduate speechlanguage pathology students participated in this study. The relationship between quality of life and sleep, socioeconomic characteristics, and health problems was examined using correlational analysis. Participant data were collected using an online form, which included questions that assessed their socioeconomic and health characteristics during the pandemic;the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index;and the first two questions of the World Health Organization Quality of Life--Brief Version. Results: There were relationships between sleep dysfunction, a reduction in household income during the pandemic, membership to a risk group, living with at-risk individuals, time spent on the Internet (hours), and the purpose underlying Internet use. Satisfaction with health was related to membership to a risk group. Perceptions of the negative impact of the pandemic on mental health were related to sleep dysfunction and quality of life during the pandemic. Conclusion: The present findings underscore the need for policies that promote health, prevent diseases, and address mental health problems during times of crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","da Silva, Kelly, Guedes-Granzotti, Raphaela Barroso, Veis Ribeiro, Vanessa, Dornelas, Rodrigo, AlcÃ¢ntara Cruz, Pablo JordÃ£o, Alves Ribeiro CÃ©sar, Carla PatrÃ­cia Hernandez","https://doi.org/10.1044/2021_PERSP-20-00251","","Database: CINAHL; Publication details: Perspectives of the ASHA Special Interest Groups; 6(5):1146-1157, 2021.; Publication details: Perspectives of the ASHA Special Interest Groups; 6(5):1146-1157, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19372,""
"Abusive leadership, psychological well-being, and intention to quit during the COVID-19 pandemic: a moderated mediation analysis among Quebecâ€™s healthcare system workers","Purpose: To examine the effects from work-organization conditions, abusive leadership, and their interaction on Quebec healthcare system workersâ€™ psychological well-being and intention to quit during the COVID-19 pandemic.Mediation and moderated mediation analyses were performed using MPlus software on a sample of 921 Quebec healthcare system workers.Skill utilization, decision authority, social support from co-workers and supervisors, and recognition were associated directly and positively with psychological well-being, while psychological and physical demands were associated directly and negatively with psychological well-being. Skill utilization, irregular work schedule, and recognition were associated directly and negatively with intention to quit, while psychological demands were associated directly and positively with intention to quit. Moreover, the results demonstrated that abusive leadership attenuated the effects from recognition and decision authority on psychological well-being (moderation effects), contributing to greater intention to quit among workers (moderated mediation effects).The obtained results underline the importance of work-organization conditions and leadership style on healthcare system workersâ€™ psychological health and their intention to quit their jobs during a pandemic. In particular, and given their key role, leaders/managers must be sensitized concerning leadership style and its possible effects on their employeesâ€™ psychological well-being and intention to quit.

"Do â€œStay-at-Home Exerciseâ€ Videos Induce Behavioral Changes in College Students? A Randomized Controlled Trial","The coronavirus disease pandemic has led to college students spending more time at home. â€œStay-at-home exerciseâ€ videos to mitigate inactivity are currently available on various digital platforms;however, it is unclear whether these videos lead to behavioral changes among college students. This study aimed to investigate the improvement in physical activity (PA) resulting from â€œstay-at-home exerciseâ€ among college students. Overall, 150 college students were recruited, and 125 students (control group: 65;intervention group: 60) who completed baseline surveys were analyzed. The preliminary outcomes were PA, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), subjective well-being (SWB), and psychological stress (K6). Mixed model repeated-measure analysis of variance compared the outcomes before and after the intervention. After 8 weeks of â€œstay-at-home exerciseâ€, there was no significant interaction in PA (F = 0.02, p = 0.89);however, a significant interaction for the general health subscale of HRQoL (F = 9.52), SWB (F = 6.70), and K6 (F = 7.83) was detected (p &lt;0.05). On comparing the pre- and post-intervention results, we found that only distributing an 8-week streaming video of â€œstay-at-home exerciseâ€ did not increase the amount of physical activity among participants, but it did have a positive effect on their mental health during the pandemic.","Fukui, Kazuki, Suzuki, Yuta, Kaneda, Kazuki, Kuroda, Sayo, Komiya, Makoto, Maeda, Noriaki, Urabe, Yukio","https://doi.org/10.3390/su132111600","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Sustainability; 13(21):11600, 2021.; Publication details: Sustainability; 13(21):11600, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19377,""
"Dental Hygiene Faculty and Student Knowledge, Psychological Health and Vaccination Behaviors Regarding COVID-19: A pilot study","Problem: The COVID-19 pandemic has been character-ized by extreme uncertainty, stress, and anxiety. Mitigating risk of contracting and transmitting COVID-19 while remaining current with the ever-changing information and guidelines has been challenging. Dental hygienists need accurate knowledge about COVID-19 in order to protect themselves and their patients. Lack of knowledge and psychological health may impact behaviors including vaccination. Purpose: This pilot study aimed to gain insights on dental hygiene faculty and student COVID-19 knowledge, psychological health during the pandemic, and vaccination behaviors. Methods: This descriptive quantitative pilot study used a 26-item online survey to examine the impact of COVID-19 on psychological health (10 items), decision to receive vaccination (2 items), and knowledge of COVID-19 (10 items). The validated Patient Health Questionnaire 4 (PHQ 4) screened participants for depression and anxiety. Data collected between February 26 to March 1 were analyzed using descriptive statistical methods and t-tests. Results: The 52 participants in this convenience sample were knowledgeable about COVID-19;the faculty mean knowledge score of 8.78 out of 10 was significantly higher than students at 7.79 (p=0.021). Of the ten items, 69.2% of participants did not know if the Food and Drug Administration had approved any drugs to treat COVID-19, and 42.3% did not know if ultraviolet light could be used to disinfect surfaces. The PHQ-4 identified 38.5% of participants with elevated anxiety scores and 21.2% with elevated depression scores. The mean PHQ-4 scores of students (2.57) were higher than faculty (0.89) at a significant level (p=0.023). Participants were significantly more anxious about contracting (p=0.037) and unknowingly transmitting (p=0.002) COVID-19 to others during normal daily activities than during clinical treatment. Of the students, 19 (46.3%) had received at least one dose of the vaccine, 13 (31.7%) intended to vaccinate in the future, and 9 (21.4%) did not plan to be vaccinated. One (11.1%) of the eight faculty did not plan to be vaccinated. Participants who did not plan to be vaccinated listed concerns about limited research regarding adverse effects. Conclusion: In this pilot study, the majority of dental hygiene faculty and students were knowledgeable about COVID-19 and willing to be vaccinated, regardless of psychological health. It is essential for faculty to know the latest information and guidelines about COVID-19, and to educate students and patients. Further research with a larger sample is needed to determine if correlations exist between knowledge scores, vaccination behaviors, and/or psychological health.

Life was already complicated without COVID-19, am I right? Due to the coronavirus crisis, more and more students will experience trauma and need mental health support. For this reason, college admission counselors and consultants need to be trauma-informed in their practice and approach their work using a healing lens to ensure students are adequately supported during the essay writing process. I developed the Restorative & Transformative Writing Process (RTWP) to offer a practical approach to building a trauma-informed practice for those working with students writing college admission essays. A trauma-informed practice in college admission consulting seeks to provide an experience of safety, choice, collaboration, and empowerment, and is well aware of larger interconnected systems of domination that shape our world, according to David Treleaven, an expert in trauma-sensitive mindfulness. It is a starting point that centers healing, wellness, empathy, acceptance, and self-care.","Lipscomb, Ashley Y.","https://www.google.com/search?q=ADDRESSING+TRAUMA+IN+THE+COLLEGE+ESSAY+WRITING+PROCESS","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of College Admission; - (249):30, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of College Admission; - (249):30, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19380,""
"Psychological distress in men and women of young adult period during the covid-19 pandemic","Previous studies confirm age and gender as important determinants of crisis adaptation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the pattern of age-gender differences in psychopathological symptoms during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Croatia. The Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) was applied in an online survey of a sample of 581 participants. For this purpose, significant differences in the achieved average results between men and women, as well as between the two age groups, were tested. The younger age group consisted of participants of young adult period (18-21 years), while the old group consisted of participants aged 22 to 32 years. The obtained results showed that women experienced symptoms of somatization, sensitivity, depression, anxiety and phobia more often than men. Significant differences were also found in the experience of symptoms of somatization, obsessive compulsiveness, sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, paranoid, and psychoticism between the two age groups. The results indicated that the younger group aged 18-21 years in relation to the older group experienced all these symptoms of psychopathology more often. Furthermore, interaction effects of gender and age were not determined in this study for any of the examined psychopathological symptoms. The results of this study provide insight into some of the examined aspects of mental health during the first wave of the corona crisis in Croatia. Further research into the mechanisms underlying the identified differences in psychopathological symptomatology is certainly needed, especially when it comes to women and young adult group of both genders.

"Coping stress as a form of islamic education counseling for students who work during the covid-19 pandemic","The research aims to investigate the stress symptoms of students studying while working while online learning affected by Covid-19 is ongoing and coping strategies as a form of Islamic education counseling. The research approach uses descriptive qualitative data collection techniques through semi-structured interviews, observations, and documentaries. The results showed that the symptoms of stress experienced were in the form of irregular sleep, blood pressure, stomach acid, irregular eating patterns, feeling depression. The main source of stress is due to tasks that collide between college assignments and work assignments. Less than optimal in doing college assignments due to responsibilities at work. The findings also show that after students received Islamic counseling, participants experienced lower levels of stress than before. Islamic education counseling in the form of services containing spiritual guidance sourced from the Qur'an and Hadith as a form of stress coping strategy (emotional focused), seeks to relieve individual emotions caused by stressors (sources of stress) or regulate emotional responses to stress. Without trying to change a situation that is a direct source of stress. The expected implication is that stress coping strategies through Islamic counseling can relieve stress symptoms in students so that they are expected to be maximal in learning to achieve a better future.

"Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Social Determinants on the Portuguese Population: Protocol for a Web-Based Cross-sectional Study","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak and consequent physical distance measures implemented worldwide have caused significant stress, anxiety, and mental health implications among the general population. Unemployment, working from home, and day-to-day changes may lead to a greater risk of poor mental health outcomes. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the protocol for a web-based cross-sectional study that aims to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. METHODS: Individuals from the general population aged 18 years or more and living in Portugal were included in this study. Data collection took place between November 10, 2020, and February 10, 2021. An exponential, nondiscriminative, snowball sampling method was applied to recruit participants. A web-based survey was developed and shared on social media platforms (eg, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp groups) and through e-mail lists for recruitment of the seeds. RESULTS: Data analysis will be performed in accordance with the different variables and outcomes of interest by using quantitative methods, qualitative methods, or mixed methods, as applicable. A total of 929 individuals had completed the web-based survey during the 3-month period; thus, our final sample comprised 929 participants. Results of the survey will be disseminated in national and international scientific journals in 2021-2022. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that the findings of this study will have broad implications for understanding the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Portuguese residents, as well as aspects related to the informal economy. We also hope that the findings of this study are able to provide insights and guidelines for the Portuguese government to implement action. Finally, we expect this protocol to provide a roadmap for other countries and researchers that would like to implement a similar questionnaire considering the related conclusions.

"Do Online Gambling Products Require Traditional Therapy for Gambling Disorder to Change? Evidence from Focus Group Interviews with Mental Health Professionals Treating Online Gamblers","Online gambling has significantly altered the situational and structural characteristics of gambling products, to the extent that online gamblers might be substantially different from traditional offline gamblers. A growing body of literature has identified the evolving features of online gambling and the individuals who engage in it. However, beyond understanding the individual characteristics of this subgroup, relatively less effort has been made to examine whether existing cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) approaches are still entirely relevant for online problem gamblers, or whether changes are needed to adapt according to gambling mode of access. To understand what kind of challenges online gambling poses to mental health professionals dealing with disordered gamblers, four focus groups comprising 28 Spanish participants were carried out. All the treatment providers had ongoing experience with online gamblers undergoing treatment, and included clinical psychologists, mental health social workers, and a medical doctor. The data were examined using thematic analysis. The analysis identified five main themes that characterised online gamblers: (1) being of younger age, (2) lack of conflicts at home and at work/educational centre, rarely presenting violent or aggressive behaviour, (3) gambling disorder only being identified by overdue debt, (4) co-occurring conditions with technology-related abuse rather than other substance-related addictions, and (5) skill-based gambling. The study highlights mental health workers' perceived insecurities about how to best treat online gamblers, and discusses the specific characteristics that CBT for gambling disorder might need to incorporate to adjust for this particular group of gamblers.","Lopez-Gonzalez, Hibai; Jimenez-Murcia, Susana; Rius-Buitrago, Alicia; Griffiths, Mark D","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10899-021-10064-9","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Gambl Stud;2021 Oct 16.; Publication details: J Gambl Stud;2021 Oct 16.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19388,""

"Social networks, depression and anxiety","Social networks are virtual spaces currently connecting over 3.8 billion users worldwide. The number of users and the number of different social networks is constantly growing, which indicates that technology-mediated daily life has become an integral part of life in the 21st century. It is indubitable that there are many advantages to technological progress, but the question remains whether the use of social networks necessarily contributes to the wellbeing and quality of life of every individual. Over the last decade, a growing number of studies have attempted to clarify the connection between the use of social networks and mental health. In the context of social networks, the most-studied factor is the subjective assessment of time spent on social networks and the type of social network use in those periods (active/passive use). In the context of mental health, the anxiety and depression have been most extensively studied, while self-esteem, fear of missing out, social comparison, and loneliness have shown themselves to be mediators/moderators in the association between social networks and mental health. However, it is extremely important to place existing research in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This review article presents the main findings in this field with the clear conclusion that further longitudinal and experimental studies are required to clarify the causal direction of this relationship and the potential protective and risk factors, especially in the context of the alterations in the importance of social networks in maintaining social contacts during the pandemic.

Broj korisnika kao i broj razlicitih drustvenih mreza je u stalnom porastu sto ukazuje da je tehnologijom posredovana svakodnevica postala sastavni dio zivota u 21. stoljecu. Nedvojbeno je da postoje brojne prednosti napretka tehnologije, no otvara se pitanje pridonosi li nuzno uporaba drustvenih mreza dobrobiti i kvaliteti zivota svakog pojedinca. Zadnjih desetak godina sve je veci broj istrazivanja koja nastoje razjasniti vezu izmedu koristenja drustvenih mreza i psihickog zdravlja. U kontekstu drustvenih mreza najvise se ispituje subjektivna procjena kolicine vremena provedenog na drustvenim mrezama te na koji je nacin to vrijeme provedeno (aktivna/pasivna uporaba). U kontekstu psihickog zdravlja najistrazivaniji konstrukti su anksioznost i depresivnost, dok se samopostovanje, strah od propustanja, socijalna usporedba, usamljenost pokazuju medijatorima/moderatorima povezanosti drustvenih mreza i psihickog zdravlja.

"Work from home, mental health and employee needs: A pilot study in selected information technology organizations in india","INTRODUCTION: The Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted the economy and has resulted in changes to the working arrangements of employees who are based at home and may continue to work from home (WFH). Organizations are expected to develop an inclusive policy for their employees to promote mental health whilst working from home. The aim of this study was to document the impact of WFH on mental health and determine the expectations of employees from their organizations regarding occupational health policy. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional study was conducted on the impact of work from home on mental health and to document the mental health support needs of employees. Google form was floated through social media platform to receive the responses. A total of 74 responses were received. Descriptive analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel, while qualitative answers were manually analysed. RESULTS: About 67% employees (n=45) mentioned that their workload has increased significantly during work from home. Thirty five percent (n=26) felt lonely and lost and 47% (n= 34) felt disconnected from the real world, indicating the mental health impact of work from home. Fifty three percent employees (n=40) mentioned that there were no efforts made by their organization to reduce the mental health impact of work from home. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that there is an urgent need to create a comprehensive occupational health and safety policy inclusive of strategies to improve mental health by the organizations in light of ""work from home"" as a ""new-normal"".

This study described the weekly fluctuation from day to day of moral distress, coping, and general health in frontline HCWs who worked during the first epidemic wave (May-June 2020) of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. Methods: This study has an intensive longitudinal design, and a convenience sampling procedure was employed to enroll physicians, nurses, allied health pro-fessions, and healthcare assistants. Data collection was performed using diary encompassed four sections: a socio-demographic form (required only at the baseline data collection) and three scales to assess moral dis-tress, coping, and general health. Results: Results confirmed poor perceived health and mild moral distress in frontline HCWs, especially in HCWs with offspring, during the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic and the stability of their daily perception over a working week regarding moral distress, general health, and avoidant coping strategy, while approach coping strategy reported a slight fluctuation over time. Conclusions: Accordingly, on the one hand, these results confirm that outcomes regarding mental health and moral distress are pretty stable and provide insights, on the other hand, regarding the possible organizational interventions to support approach coping strategy as it seems more susceptible to variation over time.

"Potential Solutions to Selected Consequences of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health Relevant Also for the Post-COVID Era","This article is based on the results of a survey conducted during the period from December 2020 to May 2021 involving 300 respondents in different countries: Italy, Spain, Hungary, Great Britain, the USA, Poland, Slovakia, Romania, Serbia, Ukraine, and African countries. The research was carried out on the basis of narrative case studies. In order to obtain an adequate methodological answer in regard to the focus of the research, which showed the personal and subjective views of the respondents, a qualitative approach using in-depth online interviews was desirable. Each interview lasted 90 minutes. The aim of the survey was to find out how designing your own online intervention program can help respondents alleviate their difficulties. It is based on human-centered ap-proaches;methods of reducing stress;methods of strength-ening the presence-focused mode;the so-called 'here and now' approach;and some relevant theses of Christian missi-ology and non-radicalized Islam that promote human health and dignity. The condition for entry into the survey was the age of the participants (over 40) and experience of at least one of the psychological consequences of, or situations in, a long-term psychological burden due to the COVID-19 pan-demic. Survey participants became infected with COVID-19 or had recovered from it before entering the survey. Many of them had other associated health problems, including COVID-19 and its psychological consequences, chronic ill-nesses, were at risk of poverty, social exclusion or insuffi-cient professional health and social care. During the survey, the online intervention program focused on gradually accom-panying survey participants towards their full autonomy (for example, in thinking, naming the feelings they experience), encouraging them to take responsibility for their lives and encouraging them by positively evaluating their achieve-ments and the results they achieved over the course of the year. The participants in the survey showed a significant weakening of rumination, which is behind the psychological difficulties, especially mood disorders and anxiety disorders. The online intervention program worked intensively with survey participants in line with the need to activate their change process. The intention of the online intervention pro-gram was also to help them regain their inner balance and their full place in society they had before the pandemic. The survey showed that even in the post-COVID period, special online strategies aimed at promoting mental and physical health should not lose their relevance. The results of such re-search may provide relevant and inspiring stimuli for further and new specific research, studies and analyses in the field of the benefits of specialized online interventions aimed at strengthening physical and mental health. Especially during heightened critical periods, which global crises and their con-sequences bring into various areas of life for the entire pop-ulation. These are, for example, crises in the form of other pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had a far-reaching impact on today's society.","Masan, J.; Hamarova, M.","https://doi.org/10.22359/cswhi_12_3_01","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Clin.

"Assessment of Psychological Stress among Quarantined COVID-19 Patients","Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been causing a worldwide pandemic since the end of 2019. This study looked at the mental health of COVID-19 patients who had been quarantined. This cross-sectional study included fifty COVID -19 patients who were under quarantine. Online self-reported questionnaires were used in the study. Demographic data and an inventory of pandemic -related stress factors (PRSF) were used to analyse COVID-19-related stress domains. The quarantined COVID-19 patients had pandemic related stress among themselves. Lack of knowledge about infectiveness and virulence (78%), sleep disorders (94%), financial concerns (92 %) and feeling isolated and avoidance by others (90%) were the most common stressors. Eighty two percent of the patients felt that they were being protected by the family and relatives and only 48% felt that the government is taking the responsibility of protecting them. The findings show that COVID-19 patients in quarantine reported severe psychological distress. As a result, this study urge that required measures be taken to alleviate COVID-19 patients stress, with special focus paid to patients perceptions of stigma and coping techniques.","Venkatesan, K.; Alshahrani, S.

"Argentine registry of acute heart failure (ARGEN-IC) â€œreality in pandemic timesâ€","Introduction: The ARGEN-IC registry allowed knowing the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of acute heart failure (AHF) in our country;however, there are no available national data of the consequences on AHF of social, preventive and mandatory distancing due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of patients admitted to the ARGEN-IC registry during confinement and social distancing due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods: Patients included in the ARGEN-IC registry during March-June 2019 (group A: Non-COVID era) were compared with those admitted in the same period of 2020 (group B: COVID era). Affiliation data, clinical, biochemical, imaging and therapeutic characteristics during hospitalization and the associated complications (cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality) were recorded. Results: A total of 361 patients were included in the study: 222 in group A and 139 in group B. Significant differences were observed between both populations in terms of age (group A: 70.9 Â± 14.8 years vs. group B: 75 Â± 13.3, p = 0.008), history of hypertension (group A: 70.2 % vs. group B: 87.7%, p &lt;0.001), history of ischemic stroke (group A: 4.5% vs. group B: 10.07%, p = 0.039), and left ventricular hypertrophy (group A: 4.9 % vs. group B: 1.5 %, p = 0.021). No significant differences were found between the two populations regarding other variables such as etiology, triggering factors, and forms of clinical presentation, although there was a trend towards greater history of depression in group B. There was no difference in the length of hospital stay or mortality. Conclusions: During compulsory social distancing in our country, we observed a decrease in hospitalizations for AHF in 2020 compared with those registered in the same period of 2019, but the population requiring hospitalization was older and with more comorbidities. No differences were observed in overall and cardiovascular mortality, or in the length of hospital stay.","Santucci, J.

"Sexual and psychological health of couples with azoospermia in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic","Background To date, there have been no reports on the sexual and psychological health of patients with azoospermia during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Previous studies on the sexual health of couples with azoospermia are limited and are especially lacking in data on the wives of azoospermic men. Methods We conducted a caseâ€“control cross-sectional study between 1 July 2020 and 20 December 2020. In total, 100 couples with azoospermia comprised the experimental group and 100 couples with normozoospermia comprised the control group. The couplesâ€™ sexual health was measured using standardised sexual function questionnaires (male: International Index of Erectile Function-15 [IIEF-15] and Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool [PEDT];female: Female Sexual Function Index [FSFI]) and a self-designed questionnaire to evaluate changes in sexual behaviours (sexual satisfaction, desire, frequency of sexual activity, masturbation, and pornography use) during lockdown. The couplesâ€™ psychological health was measured using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale and 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The Actorâ€“Partner Interdependence Model (APIM) was used to analyse the associations between sexual health and psychological health. Results The IIEF-15 scores (53.07 Â± 11.11 vs. 57.52 Â± 8.57, t = - 3.17, p = 0.00) were lower and the PEDT scores (6.58 Â± 3.13 vs. 5.17 Â± 2.22, t = 3.67, p = 0.00) and incidence of premature ejaculation (<U+03C7>2 = 14.73, p = 0.00) were higher for men with azoospermia than for men with normozoospermia. Compared with those of wives of men with normozoospermia, the total FSFI scores (25.12 Â± 5.56 vs. 26.75 Â± 4.82, t = - 2.22, p = 0.03) of wives of men with azoospermia were lower. The chi-square test showed that the perceived changes in sexual satisfaction (<U+03C7>2 = 7.22, p = 0.03), frequency of masturbation (<U+03C7>2 = 21.96, p = 0.00), and pornography use (<U+03C7>2 = 10.90, p = 0.01) were significantly different between the female groups with azoospermia and normozoospermia, but there were no significant changes in sexual behaviour between the male groups. The GAD-7 (men: 7.18 Â± 5.56 vs. 5.68 Â± 4.58, p = 0.04;women: 6.65 Â± 5.06 vs. 5.10 Â± 3.29, p = 0.01) and PHQ-9 scores (men: 10.21 Â± 6.37 vs. 7.49 Â± 6.10, p = 0.00;women: 8.81 Â± 6.50 vs. 6.98 Â± 4.43, p = 0.02) were significantly higher for couples with azoospermia than for couples with normozoospermia. The APIM showed that for couples with azoospermia, sexual function negatively correlated with their own anxiety (men: ÃŸ = -0.22, p = 0.00;women: ÃŸ = -0.38, p = 0.00) and depression symptoms (men: ÃŸ = -0.21, p = 0.00;women: ÃŸ = -0.57, p = 0.00) but not with their partnerâ€™s anxiety and depression symptoms (p &gt; 0.05). Conclusions Couples with azoospermia had a lower quality of sexual function and higher levels of psychological distress than couples with normozoospermia. Their sexual health negatively correlated with psychological distress.","Meng, Dong, Tao, Yanqiang, Wu, Shanshan, Li, Zhengtao, Wang, Xiaobin, Tan, Jichun","https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.12162","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: PeerJ;2021.; Publication details: PeerJ;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19404,""
"Formulation rationale for the development of SARS-COV-2 immunochromatography rapid test kits in India","Humanity has been continuously threatened by epidemics and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has shown greater epidemic potential. According to the World Health Organization, measures such as rapid diagnosis, immediate isolation, and precautionary contact tracing are key tools of epidemic control. The method of detection or testing is critical in this epidemiological control, where SARS-CoV-2-positive cases are increasingly growing, leading to community infection. Immunochromatographic test kits have been described for the diagnosis of various infectious diseases because of their rapid scalability, convenient use, and prompt validation. The benefits of the immunochromatographic test kits include evaluation of the sample in approximately 20 minutes, lower cost per sample, and simple directions to use. Such test kits are composed of an uncut sheet structure that is protein conjugated, labeled with markers, and reagents coated in a nitrocellulose membrane. The need for thorough vetting is a major concern for the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization, Indian Council of Medical Research and other regulators, as more businesses are rushing to produce serologic test kits for SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. Initial reports of 86%-89% sensitivity and 84.2%â€“98.6% specificity were reported for these kits. Nonetheless, many national reports show variability in test accuracy significantly among various commercial suppliers. The virusâ€™s more recent mutated strains (B.1.1.7, B.1.617, and B.1.351) have also raised concerns about their detectability using these test kits. In India, manufacturers are developing rapid test kits to detect SARS-CoV-2 by importing pre-antigen or antibody-coated uncut sheets from vendors and then cutting them into strips. Such sheets also have problems with specificity and are expensive. The possibility of developing kits with an indigenous protein coating and conjugation to detect antigens and antibodies needs to be explored by Indian researchers. This communication describes techniques to develop precise rapid test kits for detecting SARS-CoV-2. Â© 2021","Manta, P.; Chauhan, R.; Gandhi, H.; Mahant, S.; Kapoor, D.

The sample consisted of 501 participants, who were collected through an online survey that was made available from October 5 to 24, 2020. Results: Age (OR = .93;95% CI: .900 - .979) and being without a partner (OR = 2.64;95% CI: 1.347 - 5.201) increase the probability of suffering severe depressive symptoms. Younger people were .95 more likely to have elevated stress. Being a woman (OR = 2.37;95% CI: 1,144 - 4,915) and not having a job (OR = 2.62;95% CI: 1,308 - 5,254) was associated with a higher probability of suffering from severe anxiety. Conclusion: Associations were found in sociodemographic factors such as sex, age and economic income with depressive symptoms, level of stress and anxiety in times of COVID-19. These results project preliminary data on some aspects related to mental health in the Mexican context during the current health crisis.","Trujillo-HernÃ¡ndez, Pedro Enrique, GÃ³mez-Melasio, Dafne Astrid, Lara-Reyes, Braulio JosuÃ©, Medina-FernÃ¡ndez, IsaÃ­ Arturo, HernÃ¡ndez-MartÃ­nez, Eva Kerena","https://doi.org/10.6018/eglobal.471511","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: EnfermerÃ­a Global; 20(4):14-25, 2021.; Publication details: EnfermerÃ­a Global; 20(4):14-25, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19406,""
"COVID-19 and its triangle effects on humanâ€™s well-being: A qualitative research method used to collect appropriate data","Background: The health-related challenges caused by the virus and the implications of the policies implemented to fight against it further cause psychological and socio-economic consequences that could threaten the well-being of the people. Objective: This study has been carried out to identify peopleâ€™s psychosoical reactions toward COVID-19. Method: Semi-structured interviews as a qualitative research method were used to collect data from 20 people across three countries, and content analysis was applied to interpret the data. Results: Overall, the results indicated that COVID-19 has had negative consequences on psychological well-being of the general population. COVID-19 has forced people to maintain social distance and has led to family conflicts in some families. Moreover, COVID-19 has caused loss of jobs and mental health problems. Conclusion: COVID-19 has affected peopleâ€™s daily life and a significant influence on individuals and society. This research demonstrates some of the ramifications in terms of psychological well-being of the general population. One of the most important findings is the importance of social life and meeting people in person, not just online.

"Knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward COVID-19 among persian birth cohort participants","BACKGROUND: Knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) toward COVID-19 play an important role in controlling the outbreak. The present study aimed to investigate the KAP of a group of women toward COVID-19 during the second wave of the outbreak in Iran. METHOD AND MATERIAL: A cross-sectional survey of 2862 women was conducted in May and June 2020 in two centers of Persian birth cohort. The survey instrument was a self-reported questionnaire Multivariable linear regression analysis to identify factors associated with knowledge and practice. toward COVID-19 and multinomial logistic regression analyses to identify factors associated with attitudes. Unstandardized regression coefficients (ÃŸ) and odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals were used to quantify the associations between variables and KAP. RESULT: Good knowledge and optimistic attitudes toward the successful control of COVID-19 was seen among participants. Overall, about 57.3% (1640), 41.1% (1176), and 1.6% (46) of respondents were categorized as low (score &lt;50%), moderate (score: 50%-80%), and high (score &gt; 80%) proper practice, respectively. Eighty-five individuals with COVID-19 experience (3.0%) had lower knowledge score (79.91 Â± 17.93 vs. 83.81 Â± 13.88, P &lt; 0.001) and lower proper practice score (40.22 Â± 16.57 vs. 47.96 Â± 16.15, respectively, P &lt; 0.001) compared to those who were not infected. A higher level of knowledge was associated with appropriate practice in both groups of positive attitudes (<U+03C7> 2 = 32.23, P &lt; 0.001) and negative attitudes (<U+03C7> 2 = 31.49, P &lt; 0.001).

"Psychological impact of COVID-19 on medical interns - Findings from a nationwide survey","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the mental health of health-care workers worldwide. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of psychological distress in medical interns during the pandemic and examine the factors influencing it. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted using snowball sampling among 764 medical interns across India, who were evaluated using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, Fear of COVID-19 Scale, and semi-structured questionnaires. Univariate analysis was done using Chi-square test, unpaired t-test, and ANOVA, while multivariate analysis was conducted using binary logistic regression. RESULTS: 57.5% of the interns reported psychological distress, with 39.8% having moderate-to-severe distress. Past consultation with a mental health professional (odds ratio [OR]: 2.15;95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.42-3.26) and perceived lack of support from friends (OR: 2.33;95% CI: 1.33-3.99) and faculty (OR: 2.15;95% CI: 1.41-3.28) were the most significant predictors of distress. Fear of COVID-19 was higher in interns who were female, were medically ill, were dissatisfied with the pandemic preparedness at the hospital, and perceived the faculty to be less approachable and supportive. Majority of the interns felt that the pandemic had hampered their learning and were worried about an extension to their internship and their performance in the postgraduate entrance examinations. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological distress was highly prevalent among interns, with several workplaces and personal factors affecting the distress levels. Most interns perceived a negative impact of the pandemic on their learning and career. Addressing these issues could help alleviate the distress and bolster the mental health of interns.

"Hunger, fear, and isolation â€“ A qualitative analysis of media reports of COVID-19-related suicides in India","Background: India's suicide rates are among the highest in the world and may increase further as a consequence of COVID-19. There is a need to examine which pandemic related stressors may be contributing to suicide, in order to inform the deployment of suicide prevention strategies, for the current as well as future pandemics. Aim: To understand pandemic related stressors contributing to suicide in India. Methods: We identified and conducted a thematic analysis of Internet media reports of COVID-19 related suicides in India between February 1, 2020 (2 days after the first COVID-19 case), and May 31, 2020, (the end of phase four of the nationwide lockdown). Results: Ten pandemic stressors spanning both disease and lockdown-related factors were identified in 291 suicides. Economic hardship was present in a third;other notable stressors were: fear of the virus;isolation;desperation to be connected with loved ones or return home;and craving for alcohol. Men and young people seemed particularly vulnerable to these stressors. Conclusions: COVID-19 related suicides appear to be precipitated by social and economic adversities, mainly associated with containment strategies. These findings need to be confirmed by national suicide data. Suicide prevention strategies should mitigate the impact of recognized stressors in the long term, target high-risk individuals, and offer mental health care alongside containment strategies.","Madhumitha, Balaji, Patel, Vikram","https://doi.org/10.4103/indianjpsychiatry.indianjpsychiatry_100_21","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Indian Journal of Psychiatry; 63(5):467-482, 2021.; Publication details: Indian Journal of Psychiatry; 63(5):467-482, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19410,""
"Estimating Electric Power Requirements for Mechanically Shredding Massage Chairs and Treadmills at a Recycling Plant","South Korea has operated under laws to collect and recycle the waste of electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) utilizing a system based on the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) system since 2003. In 2020, the number of products managed by the EPR increased from 27 to 50. Among the 50 products, massage chairs and treadmills are recognized as the items avoided in recycling centers or by recyclers due to their large volume, large weight, and long disassembly times. This study was a preliminary study in which the physical shredding process for massage chairs and treadmills could be introduced, and the electrical power requirements calculated. In the methodology, Vickers hardness was measured by sampling two actual products, and the tensile and shear strength were calculated from the hardness. Based on the shear strength, the force affecting the cutter was calculated and converted into torque and horsepower. In particular, the actual specifications of the crusher, designed and operated in the recycling center, were applied to the study, and the design was based on the treatment capacity of 10 tons per hour. Conclusively, the proper electrical power for crushing the massage chair and treadmill was analyzed as 719.5 and 459.7 HP, respectively.","Yoo, Junsoo, Lee, Choongwoo, Kim, Sudong, Choi, Jonghyun, Park, Jihwan","https://doi.org/10.3390/su13168938","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Sustainability; 13(16):8938, 2021.; Publication details: Sustainability; 13(16):8938, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19411,""
"Anxiety controlling wrist band","Since the 1950s, suicide rate has been tripled among people aged between 15 and 24. Also, suicide is reported as the second most common cause of their deaths. Depression and anxiety are one of the major reasons for planting the thought of suicide in students' mind. People with anxiety disorders and stressful mind have excessive worry and fear about everyday situations. This intense worry and fear, though appears harmless, can reach its peak within minutes causing panic attacks. The main objective of our project is calming down the mind of people who are emotionally unstable and preventing the occurrence of any medical complications due to anxiety.

"Short-Term Changes in Internalizing Symptoms and Help-Seeking Attitudes During the Coronavirus Pandemic","Introduction: Existing data suggest that American adults experience added emotional difficulties amid the coronavirus disease outbreak. Psychotherapy can help mitigate mental health concerns;still, many individuals with unmet mental health needs refrain from professional help-seeking. According to theory of reasoned action, negative help-seeking attitudes are key barriers to engagement with mental health services. Given that individuals with severe distress are more likely to seek therapy than individuals with mild psychopathology symptoms, greater initial and increasing levels of internalizing symptoms amid the coronavirus outbreak likely are linked to increasingly favorable attitudes toward professional help-seeking. Method: In the early months of the coronavirus pandemic, American community adults, N = 831 [49.0% Asian Americans], Mage = 46.78, 50.2% women, were recruited for a panel survey study conducted over the course of three weeks. At each time point, participants completed questionnaires to assess their internalizing symptoms associated with depression and anxiety as well as their openness to and perceived value/need in treatment seeking. Results: Very few participants-especially Asian Americans -were seeking counseling during the study period. Latent growth curve results showed a general decline in internalizing symptoms, and no changes in openness to and perceived need in professional help-seeking. Whereas there were no time-varying correlations between internalizing symptoms and help-seeking attitudes, individuals with greater baseline internalizing symptoms generally were more open to seeking professional help and perceived less value in mental health services. Sensitivity analyses showed patterns in the Asian American subsample similar to those in the overall sample. Discussion: Implications for research and clinical practice are discussed.","Lui, P.

"A Brief, Mobile Intervention to Decrease Depression and Loneliness and Improve Relationship Quality During the Covid-19 Pandemic","Introduction: Effective, scalable interventions to address depression and loneliness and improve the quality of social relationships are needed for public health in pandemic and non-pandemic contexts. Towards this end, a randomized, controlled trial tested a mobile-based intervention, derived from social psychological and relationship science, for improving relational well-being and decreasing depression and loneliness. Methods: Participants were randomly assigned to either intervention (n = 719) or assessment only (n = 701) conditions and completed daily diary surveys for 28 days in the midst of the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. In the middle 14 days of the study, intervention participants received daily text-message suggestions for improving relational and mental well-being. Results: Results indicated that the intervention decreased depression and loneliness and improved relationships during the intervention period but these changes were not sustained when the intervention ceased. Discussion: Results are encouraging in that evidence-based suggestions can be scaled effectively but additional efforts are required to sustain improvements over time.","Kanter, Jonathan W.; Rosen, Daniel C.; Nash, Michael G.; Kuczynski, Adam","https://doi.org/10.1521/jscp.2021.40.5.447","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology; 40(5):422, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology; 40(5):422, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19415,""
"Post-COVID depression among a sample of Egyptian patients and its associated factors","Background Depression is classified as a mood disorder. It may be described as feelings of sadness, loss, or anger that interfere with a person's everyday activities. Nowadays, we are in COVID-19 pandemic. From practice after COVID-19 illness resolves, some of the recovering patients return back smoothly to their pre-illness life. Others experience different mood changes. Anxiety and depression are the most common. Those patients with improving general health, radiology, and oxygenation have different somatic complaints such as sensation of dyspnoea. Psychological support and psychiatric evaluation can help them to overcome this situation and get rid of dyspnoea sensation. This work aimed to evaluate the relation between COVID-19 survivors and depression and to how extent this could affect functional status of the study participants. Results This work recruited 102 adult patients as a sample of Egyptians who were positive PCR for SARS-COV2, turned negative and free of symptoms for 1 month or more which include physicians, nurses, employees, and literate health care workers of Ain Shams University hospitals attending chest outpatient clinic for follow-up. The majority were 47.1% in age group (35-55 years), sixty two (60.8%) participants were females, 74.5% had high education, and 24.5% were smokers. The most frequent symptom reported by study participants as the most annoying COVID-19 symptom was fever (32.4%). Beck depression inventory score showed that 59 (57.8%) participants had no depression, 24 (23.5%) had mild depression, 16 (15.7%) had moderate depression, and only 3 (2.9%) participants had severe depression. Logistic regression analysis was done to measure effect of steroid use and grade of dyspnoea on development of moderate or severe post-COVID depression and showed that higher grades of dyspnoea were associated with higher probability of development of moderate or severe post-COVID depression (p value &lt; 0.05). Conclusion As predicted, COVID-19 survivors presented a high prevalence of psychiatric sequelae. Age, sex, and education level were important association factors. Higher educational level was associated with higher score of depression due to increased awareness of the current pandemic issue. Steroids' use was proposed as a cause of depression since the majority of moderate or severe depression group were on steroids. Higher grades of dyspnoea were associated with higher probability of development of moderate or severe post-COVID depression. It is suggested that COVID-19 survivors should be assessed, to properly diagnose and treat any psychiatric conditions, to reduce the disease burden.","Ezzelregal, H. G.; Hassan, A. M.; Mohamed, R.

"A Controlled Evaluation of a Sport-Specific Performance Optimization Program in an Athlete Diagnosed With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Oppositional Defiant Disorder Within the Context of COVID-19","Adolescent athletes with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) experience unique challenges that impact their sport performance, such as making errors due to poor concentration. The current multiple-baseline across behaviors case trial (i.e., positive assertion and negative assertion) is an evaluation of The Optimum Performance Program in Sports in an adolescent athlete diagnosed with ADHD and ODD. Intervention skill sets were targeted sequentially in a virtual format to safeguard against COVID-19 contraction. A battery of psychological measures was administered at baseline, post-intervention, and 1-month follow-up. Results indicated negative and positive assertion skills improved, but only when targeted, and severity of ADHD and ODD symptom severity, general mental health symptoms, and factors interfering with sport performance decreased from pre- to post-intervention and these improvements were maintained at 1-month follow-up. Similar improvements occurred in relationships with coaches, teammates, and family. Treatment integrity and consumer satisfaction were high.

"Just a Flu? Self-perceived infection mediates the link between conspiracy beliefs and Covid-19 health beliefs and behaviors","The Covid-19 pandemic has inspired many conspiracy theories, which are associated with detrimental health beliefs and behaviors (e.g. reduced physical distancing;decreased vaccination intentions). We propose a previously unrecognized mediator of these relationships: A self-perceived likelihood to already have experienced a Covid-19 infection. Results from a large sample (N = 9033) revealed that self-perceived infections mediated the link between conspiracy beliefs and health beliefs and behaviors. These findings emerged independently of institutional distrust, and actual infections as indicated by a positive medical test. These findings suggest that conspiracy beliefs shape people's interpretation of the physical signals of their own body.","van Prooijen, J. W.; Etienne, T. W.; Kutiyski, Y.; Krouwel, A.

"Nurse Burnout in Hospice and Palliative Care: A Scoping Review","Burnout in hospice and palliative care nurses is a growing issue, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, few studies have focused specifically on burnout in this population. A scoping review was undertaken to identify what is known about burnout among hospice and palliative care nurses, and to unify disparate findings. Analysis of eight articles revealed three overarching categories: personal factors, organizational/workplace factors, and nursing professional development factors. Each category was then divided into three cross-cutting subcategories: contributory and noncontributory factors, mitigating factors, and workplace issues. Recommendations for individuals include self-care as well as self-awareness of intrinsic characteristics that can predispose one to burnout. Within the workplace, leaders are challenged to support evidence-based practice and ongoing education. Role modeling positive communication skills, effective conflict mitigation, responsiveness, promotion of equity, and workplace commitment also help to create a culture of wellness. Nursing professional development may aid in resilience-building, and promotion of self-efficacy, self-confidence, and assertiveness. Although all identified recommendations were derived from the literature, no interventional studies have been conducted to test the effects of suggested interventions. Future research should include interventional studies as well as qualitative research to capture nuanced experiences of burnout in hospice and palliative care nurses.

"Improving frontline healthcare workers wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic through creative writing;a pilot study and a unique collaboration between the open university and an acute hospital trust","Aim: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in healthcare workers (HCW) with a wide breadth of previous experience caring for a vast number of dying patients;including many with distressing symptoms. Recent rapid review of the evidence has highlighted that HCWs responding to the pandemic are under significant physical and psychological stressors which may lead to ongoing mental health problems;with research yet to illicit the most effective way to provide support. Creative writing for wellbeing has previously been used to support war veterans and so a pilot study was developed to investigate if this method could potentially improve wellbeing for HCWs. Methods: All clinical staff at an acute hospital were invited to participate via e-mail. Written informed consent was sought from all participants and background data gathered including their role and specialty. All participants were provided with a Creative Writing for wellbeing workbook and invited to attend three virtual workshops, over 3 months. Participants were encouraged to continue therapeutic creative writing between sessions. After each workshop, participants were asked to anonymously complete a survey, ranking on a Likert scale multiple aspects relating to their perceived usefulness of the sessions in improving wellbeing. Results: 14 frontline hospital HCWs participated, from a range of specialties;included 7 nurses, 4 doctors and 2 other HCWs. Feedback was overwhelmingly positive with 100% of survey respondents agreeing that they had found it to be a positive experience and that they felt enabled to use the techniques learned for the future. Conclusion: This pilot shows creative writing workshops to be a feasible and welcome intervention, in providing support to healthcare workers facing the COVID-19 pandemic. Although numbers are small, a positive impact was felt by those who participated. The next step is a multi-site study to gather evidence of effectiveness of this intervention on a larger scale.","Wakefield, D.; McEvoy, M.; Campbell, S.","https://doi.org/10.1177/02692163211035909","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Palliative Medicine; 35(1 SUPPL):126-127, 2021.; Publication details: Palliative Medicine; 35(1 SUPPL):126-127, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19421,""

"How Green Finance Sparks Sustainability: Using Big Data Analysis and Visualization Software to Unite Future Economic and Social Value Potential","The core concept of socialism with Chinese characteristics for the new era is to promote the optimization and upgrading of the economic system and the construction of sustainable ecological civilization. In the wake of the COVID-19, it has become a major issue for countries around the world to pursue green recovery. Green is a necessary condition for sustainable development, finance is the leading force of social economy, and the development of green finance is the core call of today's era. Guangdong, as the main force of the national economic lifeline, took the lead in green finance innovation and promoted the transformation and adjustment of leading industries. At present, the banking industry has repeatedly disclosed the environment, society and governance (ESG) in its social responsibility reports in order to achieve the strategic goal of carbon peak and carbon neutral, but there is a lack of systematic review on the measures and implementation. Aiming at objective problems, this paper mainly discusses how green finance stimulates sustainability and explores the value potential of the future economy and society. Based on this, this paper selected 300 literatures from the Web of Science (WOS) database, mapped the coword cluster, and analyzed their annual trend, topic scope, literature sources, etc. With the help of big data analysis technology and visualization software function, scientometrics is used to demonstrate the possibility and feasibility of the research contents in relevant fields, and to produce cutting-edge academic achievements with insight. In order to achieve the ultimate goal of green development with capital and financial design for diversified and deep thinking, to provide reference value theory for co-construction environment, data-driven investment scale and sustainable development, to accelerate the green finance reform in Guangdong Province and even the country to make a forward-looking small contribution.

"Impact of SARS-CoV-2 on training and mental wellbeing of surgical gynaecological oncology trainees","Introduction/Background*The SARS-CoV-2 global-pandemic has caused a crisis disrupting health systems worldwide. Whilst efforts are afoot to determine the extent of disruption, impact on gynaecological oncology trainees/training has not been explored. We present data from an international survey on impact of SARS-CoV-2 on clinical practice, medical education, and mental wellbeing of surgical gynaecological oncology trainees.MethodologyIn our prospective cohort study, a customised web-based-survey was circulated to surgical gynaecological oncology trainees from national/international organisations (May-November 2020). Validated questionnaires assessed mental wellbeing. Wilcoxon rank sum test and Fisherâ€™s exact test tested hypothesis about differences in means and proportions. Multiple linear regression evaluated effect of variables on psychological/mental wellbeing outcomes. Outcomes included clinical practice, medical education, anxiety & depression, distress, mental wellbeingResult(s)*127 trainees from 34 countries responded. 52% (66/127) were from countries with national training programmes (UK/USA/Netherlands/Canada/Australia) and 48% (61/127) from non-national training programme countries. 28% had suspected/confirmed COVID19;28% experienced drop in household income;20% self-isolated from households;45% had to re-use personal protective equipment and 22% purchased their own. 32.3% (41/127) trainees (national training programme trainees=16.6% (11/66);non national training programme trainees=49.1% (30/61), p=0.02) require additional time to complete their training fellowship. The additional training time anticipated did not differ between trainees from countries with/without national training programmes (p=0.11). Surgical training was detrimentally impacted for 50% trainees, with more national training programme trainees (62.3% (38/61) than non national training programme trainees (38.5% (25/65), p=0.01) reporting a detrimental impact despite a greater reduction in mean surgical exposure reported by non national training programme trainees. Departmental teaching continued throughout the pandemic for 69% (87/126) trainees, albeit at reduced frequency for 16.1% (14/87), and virtually for 88.5% (77/87). Trainees reporting adequate pastoral support had better mental wellbeing with lower-levels of anxiety/depression (p=0.02) and distress (p&lt;0.001). National training programme trainees experienced higher levels of distress (p=0.01). Mean mental wellbeing scores were significantly higher pre-pandemic (8.3 (SD=1.6) versus post-pandemic (7 (SD=1.8);p=&lt;0.01).Conclusion*SARS-CoV-2 has negatively impacted surgical training, household income and psychological/mental wellbeing of surgical gynaecological oncology trainees. Overall clinical impact was worse for non national training programme versus national training programme-trainees, though national-training-programme-trainees reported greater distress. COVID19-sickness increased anxiety/depression. The recovery-phase must focus on improving mental-wellbeing and addressing lost training opportunities.","Gaba, F.; Blyuss, O.; Rodriguez, I.; Dilley, J.; Wan, Y.

"Lessons in family-centred pandemic care: the psychological outcomes of families admitted with covid-19 in Singapore","BackgroundChildren are mostly infected with SARS-CoV-2 through household transmission. All children diagnosed with COVID-19 in Singapore require hospital isolation in one of Singaporeâ€™s 2 paediatric units. Discharge was initially upon nasopharyngeal clearance. This was revised on 29 May 2020 to time-based discharge of well patients, regardless of viral clearance, after Day 21 of illness. Concerted efforts are made to admit infected children together with their caregivers as a family unit.ObjectivesThis study aims to explore the psychological experiences of children and their caregivers isolated in hospital due to COVID-19.MethodsA prospective mixed-methods design was used to evaluate the psychological status of hospitalised family units where at least one child &lt; 18 years had SARS-CoV-2 infection.Patient medical records were reviewed for demographic and clinical information. Parents and children &gt;7 years old underwent a telephone-based interview performed by a trained psychologist to explore their understanding of the infection, hospital isolation, and pandemic.Two self-reported questionnaire instruments were used to assess anxiety and depression â€“ the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ) and Screen for Adult Anxiety Related Disorders (SCAARED) in adults;SMFQ for children with the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED) Questionnaire in children =7 years old.Parents were asked to score their opinion and emotions relating to their experience in isolation on a Likert scale of 1 to 5 on a series of qualitative questionnaires.ResultsFifteen family units were admitted in our institution between March-May 2020 and were invited to participate. 11 (73%) family units were recruited- 9 child-adult dyads, a triad of 2 children and 1 adult, and 1 child who was admitted alone. The mean length of hospitalization was 25.5 days (range 20â€“31 days). The mean age of children admitted was 5.1 years (8 months â€“ 12.3 years). Five children were =7 years old and all completed interviews and questionnaires. All caregivers interviewed were positive for COVID-19. Nine parental questionnaires and 10 adult interviews were completed.Parents were overall more anxious for their children than themselves. Most common sources of anxiety were the frequency of swab tests, and uncertainty regarding swab results and duration of isolation. 44.4% of adults vs 60% of children had symptoms indicative of generalized anxiety disorder, and 66.7% of adults vs 80% of children had symptoms indicative of separation anxiety disorder. 80% of parents reported being sad about separation from other family members who were not admitted. None of the participants met criteria suggestive of depression on the SMFQ.ConclusionsFamilies were anxious about their admission despite being admitted as a family unit. Main sources of anxiety were procedural discomfort and prolonged isolation of the child. Children appeared more susceptible to separation anxiety, possibly due to limited understanding of the situation.Clear timely parental communications to provide information on clinical management and anticipated discharge should be encouraged. We recommend routine psychological assessment for all children and family units, with focus on reassurance and early recognition of evolving anxiety disorders. Time-based discharge criteria and alternative SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic sampling may ease anxiety during the pandemic.","Annushkha, Sinnathamby, Yong, Celeste, Zain, Amanda, Siau Hwei, Ng, Xin Yi, Thong, Chan, Si Min","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjpo-2021-RCPCH.250","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BMJ Paediatrics Open; 5(Suppl 1):A131-A132, 2021.; Publication details: BMJ Paediatrics Open; 5(Suppl 1):A131-A132, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19425,""
"Capturing the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in a UK district general hospital paediatric department","BackgroundIn response to the coronavirus pandemic, the paediatric team have needed to make rapid changes to our pathways and ways of working. In this time colleagues have fast tracked the testing of new processes and generated ideas to deliver continuous improvement.ObjectivesGeneral objective: To capture the rapid changes made to healthcare practices within the Paediatric department at Musgrove Park Hospital, Taunton in response to the coronavirus pandemic and to share learning across the directorate.Specific ObjectivesTo capture the strategies used to strengthen services and pathways for children, young people and familiesTo identify the barriers to better patient care within the paediatric departmentTo facilitate shared learningMethodsIn June 2020, to capture the rapid changes in response to the coronavirus pandemic, the quality improvement â€˜Change Wallâ€™ initiative was used. Core teams and individuals in the paediatric department at Musgrove Park Hospital were asked five questions regarding changes to the department based on plan, do, study, act (PDSA) cycles. Responses were collated and shared via a wall display to disseminate key learning points.ResultsWe had responses from 13 teams within the paediatric department. Results showed respondents were broadly aiming to address three aspects of care in response to the coronavirus pandemic: ensuring appropriate and timely paediatric support for the acute services;striving to continue to maintain high quality communication with patients and their families;and to alter the physical environment in order to reduce the potential transmission of COVID-19.Data captured showed multiple initiatives have been introduced. A key development was the introduction of a second paediatric high dependency area. An outpatient department working party was established and the waiting lists for new patients reduced from six months to two weeks. With paediatric oncology patients no longer able to ring the bell to celebrate the end of their treatment, a â€˜party in a boxâ€™ was introduced.To be able to provide greater out-of-hours support, the children and young peopleâ€™s mental health team and diabetes nursing team flexed their patterns of working.Colleagues in the childrenâ€™s eating disorder service have changed their working too, which has helped to prevent long inpatient admissions. In one innovative case, they offered nasogastric tube feeding top ups at home, supported by the childrenâ€™s community nursing team, and prevented a child from being admitted to the most specialist care for four to six months.ConclusionsOverall, many of the changes have been felt to be positive and are being evaluated to continue long term because of the perceived benefit to patient care and the potential to ease winter pressures. We plan to continue to use the change wall to capture changes made within paediatrics beyond coronavirus. This will allow us to continue to disseminate knowledge of changes happening and inspire further change. We plan to re-visit each team in the next six months to explore which improvements have been sustained or adapted. Moving forward we also aim to capture the view of the patient and parent/carer with regards to their perceptions of changes made.","Cooksey, Felicity, Cripps, Anna, Modgil, Gita","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjpo-2021-RCPCH.215","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BMJ Paediatrics Open; 5(Suppl 1):A113-A114, 2021.; Publication details: BMJ Paediatrics Open; 5(Suppl 1):A113-A114, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19426,""

"Longitudinal study of blood pressure among children and adolescents with ADHD suggests high levels of stress and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown","BackgroundThe whole world is experiencing an unprecedented period of severe social disruption and economic downturn due to global spread of a rare new strain of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus called Coronavirus. Children and Young people (CYP) are less likely to have severe symptoms from acute COVID-19 infections, but they are more prone to possible several adverse mental health outcomes. Social isolation (eg, marital status, number of close friends and relatives, religious or other group affiliations) is known to be a major cause of stress and risk factor for cardiovascular disease including elevated Blood Pressure (BP) and Heart rates (HR).ObjectivesThis study aimed to analyse the effect of the UK pandemic national lockdown on the cardiovascular health (CVH) of CYP with ADHD regularly followed up in a North West England Community Child Health Clinic. We compared the BP and HR measurements for the CYP before and after the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown (CPL) to assess its effects on their CVH.MethodsThe CVH of 57 CYP with ADHD was prospectively studied during their clinic reviews, before and after the official commencement of the national UK lockdown on the 26th March 2020. Pre-Hypertension (PreHT)/Elevate BP (EBP) and Hypertension (HT) were defined using both the Great Britain reference charts (between 91st and 98th centile or above 98th centile for age) and the US-based recommendations (between 90th and 95th centile or above 95 percentile for gender, age and height) respectively. The centiles for HR measurements were derived from the published reference data from existing international studies of normal children. Student paired T-test was used for comparison of pre/post CPL BP/HR data.ResultsThe clinical characteristics of CYP seen before and after the CPL were similar in terms of average age, number of co-morbidities, use of medications and gender distribution.The HR, diastolic and systolic BP of all the CYP with ADHD significantly increased during the CPL (p&lt;0.001). There was two- to four-fold increase in the number of the CYP with HT, PreHT/EBP measured after the CPL (figure 1). Diastolic BP elevation accounted for 89% to 100% of the abnormal BP measurements. This increase in measured BP and HR could not be attributed to any prescribed ADHD medications as the patients had been on the same medications and unchanged dosage for an average of more than 16 months, all within the lower range of normal doses.There was statistically significant correlation between the elevated systolic and diastolic BP, and the number of weeks from the inception of the CPL.All the CYP with elevated BP are being closely monitored in the clinic and at home. The elevated BP measurements have gradually resolved as the lockdown was eased and no long-term negative consequences have been observed.ConclusionsWe conclude that the CPL was associated with transient and reversible increase in the BP and HR of CYP with background diagnosis of ADHD and other co-morbid neurodevelopmental disorders. This is probably an indication of the psychological distress associated with the pandemic affecting CYP, as also previously described for adults.","Ogundele, Michael","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjpo-2021-RCPCH.174","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BMJ Paediatrics Open; 5(Suppl 1):A92, 2021.; Publication details: BMJ Paediatrics Open; 5(Suppl 1):A92, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19428,""
"The impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of young people aged 16â€“19 and their attitudes towards vaccination","BackgroundLittle is known about the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of young people aged 16â€“19 or their attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination. Social media suggests this demographic is not coping positively with the new changes implemented by the pandemic. Collecting data on their opinions may help with planning support for this generation of young people.ObjectivesTo explore the mental health impacts of the Coronavirus pandemic and the attitude toward coronavirus vaccines on young people aged 16â€“19, living in the UK.MethodsLinks were posted on Instagram and Snapchat inviting students aged 16â€“19 to partake in an anonymous online survey during the last week of December 2020. The survey reached 115 people;they were asked questions on the changes to their mental health, the effect of COVID-19 and their attitude towards the newly developed vaccines.Results42/115 people responded to the survey, 95% of which were sixth form students aged 16(65.9%) to 17(26.8%), mostly White British (82.9%) or Asian (12.2%). The majority of responders are in Tier 4(53.7%) followed by Tier 2(41.5%);78% lived with &gt;4 people. 2/42 (5.0%) had been diagnosed with COVID-19 whilst 90.0% have had a friend/family member diagnosed.25/41(61.0%) of the responderâ€™s felt their mental health worsened over the pandemic;10/41(24.39%) had a previously existing diagnosed mental health condition. The prevailing symptoms experienced included feeling anxious (83.0%), getting frustrated easily (78.0%), a foreboding sense (78.0%), unexplained worrying (70.7%) and difficulty relaxing (65.9%). Respondents were significantly concerned about the pandemic affecting their education (85.4%) and career choices (70.7%).When asked about home life, 47.5% have trouble studying, 31.7% have trouble concentrating, 24.4% have trouble sleeping and 12.2% have trouble eating. 14/41 (34.1%) respondents express negative behaviour toward their families, 30.8% felt more isolated from their family and 28.2% argue more with their family. Contrastingly, 23.1% were talking more and 28.2% felt closer to their family. The thought of transmitting coronavirus to a vulnerable person (90.0%) or transmitting coronavirus to a family member or friend (75.5%) majorly worried the majority of respondents.When asked about the newly developed vaccine, 70.0% expressed confidence in its safety while 53.6% felt following the vaccination their mental health could improve. 25.0% stated they would not take the vaccine if given a chance.Respondents reckon less pressure at school (48.8%), additional mental health support (46.3%), having someone to talk to (46.3%), information on where to receive support (43.9%) and after school clubs (43.9%) would improve their mental health.ConclusionsOver the pandemic, the mental health of people aged 16â€“19 has worsened - they are experiencing a range of negative emotions and insomnia. Respondents perceive a more dysfunctional relationship with their family. Many believe the pandemic has affected their education and will affect their future career. To combat this decline, they might need more mental health support and less pressure. A large percentage of them may not voluntarily take the coronavirus vaccine;this highlights the need for education about the origin and production of the vaccine to gain confidence in its safety.","Balamurugan, Sahana, Thyagarajan, Balamurugan","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjpo-2021-RCPCH.143","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BMJ Paediatrics Open; 5(Suppl 1):A75, 2021.; Publication details: BMJ Paediatrics Open; 5(Suppl 1):A75, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19429,""

"Taking thinking together forward: a scheme linking paediatric and CAMHS trainees","BackgroundThe concept of joining up services and managing young peopleâ€™s mental health difficulties has never been more paramount. Covid has thrown us all into a world of uncertainty and this is exacerbated for young people with anxiety, underlying medical or psychiatric needs. At a time when linking people up to work and think together is the most needed, of course it is also the most challenging. Mental health presentations are an increasing part of the paediatric caseload and there is growing evidence that paediatric trainees feel ill-equipped to manage these patients. Equally CAMHS trainees reported they required greater access to seeing children under 5, assessing development and physical health. Only 33% of trainees we surveyed felt that their current training programme enabled them to achieve their curriculum requirements in paediatrics or mental health respectively.ObjectivesWe developed the concept of Thinking Together, to tackle this training gap. The scheme involves pairing paediatric and CAMHS trainees to share clinical encounters to foster a joint way of learning and working together, coming together to look at how we can link training to optimise patient care. CAMHS services are increasingly stretched, raising referral thresholds and making the need for closer working together across disciplines paramount.MethodsA pilot was launched in March 2016 where 30 trainees from CAMHS and Paediatrics were paired for a period of 6 months, attending at least two clinical encounters in each setting. Trainees were encouraged to explore a variety of learning possibilities, including clinics, referral meetings and signposting their partner to other relevant clinical opportunities.In 2018 we extended the scheme in a second phase pilot to four centres across the UK. Feedback from participants involved was equally positive but there were logistical challenges. We reflected on feedback from the initial and second phase pilot and adapted the programme in 2019/2020. We aimed to consolidate the scheme in one centre and include workshops, which allowed focus on a topic relevant to both specialties, in addition to a forum for debrief discussions on challenging cases.ResultsPrior to participating in Thinking Together, 70% stated they had no experience of working in a jointly delivered paediatric/mental health clinic. 93% of participants felt that their patients benefitted from access to jointly delivered clinics. Feedback was very positive and identified that the scheme met training gaps for both specialties. Th adapted version of Thinking Together that we rolled out in 2019â€“2020 was also met with positive feedback and proved to be particularly beneficial during the pandemic, when trainee pairs could still participate in Thinking Together via virtual workshops.ConclusionsCovid has clearly brought challenges to every aspect of our lives but this is a training model that has been able to adapt in this unprecedented time, by means of virtual workshops and the enthusiasm of the participants to continue to pursue learning opportunities, including joining referral meetings remotely. Thinking Together has evolved into a successful model that we would like to embed in everyday practice.","Cryer, Jo, Fisher, Megan","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjpo-2021-RCPCH.81","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BMJ Paediatrics Open; 5(Suppl 1):A42, 2021.; Publication details: BMJ Paediatrics Open; 5(Suppl 1):A42, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19431,""
"The impact of 100 days of covid-19 lock-down on the emotional health of school children in an urban indian setting","BackgroundIn response to the WHO recommended measures of physical and social distancing to mitigate person-to-person transmission, most countries decided to close schools as part of a physical distancing policy to slow transmission of COVID-19 and to ease the burden on health systems. Schools were closed in more than 160 countries by mid-July 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health measures taken to prevent the spread of the pandemic can potentially impact the mental health of children. Not much is known about the long-term impact of large-scale disease outbreaks on the mental health of children and adolescents.ObjectivesTo assess the prevalence and risk factors of childhood depression during the Covid-19 lock-down among school children.MethodsAfter 100 days of lock-down, a voluntary, anonymous survey questionnaire was sent by WhatsApp to parents of school-aged children (5â€“16 years) in Chennai. The Short Mood and Feelings questionnaire was employed as an objective screening tool to assess depression, with a score of 12 used as the cut-off which is recommended by the Child Outcomes Research Consortium, United Kingdom. All data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS, version 17) for Microsoft Windows. A chi-squared test was used for comparison between two attributes with OR 95% CI. Multiple logistic regression was used. A two-sided p value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Ethics approval was obtained for this research study.ResultsThere were 874 responses. Our survey revealed the incidence of childhood depression to be 13.7%, indicating that children are likely to be experiencing increasing depression exacerbated by the pandemic and the lock-down. Boys were less likely to be depressed than girls (OR 0.495, P value 0.000). Eleven- to 16-year-olds were more likely to be depressed than 5- to 10-year-old children (OR 1.519, P 0.035). Children who had more than 4 hours online education were more likely to have depression (OR 1.757, P= 0.037). Children who used a cell phone for online classes were more likely to have depression compared to other devices, such as tabs or laptops (OR 2.142, P 0.000). Children who slept less than 8 hours a day were more likely to have depression (OR 2.441, P 0.000). Children who either did not sleep in the afternoon or slept less than 1 hour were less likely to have depression (OR 0.522, P 0.010). Children who were interacting with family over 1 hour per day were less likely to have depression (OR 2.985, P 0.000).ConclusionsOverzealous online education, lack of adequate sleep and failure to spend quality time with family and can negatively impact the mental health of school children. Public health policy makers and health care professionals need to acknowledge that pandemics (especially when associated with lock-down) can potentially negatively impact the psychological well-being of school-age children. In the event of similar future pandemics, strategies need to be in place to safeguard the psychological well-being of individuals by offering them timely and appropriate psychological support, as well as taking the appropriate steps in the effective management of those already affected psychologically.","Mathews, John Cheri, Mathew, Deepa Elizabeth, Natasha Susan, John, Johnson, Joe, George, Sanju","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjpo-2021-RCPCH.2","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BMJ Paediatrics Open; 5(Suppl 1):A1-A2, 2021.; Publication details: BMJ Paediatrics Open; 5(Suppl 1):A1-A2, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19432,""
"Cognitive deficits are associated with anosmia but not anxio-depressive symptoms in COVID-19","ObjectivesTo characterise cognitive performance and olfaction in recovered COVID-19 patients.MethodsPatients underwent cognitive, olfaction and mental health assessments 2 months after initial SARS-CoV-2 infection as part of the Sydney St. Vincentâ€™s Hospital ADAPT study, a prospective cohort study. Cognition was assessed with the Cogstate computerised battery and expressed as a demographically-corrected composite z-score and clinically classified as impaired/borderline/unimpaired. Anxio-depressive symptoms were assessed with the Depression in the Medical ill scale-10 (DMI-10), the Somatic and Psychological HEalth Report-34 (SPHERE) Psych sub-scale, and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IESR) and reduced into single Principal Component explaining 80% of the variance. Olfaction was assessed with the NIH Toolbox Odor Identification test and expressed as demographically-corrected T-scores, and impaired/unimpaired. Disease severity was classified as mild (40%), moderate (50%) or hospitalised (10%).Results132 patients (mean age=46Â±15;40% women, median education=16 years, 10% Non-English-Speaking Background-NESB) were included. 17% had impaired cognition, 10% had borderline deficits, 25% has impaired olfaction. 25% had clinically elevated symptoms on the DMI-10, 13% on the IESR, and 35% on the SPHERE. Regression analyses showed that anxio-depression was not associated with cognitive performance (unadjusted p=.43;adjusted for sex & NESB p=.98) nor impaired/unimpaired status (unadjusted p=.50;adjusted for sex & NESB p=.78). Cognitively impaired patients were more likely to have impaired olfaction (p&lt;.009). Results were independent of disease severity.ConclusionsCognitive impairment is common and not related to psychological factors, may occur independent of disease severity and is associated with anosmia. These point to direct brain effects of COVID-19.","Cysique, Lucette A.; Allen-Davidian, Yasmin, Darley, David R.; Byrne, Anthony, Wilhelm, Kay, Dore, Greg, Matthews, Gail, Brew, Bruce J.","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjno-2021-ANZAN.32","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BMJ Neurology Open; 3(Suppl 1):A12, 2021.; Publication details: BMJ Neurology Open; 3(Suppl 1):A12, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19433,""
"â€˜The Pandemic Affected My Life in a Negative Wayâ€™: The Experiences of Estonian Children in Child Protective Services During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic","This study investigates children's experiences concerning the effect of the containment measures associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on their daily lives. A small-scale study using in-depth, semi-structured interviews was conducted in Estonia with 10 children registered with Child Protective Services (CPS) as in need of assistance. The COVID-19 pandemic generally negatively affected the children, who struggled with e-schooling, social relationships and emotional well-being. Most of the children reported struggling with their emotional well-being, using words such as anxiety, tension, fear, sadness, and depressing. Not all of the children received the necessary support or assistance from the CPS. The children reported a few positive experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as attaining a more personalised method and schedule for studying and receiving parental support during e-schooling.

"Tweet Sentiment Analysis for Predicting the Symptoms Effect Level Regarding COVID-19","From the end of 2019, numerous comments and opinions relating to the COVID-19 pandemic have been posted on Twitter. The number of opinions rapidly increased since the countries began implementing social isolation and reduction. In these comments, users often express different emotions regarding COVID-19 signs and symptoms, the majority of which are sadness and fear sentiments. It is important to determine the symptom effect level for the emotions of symptomatic persons based on their opinions. However, no study analyzes the tweets' sentiment related to the COVID-19 topic to predict the symptoms effect level. Therefore, in this study, we present a method to predict the symptoms effect level based on the sentiment analysis of symptomatic persons according to the following steps. First, the sentiments in tweets are analyzed by using a combination of the text representation model and convolutional neural network. Second, a topic modeling model is built based on the latent Dirichlet allocation algorithm to group symptoms into small clusters that conform to sadness and fear sentiments. Finally, the symptom effect level is predicted based on the probability distribution of the symptoms in each sentiment cluster. Experiments using tweets promise that the proposed method achieves significant results toward the accuracy and obtained information.","Phan, H. T.; Bui, V. H.; Nguyen, N.

"Leisure travel intention following a period of COVID-19 crisis: a case study of the Dutch market","PurposeThis study aims to analyse what drives and limits the Dutch population during COVID-19 in their intention to travel for leisure once travel restrictions have been lifted, to gain an insight in the psychological travel barriers following a period of crisis.Design/methodology/approachThe research process involved an online self-administrated method created with one of the leading research and web-based survey tools called Qualtrics. The questionnaire was filled by 402 respondents.FindingsThe findings indicate that the impact of COVID-19 on cutting down travel plans, certain personal values and structural constraints have a positive relationship with the leisure travel intention to various destinations. Moreover, risk perceptions and intrapersonal constraints have a positive relationship with domestic leisure travel intentions. However, these factors have a negative connection with the leisure travel intention to some international destinations. Further, decreased perceptions of risks have a negative relationship with the domestic leisure travel intentions.Research limitations/implicationsUsing questionnaires in the form of online, self-administrated surveys made it impossible to get an insight in and have control over who responded to the questionnaire. Gaining an insight into the factors impacting the leisure travel intentions following a period of crisis will make it possible for the tourism industry to respond adequately to future crises and will make it easier for destination marketers and managers to attract new tourists during the recovery process.Originality/valueTo the best of the authorâ€™s knowledge, no analysis has been so far published with a focus on the impact of COVID-19 on the Dutch population and their intention to travel. It is crucial for gaining an insight into leisure travel intention and the factors impacting this intention following a period of crisis since travel intention is an under-researched topic of academic tourism literature. This study closes the existing gap in literature.","Isaac, Rami K.; Keijzer, Jessica","https://doi.org/10.1108/IJTC-08-2020-0158","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: International Journal of Tourism Cities; 7(3):583-601, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Tourism Cities; 7(3):583-601, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19436,""

"Home gardens moderate the relationship between Covid-19-induced stay-at-home orders and mental distress: a case study with urban residents of India","With the increasing spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, restrictions on public life were strengthened across the world. Non-pharmaceutical interventions like stay-at-home orders, cancellations of events, work from home, etc. are the first line of defence to combat the spread of highly transmittable infections like Covid-19. But these interventions create whole new situations that urban residents need to cope with, which often creates mental distress. Home gardens, due to their therapeutic benefits, can help individuals to relax and unwind, thus reduce mental distress. Hence, the present study attempts to investigate whether home gardens moderate the effects on mental distress from confinement at homes due to the enforcement of stay-at-home orders. Samples (N = 408) were collected through an online question survey with urban residents across different parts of India. Moderation analysis reported the significant effect of home gardens in lowering mental distress. Further analysis with time spent in home gardens revealed that with increasing time spent from less than 10 min to more than 2 h, an individual score of stress and anxiety, and overall Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS)-21 scores had significantly decreased. These findings illustrate the beneficial properties of nature-based solutions, home gardens in this case, in improving mental health, even during the difficult times of the Covid-19 pandemic. Our results suggest the necessity of scaling up these nature-based solutions in urban planning processes to make the residents healthy and resilient.","Basu, M.; DasGupta, R.; Kumar, P.; Dhyani, S.","https://doi.org/10.1088/2515-7620/ac2ab2","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Environ.

"The evolution of mental health in schools: where from, where next?","The current agenda for mental health in schools is considered in relation to the concept of mental health and how it has been iterated in schools in the UK. Key contributions from education pioneers are outlined, providing a time line for the first half of the twentieth century particularly informed by psychoanalysis. Mid twentieth century the term mental health begins to be used explicitly and we see the emergence of mental health counselling in schools.Â  Developments culminate in Wallâ€™s (1955) landmark book Education and Mental Health, which set out a whole school approach. In the latter part of the twentieth century we see a move towards a targeted approach, and the curriculum development for Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning (SEAL) and the consolidation of current policy drivers for mental health are set out. It is argued that in the future, in light of COVID-19, we will see new bridges between home and school, with schools acting more as community hubs supporting the mental health of children and their families.","Winship, Gary","https://doi.org/10.1080/0305764X.2021.1891204","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Cambridge Journal of Education; 51(5):589-606, 2021.; Publication details: Cambridge Journal of Education; 51(5):589-606, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19439,""
"Mild cognitive impairment in COVID-19 survivors: Measuring the brain fog","Background Objective Methods Results/Conclusions The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been impacting individuals throughout the world. Millions have been affected, and while many have recovered, a growing number of recovered COVID-19 patients are reportedly facing neurological symptoms, described as â€œslow thinking,â€ â€œdifficulty in focusing,â€ â€œconfusion,â€ â€œlack of concentration,â€ â€œforgetfulness,â€ or â€œhaziness in thought process.â€ These experiences of mental fatigue, associated with and related to mild cognitive impairments, may be conceptually defined as â€œbrain fog.â€To study the prevalence and severity of these brain fog symptoms in COVID-19 recovered patients, and examining their association with age, gender, and COVID-19 symptom severity.A total of 300 patients who tested positive for Real-Time Reverse Transcriptaseâ€“Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) for SARSCoV-2 during Aprilâ€“August 2020 were included in our study after complete recovery from their acute illness. They were assessed for brain fog symptoms using the 9-item validated Woodâ€™s mental fatigue inventory.The overall cumulative prevalence of any components of brain fog was 34%, with a mean score of 6.11 Â± 1.7 in those who experienced it. Males were more affected than females (42.3% vs. 29.1%) with males scoring higher than females. The mean score was higher in severe ill and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients and those who required oxygen or were on a ventilator.

"Entertainment and social media use during social distancing: Examining trait differences in transportability and need for social assurance","This study (N = 348 students and 468 adults) examines whether the associations between increased media use during social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic and negative emotional states (negative affect, boredom, and depression) depend on individual differences. Transportability is the trait likelihood of becoming mentally and emotionally immersed in story worlds, and need for social assurance is the tendency to rely on others for affiliation and companionship. Theoretically, higher transportability may lead to greater benefits from using entertainment media, whereas need for social assurance has previously been linked with negative outcomes of social media use. In addition, we explored whether media use and its associations differ between college students and older adults. Results suggest that social media use and entertainment media use increased during social distancing, particularly for students. Moreover, increased use of both types of media was associated with more negative emotional states. In particular, those high in need for social assurance used social media more often and reported more negative feelings. In addition, contrary to expectations, the association between entertainment media and depression appeared to be increased by transportability, particularly in older adults. These findings highlight the need for greater understanding of how effects of media use might change during social isolation as well as the need for additional social and mental health support for young adults/students during social distancing. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement College students and older adults increased their entertainment and social media use during social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but that media use did not relieve negative feelings, boredom, or depression. This was especially true for those more likely to be transported (immersed) into stories, those high in need for social assurance, and young adult/students, in whom these characteristics appeared to facilitate the effects of media use on negative mood state. These results suggest that the effects of individual differences on media use may change during times of social stress.

"Nightmares and COVID-19: A possible increase in suicide attempts","COVID-19, an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, has negatively affected almost every country in the world, with consequences going far beyond those of the disease itself. Some pandemic-related symptoms, such as anxiety, fear, worry, and traumatic stress, have had an impact on mental health and are known to be significant causes of nightmares. It has been demonstrated that people with frequent nightmares have a higher risk of suicide, especially when the nightmares are combined with depression. Many countries have reported COVID-19-related suicides. In particular, patients with previous psychiatric disorders may present a worsening of symptoms, becoming more vulnerable to suicide attempts during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our aim is to call attention to the possible impact that an increase in nightmares during the pandemic may have in respect of suicide and the need to give more focus on the triad of sleep, mental health, and suicide, factors that might be more related than we thought prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Asian Americans' racial discrimination experiences during COVID-19: Social support and locus of control as moderators","Using a cross-sectional survey design, we examined whether social support was a stress buffer against direct online and vicarious general racial discrimination for 218 Asian/Asian American college students in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, and whether the buffering effect depended on external locus of control (external LOC). An alarming percentage of Asian/Asian American students reported direct online (58.7%) and vicarious racial discrimination (88.1%). Moderated moderation with bootstrap analysis revealed detrimental effects of direct online and vicarious racial discrimination on mental health, and protective effects of social support and low external LOC. Importantly, we found several significant Racial discrimination x Social support x External LOC interaction effects. High levels of social support were only consistently found to be a significant buffer against direct online racial discrimination for those with moderate-to-high external LOC. Results indicated that the buffering effect of social support depended on external LOC and the type of racial discrimination during the current pandemic. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement Asian/Asian American college students with limited social support and high external LOC were especially vulnerable to racism-related psychological symptoms during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. High levels of social support were a buffer against direct online racial discrimination for those with high external LOC. Social support may be less effective as a stress buffer for vicarious racial discrimination. It is important to promote coping strategies that are consistent with one's values and beliefs and responsive to the nature of the racial stressors.

Methods 2117 participants, selected to represent the age, gender, and race/ethnic distributions of the US population, completed an online survey. Analysis of variance and correlation analyses were used to assess relationships between the COVID-19 related worry score and demographic characteristics, past psychiatric diagnoses, personality dimensions, and current psychological symptoms. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between the COVID-19 worry score and depression symptoms. Results The COVID-19 worry score was markedly higher in younger (18-49 year-olds) than older participants, and moderately higher in men, those who were married or cohabiting, with post-college education, and/or living in large urban areas. The COVID-19 worry score also was markedly higher in those who reported having been diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder. The COVID-19 worry score correlated with neuroticism, current psychological symptoms, and COVID-19 risk and COVID-19 behavior scores. The COVID-19 worry score was associated with current depression symptoms (ORÂ =Â 1.10, 95% CIÂ =Â 1.09â€“1.11;pÂ &lt;Â 0.001) in univariable models and remained significant after adjustment for other correlates of depression, including COVID-19 risk. Conclusions In this US sample, the COVID-19 worry score was inversely related to age, strongly related to psychological symptoms, and independently associated with depression symptoms. These findings have implications for the community mental health response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the US.","Samuels, Jack, Holingue, Calliope, Nestadt, Paul S.; Bienvenu, O.

"Adolescent Mental Health, Connectedness, and Mode of School Instruction During COVID-19","Background Since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March 2020, nearly 93% of US students engaged in some distance learning. These school disruptions may negatively influence adolescent mental health. Protective factors, like feeling connected to family or school may demonstrate a buffering effect, potentially moderating negative mental health outcomes. The purpose of the study was to test our hypothesis that mode of school instruction influences mental health and determine if school and family connectedness attenuates these relationships. Methods The COVID Experiences Survey was administered online or via telephone October â€“November 2020 to adolescents ages 13-19 using NORCâ€™s AmeriSpeak Panel, a probability-based panel recruited using random address-based sampling with mail and telephone non-response follow-up. The final sample included 567 adolescents in grades 7-12 who received virtual, in person, or combined instruction. Unadjusted and adjusted associations among four mental health outcomes and instruction mode were measured, and associations with school and family connectedness were explored for protective effects. Results Students attending school virtually reported poorer mental health than students attending in-person. Adolescents receiving virtual instruction reported more mentally unhealthy days, more persistent symptoms of depression, and a greater likelihood of seriously considering attempting suicide than students in other modes of instruction. After demographic adjustments school and family connectedness each mitigated the association between virtual vs. in-person instruction for all four mental health indicators. Conclusion As hypothesized, mode of school instruction was associated with mental health outcomes, with adolescents receiving in-person instruction reporting the lowest prevalence of negative mental health indicators. School and family connectedness may play a critical role in buffering negative mental health outcomes.","Hertz, Marci F.; Kilmer, Greta, Verlenden, Jorge, Liddon, Nicole, Rasberry, Catherine N.; Barrios, Lisa C.; Ethier, Kathleen A.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.10.021","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Adolescent Health;2021.; Publication details: Journal of Adolescent Health;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19448,""
"Secondary school teachers psychological status and competencies in e-teaching during Covid-19","Presents problem/focus of study The Covid-19 outbreak has had a staggering impact on the global economy, public health and safety, trade and education. In Malaysia, the government implemented the Movement Control Order (MCO) as a preventive measure against Covid-19. In education, the learning process has been transferred to online teaching. However, pandemic pedagogy is making learning into completely online either synchronous or asynchronous. Therefore, the current research aims to determine the secondary school teachersâ€™ psychological status, competencies in e-teaching and teachers work motivation as well as determine the relationship between secondary school teachersâ€™ psychological status and competencies in e-teaching during the Covid-19 outbreak. Design/methodology/approach Current research is a descriptive-correlational quantitative survey to determine teachersâ€™ psychological status, e-teaching competencies and working motivation during Movement Control Order (MCO) to contain the Covid-19 pandemic. The study sample consists of 595 secondary school teachers selected via convenient sampling. Quantitative data are collected from an online survey through the questionnaires with demographic, psychological status (stress, anxiety and depression), e-teaching competencies (teaching, monitoring and evaluation) and teaching motivation developed by the researchers were distributed during the MCO period. SPSS 25 is applied, Statistical measures such as Cronbach's alpha, means, percentage and standard deviation were employed to analyze the data to obtain the value of the school teachersâ€™ psychological status, e-teaching competencies and teaching motivation. Consequently, a Pearson correlation table was created to show the analysis of the school teachersâ€™ psychological status and competencies in e-teaching. Findings This finding indicated that the teachersâ€™ psychological factors in stress, anxiety and depressed are moderate, the teachersâ€™ competencies in e-teaching is moderate as well as teachersâ€™ working motivations is also the moderate level. However, the highest mean value was found among the variables, this is revealed that despite the challenges during the Covid-19 outbreak, teachers showed positive and strong motivation in conducting e-teaching. Additionally, the result showed a negative relationship between psychological status and e-teaching competencies (-0.286, p&lt;0.01), as well as reported a negative relationship between dimension of psychological status and competencies in e-teaching. Limitation & recommendations This study has its limitations. This study is included only Selangor teachers and given that the information obtained from the study was gather from secondary schools, the generalizability might be limited. future research may consider expanding the scope from secondary schools to primary schoolsâ€™ teachers and then to university lecturers. Perhaps the scope is expanding, so more information could be obtaining and help researchers understand the teachersâ€™ competencies in e-teaching, psychological status and work motivation.","Wong, Kai Yan, Sulaiman, Tajularipin, Ibrahim, Amalina, Kunchi Mohd, Abdul Gaffar, Hassan @ Hussin, Omrah, Wan Jaafar, Wan Marzuki","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e08238","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Heliyon;: e08238, 2021.; Publication details: Heliyon;: e08238, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19449,""
"Dataset concerning the mental health of healthcare professionals during covid-19 pandemic in Bangladesh","The present dataset is concerned with an article entitled â€œEffect of covid-19 pandemic on mental health among Bangladeshi healthcare professionals: A cross-sectional studyâ€ [1]. This data article consists of a dataset regarding the mental health of Bangladeshi healthcare professionals (HCPs) during the ongoing covid-19 pandemic. We collected the data from July 15, 2020, to September 20, 2020, using Google survey tools (Google Forms). A total of 355 complete responses have been obtained from the Bangladeshi HCPs aged between 20-60 years (male: 204, female: 151). We obtained informed consent from all participants for this study. We assessed the sociodemographic profile and four psychometric measures of HCPs working in Bangladesh during the covid-19 pandemic. A structured questionnaire was used to collect the demographic information. We used the UCLA loneliness scale (UCLA-8), the patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the 7-item generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7), and the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) were applied to measure loneliness, depression, generalized anxiety, and sleep disturbance, respectively. This dataset presents the descriptive analysis of psychometric variables of participants. Also, the dataset might be used as a platform for future research on psychometric evaluation using the above scales. We included participants regardless of the sociodemographic backgrounds of HCPs. Therefore, the policymakers, government, and non-government organizations can use this data to develop different programs for promoting the mental health of HCPs and the general population in Bangladesh.","Islam, Md Rabiul, Quaiyum, Sumaiya, Pakhe, Sajuti Akter, Repon, Md Azim Uddin, Bhuiyan, Mohiuddin Ahmed","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2021.107506","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Data in Brief;: 107506, 2021.; Publication details: Data in Brief;: 107506, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19450,""
"Parental mediation in pandemic: Predictors and relationship with children's digital skills and time spent online in Ireland","During the COVID-19 pandemic, an increasing reliance on digital technology to carry out social, entertainment, work and school activities increased, which may have affected the ways in which parents mediated their children's digital technology use. Given the prominent role that digital technology will have in the future, it is important to investigate parent and child characteristics which impacted parental mediation of children's digital technology use. Therefore, the present study aimed at analysing the frequency of parental mediation strategies (i.e. active and restrictive) during lockdown, their determinants, and how the two strategies affected children's digital skills and time spent online. Data were collected from 461 parent and 461 child participants. Results showed that almost half of parents (46%) practiced parental mediation with the same frequency, while the 42.6% applied it more often. Active mediation was predicted by parental worries about online risks, while restrictive mediation was predicted by time spent online by children, parental worries about online risks, parental negative attitudes towards digital technology and parents' digital skills. Children developed more digital skills when their parents applied higher levels of both active and restrictive mediation, and they spent the lowest amount of time online when their parents employed higher levels of restrictive and lower levels of active mediation. Practical implications for families and children's wellbeing are discussed.","Sciacca, Beatrice, Laffan, Derek A.; O'Higgins Norman, James, Milosevic, Tijana","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2021.107081","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Computers in Human Behavior;: 107081, 2021.; Publication details: Computers in Human Behavior;: 107081, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19451,""
"Analysis of the status of treatment of benign thyroid diseases â€“ a public health problem aggravated in the COVID-19 pandemic era","Objective Goiters and benign nodules detected in the thyroid are growing lesions and the COVID-19 pandemic have negatively impacted on their surgical treatment. The appropriate selection of patients to treatment will improve the overall health status. This article review will focus on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on treatment of benign conditions of the thyroid gland and their implications. Methods This review pointed out the status of the health system in developing country and the problems to treat benign surgical diseases of thyroid. Aspects of epidemiology, incidence, clinical presentation and surgical treatment of goiters, economic and health status impact were cited. Results All surgical treatment of goiter and other benign conditions were postponed, forced to redirect, and reschedule all benign surgeries, situation aggravated by poor public management and closure of hospital beds. These conditions have caused deterioration in patientsâ€™ physical (decompensated thyroid disease) and mental health status, increasing work disabilities and burdening society by increasing the social and health cost. The overall situation could be catastrophic in emergent countries where this increased disease-related social expenditure on surgical treatment may increase the risk of national impoverishment as increase the treatment cost. Brazilian Society Head and Neck Surgery related some recommendations and new suggestions were made to safely treat these high potential hazard surgical conditions. Conclusions Surgeries for goiter and benign thyroid conditions can be performed during the COVID-19 pandemic, following strict safety protocols for the patient and the medical team, reducing the negative economic and on patient health impact.","de Melo, Giulianno Molina, GonÃ§alves, Antonio JosÃ©, Walder, Fernando, Ferraz, Carolina, Neves, Murilo Catafesta, AbrahÃ£o, Marcio, Cervantes, Onivaldo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjorl.2021.08.008","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Brazilian Journal of Otorhinolaryngology;2021.; Publication details: Brazilian Journal of Otorhinolaryngology;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19452,""
"The Role of Spiritual Intelligence in Predicting the Empathy Levels of Nurses with COVID-19 Patients","Aim Given the prolongation of the newly emerging COVID-19 pandemic and the significance of caring for the patients by nursing staff, investigating and planning for the different psychological dimensions of this group is of paramount importance. Hence, this study investigated the role of spiritual intelligence in predicting nurses' empathizing with COVID-19 patients. Methods This descriptive-correlation study was conducted in 2021 on nurses caring for COVID-19 patients in three public hospitals. The researchers used two standard questionnaires, including the Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSE) and Spiritual Intelligence (SI), for data collection. The collected data were analyzed in SPSS16 using descriptive statistics and the following: The Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskalâ€“Wallis test, Regression, chi-square test, and Pearson and Spearman correlations. Results The statistical population consisted of 338 nurses with an average age of 34 and ten years of work experience. There was a significant positive relationship between the empathy scores and spiritual intelligence scores of the nurses caring for COVID-19 patients (P&lt;0.05). It was also concluded from the regression analysis that, spiritual intelligence affect empathy. Mean score of empathy was higher in hospitals where more nursing staff had MSc degrees. There was a significant difference between the empathy scores of the three hospitals (P&lt;0.05). Conclusion The results indicated that there is a positive relationship between empathy and spiritual intelligence. Therefor improving spiritual intelligence is the appropriate strategy to ameliorate empathy during the COVID19 pandemic. At the same time, study indicated attention to the issue of nurses' mental health. Hence, it was suggested to incorporate these issues in the training programs and national/international decisions.","Aliabadi, Parastoo Karimi, Zazoly, Atefeh Zabihi, Sohrab, Mehrnoush, Neyestani, Farkhondeh, Nazari, Nahid, Mousavi, Seyed Hassan, Fallah, Abolghasem, Youneszadeh, Majid, Ghasemiyan, Masoumeh, Ferdowsi, Mohammad","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnu.2021.10.007","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Archives of Psychiatric Nursing;2021.; Publication details: Archives of Psychiatric Nursing;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19453,""
"Prospective survey of psychiatric patients during the first confinement of COVID 2020","In the early steps of an emerging infectious disease epidemic such as Covid-19, uncertainties about the nature of the disease, its spread and impact can lead to emotional distress. In addition, the studies on confinement during an epidemic have shown a psychological impact of this measure on the feelings of anxiety and depression in the general population. Method We assessed the psychological health of 550 patients followed up in outpatient psychiatry, via a pandemic-related teleconsultation during the first confinement period between March and June 2020. Patients were assessed at the beginning and at the end of the confinement on their personal situation, social relationships, professional activity, anxiety and mood. We also evaluated patients' symptomatology and their quality of life. Results Patients were well informed about Covid-19 via the media and complied with the confinement and barrier procedures. They appreciated the phone-calls and the teleconsultation follow-up. A small proportion of patients were completely socially isolated mainly at the beginning of the confinement (10%). There was no difference between the beginning and the end of the confinement in terms of depressive and anxiety symptoms or quality of life. The women were more anxious and depressed than men. Only smoking was significantly increased during this period. Conclusion The expected and feared health catastrophe in psychiatry during this first phase of the pandemic in 2020 did not occur.

"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Substance Use among Adults without Children, Parents, and Adolescents","Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on alcohol and illicit substance use among adults without children, parents, and adolescents was investigated through two studies with five samples from independent ongoing U.S. longitudinal studies. In Study 1, 931 adults without children, parents, and adolescents were surveyed about the pandemicâ€™s impact on personal behavior. 19% to 25% of adults without children, parents, and adolescents reported an increase in alcohol or illicit substance use. In Study 2, 274 adults without children, parents, and adolescents who had been interviewed prior to the pandemic onset about alcohol and illicit substance use problems were re-interviewed after the pandemicâ€™s onset to test within-person change. The rate of alcohol or illicit substance use problems increased from pre-pandemic to post-pandemic onset from 13% to 36% among the three groups. Increase in alcohol and illicit substance use problems was positively correlated with increased depression/anxiety and household disruption, suggesting possible mechanisms for increases in substance problems. Findings in both studies held across low- and middle-income families. Findings suggest the need for communitywide policies to increase resources for alcohol and illicit substance use screening and intervention, especially for adolescents.","Dodge, Kenneth A.; Skinner, Ann T.; Godwin, Jennifer, Bai, Yu, Lansford, Jennifer E.; Copeland, William E.; Benjamin Goodman, W.; McMahon, Robert J.; Goulter, Natalie, Bornstein, Marc H.; Pettit, Gregory S.; Bates, John E.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.abrep.2021.100388","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Addictive Behaviors Reports;: 100388, 2021.; Publication details: Addictive Behaviors Reports;: 100388, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19455,""
"Health and pathology: a brief history of the biopolitics of US mathematics education","Abstract: Concerns about health and disease have long pervaded mathematics education research, yet their implications have been underappreciated. This article focuses on three contemporary relationships amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic: (1) school mathematics and national health, (2) mathematics educatorsâ€™ roles in distinguishing the health needs of students, and (3) mathematics instruction as either enhancing or threatening studentsâ€™ mental health and social adjustment. We argue that these concerns are foundational preoccupations of mathematics education research that have persistently shaped debates over who should learn mathematics, how, and to what ends. Our study examines histories of school mathematics and health discourses to explore how particular notions of health entered US mathematics education during the 19th and early twentieth centuries in ways that resonate with recent research trends and responses to COVID-19. We especially attend to how health/pathology distinctions reconfigured hierarchies of nationality, sex, race, and dis/ability within exclusionary, segregated, colonial, and tracked mathematics instruction. By mapping some of the shifting contours of health and pathology over time, we emphasize the potential dangers of the pandemic reanimating long-circulating dividing practices, such as in emerging trends comparing national metrics of well-being, responding to perceived trauma with differentiated instruction, and seeking to calibrate healthy mathematics identities in marginalized groups.

"Bidirectional GRU networks-based next POI category prediction for healthcare","The Corona Virus Disease 2019 has a great impact on public health and public psychology. People stay at home for a long time and rarely go out. With the improvement of the epidemic situation, people began to go to different places to check in. To maintain public mental health, it is necessary to propose a point-of-interest (POI) prediction model which can mine users' interests. However, the current techniques suffer from lower precision during prediction and the practical value is poor, which is due to the sparse data of users' check-in. Faced with this challenge, we propose an attention-based bidirectional gated recurrent unit (GRU) model for POI category prediction (ABG_poic). We regard the user's POI category as the user's interest preference because the fuzzy POI category is easier to reflect the user's interest than the POI. This method can alleviate the data sparsity, and protect users' location privacy. Since users' preferences are variable, we utilize a bidirectional GRUÂ to capture the dynamic dependence of users' check-ins. Furthermore, since the neural network is similar to a â€œblack boxâ€Â in feature learning, the decision-making stage is opaque. Thus, we combine the attention mechanism with bidirectional GRU to selectively focus on historical check-in records, which can improve the interpretability of the model. Considering the time impact on users' check-in, we utilize the time sliding window in the ABG_poic model. Experiments on two data sets demonstrate that our ABG_poic outperforms the comparison models for POI category prediction on sparse check-in data.

"Emotion Regulation Strategies, COVID-19 Induced Psychological Distress, and Psychological Well-being in Pakistan","The world is not the same after the COVID-19 pandemic hit in December 2019. The present study investigated the role of emotion regulation (ER) strategies (expressive suppression and cognitive reappraisal) between COVID-19-induced psychological distress and psychological well-being among students during the lockdown. This study hypothesized that COVID-19-induced psychological distress reduces the student's psychological well-being, and ER strategies mediate this association. A quantitative survey research design was used for collecting data from 300 students in different departments of a public university in Pakistan. The results indicated that COVID-19-induced psychological distress significantly decrease students' psychological well-being (b=-.38, t = -15.02, p &lt; .001) during the lockdown period in Pakistan. Both ER strategies found a complete statistically significant mediation between this distress and students' psychological well-being. Cognitive reappraisal had a slightly more positive indirect effect (a*b = .08, Bootstrap CI95 = .03 and .12) on COVID-19 induced psychological distress and psychological well-being than expressive suppression (a*b = .07, Bootstrap CI95 = .01 and .04). It is concluded that mental health can be better looked after by using better emotion regulation strategies. Thus, this study contributes to the behavioral sciences knowledge by iterating that emotional regulation improves the mental health of individuals in these difficult circumstances. The strength of using thought restructuring through cognitive reappraisal is a better strategy for dealing with distress in the pandemic. These findings contribute to behavioral science knowledge and understanding of emotion regulation in mitigating psychological distress and enhancing well-being during this pandemic and beyond.","Zaman, S.; Abid, F.; Bilal, Y.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Emotion+Regulation+Strategies,+COVID-19+Induced+Psychological+Distress,+and+Psychological+Well-being+in+Pakistan","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: J.

"Vitamin D Level in Patients with COVID-19 and Its Relationship with Severity of The Clinical Course","Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has killed millions of individuals and has led to the largest economic contraction since the Great Depression. The antiviral effects of vitamin D can hinder viral replication directly, and also be effective in an anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory way. Objective: This study aimed to estimate the serum levels of free 25 hydroxycholecalciferol (25(OH)-D) in patients with COVID-19 infection in correlation to clinical manifestations and severity in multicenter tertiary-care hospitals, Egypt. Subject and Methods: This cross-sectional study included 150 confirmed patients with COVID-19 by using RT-PCR for detection of the viral RNA. The COVID-19 patients were classified into four groups of mild (n=40) moderate (n=40), severe (n=40), and critical (n=30) based on disease severity. Serum concentrations of 25(OH)-D were tested using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results According to the current study results, all included patients (n=150) had a low level of serum levels of 25(OH)- D (11.46Â±4.47) in COVID -19 patients compared to normal levels. Interestingly, the levels of serum 25(OH)-D were significantly low in severe (9.5Â±2.71) and critical (6.26Â±2.58) groups compared to mild (16.37Â±2.62) and moderate (12.3Â±2.62) groups. Also, there was a significant positive correlation between serum 25(OH)-D levels and hemoglobin, platelets, albumin, and SPO2 values. On the other hand, there was a significant negative correlation between serum 25(OH)-D levels and LDH, C reactive protein, D dimer, and ferritin levels. Conclusions: Patients with COVID-19 in particular patients with severe and critical COVID -19 had a significantly low level of serum 25(OH)-D compared to mild and moderate cases, in addition, PSO2 and D dimer were independently correlated with serum 25(OH)-D, thus low serum 25(OH)-D level could be a predictor of severe and critical COVID - 19.

"The legacy of public action and gender-sensitivity of the pandemic response in Kerala State, India","Kerala State, India has received global attention in its response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Its response effectively attended to the health pandemic and focussed on economic relief. This paper attempts to understand how gender-responsive Keralaâ€™s policies were. Keralaâ€™s success was due to its historical preparedness and contemporary policy innovations. Over the years, public action was able to ensure that the state and the society were equipped to meet the challenges of a disaster, such as of the pandemic. In the 1990s, when India sought to limit state intervention and promote market-based solutions, public policy in Kerala shifted gears to deepen state intervention by promoting community participation and empowering women. As in other Indian States, the pandemic in Kerala too led to losses of female employment, rise in gender-based violence, a deterioration of womenâ€™s mental health and rise in unequal care burdens. But Keralaâ€™s response was distinctive. Several policy interventions had foregrounded womenâ€™s needs, which helped ensure gender-sensitivity in Keralaâ€™s pandemic response. Keralaâ€™s economic relief package included cash support, employment, free food provision and zero-interest loans to women. Through helplines, the government reached out and helped women report instances of violence and mental stress. The gender-sensitivity of Keralaâ€™s pandemic response is a rich guide as a demonstration of its possibilities and a reminder of the essential pre-requisites to achieve it.","Ramakumar, R.; Eapen, Mridul","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+legacy+of+public+action+and+gender-sensitivity+of+the+pandemic+response+in+Kerala+State,+India","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Economia Politica;: 1-31, 2021.; Publication details: Economia Politica;: 1-31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19460,""
"A Group-Based Online Acceptance And Commitment Therapy Treatment For Depression, Anxiety Symptoms And Quality Of Life In Healthcare Workers During Covid-19 Pandemic: A Randomized Controlled Trial","This study aimed to investigate whether Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) leads to reduced anxiety and depression symptoms in health care workers during the pressure of the covid-19 wide range of psychological disorders. For this study, 40 health care participants had been approached Tabriz city during COVID-19 and were divided into two groups. One received an ACT-based treatment program, and one had no therapy in this study. All participants were administered by Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Quality of Life Index, GlobalAssessment of Functioning Scale, and the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II to assess at preand post-treatment level their ratings on such scales. Regarding the results, an ANCOVA analysis revealed a significant effect of ACT to reduce the level of depression and anxiety scores as well as an improvement in quality of life in the treatment group (p &lt;.05) compared with the control group. Based on the present study, we conclude that ACT effectively reduces anxiety and depression, and achieves an improvement on the quality of life among health workers in this study and can be applied as efficient psychological treatment.

"Treating mental health patients in the emergency department setting: Examining stressors for clinicians","The purpose of the following qualitative study involves an in-depth exploration of the factors that impact the stress level of clinicians seeking effective care for clients in the acute crisis setting on the north shore of Boston. The researcher sought to understand the following: what factors increase the stress of practicing as a clinician in the ED setting. The researcher utilized Consensual Qualitative Research (CQR). 15 participants were selected and interviewed to create an analysis that included 6 major domains of findings. Major domains identified were the benefits of crisis counseling, stressors associated with the hospital setting, systemic issues within the mental health system, stressors associated with the population served, administrative issues, and changes that were a result of COVID-19. The most common factors that increase stress and were discussed were difficulties working with the interdisciplinary team, difficulty with managed care, legal and liability issues, and societal factors that are brought into the ED. These results indicate changes that need to be made at the hospital administrative level and at the larger legislative level.

"Effect of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic on Mental Health among Health Care Workers and Others","Background: A pandemic of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19)may endanger the mental well-being of health care workers. Objective: This is to stipulate some mental issues faced by health care workers at the time of COV-SARS. Patients and Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted upon 5745 participants from the Qalyubiya Governorate (7 centers). Online self-administered questionnaire (Fear of Coronavirus-19 Scale (7 Qs scale) and The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (14 items of two subscales: anxiety and depression)) was utilized. Propensity score matching was performed to minimize bias between health care workers (1740) and non-healthcare workers. Results: After performing propensity score matching, 1740 participants were included for comparison between health care workers and non-healthcare workers. Health care workers expressed more fear, anxiety, and depression scores. Increasing hours of watching media is a predictor of fear, anxiety, and depression among health care workers ((95%CI: 0.555-1.4, p&lt;.001), (0.77-1.22, p&lt;.001) and (0.45-0.85, p&lt;.001) respectively) and ((1.44-2.2, p&lt;.001), (0.94-1.49, p&lt;.001) respectively) among non-healthcare workers. Conclusions: HCW showed mental disorders scores more than non-healthcare workers. Among health care workers, females, the age group from 26 to 30 years, and more than 4h of watching media about COVID-19 had significantly higher mental scores. Non-married health care workers showed a higher fear score. Among non-healthcare workers, married and low educated levels expressed lower scores.

"Electronic Health Records in Pharmacy Skills-based Curricula","Electronic health records (EHRs) are integral to contemporary pharmacy practice. The use of EHRs and associated skill development in curricula across pharmacy education is variable. Skills-based courses in the Doctor of Pharmacy curriculum are ideal areas to develop these competencies and integrate EHR use and skills with the Pharmacists Patient Care Process. Consideration should be given by each school and college of pharmacy for having an EHR curriculum embedded within skills-based courses to prepare students for advanced pharmacy practice experiences as well as professional practice after graduation. A consensus on what skills or competencies shouldbe consistentlyincludedinpharmacy curricula shouldbe developed across pharmacy education to increase consistency in the delivery of EHR skills education and assessment. Emphasis on EHR skills and incorporation of them into national pharmacy education standards would help further guide development and assessment, as well as ensure new pharmacists are on the cutting edge of patient care and technology.

"Coping with COVID-19: Predictors and mediators of anxiety and depression during the pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased levels of anxiety and depression worldwide. The current study examined predictors of anxiety and depression as well as longitudinal changes in distress at two times points during the pandemic in the United States. We also looked at disparities between White and Non-White participants. We found Non-White participants scored higher on all dependent measures than White participants in May 2020, indicating greater distress. Further, significant depression predictors for the whole sample were COVID-19 diagnosis, previous depression, and younger age, and health anxiety predictors were previous anxiety diagnosis and no COVID-19 diagnosis. Avoidant coping predicted state anxiety and depression;more time spent watching or reading COVID-19 related news predicted all three outcome variables;intolerance of uncertainty predicted state anxiety and health anxiety, and looming cognitive style predicted health anxiety. Spiritual well-being significantly mitigated all three types of symptoms. Finally, we found differences in predictors between White and non-White participants, such that for all three dependent measures there were more significant predictors for White participants, however there was substantial overlap in predictors. We further examined the impact of cognitive vulnerability factors and avoidant coping on anxiety and depression longitudinally. After testing for temporal directionality between looming cognitive style and intolerance of uncertainty, we found the best model fit and a significant serial mediation for looming cognitive style at time one leading to increased intolerance of uncertainty at time two leading to more avoidant coping resulting in increased anxiety and depression at time two. Depression scores significantly increased over time and moderation analyses revealed that when people had lower levels of depression at time one and used less avoidant coping, they had significantly less symptoms at time two;and when people had higher levels of depression at time one and used less approach coping, they had significantly higher levels of depression at time two. Results suggest a novel model in conceptualizing anxiety and depression during the pandemic, namely highlighting looming cognitive style as an underlying cognitive vulnerability factor and the impact of coping on distress. Further implications include understanding predictors and mitigating factors of psychological symptoms during COVID-19 to inform psychological treatment of depression and anxiety. Moreover, understanding the differences in predictors of anxiety and depression in White versus Non-White groups in creating treatment plans.

"Psychological problems among patients with chronic medical disorders during the covid-19 pandemic","The aim of the current study was to investigate the rates of stress, anxiety, and depression among people in south Iran (a group from the general population without a history of any chronic medical problems, and cohorts of patients were recruited from epilepsy, diabetes, and cardiac disease clinics). We surveyed a sample of people during September 2020: a group of the general population without a history of any chronic medical problems, people with epilepsy, people with diabetes mellitus (DM), and people with cardiac problems. The survey included four general questions and two COVID-19 specific questions [contracting COVID-19, relatives with COVID-19]. Furthermore, the survey included the DASS (Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale)-21 questionnaire. 487 people were surveyed (154 people with epilepsy, 127 patients with DM, 98 people with cardiac problems, and 108 healthy individuals). Among people without a history of any chronic medical illnesses, 14% had any psychological problems. The highest rates of depression and anxiety were observed among patients with DM (52% and 57%, respectively), and the highest rate of increased stress was observed among people with cardiac problems (40%). The existence of any underlying medical problem was significantly associated with higher rates of depression, anxiety, and stress among the participants. While many patients with underlying chronic medical conditions suffer from depression, anxiety, and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot establish a cause and effect relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and increased psychological problems among these patients.","Asadi-Pooya, A.

"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health of health care workers of bahrain defence force royal medical services","Background: Literature from around the globe shows that Health Care Workers (HCW) on the front line who are exposed to patients with COVID-19, and previously, other viral epidemics, are at risk of developing adverse psychological reactions such as anxiety and depression. The objective of this study is to perform an evidence-based evaluations of the mental health of HCW in Bahrain Defence Force Royal Medical Services (BDFRMS) Hospital with regard to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional, survey-based study from BDFRMS Hospital. In the study, an online survey was created using two internationally validated diagnostic scales;the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and the survey was distributed among HCWs by electronic messaging via email or phone. The data obtained was used for statistical analysis to identify the symptoms of anxiety, depression and associated risk factors based on mental health diagnostic scales, demographic, clinical, and work-related data. Results: The prevalence of HCWs experiencing anxiety among the sample in this study was 19.6 % and the prevalence of depression was 20.5 %. The prevalence of GAD was significantly higher among HCW covering on calls/shifts [OR=2.307, 95% CI (1.010, 5.269), P-value=0.046]. The odds of experiencing GAD and/or depression was higher among HCWs with higher exposure to COVID19. The prevalence of GAD and depression was also higher among HCWs who have changed their living circumstances for safety measures and are working away from their families. Conclusion: HCWs are a vulnerable group to both depression and anxiety, and that was found to be directly proportional to exposure to COVID-19. Stigmatization of mental illness and reluctancy to seek help increase vulnerability of HCWs to adverse psychological reactions. The study recommends increasing the awareness of the importance of mental healthcare in pandemics and estimate the mental health burden of COVID-19 and can further be used to promote the mental well-being among HCW.","Al Noaimi, H.

"Buprenorphine management in the perioperative period: educational review and recommendations from a multisociety expert panel","BACKGROUND: The past two decades have witnessed an epidemic of opioid use disorder (OUD) in the USA, resulting in catastrophic loss of life secondary to opioid overdoses. Medication treatment of opioid use disorder (MOUD) is effective, yet barriers to care continue to result in a large proportion of untreated individuals. Optimal analgesia can be obtained in patients with MOUD within the perioperative period. Anesthesiologists and pain physicians can recommend and consider initiating MOUD in patients with suspected OUD at the point of care; this can serve as a bridge to comprehensive treatment and ultimately save lives. METHODS: The Board of Directors of the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, American Society of Anesthesiologists, American Academy of Pain Medicine, American Society of Addiction Medicine and American Society of Health System Pharmacists approved the creation of a Multisociety Working Group on Opioid Use Disorder, representing the fields of pain medicine, addiction, and pharmacy health sciences. An extensive literature search was performed by members of the working group. Multiple study types were included and reviewed for quality. A modified Delphi process was used to assess the literature and expert opinion for each topic, with 100% consensus being achieved on the statements and each recommendation. The consensus statements were then graded by the committee members using the United States Preventive Services Task Force grading of evidence guidelines. In addition to the consensus recommendations, a narrative overview of buprenorphine, including pharmacology and legal statutes, was performed. RESULTS: Two core topics were identified for the development of recommendations with >75% consensus as the goal for consensus; however, the working group achieved 100% consensus on both topics. Specific topics included (1) providing recommendations to aid physicians in the management of patients receiving buprenorphine for MOUD in the perioperative setting and (2) providing recommendations to aid physicians in the initiation of buprenorphine in patients with suspected OUD in the perioperative setting. CONCLUSIONS: To decrease the risk of OUD recurrence, buprenorphine should not be routinely discontinued in the perioperative setting. Buprenorphine can be initiated in untreated patients with OUD and acute pain in the perioperative setting to decrease the risk of opioid recurrence and death from overdose.","Kohan, Lynn; Potru, Sudheer; Barreveld, Antje M; Sprintz, Michael; Lane, Olabisi; Aryal, Anuj; Emerick, Trent; Dopp, Anna; Chhay, Sophia; Viscusi, Eugene","https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/rapm-2021-103007","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Reg Anesth Pain Med;46(10): 840-859, 2021 Oct.; Publication details: Reg Anesth Pain Med;46(10): 840-859, 2021 Oct.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19472,""
"COVID-19-Associated Pulmonary Aspergillosis, Fungemia, and Pneumocystosis in the Intensive Care Unit: a Retrospective Multicenter Observational Cohort during the First French Pandemic Wave","The aim of this study was to evaluate diagnostic means, host factors, delay of occurrence, and outcome of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and fungal coinfections in the intensive care unit (ICU). From 1 February to 31 May 2020, we anonymously recorded COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA), fungemia (CA-fungemia), and pneumocystosis (CA-PCP) from 36 centers, including results on fungal biomarkers in respiratory specimens and serum. We collected data from 154 episodes of CAPA, 81 of CA-fungemia, 17 of CA-PCP, and 5 of other mold infections from 244 patients (male/female [M/F] ratio = 3.5; mean age, 64.7 Â± 10.8 years). CA-PCP occurred first after ICU admission (median, 1 day; interquartile range [IQR], 0 to 3 days), followed by CAPA (9 days; IQR, 5 to 13 days), and then CA-fungemia (16 days; IQR, 12 to 23 days) (P < 10-4). For CAPA, the presence of several mycological criteria was associated with death (P < 10-4). Serum galactomannan was rarely positive (<20%). The mortality rates were 76.7% (23/30) in patients with host factors for invasive fungal disease, 45.2% (14/31) in those with a preexisting pulmonary condition, and 36.6% (34/93) in the remaining patients (P = 0.001). Antimold treatment did not alter prognosis (P = 0.370). Candida albicans was responsible for 59.3% of CA-fungemias, with a global mortality of 45.7%. For CA-PCP, 58.8% of the episodes occurred in patients with known host factors of PCP, and the mortality rate was 29.5%. CAPA may be in part hospital acquired and could benefit from antifungal prescription at the first positive biomarker result. CA-fungemia appeared linked to ICU stay without COVID-19 specificity, while CA-PCP may not really be a concern in the ICU. Improved diagnostic strategy for fungal markers in ICU patients with COVID-19 should support these hypotheses. IMPORTANCE To diagnose fungal coinfections in patients with COVID-19 in the intensive care unit, it is necessary to implement the correct treatment and to prevent them if possible. For COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA), respiratory specimens remain the best approach since serum biomarkers are rarely positive. Timing of occurrence suggests that CAPA could be hospital acquired. The associated mortality varies from 36.6% to 76.7% when no host factors or host factors of invasive fungal diseases are present, respectively. Fungemias occurred after 2 weeks in ICUs and are associated with a mortality rate of 45.7%. Candida albicans is the first yeast species recovered, with no specificity linked to COVID-19. Pneumocystosis was mainly found in patients with known immunodepression. The diagnosis occurred at the entry in ICUs and not afterwards, suggesting that if Pneumocystis jirovecii plays a role, it is upstream of the hospitalization in the ICU.","Bretagne, StÃ©phane; Sitbon, Karine; Botterel, FranÃ§oise; DelliÃ¨re, Sarah; Letscher-Bru, ValÃ©rie; Chouaki, Taieb; Bellanger, Anne-Pauline; Bonnal, Christine; Fekkar, Arnault; Persat, Florence; Costa, Damien; Bourgeois, Nathalie; Dalle, FrÃ©dÃ©ric; Lussac-Sorton, Florian; Paugam, AndrÃ©; Cassaing, Sophie; Hasseine, Lilia; Huguenin, Antoine; Guennouni, Nadia; Mazars, Edith; Le Gal, SolÃ¨ne; Sasso, MilÃ¨ne; Brun, Sophie; Cadot, Lucile; Cassagne, Carole; Cateau, Estelle; Gangneux, Jean-Pierre; Moniot, Maxime; Roux, Anne-Laure; Tournus, CÃ©line; Desbois-Nogard, Nicole; Le Coustumier, Alain; Moquet, Olivier; Alanio, Alexandre; Dromer, FranÃ§oise","https://dx.doi.org/10.1128/Spectrum.01138-21","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Microbiol Spectr;: e0113821, 2021 Oct 20.; Publication details: Microbiol Spectr;: e0113821, 2021 Oct 20.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19473,""

"Long-term health impact of PM<sub>25</sub> under whole-year COVID-19 lockdown in China","The health impact of changes in particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <2.5Â Âµm (PM2.5) pollution associated with the COVID-19 lockdown has aroused great interest, but the estimation of the long-term health effects is difficult because of the lack of an annual mean air pollutant concentration under a whole-year lockdown scenario. We employed a time series decomposition method to predict the monthly PM2.5 concentrations in urban cities under permanent lockdown in 2020. The premature mortality attributable to long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 was quantified by the risk factor model from the latest epidemiological studies. Under a whole-year lockdown scenario, annual mean PM2.5 concentrations in cites ranged from 5.4 to 68.0Â ÂµgÂ m-3, and the national mean concentration was reduced by 32.2% compared to the 2015-2019 mean. The Global Exposure Mortality Model estimated that 837.3 (95% CI: 699.8-968.4) thousand people in Chinese cities would die prematurely from illnesses attributable to long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5. Compared to 2015-2019 mean levels, 140.2 (95% CI: 122.2-156.0) thousand premature deaths (14.4% of the annual mean deaths from 2015 to 2019) attributable to long-term exposure to PM2.5 were avoided. Because PM2.5 concentrations were still high under the whole-year lockdown scenario, the health benefit is limited, indicating that continuous emission-cutting efforts are required to reduce the health risks of air pollution. Since a similar scenario may be achieved through promotion of electric vehicles and the innovation of industrial technology in the future, the estimated long-term health impact under the whole year lockdown scenario can establish an emission-air quality-health impact linkage and provide guidance for future emission control strategies from a health protection perspective.","Hao, Xin; Li, Jiandong; Wang, Huijun; Liao, Hong; Yin, Zhicong; Hu, Jianlin; Wei, Ying; Dang, Ruijun","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118118","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Environ Pollut;290: 118118, 2021 Dec 01.; Publication details: Environ Pollut;290: 118118, 2021 Dec 01.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19476,""

"The association between the suicide crisis syndrome and suicidal behaviors: The moderating role of personality traits","BACKGROUND: Personality traits have been associated with long-term suicide risk but their relationship with short-term risk is still unknown. Therefore, to address this gap, we explored the moderating effect of personality traits on the relationship between the Suicide Crisis Syndrome (SCS) and short-term suicidal behaviors (SB). SAMPLING AND METHODS: Adult participants (N = 459) were administered the Suicide Crisis Inventory (SCI), a validated self-report questionnaire designed to measure the intensity of the Suicidal Crisis Syndrome, the Big Five Inventory for personality traits, and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale for SB at intake and at a 1-month follow-up. The PROCESS macro in SPSS was used to test the moderation model. Covariates hypothesized to influence the results were added: age, gender, ethnicity, years of education, and depressive symptomatology on the Beck Depression Inventory. This study was a secondary analysis drawn from a larger study on the SCS. RESULTS: SCI total score had a significant positive relationship with SB at the 1-month follow-up for patients with lower levels of extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness, respectively. Hence, these four traits were protective against SB. There was an association between SCI and SB for patients with high levels of neuroticism at the 1-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: High levels of neuroticism served as a risk factor, whereas high levels of the other Big Five traits were protective factors against short-term SB in the context of elevated SCS symptoms. Thus, personality traits play a role in moderating the relationship between the SCS and imminent SB.","Flint, Jada; Cohen, Lisa; Nath, Diyaree; Habib, Zara; Guo, Xufei; Galynker, Igor; Calati, Raffaella","https://dx.doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.2235","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Eur Psychiatry;64(1): e63, 2021 Oct 13.; Publication details: Eur Psychiatry;64(1): e63, 2021 Oct 13.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19478,""
"Examining prevalence and correlates of smoking opioids in British Columbia: opioids are more often smoked than injected","BACKGROUND: British Columbia (BC) is in the midst of an opioid overdose crisis. Since 2017, smoking illicit drugs has been the leading mode of drug administration causing overdose death. Yet, little is known about people who smoke opioids, and factors underlying choice of mode of administration. The study objectives are to identify the prevalence and correlates associated with smoking opioids. METHODS: The Harm Reduction Client Survey is a monitoring tool used by the BC Centre for Disease Control since 2012. This survey is disseminated to harm reduction sites across BC to understand drug use trends and drug-related harms. We examined data from the survey administered October-December 2019 and performed descriptive, univariate, and multivariate analyses to better understand factors associated with smoking opioids. RESULTS: A total of 369 people who used opioids in the past 3 days were included, of whom 251 (68.0%) reported smoking opioids. A total of 109 (29.5%) respondents experienced an overdose in the past 6 months; of these 79 (72.5%) smoked opioids. Factors significantly associated with smoking opioids were: living in a small community (AOR =2.41, CI =1.27-4.58), being a woman (AOR = 1.84, CI = 1.03-3.30), age under 30 (AOR = 5.41, CI = 2.19-13.40) or 30-39 (AOR = 2.77, CI = 1.33-5.78) compared to age &#8805; 50, using drugs alone (AOR = 2.98, CI = 1.30-6.83), and owning a take-home naloxone kit (AOR = 2.01, CI = 1.08-3.72). Reported use of methamphetamines within the past 3 days was strongly associated with smoking opioids (AOR = 6.48, CI = 3.51-11.96). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight important correlates associated with smoking opioids, particularly the recent use of methamphetamines. These findings identify actions to better respond to the overdose crisis, such as targeted harm reduction approaches, educating on safer smoking, advocating for consumption sites where people can smoke drugs, and providing a regulated supply of opioids that can be smoked.","Parent, Stephanie; Papamihali, Kristi; Graham, Brittany; Buxton, Jane A","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13011-021-00414-6","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Subst Abuse Treat Prev Policy;16(1): 79, 2021 Oct 18.; Publication details: Subst Abuse Treat Prev Policy;16(1): 79, 2021 Oct 18.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19479,""
"Starting ambulance care professionals and critical incidents:Â a qualitative study on experiences, consequences and coping strategies","BACKGROUND: Ambulance care professionals are regularly confronted with critical incidents that increase risks for mental health disorders. To minimize these risks, it is important that ambulance care professionals adequately cope with critical incidents. Especially from the perspective of starting ambulance care professionals it is unknown which coping styles they use when experiencing a critical incident and how they are trained to cope with critical incidents. The aim of this study was to gain insight in (a) what starting ambulance care professionals describe as critical incidents, (b) how they experience these critical incidents and their consequences, (c) how they cope with these incidents, and (d) how they are trained and guided to cope with these incidents. METHODS: A qualitative design with individual, semi-structured interviews was used. The data was analyzed by using inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-two starting ambulance care professionals were interviewed of which, 11 were male. The age ranged from 23 to 31 years, with 11 participants being 27 years or younger. Three key-themes emerged that make an incident critical: (1) emotional connection versus emotional detachment, (2) feeling loss of control, and (3) incomprehension. All participants experienced several short to middle term physical, psychological and social consequences after encountering a critical incident. Starting ambulance care professionals applied different coping strategies during different phases of the ambulance care process: a mix of depersonification, focus on the medical task, support from colleagues and their own network, seeking confirmation, and distraction. Most starting ambulance care professionals don't actively remember they received education about coping with critical incidents during their initial educational program. During and after traineeships, the workplace preceptor has a crucial role for starting ambulance care professionals to learn them how to cope with critical incidents. CONCLUSIONS: Three key-themes interact to make an incident more critical for starting ambulance care professionals. To cope with these critical incidents, starting ambulance care professionals use a variety of coping strategies. These results can be used to develop training and coaching for starting ambulance care professionals so they can adequately cope with critical incidents.","Loef, Jorik; Vloet, Lilian C M; Vierhoven, Peter-Hans; van der Schans, Leonie; Neyman-Lubbers, Yvonne; de Vries-de Winter, Christine; Ebben, Remco H A","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12873-021-00500-9","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMC Emerg Med;21(1): 110, 2021 10 07.; Publication details: BMC Emerg Med;21(1): 110, 2021 10 07.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19480,""

"Stigma, mental illness, and covid-19 from a frontline clinician perspective: A way to go against the grain?","A well-known insidious obstacle for patients with mental illness is stigma, linked to feelings of incomprehensibility, incurability, and dangerousness. The COVID-19 pandemic represented a relevant ad-ditional barrier for these patients, which contributed to their marginalization, quality of life reduction and diminished treatments feasibility. As part of a cross-sectional multidisciplinary project conducted in the psychiatric service of Biella, a northern Italy province, preliminary data were collected by frontline clinicians during the COVID-19 first wave regarding the vicious cycle that may have been created between stigma and psychiatric patients in COVID-19 time. Therefore, we tried to frame the observed changes not in the dual literature paradigms stigma-mental illness or stigma-social consequences in COVID-19 time, but in the mental illness-stigma-COVID-19 three-way paradigm. The protection of this vulnerable segment of population, including a rapid access to COVID-19 vaccination, needs to be recognized as a real public health priority. The role of mental health services in providing information and activating supportive interventions for patients with mental illness is also crucial. Particularly, a multidisciplinary therapeutic team including mental health providers, general practitioners, hospital physicians, and social services would be needed to ensure adequate networks and cares continuity. Actions to contrast stigma can be arduous and exhausting because they must counteract the gravitational pull of customs, prejudices, and ingrained cultural beliefs, and may therefore appear to be moving in an â€œunnaturalâ€ direction, like the water in Escherâ€™s lithograph entitled â€œWaterfallâ€. Nevertheless, there is no less strenuous way to go against the grain.","Branca, F.; Macchiarulo, E.; Costanza, A.; Ambrosetti, J.; Amerio, A.; Aguglia, A.; Serafini, G.; Amore, M.; Merli, R.","https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v92iS6.12235","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Acta Biomedica; 92, 2021.; Publication details: Acta Biomedica; 92, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19482,""
"Can home gardening significantly reduce food insecurity in South Africa during times of economic distress?","The novel coronavirus has revealed major impediments in South African food distribution. Existing challenges will be greatly exacerbated by an economic recession projected to be worse than the Great Depression. Home gardens are decidedly utilised to fortify food security and economic resiliency in the face of crises, especially in impoverished communities. For these communities, home garden produce favourably augments diets consisting predominantly of industrially produced staples and the surplus yield can be sold. Despite many campaigns to alleviate food insecurity - some aimed at developing industrial agriculture and others to establish and uplift home gardens - malnutrition and hunger still plague the impoverished. Dissection of these campaigns reveals common flaws in those that failed and key aspects related to those that succeeded, with successful projects even managing to provide a household's total supply of vegetables. One of the crucial failings was a 'top-down' approach that condescended to participants, ignoring existing knowledge, preferences and social consolidation whilst focusing on meticulously consistent packaged methodologies. Successful projects exalted recipients' own bid for food sovereignty and increased individual and community capacity by providing insightful consultation and access to requested necessary inputs. Obstacles especially present in South Africa include drought and collapse of social capital after withdrawal of institutional support. It has been proven possible that these can be overcome with application of technologies, such as rainwater harvesting, and the creation of common cause such as in national drives. This review of the literature clearly reveals that purposefully uplifted home and community gardens alleviate food insecurity. Significance: Citizens aim for food sovereignty in times of economic crises such as will be brought about by the novel coronavirus. We assess the potential of the establishment of home and community gardens to alleviate food insecurity in South Africa. Home gardens should mainly target the alleviation of malnutrition, producing vegetables to augment cereal-based diets. Protection of social capital by institutional networks ensures durability and long-term success of campaigns. Rainwater harvesting technology is immensely influential for the success of home gardens in a South African context.","Carstens, G.; Hay, R.; van der Laan, M.","https://doi.org/10.17159/sajs.2021/8730","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: South African Journal of Science; 117(9-10):46-52, 2021.; Publication details: South African Journal of Science; 117(9-10):46-52, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19483,""
"THE AFTERMATH OF COVID-19 ON STUDENTS' EDUCATION AND HEALTH IN INDIAN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS: A SURVEY","Aim. This paper aims to bring forth how the basic right of education got adversely affected due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The unplanned and immediate shift to online classes adversely affected the students' physical and mental health as several issues that the students faced were related to the lack of adequate resources. Methods. The data for this paper were collected through a self-prepared and struc-tured questionnaire, using Google forms, which was then circulated among different stakeholders of the educational institutes. The statistical analysis of the collected data was done using Microsoft Excel. Results and conclusion. According to the analysis of the survey, smartphones (75% of the total respondents) are relatively more accessible by students in compa-rison to computers or laptops (53%). And even if students had Internet connection (57%), they faced issues of low data bandwidth (39%) leading to poor quality of online interaction in classes. Another important result suggested that 57% of students lacked a quiet room or space to attend the online classes in their homes. Finally, the negative impacts of online classes on the physical and mental health of students were also analysed. Cognitive value. The findings and the analysis of this paper would thus help teachers and institutions to understand students' views and experiences of the pandemic. This understanding would help teachers to plan their teaching accordingly, bridging the digital divide, which would help students learn and grow.","Mann, P.; Mann, B.","https://doi.org/10.15503/jecs2021.2.361.374","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Journal of Education Culture and Society; 12(2):361-374, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Education Culture and Society; 12(2):361-374, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19484,""
"Psychological impact of COVID-19 on health-care workers: A multicenter cross-sectional study","Background: Health-care workers (HCWs) as frontline soldiers are involved in the war against COVID-19. Not only their protection from COVID-19 is important but also their mental health is a concern. This study aimed to measure the psychological distress among HCWs in the time of COVID-19 in Isfahan, Iran. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in the 2 nd month of the spread of COVID-19 in Isfahan, Iran (March 16 to April 3). A total of 321 HCWs participated in an online survey and answered the General Health Questionnaire, the Insomnia Severity Index, and the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey. t-test and ANOVA were used for comparing variables between groups. Multiple linear regression was used to evaluate the predictive factors of psychological distress. Results: About 34% of our HCWs suffer from some levels of psychological distress. The result of multiple linear regression (R 2: 0.41) shows that the predictive variables with the highest value were insomnia, working as a medical resident, and lack of social support (standardized coefficient of beta: 0.51, 0.25, and 0.16, respectively;P &lt; 0.05).

"Different approaches to confronting the biological epidemic;Prevention tools with an emphasis on COVID-19: A systematized study","Background: The World Health Organization has identified COVID-19 as a public health emergency and is urging governments to stop the virus transmission by adopting appropriate policies. In this regard, authorities have taken different approaches to cutting the chain or controlling the spread of the disease. The aim of this study was to determine the approaches to biological epidemics and related prevention tools with emphasis on COVID-19 disease. Methods: The present study was a systematize study of publications related to the prevention strategies for Covid-19 disease. The study was carried out based on the PRISMA guidelines, CASP and AACODS. The data resources included ISI/WOS, PubMed, Scopus, science direct, Ovid and ProQuest. WHO website, published reports of countries, as well as the Worldometer website were evaluated. The time-frame of the study was from 1 December 2019 to 30 May 2020. Results: The study findings showed that in order to confronting the COVID-19 epidemic, in general, there are three approaches of 'mitigation', 'active control', and 'suppression' and four strategies of 'quarantine', 'isolation', 'social distance', and 'lockdown' in both individual and social dimensions to deal with epidemics. Selection and implementation of each approach requires specific strategies and has different effects when it comes to controlling and inhibiting the disease. Conclusion: One possible approach to control the disease is to change individual behavior and lifestyle. In addition to prevention strategies, use of masks, observance of personal hygiene principles such as regular hand washing and non-contact of contaminated hands with the face, as well as observance of public health principles such as sneezing and coughing etiquettes, safe extermination of personal protective equipment must be strictly observed. The use of the previous experiences in the world, along with the current experiences of countries, can be very helpful in choosing the accurate approach for each country in accordance with the characteristics of that country and lead to the reduction of possible costs at the national and international levels.","Hadian, M.; Mazaheri, E.; Jabbari, A.","https://doi.org/10.4103/ijpvm.IJPVM_634_20","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: International Journal of Preventive Medicine; 12(1), 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Preventive Medicine; 12(1), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19486,""
"Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of seafarers: A comparison using matched samples","The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures implemented to curb its transmission have altered workplaces and challenged occupational health and safety in unprecedented ways, with high levels of mental distress reported across several industries. In the maritime industry, occupational health and safety risks, including psychosocial risks, were a concern already before the COVID-19 pandemic. However, knowledge about the prevalence of mental health problems and the factors associated with them is still limited. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the effects of respondent and work-related characteristics on seafarersâ€™ self-reported symptoms of depression and anxiety. Data came from two cross-sectional convenience samples of seafarers on international commercial vessels, surveyed before (Npre-pandemic = 793) and during the pandemic (Npandemic = 504). Matching the two samples on respondent and work-related characteristics using propensity scores, we found that the pandemic contributed to significantly higher levels of both depression and anxiety. Further analyses showed that seafarers with longer work periods, those who had been on board longer than expected, and those working on vessels registered with â€œFlags of Convenienceâ€ reported significantly higher levels of both depression and anxiety during the pandemic, but not prior to the pandemic. Taken together, these findings suggest that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic led to a deterioration of working conditions and increased mental health risks for seafarers. Practical implications for safe-guarding occupational health and safety during this and future crises are discussed.","Pauksztat, Birgit, Andrei, Daniela M.; Grech, Michelle R.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2021.105542","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Safety Science;: 105542, 2021.; Publication details: Safety Science;: 105542, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19487,""
"Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on medication adherence: In the case of antiseizure medications, a scoping review","Since early 2020, an unprecedented public global health emergency caused by coronavirus (COVID-19) resulted in national governments' imposing confinement measures. Lockdowns and isolation during pandemics complicate disease management and medication adherence. Chronic conditions, such as epilepsy, require linear adherence patterns to prevent breakthrough seizures and to reduce the risk of sudden unexpected death. Limited access to health care facilities for routine care and medicines management further hampers this. Social isolation exacerbates stress, depression and decreases social support, which may combine to reduce adherence to antiseizure medication (ASM) during the pandemic. Methods : We conducted a literature scoping review to explore ASM adherence among people with epilepsy, non-infected or infected SARS-CoV-2 or recovered from COVID-19 during the pandemic and explore risk factors for adherence. We search Pubmed for articles up to 16 September 2021. Search terms included the thematic of ASM adherence and COVID-19. We adhered to the PRISMA guidelines for reporting scoping reviews. Results : Six articles were retained after the screening, which covered four overarching themes: change of ASM compliance and as risk factors, lack of follow-up, difficulties accessing ASM, and behavioural risk factors. Our review underscores the lack of evidence on ASM adherence among people with epilepsy infected or recovered from COVID-19. No study retrieved took place in a low-income setting, warranting a cautionary approach to be employed when extrapolating findings on a global scale.","Menon, Sonia, Sander, Josemir W.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seizure.2021.10.009","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Seizure;2021.; Publication details: Seizure;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19488,""
"Implementation of pharmacist-led tele medication management clinic in ambulatory care settings: A patient-centered care model in COVID-19 era","Over the past 20Â years, owing to rapid advances in technological innovation, namely in telecommunication and telemedicine, healthcare institutions have integrated clinical practices with cutting-edge telecommunication technology to enhance access to patient care, improve continuity of clinical care, and ensure patient safety. Johns Hopkins Aramco Healthcare (JHAH) is a gold-certified tertiary care institution, and it is an excellent center for patient-centered care. In response to the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it has adopted various telecommunication technologies to provide patient-care services. This article describes the integration of telecommunication technology, such as telephone and video consultation, with a pharmacist-led medication management clinic (MMC) to provide person-centered patient care services at JHAH. The JHAH pharmacy services were found to be essential in establishing face-to-face outcome-oriented pharmacist-led medication management services for patients requiring chronic ambulatory care. The established tele-MMC services enhanced patient engagement and treatment compliance, and the integration process and its challenges were assessed. Especially during this COVID-19 pandemic, the pharmacist-led tele-MMC services were beneficial to chronic disease patients and ensured the continuity of care, maintenance of up-to-date lab tests, management of polypharmacy, minimization of the use of unwanted medications and medication synchronization. Further, the pharmacist-led tele-MMC services provided comprehensive patient counseling, which included the use of visual aids. This new integrated model provides an example for other healthcare organizations to adopt and implement the program in ambulatory care settings, to better ensure the continuity of quality healthcare, especially for elderly patients and those with chronic diseases.","Mohiuddin, Syed Iqbal, Thorakkattil, Shabeer Ali, Abushoumi, Fatimah, Nemr, Habib S.; Jabbour, Rita, Al-Ghamdi, Fuad","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcsop.2021.100083","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Exploratory Research in Clinical and Social Pharmacy;: 100083, 2021.; Publication details: Exploratory Research in Clinical and Social Pharmacy;: 100083, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19489,""
"Perceived changes in lifestyle behaviours and in mental health and wellbeing of elementary school children during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Canada: Lifestyles and mental health and wellbeing of children during the lockdown","ABSTRACT Objectives The closure of schools to prevent the spread of COVID-19 prompted concerns of deteriorating lifestyle behaviours, mental health and wellbeing of children, particularly those in socioeconomically disadvantaged settings. We assessed changes in lifestyle behaviours (physical activity, screen time, eating habits and bed/wake-up times), mental health and wellbeing during the first lockdown in Spring 2020 as perceived by school children from disadvantaged settings, and examined determinants of these changes. Study Design Cross-sectional study. Methods We surveyed 1095 grade 4 to 6 students (age 9-12 years) from 20 schools in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities in northern Canada. Students reported on changes in lifestyle behaviours, mental health and wellbeing during the lockdown. Determinants of these perceived changes were examined in multivariable regression models. Results A majority of students reported declines in physical activity, having late bed/wake-up times, and modest improvements in mental health and wellbeing. Many students reported increases rather than decreases in screen time and snacking. Positive attitudes toward being active, eating healthy, going to sleep on time and being healthy, were strongly associated with maintaining healthy lifestyle behaviours during the lockdown. Positive attitudes toward active and healthy living and healthy lifestyle behaviours were associated with maintaining positive mental health and wellbeing during the lockdown. Conclusions The considerable changes in lifestyle behaviors, superimposed on the pre-existing burden of unhealthy lifestyle behaviours, put this generation of children at increased risk for future chronic disease. Findings call for effective health promotion of active and healthy lifestyles to benefit both physical and mental health.","Maximova, Katerina, Khan, Mohammad K.

"TRANSFORMATIONAL STRATEGIES FOR OPTIMIZING USE OF MEDICATIONS AND RELATED THERAPIES THROUGH US PHARMACISTS AND PHARMACIES FROM 2021-2025: FINDINGS FROM A NATIONAL STUDY","ABSTRACT Background Non-optimized medication therapies (NOMTs) are associated with likely-avoidable illnesses and mortality affecting millions of people and costing an estimated $528 billion per year in excess health spending in the US. The COVID-19 pandemic brought into focus barriers limiting the ability of US pharmacists and pharmacies to provide services that can reduce NOMTs and improve US population health. Objectives This National Science Foundation Center for Health Organization Transformation study explored potential strategies that US pharmacists, pharmacies and their partners could implement to reduce NOMTs while also delivering other forms of value to US populations from 2021-2025 (during and after the COVID-19 pandemic). Methods A panel of senior leaders representing the US pharmacist/pharmacy sector participated in a four round Delphi process to identify unmet needs, barriers, change drivers and priority strategies for meeting those needs. Data was gathered and analyzed by public health researchers most of whom are outside the pharmacist/pharmacy sector. Results A comprehensive set of evidence-based strategies with potential to reduce NOMTs, protect and improve population health and wellbeing, and strengthen the sector were identified. Four transformational strategies were recommended: comprehensive payment and practice transformation, strengthening pharmacy data interoperability infrastructure, development of unifying measurement and management mechanisms, and development of a more robust national research infrastructure. Strengthening health equity was a cross-cutting strategy affecting all areas. Conclusion The results may be of interest to policymakers, pharmacists, pharmacies, physicians, nurses and other clinicians, pharmaceutical firms, plan sponsors, plans, health systems, clinics, aging care, digital technology companies, and others interested in optimizing outcomes from medications and related therapies for US populations.","Thornewill, Judah, Antimisiaris, Demetra, Ezekekwu, Emmanuel, Esterhay, Robert","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.japh.2021.10.018","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of the American Pharmacists Association;2021.; Publication details: Journal of the American Pharmacists Association;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19491,""

"Entertain Me Well: An Entertaining, Tailorable, Online Platform Delivering CBT for Depression","Depression prevalence is high, impacting approximately 20% of Americans during their lifetime, and on the rise due to stress and loss associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the high prevalence of depression, unacceptable treatment access disparities persist. When depression goes untreated, it leads to substantial negative impacts in multiple life domains. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), the gold-standard psychosocial treatment for depression, remains largely unavailable to individuals living with depression, particularly individuals who are members of underrepresented groups in our society. Digital mental health interventions (DMHI) have led to important advances in extending the reach of CBT for depression;however, they are underutilized and treatment engagement remains low. We sought to address some of the current gaps in DMHI by developing an online platform for delivering CBT for depression that is entertaining, simple and straightforward, and tailorable. First, this article introduces our online platform, Entertain Me Well (EMW) and its key innovations, including the use of an engaging, character-driven storyline presented as â€œepisodesâ€ within each session, as well as customizable content that allows for tailoring of text, images, and examples to create content most relevant to the target client population, context, or setting. Next, we describe two EMW depression treatment programs that have been tailored: one for delivery in the rural church setting, called Raising Our Spirits Together, and one tailored for delivery in dialysis centers, called Doing Better on Dialysis. Finally, we discuss future directions for the EMW platform, including the ability to create programs for other common mental health and health conditions, the development of additional character-driven storylines with greater treatment personalization, translation of content in multiple languages, and the use of additional technological innovation, such as artificial intelligence like natural language processing, to enhance platform interactivity.","Weaver, Addie, Zhang, Anao, Xiang, Xiaoling, Felsman, Peter, Fischer, Daniel J.; Himle, Joseph A.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpra.2021.09.003","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Cognitive and Behavioral Practice;2021.; Publication details: Cognitive and Behavioral Practice;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19494,""
"Addressing mental and physical health in vulnerable patients during the covid-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted not only in physical illness and death but it has also precipitated an evolving mental-health crisis. The importance of widespread vaccination is accepted as the best medical hope to lead us out of the pandemic, but that will require population herd immunity to ensure that most people can be considered protected. Addressing vaccination hesitancy, especially that associated with the COVID-19 vaccine, is challenging and can be made even more so by health disparities experienced by individuals in vulnerable groups, including those with mental-health disorders. These disparities may also predispose patients to greater risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated complications. To provide optimal care for patients diagnosed with mental-health disorders and those who have other predisposing disparities during the COVID-19 pandemic, pharmacists should have a comprehensive understanding of how these clinical factors may uniquely impact this population and identify and take advantage of opportunities to address them.","Demler, T.

"Self-care practices and online student engagement during Covid-19 in the Philippines: A mixed methods study","The Covid-19 pandemic and the transition of educational landscapes from traditional to online classes, have exposed students to an increased risk of mental health problems that can impact their educational engagement and learning outcomes. Self-care practices can help protect students from psychological challenges, and also improve student outcomes;however, the drastic societal changes brought about by quarantine and digital learning may cause disruptions in students' practice of self-care. The aim of this convergent mixed methods study is to determine the relationship between self-care practices and online student engagement, and describe the barriers in practising self-care among undergraduate students during the pandemic. An online survey was administered to a convenience sample of 202 students from De La Salle University, Philippines. Quantitative results suggest that specific domains of self-care practices are statistically linked with background characteristics and online student engagement. On the other hand, two themes describing the barriers to practising self-care emerged from the qualitative data: (1) quarantine-related barriers;and (2) online-class-related barriers.","Cleofas, J.

"How are you? Impressions on covid-19 lockdown from women scientists in italy","The Covid-19 pandemic has changed our lives. The first and unexpected lockdown in Italy has seriously upset people daily routine, working organisation, socialisation and interactions with colleagues and relatives. To overcome the physical isolation and collect impressions, the â€œHow are you?â€ online questionnaire was created and shared as a conversation among friends. Text mining techniques have been applied to almost one hundred replies, to highlight similarities and differences in the experiences lived during the lockdown, changes in daily actions, thoughts and reflections. Our findings show that the lockdown period was experienced as a moment of physical and relational confinement, provoking feelings such as fear, sadness and restlessness concerning the near future. However, it appears that many respondents accepted this lockdown as an opportunity to reorder their own lives, in terms of physical activities such as daily habits, and personal relationships and priorities. The fresco on which the paper is based is unique in terms of time, space, gender and professions. The written conversations took place from mid-March to the end of May 2020, i.e. during a period in which Italy was the first country in Europe to confine people home for all but essential reasons. Selected testimonies have been chosen among women professionals in science, mainly higher education professors and researchers. Since the questionnaire was aimed to collect free narratives, explicitly asked â€œfrom a few syllables to pagesâ€, it allows to hear researchersâ€™ voices, which often risk to remain unheard, and to collect them in a direct, fresh manner, without the constraints of structured questions. Topics covered in the conversations are highly gendered, including working conditions, work-life balance, family care. Moreover, since the initiative stemmed from a women scientistsâ€™ association, respondents provided interesting inputs regarding both gendered visions of the pandemic before and during it and their expectations afterwards centring on the roles that women play.

"Dual impact of comorbidities and symptoms of coronavirus on mental health during covid-19 pandemic among males and females in india: Online cross sectional study","BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) has become a pandemic affecting health and wellbeing worldwide. In addition to the physical health, economic, and social implications, the psychological impacts of this pandemic are increasingly being reported in the scientific literature. Individuals with certain pre-existing comorbidities have been identified as a high-risk group for fatalities of COVID-19 infection. Thus, this study aimed to analyse the association of COVID-19 symptoms and the presence of comorbidities with the mental health of the population during this pandemic. METHOD: A cross-sectional web-based online study was conducted from 13thJune to 31stJuly 2020, and link was circulated using social media platforms. Participants were of age =18 and residents of India were included. HERO's scale was used to assess the mental health status. A multivariate logistic regression was performed to examine associations. RESULTS: Out of 1021 eligible individuals (460-females, 561-males), 15.2% females and 11.2% males reported poor mental health status. The COVID-19 symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, cough, shortness of breath, runny nose, fever, and sore throat were associated with poor mental health among males, while only nausea, vomiting was associated among females. Also, the presence of any one or more comorbidities was associated with poor mental health across gender. CONCLUSION: Poor mental health was reported by both genders across the study population. Comorbidities and COVID-19 symptoms were significantly associated with poor mental health among males than females. These findings strongly support the need for an infrastructure to comprehend the gender-specific mental well-being as a core component of health across all the sections of Indian society.

"An integrated framework of leadership for healthcare organizations to navigate through covid-19 crisis","COVID-19 crisis has strained healthcare systems immensely creating a multi-front challenge to overcome. Healthcare leaders face stressful situations like long arduous hours of work, isolation from their loved ones, immense mental health issues along with fighting false narratives and campaigns by social media. Hence, there is a dire need for leaders to embrace this uncertainty and evolve by adopting a strategic shift in their mindset. To propose an effective functional leadership model of practice during crisis, author has undertaken a qualitative approach to understand the various literature published on crisis management, reviewed the literature on healthcare leadership, contextualized the papers about unique challenges posed by a crisis like COVID-19, and utilize the learnings to design an integrated framework for healthcare organizations to be applied during a crisis. Author presents a systems-based view of leadership challenges in healthcare organizations during a crisis and proposes a unique framework of 3A- Acknowledge, Activate, and Agility which could serve a comprehensive tool of strategic leadership for healthcare leaders to adopt during a crisis. When healthcare organizations adopt the principles embedded within 3A model elements, it would help them realize better patient outcomes, develop compassionate organizational culture, and enhance professional satisfaction within their teams.

"What is it to lose trust? Covid-19 pandemic, extended minds and shared feelings","Since the emergence of the Covid-19 outbreak, the world has faced profound changes, with different levels of impact on human experience. Besides immediate health, economic, and political issues, psychological and existential impacts have also emerged. It is no exaggeration to say that even our taken-for-granted, embodied being in the world has profoundly changed, with collectively felt impacts. In this paper, I argue for a general description of the Covid-19 experience. I suggest that loss of trust emerges as a pervasive dimension of these strange times, de-structuring the whole web of human relations since then. As an essentially affective category, trust can be described at the most basic level as a pre-intentional bodily orientation towards ourselves, others, and the world in general. A critical point is that loss of trust cannot be described as an internal and individual emotion, but rather, as an essentially relational and socially extended affective phenomenon. Another critical point is that, due to social distancing measures, loss of trust has to be understood mostly as a technologically scaffolded form of emotional sharing. I end by calling attention to the potential and present mental health impacts of losing trust. Â© 2021 by Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia. All rights reserved.","Lopes, M.

"Effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on happiness in the Netherlands","In the media we read mainly about negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our subjective wellbeing, such as increased depression, anxiety and loneliness. There is less attention for possible positive effects and for this reason it is worth examining how the life-satisfaction of the Dutch population has developed during the pandemic. In the short run, this will help policy makers to balance loss of happiness against loss of lives and in the long run it will help to examine which policies have resulted in the lowest loss of happy life years. In this article, we describe observed effects on happiness in the Netherlands during the pandemic (until spring 2021) using three empirical approaches: 1) trend in subsequent survey studies, 2) analysis of a panel study, and 3) analysis of a dairy study in which mood during daily activities was measured. Average life-satisfaction declined by about 4% of which 3% between summer 2020 and spring 2021. Whereas in the early days of the pandemic, the Dutch population only reported a minor loss of happiness, the decline has become substantial at the end of the road. Â© 2021 Amsterdam University Press.

"Choose your own adventure: Psychiatric advanced directives coming soon to an ED near you","Psychiatric advanced directives (PADs) are utilized by mental health patients to direct their psychiatric care including assigning surrogates for medical decision-making, listing preferred inpatient psychiatric/treating facilities, preferred medication regimens to stabilize acute psychiatric condition and to facilitate the patientâ€™s overall interaction with the mental health system. This article reviews the rationale behind PADs, how they can be utilized to reduce the need for de-escalation techniques, restraints and chemical anxiolysis by partnering with patients in the delivery of their care. This paper will also briefly address some of the practical limitations that Emergency Physicians and allied health care providers might face in attempting to honor PADs including the inability to admit to preferred facilities due to staff shortages or other issues associated with the global COVID-19 pandemic.

"The Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Jordanian Healthcare Workers","Introduction: Healthcare workers face incomparable work and psychological demands that are amplified throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Aim: This study aimed to investigate the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health care workers in Jordan. Method: A cross-sectional design was used. Data was collected using an online survey during the outbreak of COVID-19. Results: Overall, of the 312 healthcare workers, almost 38% and 36% presented with moderate to severe anxiety and depression consecutively. Nurses reported more severe symptoms than other healthcare workers. And both anxiety and depression were negatively correlated with well-being. Getting infected was not an immediate worry among healthcare workers;however, they were worried about carrying the virus to their families. Implications for Practice: Stakeholders must understand the impact of COVID-19 on healthcare workers and plan to provide them with the required psychological support and interventions at an early stage.","Fawaris, Fadi, Othman, Elham, AlBashtawy, Mohammed, Ahmad Abu, Alfwares","https://doi.org/10.4018/IJRQEH.289635","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: International Journal of Reliable and Quality E - Healthcare; 11(3):1-9, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Reliable and Quality E - Healthcare; 11(3):1-9, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19506,""
"Preparing for the Worst? Household Food Stockpiling during the Second Wave of COVID-19 in Serbia","Stockpiling and panic buying are significant components of crisis- and disaster-related consumption behaviors that have gained significant media coverage during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper aims to analyze the features of stockpiling behavior during the second wave of COVID-19 in Serbia based on a structured online questionnaire. This study seeks to answer two questions. First, what factors triggered and affected stockpiling during the COVID-19 pandemic in Serbia? Second, how does stockpiling affect other food habits and diets? A total of 851 valid responses were received. The results highlight several features of the stockpiling behavior in Serbia. First, food stockpiling behavior is influenced by some sociodemographic variables such as gender and household composition. Second, stockpiling was fueled by several negative emotions such as fear, sadness, and depression. Third, the results confirm that stockpiling in Serbia was not triggered by supply shortages but rather by consumersâ€™ concerns of obtaining enough food and rising food prices. Finally, food stockpiling was associated with some positive changes such as eating out less (e.g., restaurants/cafeteria), eating more with their family members, and cooking more food. Analyzing and comprehending consumer food stockpiling patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic may offer policymakers imperative information for adjusting supply and response strategies during future crises.","Ben Hassen, Tarek, El Bilali, Hamid, Allahyari, Mohammad S.; Berjan, Sinisa, KarabaÅ¡evic, Darjan, Radosavac, Adriana, DaÅ¡ic, Goran, Ãervida, RuÅ¾ica","https://doi.org/10.3390/su132011380","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Sustainability; 13(20):11380, 2021.; Publication details: Sustainability; 13(20):11380, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19507,""
"Modelling of Social Policy and Initiatives under COVID-19: Rural NEET Youth Case Study","NEET (Not in Education, Employment, or Training) youth rates in Europe are generally higher in rural regions than in urban areas and the share in rural regions is constantly increasing. During the COVID-19 pandemic, young people became even more vulnerable as they experienced social exclusion and mental health problems. The objective of this paper is to analyse NEET youth-related statistics in Europe and distinguish positive initiatives for young people in rural areas of the Baltic countries to encourage positive emotions and willingness to learn. Statistical analysis and case study methods were employed. Data on youth unemployment, NEET youth by age and gender, and poverty and social exclusion of young people, is analysed. Social policy initiatives in Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, mainly from rural municipalities, are presented and discussed. This research determines the key issues related to NEET youth and proposes initiatives to overcome existing problems among young people. Such social initiatives aim to promote positive social emotions of youth, promote their inclusion in society, and foster regional sustainability.","Kvieskiene, Giedre, Ivanova, Ilze, Trasberg, Karmen, Stasytyte, Viktorija, CelieÅ¡iene, Egle","https://doi.org/10.3390/socsci10100393","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Social Sciences; 10(10):393, 2021.; Publication details: Social Sciences; 10(10):393, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19508,""
"Religiosity and Contentment among Teachers in the Philippines during COVID-19 Pandemic: Mediating Effects of Resilience, Optimism, and Well-Being","The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented effect on many areas of peopleâ€™s lives all over the world, including in the area of education. Many educational institutions must un-preparedly transition from physical classes to distance learning modalities, affecting both the students and teachers. Given that the teachers are confronted with so many challenges, leading to their increased stress and mental health issues, this research project investigated the role of religiosity in the contentment of a sample of 296 teachers in the Philippines, mediated by the effects of resilience, optimism, and well-being. Bivariate correlation analysis showed that religiosity, resilience, optimism, and well-being were positively and significantly correlated with each other, while contentment was positively and significantly correlated with optimism and well-being. Regression analysis indicated no direct significant association between religiosity and contentment. Mediation analyses suggested that optimism partially mediated the impact of religiosity on well-being, whereas well-being fully mediated the impact of religiosity on contentment and the impact of optimism on contentment. Lastly, the measurement model indicated a significant path from religiosity to contentment through optimism and well-being. These significant results suggest that, while facing adversities in life, the teachers in the Philippines might use religiosity and its relevant dimensions as positive coping mechanisms to face the academic challenges triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, and thus derive contentment that is mediated by the positive effects of optimism and well-being.","Edara, Inna Reddy, del Castillo, Fides, Ching, Gregory S.; del Castillo, Clarence Darro","https://doi.org/10.3390/rel12100879","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Religions; 12(10):879, 2021.; Publication details: Religions; 12(10):879, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19509,""
"Novel Synthesis of N-Acetylcysteine Medicine Using an Effective Method","N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is mainly administrated as a mucolytic medication, antioxidant supplement, antidote in paracetamol overdose, and a drug for the prevention of diabetic kidney disease. Its effect has been investigated for the treatment of several diseases such as COVID-19. In this work, an effective method for high-yield synthesis of N-acetylcysteine is proposed. This drug can be synthesized in a single-batch step instead of using a multi-stage process. The proposed method has shown the potential to be considered as an alternative method for producing NAC. The purification process was carried out using suitable solvents to reach a high level of purity. The characterization of the synthesized drug was undertaken through Elemental analysis, Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR), High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), and melting point analyses.","Ziaee, Farzaneh, Ziaee, Mohammad","https://doi.org/10.3390/M1288","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Molbank; 2021(4):M1288, 2021.; Publication details: Molbank; 2021(4):M1288, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19510,""
"Attitudes and Behaviors toward the Use of Public and Private Green Space during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Iran","This paper reports the results of an exploratory study carried out in Birjand, Iran, during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of the study was to explore the behavioral change in the use and the motivation to visit a green space (public or private) during the pandemic as compared to the pre-pandemic period, the effect of green spaces (private and public) on usersâ€™ feelings, the relations between the extent to which the access to green spaces was missed, and characteristics of respondents and the place they live. A survey was carried out through an online questionnaire in winter 2020 and about 400 responses were collected. The results showed a decrease in visitation of public green spaces during the pandemic, and higher visitation of private green spaces such as gardens or courtyards by those with access. In addition, both public and private green spaces enhance positive feelings and decrease the negative ones. Respondents missed access to green spaces, especially when their visitation before the pandemic was high, and women missed them more than men. Therefore, private green spaces might represent an opportunity for psychological respite in time of a pandemic, but also for socialization. The study reports respondentsâ€™ useful suggestions for urban landscape planning for the city of Birjand that might also be useful for other cities in dry lands;improving the quality of green spaces beyond the quantity may play a role in enhancing the connection to nature in the time of a pandemic, with positive effects on mental health, and this can also can improve recreation opportunities and reduce inequalities.","Khalilnezhad, Mohammad Reza, Ugolini, Francesca, Massetti, Luciano","https://doi.org/10.3390/land10101085","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Land; 10(10):1085, 2021.; Publication details: Land; 10(10):1085, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19511,""
"Determinants of Managerial Competences Transformation in the Polish Energy Industry","Different technological, socio-economic, geopolitical, and demographic factors have a significant influence on labor markets. Currently, due to COVID-19, the global economy is in a challenging situation, and millions of people from different countries have lost their jobs. The employeeâ€™s mental health and well-being are in risk conditions. In the coming years, the Polish energy sector will face several transformations. Emerging technologies are intended to deal with the problems in energy management. One of the main industry forces is human capital, people who will be able to project and manage the innovative technologies. Thus, this paper examines the determinants of managerial competences transformation in the energy industry from the labor market perspective. The paper fulfills the research gap in the energy manager professionâ€™s transformation in Poland. The aim of the paper was to present the current state of the energy manager profession in Poland. Two methodological approaches were used: the theoretical and practical approaches. Descriptive statistics are provided to present the labor market research results.

"Exploratory Analysis of Fundamental Spiritual Support Factors to a Positive Attitude in Patients with COVID-19 Using Natural-Language Processing Algorithms","The SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 affects the respiratory tract and is highly infectious. Those patients who knew that the disease could cause death or that their healing process is quite painful because of the symptoms and conditions developed extreme stress, anxiety, and depression, which aggravated the effects of the disease. Therefore, it is vital to conduct research to analyze these effects and generate self-help and support mechanisms during the disease process. This paper presents exploratory analysis related to stress, coping attitudes, emotional responses, and sources of support that were vital in patients affected by COVID-19;the focus of this study is the consideration of the spiritual factor, which may influence religious resilience that allows for a positive attitude and tenacity. To carry out this research, interviews were conducted with patients who had suffered from COVID-19 disease, and the collected information was processed using text-mining techniques using a two-phase methodology. The first phase is based on the Colaizzi method. Interview responses were coded through the search for patterns in the key phrases, and these codes were grouped, forming semantic relationships. In the second phase, natural-language processing algorithms (WordCloud, WordEmbedding, sentiment analysis of opinions) were used, summarizing the interviews in relevant factors of the patientâ€™s experience during the disease. Spiritual resilience stood out the most of all key phrases of the code group tables. Likewise, words such as security, confidence, tranquility, and peace indicated that the patients took a positive attitude towards the symptoms and complications of the disease. Therefore, it is important to be the resilience to face a crisis process, and one of the factors that generated such resilience in COVID-19 patients was religious faith, which was expressed in the interviews using the factors of security, trust, promises of healing, tranquility, and the impossibility of discouragement. All this contributed to the positive attitude of the interviewees during the process of recovery from the disease.","SÃ¡nchez-GarcÃ©s, Jorge, LÃ³pez-Gonzales, Javier Linkolk, Palacio-FarfÃ¡n, Miguel, Coronel-SacÃ³n, VÃ­ctor, Ferney-Teheran, Yonny, PeÃ±uela-Pineda, Jahisber, Avila-George, Himer","https://doi.org/10.3390/app11209524","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Applied Sciences; 11(20):9524, 2021.; Publication details: Applied Sciences; 11(20):9524, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19513,""
"Companionship and Sexual Issues in the Aging Population","Loneliness and social isolation are significant public health crises in older adults. The issues about companionship have many psychosocial and cultural dimensions, which is further compounded by the current COVID-19 pandemic. In modern-day India, there is a significant increase in the number of older adults left to live alone because of sociocultural changes in our society. Companionship in late life is known to promote the quality of life and decrease the mental health morbidity. There is an increasing role of pets as companions to the elderly. Novel technologies such as artificial intelligence in the form of robots are being explored to support the elderly. Sexuality is another complex issue related to older adults that is often ignored. The sexuality and sexual functioning in older adults largely depend on physiological, psychological, and sociocultural factors. The principles of ageism have influenced sexuality in older adults. Sociocultural issues and the aging-related pathophysiological changes can contribute to an increased risk for legal issues related to sexuality in this population. There is a need for more systematic research into the multifaceted concept of companionship and sexuality in the older adult population.

"Hope and Fear in the Midst of Coronavirus: What Accounts for COVID-19 Preparedness?","Objective: The present study asks the question: What variables accounted for peopleâ€™s tendencies to take steps to prepare for COVID-19 during the earliest stage of the pandemic? Data collection took place from March 6 to 11, 2020. In particular, the study examines variables that have been shown to predict health behavior in previous research outside the context of the present pandemic, including hope, optimism, perceived risk, fear, and mental health variables. Method: Participants (222 adults in 39 U.S. states) were recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk. Online surveys included the Adult Hope Scale (AHS), Life Orientation Test (LOT-R), Health Anxiety Inventory (HAI), Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), Impact of Events Scale (IES-R), and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). Also included were items inquiring about COVID-19 perceived mortality risk, fear/anxiety, and preparedness. Results and Conclusion: Participants were asked to imagine that COVID-19 had different hypothetical levels of mortality risk, ranging from 1 to 10 percent mortality (at the time of data collection, the WHO estimated actual mortality of the disease at approximately 3 percent). For each level, participants rated the degree to which they would be willing to take steps to prepare and protect themselves from the disease on a 7-point scale. Nearly 49 percent of participants said they would be relatively unlikely (i.e., provided a rating below the midpoint of the scale) to take steps to protect themselves if the mortality rate were at the 3 percent level. Stepwise multiple regression including the aforementioned predictors showed that three variables accounted for unique variance in participantsâ€™ levels of current preparedness: COVID-19 fear/anxiety, posttraumatic stress (as measured by the IES-R), and hope. Implications of these results are briefly discussed in the context of raising preparedness given that future public health crises are likely inevitable.

"Using forecasting to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on passenger air transport demand","Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic caused a drastic drop in passenger air transport demand due to two forces: supply restriction and demand depression. In order for airlines to recover, the key is to identify which force they are fighting against. We propose a method for separating the two forces of COVID-19 and evaluating the respective impact on demand. Our method involves dividing passengers into different segments based on passenger characteristics, simulating different scenarios, and predicting demand for each passenger segment in each scenario. Comparing the predictions with each other and with the real situation, we quantify the impact of COVID-19 associated with the two forces, respectively. We apply our method to a dataset from Air France?KLM and show that from March 1st to May 31st 2020, the pandemic caused demand at the airline to drop 40.3% on average for passengers segmented based on age and purpose of travel. The 57.4% of this decline is due to demand depression, whereas the other 42.6% is due to supply restriction. In addition, we find that the impact of COVID-19 associated with each force varies between passenger segments. The demand depression force impacted business passengers between age 41 and 60 the most, and it impacted leisure passengers between age 20 and 40 the least. The opposite result holds for the supply restriction force. We give suggestions on how airlines can plan their recovery using our results and how other industries can use our evaluation method.","Li, Xishu, de Groot, Maurits, BÃ¤ck, Thomas","https://doi.org/10.1111/deci.12549","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Decision Sciences; n/a(n/a), 2021.; Publication details: Decision Sciences; n/a(n/a), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19516,""
"Analysis of the influence factors of online teaching on the psychological status of the students in Vocational Colleges during the epidemic of COVID-19","Objective: To understand the psychological status and influencing factors of college students during the online teaching under the COVID-19 outbreak, so as to provide scientific basis for the mental health education of the population group in the future. Methods: Using the method of stratified cluster sampling and self-compiled questionnaire, the students of a vocational college in Hebei province were investigated by network questionnaire. Results: Among the 4827 college students surveyed, 1138 showed anxiety, with a detection rate of 23.6%. The detection rate of depression was 10.7% in 516 patients. The incidence of anxiety was 21.4% in boys and 24.6% in girls (chi2=6.024,P=0.014);The incidence of depression was 9.4% in boys and 11.3% in girls (chi 2=4.248, {mathrm {P}}=0.039);The results of the unconditioned Logistic regression showed that: female and senior students with poor hardware and network conditions, dissatisfaction with online teaching, difficulty in completing homework, and poor self-control were more likely to suffer from anxiety. The OR values(95% CI)were 0.646(0.590sim0.706),0.899(0.853sim0.946), 0.822(0.752sim0.899), 1.151(1.019sim1.301), 1.221(1.144sim1.303), and 0.867(0.840sim0.895), respectively. And female students with poor hardware and network conditions, dissatisfaction with online teaching, difficulty in completing assignments, and poor self-control were more likely to suffer from depression. The OR values(95% CI) were 0.863 (0.757sim0.985), 0.841(0.739sim0.956), 1.243(1.059sim1.460), 1.059(1.012sim1.107) and 0.904(0.864sim0.946), respectively. Conclusion: The psychological problems of anxiety and depression in college students during online teaching should not be ignored.

"Adolescents' assessments of consequences of the pandemic after one year of COVID-19Â restrictions; Ungdoms opplevelser av konsekvenser av pandemien etter ett Ã¥r med covid-19-restriksjoner","BACKGROUND: We have obtained knowledge of how the COVID-19Â pandemic affected the lives of adolescents immediately after the pandemic arrived in Norway. However, we know little about adolescents' experiences from the pandemic over time, and whether sociodemographic factors and infection rates at the municipality level play a role. MATERIAL AND METHOD: We used questionnaire data from 106Â 448Â lower and upper secondary school pupils who took part in the Ungdata survey in 167Â municipalities in the spring of 2021 (response rate 76Â %). The adolescents' responses regarding their experiences during the pandemic were collated with statistics on infection rates at the municipality level. We performed a Chi-square test and multilevel analyses to investigate predictors of adolescents' experiences. RESULTS: A total of 49Â % responded that the COVID-19Â pandemic affected their lives in a partly or very negative direction. Many reported negative changes in peer relationships, family relationships and mental health, but some also reported positive changes. Girls, older adolescents, those with a low socioeconomic background and those living in municipalities with a higher prevalence of infection reported more negative consequences. INTERPRETATION: Most adolescents reported that the pandemic has had more negative than positive consequences. Girls, older adolescents, those with a low socioeconomic background and those living in municipalities with a higher rate of infection may be especially affected by the negative effects of the pandemic.","Ulset, Vidar Sandsaunet; Bakken, Anders; von Soest, Tilmann","https://dx.doi.org/10.4045/tidsskr.21.0335","","Country: NO; NORUEGA; NORWAY; NORUEGA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen;1412021 09 28.; Publication details: Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen;1412021 09 28.; COVID-19; Pandemics; Adolescent; Female; Humans; Mental Health; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19518,""
"Multilevel determinants of COVID-19 vaccination uptake among South Asian ethnic minorities in Hong Kong: cross-sectional online survey","BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to have a disproportionate effect on ethnic minorities. Across countries, greater vaccine hesitancy was observed among ethnic minorities. After excluding foreign domestic helpers, South Asians make up the largest proportion of ethnic minorities in Hong Kong. It is necessary to plan for COVID-19 vaccination promotion that caters to unique needs of South Asians in Hong Kong. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccination uptake among a sample of South Asians in Hong Kong. We examined the effects of factors including socio-demographics and all three levels of factors based on the socio-ecological model. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted on May 1-31, 2021. Participants were South Asian people aged 18 years or above living in Hong Kong, able to comprehend English, Hindi, Nepali or Urdu, and having access to a smartphone. Three community-based organizations (CBOs) providing services to South Asians in Hong Kong facilitated the data collection. CBO staff posted the study information in the WhatsApp groups involving South Asian clients, and invited them to participate an online survey. Logistic regression models were fit for data analysis. RESULTS: Among 245 participants, 33.1% (n=81) had taken up at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccination [one dose: n=62 (25.2%), and both doses: n=19 (7.9%)]. After adjusted for significant background characteristics, cultural and religious reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy were associated with lower COVID-19 vaccination uptake (AOR: 0.83, 95%CI: 0.71, 0.97, P=.02). On individual-level, having more positive attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination (AOR: 1.31, 95%CI: 1.10, 1.55, P=.002), perceived support from significant others (AOR: 1.29, 95%CI: 1.03, 1.60, P=.03), and perceived higher behavioral control to receive COVID-19 vaccination (AOR: 2.63, 95%CI: 1.65, 4.19, P<.001) were associated with higher COVID-19 vaccination uptake, while a negative association was found between negative attitudes and the dependent variable (AOR: 0.73, 95%CI: 0.62, 0.85, P<.001). Knowing more peers who had taken up COVID-19 vaccination was also associated with higher uptake (AOR: 1.39, 95%CI; 1.11, 1.74, P=.01). On interpersonal-level, higher exposure to information about deaths and other serious conditions caused by COVID-19 vaccination was associated with lower uptake (AOR: 0.54, 95%CI: 0.33, 0.86, P=.01). CONCLUSIONS: One third (81/245) of our participants received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccination. Cultural or religious reasons, perceptions, information exposure on social media, and influence of peers were determinants of COVID-19 vaccination uptake among South Asians. Future program should engage community groups, champions and faith leaders, and develop culturally competent interventions.","Singh, Akansha; Lai, Angel Hor Yan; Wang, Jingxuan; Asim, Saba; Chan, Paul Shing-Fong; Wang, Zixin; Yeoh, Eng Kiong","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/31707","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Public Health Surveill;2021 Oct 12.; Publication details: JMIR Public Health Surveill;2021 Oct 12.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19519,""
"Tracking Self-reported Symptoms and Medical Conditions on Social Media During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Infodemiological Study","BACKGROUND: Harnessing health-related data posted on social media in real time can offer insights into how the pandemic impacts the mental health and general well-being of individuals and populations over time. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to obtain information on symptoms and medical conditions self-reported by non-Twitter social media users during the COVID-19 pandemic, to determine how discussion of these symptoms and medical conditions changed over time, and to identify correlations between frequency of the top 5 commonly mentioned symptoms post and daily COVID-19 statistics (new cases, new deaths, new active cases, and new recovered cases) in the United States. METHODS: We used natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to identify symptom- and medical condition-related topics being discussed on social media between June 14 and December 13, 2020. The sample posts were geotagged by NetBase, a third-party data provider. We calculated the positive predictive value and sensitivity to validate the classification of posts. We also assessed the frequency of health-related discussions on social media over time during the study period, and used Pearson correlation coefficients to identify statistically significant correlations between the frequency of the 5 most commonly mentioned symptoms and fluctuation of daily US COVID-19 statistics. RESULTS: Within a total of 9,807,813 posts (nearly 70% were sourced from the United States), we identified a discussion of 120 symptom-related topics and 1542 medical condition-related topics. Our classification of the health-related posts had a positive predictive value of over 80% and an average classification rate of 92% sensitivity. The 5 most commonly mentioned symptoms on social media during the study period were anxiety (in 201,303 posts or 12.2% of the total posts mentioning symptoms), generalized pain (189,673, 11.5%), weight loss (95,793, 5.8%), fatigue (91,252, 5.5%), and coughing (86,235, 5.2%). The 5 most discussed medical conditions were COVID-19 (in 5,420,276 posts or 66.4% of the total posts mentioning medical conditions), unspecified infectious disease (469,356, 5.8%), influenza (270,166, 3.3%), unspecified disorders of the central nervous system (253,407, 3.1%), and depression (151,752, 1.9%). Changes in posts in the frequency of anxiety, generalized pain, and weight loss were significant but negatively correlated with daily new COVID-19 cases in the United States (r=-0.49, r=-0.46, and r=-0.39, respectively; P<.05). Posts on the frequency of anxiety, generalized pain, weight loss, fatigue, and the changes in fatigue positively and significantly correlated with daily changes in both new deaths and new active cases in the United States (r ranged=0.39-0.48; P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 and symptoms of anxiety were the 2 most commonly discussed health-related topics on social media from June 14 to December 13, 2020. Real-time monitoring of social media posts on symptoms and medical conditions may help assess the population's mental health status and enhance public health surveillance for infectious disease.","Ding, Qinglan; Massey, Daisy; Huang, Chenxi; Grady, Connor B; Lu, Yuan; Cohen, Alina; Matzner, Pini; Mahajan, Shiwani; Caraballo, CÃ©sar; Kumar, Navin; Xue, Yuchen; Dreyer, Rachel; Roy, Brita; Krumholz, Harlan M","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/29413","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Public Health Surveill;7(9): e29413, 2021 09 28.; Publication details: JMIR Public Health Surveill;7(9): e29413, 2021 09 28.; COVID-19/epidemiology; Pandemics; Public Health Surveillance/methods; Self Report; Social Media/statistics & numerical data; Adult; Female; Humans; Male; United States/epidemiology; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19520,""

Orv Hetil. 22021; 162(42): 1671-1677. Summary. Several patients with COVID-19 infection report prolonged complaints after recovery and many of them suffer from persistent cough, dyspnea, chest pain and shortness of breath regardless of whether the coronavirus caused mild or more severe symptoms. They complain of severe fatigue and weakness while others grizzle about gastrointestinal complaints, headache, depression, loss of sense of smell and taste. Numerous studies describe that the infection can affect lung function even in months and coronavirus infection can be detectable in previously healthy lungs by taking a control chest CT scan three months after recovery. Therefore, chest follow-up is required after the infection if the patient has prolonged complaints or if the disease has caused pneumonia. In addition to the currently operating inpatient respiratory rehabilitation, there is also a need for an outpatient extension of treatment to achieve complete recovery in patients without further hospitalization. For those patients who have had the COVID-19 infection complex rehabilitation can improve their workload, quality of life, improves their respiratory function values, reduces their complaints and also improves their physical and mental condition. The aim of our summary research is to review what COVID-19 outpatient rehabilitation programs have been initiated for patients who went through coronavirus infection on international and domestic scenes.

"Efficacy of a Low-threshold, Culturally-Sensitive Group Psychoeducation Programme for Asylum Seekers (LoPe): study protocol for a multicentre randomised controlled trial","INTRODUCTION: Despite high levels of mental distress, accessing psychological treatment is difficult for asylum seekers in Western host countries due to a lack of knowledge about mental disorders, and the health system, as well as due to cultural and language barriers. This study aims to investigate whether brief culturally sensitive and transdiagnostic psychoeducation is effective in increasing mental health literacy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study is a parallel two-group randomised controlled trial with 1:1 individual allocation to either culturally sensitive, low-threshold psychoeducation ('Tea Garden' (TG)) or a waitlist (WL) control group. It takes place at four study sites in Germany. A total of 166 adult asylum seekers who report at least mild mental distress will be randomly assigned. The TG consists of two 90 min group sessions and provides information about mental distress, resources and mental health services in a culturally sensitive manner. The primary outcome is the percentage of participants in the TG, as compared with the WL, achieving an increase in knowledge concerning symptoms of mental disorders, individual resources and mental healthcare from preintervention to postintervention. The further trajectory will be assessed 2 and 6 months after the end of the intervention. Secondary outcomes include changes in mental distress, openness towards psychotherapy and resilience. Furthermore, healthcare utilisation and economics will be assessed at all assessment points. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by the Ethics Commission of the German Psychological Society (ref: WeiseCornelia2019-10-18VA). Results will be disseminated via presentations, publication in international journals and national outlets for clinicians. Furthermore, intervention materials will be available, and the existing network will be used to disseminate and implement the interventions into routine healthcare.

"Improving primary health care quality for refugees and asylum seekers: A systematic review of interventional approaches","BACKGROUND: It has been widely acknowledged that refugees are at risk of poorer health outcomes, spanning mental health and general well-being. A common point of access to health care for the migrant population is via the primary health care network in the country of resettlement. This review aims to synthesize the evidence of primary health care interventions to improve the quality of health care provided to refugees and asylum seekers. METHODS: A systematic review was undertaken, and 55 articles were included in the final review. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews was used to guide the reporting of the review, and articles were managed using a reference-management software (Covidence). The findings were analysed using a narrative empirical synthesis. A quality assessment was conducted for all the studies included. RESULTS: The interventions within the broad primary care setting could be organized into four categories, that is, those that focused on developing the skills of individual refugees/asylum seekers and their families; skills of primary health care workers; system and/or service integration models and structures; and lastly, interventions enhancing communication services. Promoting effective health care delivery for refugees, asylum seekers and their families is a complex challenge faced by primary care professionals, the patients themselves and the communication between them. CONCLUSION: This review highlights the innovative interventions in primary care promoting refugee health. Primary care interventions mostly focused on upskilling doctors, with a paucity of research exploring the involvement of other health care members. Further research can explore the involvement of interprofessional team members in providing effective refugee/migrant health. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: Patient and public involvement was explored in terms of interventions designed to improve health care delivery for the humanitarian migrant population, that is, specifically refugees and asylum seekers.","P Iqbal, Maha; Walpola, Ramesh; Harris-Roxas, Ben; Li, Jiadai; Mears, Stephen; Hall, John; Harrison, Reema","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/hex.13365","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Health Expect;2021 Oct 15.; Publication details: Health Expect;2021 Oct 15.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19523,""
"Prevalence of and risk factors for depressive and anxiety symptoms in a large sample of Chinese adolescents in the post-COVID-19 era","Background:  Depressive and anxiety symptoms are widespread among adolescents today, creating a large social problem. However, few previous studies have addressed depression and anxiety among adolescents in Chinese cohorts. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of and risk factors for depressive and anxiety symptoms among Chinese middle school adolescent students in the post-COVID-19 era. Methods A total of 22380 middle school students from Jiangsu Province were surveyed online, and their general demographic data were collected. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was used to assess depressive symptoms, and the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale was used to measure anxiety symptoms. Results Of these participants (aged 12â€“17 years), 25.6% had depressive symptoms, 26.9% had anxiety symptoms, and 20.6% had a combination of depression and anxiety symptoms. The prevalence of depressive symptoms was higher in female adolescents (27.6%) than in male adolescents (23.7%;<U+03C7> 2  = 45.479, P=0.000), and the proportion with anxiety symptoms was higher among female adolescents (28.6%) than among male adolescents (25.4%;<U+03C7> 2  = 29.390, P=0.000). Furthermore, binary logistic regression analysis showed that gender, region, and parental relationship were significantly associated with depressive symptoms among adolescents, while age, gender, region, and parental relationship were significantly associated with anxiety symptoms. Conclusions Our findings demonstrated that the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms in Chinese adolescents are high. Female gender, urban region, and poor parental relationship may be risk factors for depressive and anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, policy makers, schools, and families should pay more attention to the psychological health of adolescents.","Zhang, Xiaobin, Yang, Haidong, Zhang, Jing, Yang, Man, Yuan, Nian, Liu, Junjie","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-961556/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19524,""

"Natural Environments, Psychosocial Health, and Health Behaviors during COVID-19 â€“ A Scoping Review","The COVID-19 outbreak has led to major restrictions globally, affecting peopleâ€™s psychosocial health and their health behaviors. Thus, the purpose of this scoping review was to summarize the available research regarding the nature-health-association in the COVID-19 context. Keywords related to natural environments and COVID-19 were combined to conduct a systematic online search in six major databases. Eligibility criteria were a) published since 2020 with data collected in the COVID-19 context b) peer-reviewed, c) original empirical data collected on human participants, d) investigated the association between natural environments and psychosocial health or health behavior, and e) English, German, or Scandinavian language. Out of 8,568 articles being obtained, we identified 82 relevant articles representing 80 unique studies. Most studies focused on adults in the general population and were predominantly conducted in the USA and Europe. Overall, the findings tentatively indicate that nature mitigates the impact of COVID-19 on psychological health and physical activity. Through thematic analysis of the extracted data, three primary themes were identified: 1) type of nature assessed, 2) psychosocial health and health behaviors investigated, and 3) heterogeneity in the nature-health relationship. Research gaps in the COVID-19 context were identified regarding I) nature characteristics that promote psychosocial health and health behaviors, II) investigations of digital and virtual nature, III) psychological constructs relating to mental health promotion, IV) health behaviors other than physical activity, V) underlying mechanisms regarding heterogeneity in the nature-health relationship based on human, nature, and geographic characteristics, and VI) research focusing on vulnerable groups. Overall, natural environments demonstrate considerable potential in buffering the impact of stressful events on a population level on mental health. However, future research is warranted to fill the mentioned research gaps and to examine the long-term effects of nature exposure during COVID-19.","Nigg, Carina, Petersen, Evi, MacIntyre, Tadhg","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/a9unf","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19526,""
"Effectiveness of the digital socio-emotional competence training Zirkus Empathico in preschoolers: A randomized controlled trial","The development of socio-emotional competencies (SEC) has proven key for school and life success as well as for preventing mental illness. Digital SEC trainings create new ways to strengthen childrenâ€™s mental health especially in times of disrupted childcare and subsequent increase of mental health problems due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the potential benefits, few studies examined the effectiveness of digital SEC trainings in young children. In a six-week study, we tested the digital SEC training Zirkus Empathico with four- to six-year-old typically developing children (N = 60) using parent and child SEC ratings as well as EEG. The registered primary outcome was empathy (GEM, EMK 3-6);secondary outcomes included emotion knowledge (EMK 3-6), prosocial behavior (SDQ), reduction of problematic behaviors (SDQ), and childrenâ€™s neural sensitivity to facial expressions quantified with early (P1, N170) and late (P3) event-related potentials. Compared to age- and gender-matched controls (N = 30), the Zirkus Empathico group (N = 30) showed increases in empathy, emotion recognition, prosocial behavior and reduced behavioral problems post-training and increases in empathy in a three months follow-up. Zirkus Empathico participants had larger P3 amplitudes for happy vs. neutral facial expressions, whereas larger P3 amplitudes for angry vs. neutral facial expressions were found for controls. Given the training groupâ€™s improvements across behavioral measures, Zirkus Empathico may be a promising digital SEC training. EEG results seem to corroborate behavioral findings: The training group allocated more neural resources toward happy faces potentially indicative of training-induced, accelerated maturation regarding the regulation of positive emotional states.","Naumann, Sandra, Bayer, Mareike, Kirst, Simone, van der Meer, Elke, Dziobek, Isabel","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/dkxp9","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19527,""
"The impact of COVID-19 on people ageing with an intellectual disability in Ireland: Protocol for a follow-up survey (preprint)","Background :Â  The COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns have had a dramatic impact on many people, but individuals with an intellectual disability, given the prevalence of congregate living and high levels of co-morbid conditions, may be particularly vulnerable at this time. A prior initial survey of participants of the Intellectual Disability Supplement to the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (IDS-TILDA) found that, despite a majority of participants being tested, only a small proportion had tested positive for COVID-19. Furthermore, despite some reporting positive aspects to the lockdown, a similar proportion were experiencing stress or anxiety during the pandemic. The pandemic and lockdowns have continued, and it is possible that experiences and consequences have changed over time. Aim : To explore over time and in greater depth the impact of COVID-19 and associated lockdowns and to further establish rates of infection, rates of vaccination and participantsâ€™ experiences. Methods : A structured questionnaire for people with intellectual disability participating in the IDS-TILDA longitudinal study, to be administered by telephone/video in summer 2021. Where participants are unable to respond independently, a proxy respondent will be invited to either assist the participant or answer questions on their behalf. This questionnaire will include questions from the first COVID-19 questionnaire, with extra questions assessing â€œlong COVIDâ€ (i.e. COVID-19 lasting for 12 weeks or longer), infection control behaviours, changes in mental health, social contacts and loneliness, frailty, healthcare, and incidence of vaccination. Impact : The results of this survey will be used to inform healthcare provision for people with intellectual disability during the latter stages of the lockdown and into the future.","McCarron, Mary, Allen, Andrew, McCausland, Darren, Haigh, Margaret, Luus, Retha, Bavussantakath, Fathima Rosmin, Sheerin, Fintan, Mulryan, Niamh, Burke, Eilish, McGlinchey, Eimear, Flannery, Fidelma, McCallion, Philip","https://doi.org/10.12688/hrbopenres.13340.2","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19528,""
"Impact of Sequelae Resulting From the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health: a Cross-sectional Study in Japan and Sweden","Background:  Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, people have undermined their mental health. It has been reported that sequelae resulting from COVID-19 occur at a certain rate. However, information on the mental health of people with sequelae is limited. Thus, this study investigated the relationship between sequelae resulting from COVID-19 and mental health. Methods: : Design of the present study was an International and collaborative cross-sectional study in Japan and Sweden from March 18 to June 15, 2021. The analyzed data included 763 adults who participated in online surveys in Japan and Sweden and submitted complete data. In addition to demographic data including terms related to COVID-19, psychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress were measured by using the fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), General Anxiety Disorder-7 item (GAD-7), and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). Results: : of the 135 COVID-19 survivors among the 763 total participants, 40.7% had COVID-19-related sequelae. First, the results of the Bonferroni-corrected Mann Whitney U test showed that the group infected SARS-CoV-2 with sequelae scored significantly higher than those without sequelae and the non-infected group on all clinical symptom scales (P = .001). Next, there was a significant difference that incidence rates of clinical-significant psychiatric symptoms among each group from the results of the Chi-squared test (P = .001). Finally, the results of the multivariate logistic model revealed that the risk of having more severe clinical symptoms were 2.48â€“4.64 times higher among participants with sequelae. Conclusion:  The results showed that approximately half had sequelae after COVID-19 and that the sequelae of COVID-19 may lead to the onset of mental disorders. Trial registration: The ethics committee of Chiba University approved this cross-sectional study (approval number: 4129). However, as no medical intervention was conducted, a clinical trial registration was not necessary.","Matsumoto, Kazuki, Hamatani, Sayo, Shimizu, Eiji, KÃ¤ll, Anton, Andersson, Gerhard","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-798323/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19529,""
"The Cost of Caring: Compassion Fatigue Among Peer Workers in Overdose Response Settings in British Columbia","Background:  The drug toxicity crisis has had dramatic impacts upon communities of people who use substances. Peer workers, individuals with lived/living experience of substance use who work in overdose response settings, are particularly susceptible to negative impacts on wellbeing caused by this crisis. Coupled with the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic including reduced capacity and hours of overdose prevention services and physical distancing regulations, the burden placed upon peers is large. However, these mental health impacts have yet to be studied and measured. Methods The Professional Quality of Life Scale survey (Version 5) was taken by 47 peer workers between September 2020 and March 2021 to assess compassion satisfaction and compassion fatigue. It was administered as a part of a larger survey administered by peer research assistants - to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions identified and implemented through a peer-led project. Some questions from the tool were also asked prior to implementation of the intervention (September 2020). Participants were recruited by their organizational managers and paid a $25 honorarium. Results Our study uncovered a HIGH mean score for compassion satisfaction, a LOW mean score for burnout, and a MEDIUM mean score for secondary traumatic stress among peers working in overdose response settings in British Columbia. We also found changes before and after implementation of the intervention. After implementation, peer workers felt more satisfied from their work, more connected to others, less worn out and were less affected by the traumatic stress of those they help. Conclusion Although peers derive significant pleasure and fulfillment from their jobs, i.e., compassion satisfaction, they also face considerable feelings of overwhelmingness, i.e. burnout, and stress due to continuous exposure to the trauma of the people they support, i.e. secondary traumatic stress. These results lay the groundwork for further research on the intersectional factors contributing to negative mental health impacts upon peer workers and highlight potential strategies that bolster the fulfillment they derive from their jobs.","Mamdani, Zahra, McKenzie, Sophie, Ackermann, Emma, Voyer, Rayne, Cameron, Fred, Scott, Tracy, Pauly, Bernadette, Buxton, Jane","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-957588/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19530,""

"Fear of COVID-19, Internet Addiction, Learning Burnout, and Psychological Health On Teenagers in China at Post-Pandemic Era: A Serial Mediation Model","Background:  The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic produces a long-term effect on adolescent psychological health. There were two objectives of this study: (1) To compare psychological outcomes between an early stage of pandemic and post-pandemic era among junior high and high school students in China;(2) To investigate how COVID-19 fear impacts psychological health through a serial mediation of Internet addiction and learning burnout. Methods: : Two cross-sectional online surveys were conducted among Chinese adolescents at April 2020 and at April 2021, respectively. Psychological consequence was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). In addition, influencing factors were assessed by the Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S), Internet Addiction Test (IAT), and Maslach Burnout Inventory-Student Survey (MBI-SS). Results: : Our sample comprised 501 junior high school students and 540 high school students. There was a significant increase in symptoms of depression (<U+03C7> 2 = 7.03, P &lt; 0.01), anxiety (<U+03C7> 2 = 35.50, P &lt; 0.01), and stress (<U+03C7> 2 = 13.60, P &lt; 0.01) at post-pandemic era compared with an early stage of COVID-19. Importantly, Internet addiction and learning burnout were identified the serial mediators between fear of COVID-19 and psychological health (ÃŸ = 0.02, 95% CI = 0.01, 0.03). Conclusions: : During the post-pandemic era in China, an increased number of junior high and high school students' psychological health was affected compared with the number during the pandemic. Furthermore, fear of COVID-19 influenced psychological health through first Internet addiction and then learning burnout.","Hu, Rui, Ye, Maolin, Lai, Bingbing, Luo, Fen, Yang, Minyi, Yuan, Jinua, Tao, QIan","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-955207/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19532,""
"Relationship Between Quality of Life and Fear of COVID-19 in Patients With Myocardial Infarction (Case Study: Shahid Madani Cardiac Hospital, Tabriz, Iran)","Background:  Quality of life is one of the most important concepts in the fields of health and development, and the study of its related factors can play an effective role in strengthening the quality of life. COVID-19 is one of the emerging crises in the world, and fear of it can affect the quality of life of people. Purpose:  The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between quality of life and fear of COVID-19 in patients with myocardial infarction. Methods: : In this study, we administered WHOQOL-BREF (World Health Organization quality of life questionnaire) and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) to 200 patients with myocardial infarction admitted to the hospital from February to April 2021. Then, we calculated the correlation between the quality of life and fear of COVID-19. Results: : The results of this study showed a moderate to high score in all domains of QoL and overall QoL among patients. The mean score of fear of COVID-19 was lower than average level. The research revealed that there was a negative correlation between fear of COVID-19 and physical health, environmental health, and overall quality of life (p &lt; 0.05), but there was not a significant relationship between fear of coronavirus and psychological health and social relationships (p &gt; 0.05). Furthermore, there were significant correlations between quality of life and sociodemographic variables including gender, age, marital status, and level of education. So that, female, widow(er), uneducated, and older patients had a lower quality of life. Conclusions: : Since the quality of life is one of the main indicators of health, managers must take strategies to improve the quality of life of people, especially patients. One of the measures that they can take is to reduce the fear of COVID-19 among patients by taking wise strategies.","Golabi, Fatemeh, Aghdam, Mohammad Bagher Alizadeh, Mazraehshadi, Mir Mojtaba Hosseini, Akbarian, Hamed","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-942305/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19533,""
"Psychological Distress, Fear, and Coping Strategies among Citizens and Residents in Saudi Arabia During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background:  COVID-19 caused the worst international public health crisis, accompanied by major global economic downturns, mass-scale job losses, which impacted on the psychosocial wellbeing of the worldwide population. This study examined factors associated with psychosocial distress, fear of COVID-19 and coping strategies amongst the general population in Saudi Arabia. Methods: : A cross-sectional study was conducted using an anonymous online questionnaire. Multivariate logistic regressions were used;Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) was reported. Results: : Among 803 participants, 70 %(n=556), were females and the median age was 27 years;35% (n=278), were frontline or essential service workers;24% (n=195), reported comorbid conditions including mental health illness. Factors associated with moderate to high levels of psychological distress were: youth (18 - 29 years) (AOR 3.35, 95% CIs 2.06 - 5.44), females (2.59, 1.60 - 4.19), non-Saudi nationals (2.17, 1.11 - 4.26), change in employment (2.9, 1.73 - 4.87), negative financial impact (2.14, 1.29-3.56), having comorbidities (2.67, 1.47 - 4.87), and current smoking (2.87, 1.55 - 5.33). Being ex-smokers (3.72, 1.14 - 12.14) and change in employment (3.42, 1.91 - 6.11) were associated with higher levels of fear of COVID-19. People whose financial situation was impacted and who had contact with known/suspected cases (1.63, 1.12-2.38) had low medium to high resilient coping. Conclusions: : People in Saudi Arabia were at a higher risk of psychosocial distress and fear along with low resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic, warranting urgent attention from healthcare providers and policymakers, to provide specific mental health support strategies for their wellbeing currently and to avoid a post-pandemic mental health crisis.","Alharbi, Talal Ali, AlQurashi, Alaa, Mahmud, Ilias, Alharbi, Rayan Jafnan, Islam, Sheikh Mohammed Shariful, Almustanyir, Sami, Maklad, Ahmed Essam, AlSarraj, Ahmad, Mughaiss, Lujain Nedhal, Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar, Ahmed, Ahmed Ali, Barry, Mazin, Ghozy, Sherief, Alabdan, Lulwah Ibrahim, Alif, Sheikh, Sultana, Farhana, Salehin, Masudus, Banik, Biswajit, Cross, Wendy, Rahman, Muhammad Aziz","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-887072/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19534,""
"An investigation of quality assurance practices in online English classes for young learners","PurposeThe main purpose of this study was to explore the quality assurance practices in teaching English to young learners (TEYL) settings during the sudden switch to digital education. The investigation of the issue was conducted through triple perspectives including institutional, teacher and learner dimensions.Design/methodology/approachA partially mixed sequential dominant status design (P4) method was adopted in this study. The qualitative and quantitative data collection techniques were incorporated, and the data were triangulated to ensure validity. Additionally, trustworthiness, credibility and transferability procedures were strictly followed for the qualitative data.FindingsThe findings of this study revealed that the investigated institution in this study reacted this process swiftly and made the benefit of young and technology literate teachers while experiencing certain difficulties. On the other hand, teachers were confused in this process, and they showed signs that they were affectively influenced. The most prominent difficulty experienced by the teachers was the integration of four language skills to their teaching and assessment. A small number of the learners in this study revealed that they had negative attitudes toward online education, which was thought to be stemming from the lack of technological equipment and a suitable learning environment.Originality/valueTo the best of the authorsâ€™ knowledge, the present study is one of the first studies to explore quality assurance in TEYL in relation to distance education practices.

"â€œTaming the black elephantâ€: assessing and managing the impacts of COVID-19 on public universities in Australia","Purpose: The Australian higher education sector faces severe risks from the consequences of COVID-19. This paper aims to explore these risks, their immediate impacts and the likely future impacts. The authors specifically focus on the institutional financial and social risks arising from the global pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: The authors collect data using the 2019 annual reports of the 37 Australian public universities and relevant media contributions. The findings of identified sector change are interpreted through Laughlinâ€™s organisational change diagnosis. Findings: The sector confronts significant financial and social risks because of its over-reliance on income from fee-paying onshore overseas students resulting in universities primarily undertaking morphostatic changes. These risks include job losses, changing employment conditions, mental health issues for students, scholars, other staff, including casual staff, online learning shortfalls and the student expectations of their university experience. The study reveals how many of these risks are the inevitable consequence of the â€œaccountingisationâ€ of Australian public universities. Practical implications: Despite material exposure, the universities provide only limited disclosure of the extent of the risks associated with increasing dependence on overseas student fees to 31 December 2019. The analysis highlights fake accountability and distorted transparency to users of audited financial statements â€“ a major limitation of university annual reports. Originality/value: Research on the Australian higher education sector has mainly focussed on the impact of policies and changes. The public disclosure of critical risks taken by these universities are now addressed. Â© 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Carnegie, G.

"A model of business intelligence on cloud for managing SMEs in COVID-19 pandemic (Case: Iranian SMEs)","Purpose: The purpose of this study was to demonstrate a cloud business intelligence model for industrial SMEs. An initial model was developed to accomplish this, followed by validation and finalization of the cloud business intelligence model. Additionally, this research employs a mixed-techniques approach, including both qualitative and quantitative methods. This paper aims to achieve the following objectives: (1) Recognize the Cloud business intelligence concepts. (2) Identify the role of cloud BI in SMEs. (3) Identify the factors that affect the design and presenting a Cloud business intelligence model based on critical factors affecting SMEs during pandemic COVID-19. (4) Discuss the importance of Cloud BI in pandemic COVID-19 for SMEs. (5) Provide managerial implications for using Cloud BI effectively in Iranâ€™s SMEs. Design/methodology/approach: In the current study, an initial model was first proposed, and the cloud business intelligence model was then validated and finalized. Moreover, this study uses a mixed-methods design in which both qualitative and quantitative methods are used. The fuzzy Delphi Method has been applied for parameter validation purposes, and eventually, the Cloud business intelligence model has been presented through exploiting the interpretive structural modeling. The partial least squares method was also applied to validate the model. Data were also analyzed using the MAXQDA and Smart PLS software package. Findings: In this research, from the elimination of synonym and frequently repeated factors and classification of final factors, six main factors, 24 subfactors and 24 identifiers were discovered from the texts of the relevant papers and interviews conducted with 19 experts in the area of BI and Cloud computing. The main factors of our research include drivers, enablers, competencies, critical success factors, SME characteristics and adoption. The subfactors of included competitors pressure, decision-making time, data access, data analysis and calculations, budget, clear view, clear missions, BI tools, data infrastructure, information merging, business key sector, data owner, business process, data resource, data quality, IT skill, organizational preparedness, innovation orientation, SME characteristics, SME activity, SME structure, BI maturity, standardization, agility, balances between BI systems and business strategies. Then, the quantitative part continued with the fuzzy Delphi technique in which two factors, decision-making time and agility, were deleted in the first round, and the second round was conducted for the rest of the factors. In that step, 24 factors were assessed based on the opinions of 19 experts. In the second round, none of the factors were removed, and thus the Delphi analysis was concluded. Next, data analysis was carried out by building the structural self-interaction matrix to present the model. According to the results, adoptability is a first-level or dependent variable. Regarding the results of interpretive structural modeling (ISM), the variable of critical success factors is a second-level variable. Enablers, competencies and SME characteristics are the third-level and most effective variables of the model. Accordingly, the initial model of Cloud BI for SMEs is presented as follows: The results of ISM revealed the impact of SME characteristics on BI critical success factors and adoptability. Since this category was not an underlying category of BI;thus, it played the role of a moderating variable for the impact of critical success factors on adoptability in the final model. Research limitations/implications: Since this study is limited to about 100 SMEs in the north of Iran, results should be applied cautiously to SMEs in other countries. Generalizing the study's results to other industries and geographic regions should be done with care since management perceptions, and financial condition of a business vary significantly. Additionally, the topic of business intelligence in SMEs constrained the sample from the start since not all SMEs use business int lligence systems, and others are unaware of their advantages. BI tools enable the effective management of companies of all sizes by providing analytic data and critical performance indicators. In general, SMEs used fewer business intelligence technologies than big companies. According to studies, SMEs understand the value of simplifying their information resources to make critical business choices. Additionally, they are aware of the market's abundance of business intelligence products. However, many SMEs lack the technical knowledge necessary to choose the optimal tool combination. In light of the frequently significant investment required to implement BI approaches, a viable alternative for SMEs may be to adopt cloud computing solutions that enable organizations to strengthen their systems and information technologies on a pay-per-use basis while also providing access to cutting-edge BI technologies at a reasonable price. Practical implications: Before the implementation of Cloud BI in SMEs, condition of driver, competency and critical success factor of SMEs should also be considered. These will help to define the significant resources and skills that form the strategic edge and lead to the success of Cloud BI projects. Originality/value: Most of the previous studies have been focused on factors such as critical success factors in cloud business intelligence and cloud computing in small and medium-sized enterprises, cloud business intelligence adoption models, the services used in cloud business intelligence, the factors involved in acceptance of cloud business intelligence, the challenges and advantages of cloud business intelligence, and drivers and barriers to cloud business intelligence. None of the studied resources proposed any comprehensive model for designing and implementing cloud business intelligence in small and medium-sized enterprises;they only investigated some of the aspects of this issue.

"The feasibility and impact of online peer support on the well-being of higher education students","Purpose: Peer support has been identified as an important protective factor for mental health and overall well-being. The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of implementing an online peer support group and its impact on measures of well-being. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed-methods randomized controlled trial design was used to examine the feasibility and impact of online peer support. Comparisons in well-being were made between the online peer support group and an in-person peer support group and control group. Participants were randomly assigned to a control group or either a six-week in-person or online peer support group. All participants completed an online survey measuring constructs of well-being pre- and post-condition. Additionally, qualitative data regarding the benefits of peer support and in particular the efficacy of the online format were collected from participants. Analysis of variance and post hoc tests determined significant differences within and between the groups. Findings: Both the online and face-to-face peer support groups scored significantly higher on post-test measures of well-being than pre-test scores and control group scores. Qualitative narratives and significant quantitative findings supported the feasibility of peer support offered online. Post-condition outcomes showed that online peer support is as effective as in-person peer support for improving well-being. Originality/value: To the best of the authorsâ€™ knowledge, this study is the first of its kind to compare online and in-person peer support programs for students in higher education. The results have direct implications for higher education students and practitioners, especially at times when face-to-face support is not feasible.

"Exploring maintaining gains following therapy during the coronavirus pandemic with adults with an intellectual disability","Purpose: The novel coronavirus and associated mitigation efforts have caused significant increases in stress for adults with intellectual disabilities. Such increases in life stress predict an increased risk of relapse following psychological therapy. This contributes to the high global disease burden of common mental health difficulties. Therefore, this paper aims to explore service user experiences of maintaining gains following therapy within the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed-methods evaluation was completed in a psychology service based in the North of England which specialises in supporting adults with intellectual disabilities. Descriptive statistics and effect size calculations were used to examine therapeutic outcomes pre-therapy, post-therapy, and at follow-up. These findings informed a framework analysis of eight semi-structured interviews. Findings: Overall, outcome results improved post-therapy and regressed at follow-up. The framework analysis revealed facilitators to maintenance include a recollection of specific aspects of therapy and the regular utilisation of strategies and resources. Conversely, barriers to maintenance include a recollection focussed on personal outcome, a reliance on social support and an inability to remember therapy. Originality/value: This is the only study to the authorsâ€™ knowledge examining service user experiences of maintaining gains following therapy within the context of Covid-19. It is hoped that these findings will inform further research and be useful for services in preparing service users for discharge as the Covid-19 pandemic continues and moves towards the post-pandemic phase.

"The plight of migrants during COVID-19 and the impact of circular migration in India: a systematic review","As per the reports of WHO, the COVID-19, first reported in December 2019, put the whole world in an unprecedented crisis and lingering uncertainty with innumerable deaths, generalised economic depression, unemployment, quarantine, unavoidable lockdown, and travel-ban that was imposed globally as a necessity to tackle the pandemic. Among the populace, the migrants were found to be one of the most vulnerable groups in this lockdown, as their very livelihood came to a complete standstill. This review-paper aims to investigate in detail the multiple facets of adversities the migrants went through in India during the lockdown and the socio-psychological impact of circular migration. Following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, studies on migrant workers during COVID-19 and on circular migration were searched. Database searches on Scopus, PubMed, and PsychNet and manual searches on Google Scholar were carried out. From the initially identified 15,697 articles, 15 articles that met the inclusion criteria were chosen for review. The findings highlight the different plight of the migrants, who had the pressing need to head back home to safety despite the acute financial crisis and the travel problems. The poor quality of the relief camps with meagre rations and lack of facilities especially put the women and children in distress and generated a lot of psychosocial issues. The present study urges the mental health-care professionals to groom themselves for facing the challenges of a surge in mental illnesses by taking necessary measures. It also emphasises the need to establish a strong ethical alliance between the local population, health systems, local government mechanisms, and human rights associations in order to take a relook at the national migration policies.","Jesline, Joshy, Romate, John, Eslavath, Rajkumar, George Allen, Joshua","https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-021-00915-6","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Humanities & Social Sciences Communications; 8(1), 2021.; Publication details: Humanities & Social Sciences Communications; 8(1), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19542,""
"Perceived Stress of Cypriot College Students during COVID-19: The Predictive Role of Social Skills and Social Support","Background: Increased perceived stress is associated with physical and mental health problems. However, little is known about the social factors that influenced perceived stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we examined the relationship between social skills, perceived support from family and friends, and perceived stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, through a two-wave design. Methods: A group of 106 college students completed measures of social skills during the prepandemic period as well as of perceived social support and perceived stress 1 month into the implementation of the first lockdown in Cyprus. Results: Preexisting social skills and concurrent family support the predicted negatively perceived stress during the lockdown. Although several aspects of social skills were correlated negatively with perceived stress, only the ability to manage interpersonal conflicts and to effectively resolve disagreements negatively predicted perceived stress, suggesting that this skill may constitute a protective factor against perceived stress during stressful events. Perceived support during the pandemic, on the other hand, was not overall significantly predicted by one's social skills. Conclusions: Our study provides preliminary evidence about the relationship between interpersonal skills and perceived stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions targeting the development of conflict resolution skills seem to be promising in ameliorating the psychological stress associated with the pandemic. Â© 2021 The Author(s).

"The effects of immersive garden experience on the health care to elderly residents with mild-to-moderate cognitiveÂ impairment living in nursing homes after the COVID-19 pandemic","Elderly patients living in long-term care facilities have been restricted from leaving to comply with social distancing guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic. This has led to a worsening of disorders, such as anxiety and depression. This study aims to understand the health benefits of an immersive garden experience to elderly nursing home residents with mild-to-moderate cognitive impairments. Virtual reality devices were used to provide immersive gardenÂ experiences for the residents who were unable to go outside. The heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV) data of the participants of the participants were collected using biofeedback instruments, and changes in the low frequency/high frequency (LF/HF) and the standard deviation of the NN interval (SDNN) values caused by immersive garden experiences were discussed. The results show that the immersive garden experiences were beneficial to these elderly residents. Within 6Â min of completing the experiment, we found that the heart rates of participants had dropped slightly, while SDNN and HF values continued to rise. SDNN values before and after the experiment demonstrated a statistically significant improvement. Furthermore, participants expressed their satisfaction with the video intervention program. The results indicated that nursing homes can provide immersive landscape experiences to help increase HRV and SDNN of their elderly residents. This will not only help these residents recall beautiful memories of their past, but will also improve their quality of life.

"Tough Times, Extraordinary Care: A Critical Assessment of Chatbot-Based Digital Mental Healthcare Solutions for Older Persons to Fight Against Pandemics Like COVID-19","Pandemics like COVID-19 confine and isolate people due to the necessary physical distancing, lockdown or quarantine countermeasure, which can in particular deteriorate the social environment for older people. Chatbots are a significant part of COVID-19 countermeasures for providing digital mental health services to older people in order to â€˜keep them aliveâ€™ during the fight against this pandemic. This study performs a critical assessment of the state of the art and the research gaps regarding the topic and proposes high-level, strategic solutions to help researchers and practitioners speed up the corresponding project planning and mitigate the potential development risks. The design of mental health chatbots is grounded in the fields of psychology and culture and utilizes the most advanced information and communication technologies including conversational interfaces, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. A strong interdisciplinary and intercultural collaboration is essential to better understand the mental hardships of older people during such times and take effective measures to alleviate their suffering.

"Anxiety Detection During COVID-19 Using the Character Computing Ontology","The lifestyle changes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic increased the risk of suffering from anxiety and depression. We need the cooperation between psychologists and computer scientists to provide technology solutions to help mitigate negative mental well-being early on. CCOnto is an integrated ontology that models the interactions between behavior and character states and traits in specific situations following the framework of the inter-disciplinary domain of Character Computing. CCOnto is parts of an going research cooperation between computer scientists and psychologists for creating character-based interactive applications. The knowledge represented in the ontology is modular separating core knowledge from rules. In previous work, the rules were extracted from the literature. In this paper, we present an approach for generating rules from existing datasets. The main contribution of this paper is the generation of if/then rules from a dataset collected during the first lockdown. The rules are added to CCOnto in form of SWRL rules and used as a backend for an anxiety detection application. Â© 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Elaraby, N.; Bolock, A.

"Resilient Urban Open Public Spaces in During the Covid-19 Pandemic","The emergence of â€œCovid-19â€ placed the entire world at a loss on how to deal with health disasters. Lockdown measures, primarily instilled to help decrease the risk of contracting the disease, failed to take mental health issues into perspective and eventually lead to the magnification of psychological problems. With the decrease of lockdown measures, people were allowed to social distance, however, with no clear written rules, it was left either up to individuals to keep their distance or up to local authorities to try and enforce it. And that was when the concept of urban design was best challenged. The idea that the design of open public spaces (OPS) was not available to accommodate issues like health crisis became a point of concern. This paper aims to identify different practices enforced in open public place design during the pandemic, to try and limit social interaction and enforce social distancing, and their effect on the mental health of users, as well as focusing on ideas and strategies on how to better promote health and well-being, including psychosocial health, in open public spaces through resilient design.

"How Does the Citizensâ€™ Behavioral Intention to Use Digital Technology in Smart Cities Affect Their Mental Health During the Covid-19 Pandemic?","In the face of the Covid-19 pandemic, some cities around the world have adopted smart prevention and control measures based on digital technology, in addition to physical prevention and control means such as local closures, home isolation and wearing protective masks. Based on the context of smart cityâ€™s response to public health crisis in China, this study analyzed the effect of the behavioral intention to use digital technology (i.e., the health quick response code technology) on citizensâ€™ mental health. This study takes 789 respondents from Chinaâ€™s smart cities as research samples. The empirical results show that the behavioral intention to use digital technology can reduce the citizensâ€™ anxiety level. The negative effect of the behavioral intention to use digital technology on the anxiety level of citizens decreases as the increase of the Covid-19 severity.

"Understanding changes to children's connection to nature during the COVID-19 pandemic and implications for child well-being","Abstract While psychological connection to nature is known to be associated with both pro-environmental behaviours and well-being, there is an urgent need to extend this research to consider impacts from the COVID-19 lockdown period. Examining whether children's connection to nature changed during this period, identifying the drivers of these changes and determining the links between connection to nature and child well-being can each serve to guide post-lockdown initiatives to promote children's connection to nature. Three findings emerged from this UK sample of 376 families with young children. First, nearly two thirds of parents reported a change (most typically, an increase) in their child's connection to nature. Explanations for this increase included having more time, increased enjoyment of nature and increased awareness or interest in nature. Second, a third of children whose connection to nature decreased during the pandemic displayed increased problems of well-being?manifest as either ?acting out? (externalising problems) or sadness/anxiety (internalising problems). Third, an increase in connection to nature during the pandemic was more evident for children from affluent families than for their less affluent peers. While connecting to nature may be an effective means of addressing child problems of well-being, the divergent findings for children from different family backgrounds indicate that efforts to enhance connection to nature should focus on the barriers experienced by children from less affluent families.

"Anxiety, Fear, and Self-Efficacy in Pregnant Women in the United States During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention places pregnant women at an increased risk for severe illness compared to non-pregnant women (CDC, 2020). A systematic review of 49 peer-review studies on the relationship between disasters (e.g., terrorist attacks, environmental/chemical disasters, natural disasters) and pregnancy outcomes found that experiences during pregnancy had a negative impact on maternal mental health, which in turn had a negative influence on child development (Harville et al., 2010). [...]none of the studies looked at the relationship between increases in general anxiety and measures specific to the childbirth experience, such as increased childbirth fear and decreased childbirth self-efficacy, which may put pregnant women at even greater risk of negative childbirth experiences (Berentson-Shaw et al., 2009;Elvander et al., 2013). Additionally, more than 40% of the pregnant women in the study had already experienced non-COVID related complications during their pregnancy, which may itself have led to increased anxiety in the sample. [...]there is some evidence to suggest that in addition to state anxiety, both fear and negative expectations specific to childbirth are also significantly increased during this time.","Conrad, Megan","https://www.google.com/search?q=Anxiety,+Fear,+and+Self-Efficacy+in+Pregnant+Women+in+the+United+States+During+the+COVID-19+Pandemic","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of Prenatal & Perinatal Psychology & Health; 35(1):39-57, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Prenatal & Perinatal Psychology & Health; 35(1):39-57, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19555,""
"Developing digital approaches for adolescents and young adults with autism and learning disabilities: Tools to facilitate access and shared decision-making","Aims: Digital living is now an integral part of many children and young peopleâ€™s (CYP) everyday experience. Practitioners who work with them are increasingly focused on effectively deploying technology to help those with social, emotional and mental health (SEMH) needs. Throughout all aspects and phases of work, practitioners must adhere to legal and professional best practice standards in involving service users, person-centred working and in enhancing accessibility for all. Methods: Measures introduced to reduce the spread of Covid-19 triggered significant service delivery change in a specialist multi-disciplinary child and adolescent mental health service (CAMHS) team. The majority of assessment and intervention work moved to an online audio and web conferencing platform. A shared decision-making approach was developed to support service user understanding of online appointments and to giving informed consent, in line with the i-THRIVE Framework for system change (Wolpert et al., 2019). Three Guides were developed and distributed ahead of online appointments: Written, easy-read and video. Findings: Data collected within a Quality Improvement (QI) framework indicated that the Guides supported practitioners to prepare service users, as well as themselves, for digital working. The Guides supported service access, collaborative decision-making and increased CYP autonomy. Their introduction also led to conversations about equity and cultural responsiveness, as well as serving as a model for the development of aids to support shared decision-making for autism diagnostic assessments. Limitations: This paper outlines the first phase of the QI project with a small participant sample and requires further engagement with service users to review the use of Guides and shared decision-making decision aids. Conclusions: Digital approaches present new possibilities and are rapidly changing service delivery across CAMHS. The importance of involving service users in shared decision-making when developing digital practices must be held in mind as part of this change process.

"On the primacy of emotion: ""The order of things"" - From Aristotle, James, Darwin, Tomkins, To Ekman, Izard Boyle, And Akande","For centuries, emotion has been a conundrum for scholars because it punctuates, marks or changes magnitude of all major events in human and organizational lives. Each individual's human emotional experience is culturally constructed or socio-culturally created under specific conditions, with the involvement of other human agents or variables to the causal processes. To advance research, we draw from theories and philosophical thoughts across cultures, from ancient times to modern era. In that context, emotion is the sine qua non of the totality of YorÃ¹bÃ¡'s beliefs about reality and it is the heart and soul of connectedness between people or places. The present study assessed human emotion factors among a business-oriented population and compared these views with distinctions proposed in the literature. Using a repeated-measure multiple discriminant function analysis for individual items across raters. Neither the Interest subscale or Surprise subscale nor the Guilt subscale demonstrated significant retest correlations in a comparison of the General and Specific Depression conditions;and also, of the Specific Depression and pre-examination conditions. More specifically, culturally mediated beliefs, values and traditions associated with socialization practices (political skills in case of workplace), have been hypothesized to play a role in the kinds of emotions display. Alternative interpretations of the data are examined and theoretical issues in need of further clarification are discussed. By discussing caveats, the chapter laid foundations for artifacts that can guide future thoughtful research and the potential utility of this measure, and the likes for several areas of organizational, social and business research phenomena.

Systemic play therapy in a virtual format can work well if therapists make appropriate adjustments and rely on their creativity, high regard for ethics, and innovation.","Smith, Tiffany; Norton, Aaron M; Marroquin, Latrisha","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10591-021-09612-7","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Contemp Fam Ther;: 1-11, 2021 Oct 15.; Publication details: Contemp Fam Ther;: 1-11, 2021 Oct 15.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19558,""
"20 taxes to scrap: How to grow the UK economy by simplyfying the tax system","The five-year average tax burden in the UK is now at a 70-year high. The impact and opportunities of Brexit, coupled with the need to revitalise the economy in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis, mean 2021 would be a good time for the government to embark on a tax-cutting programme. This paper analyses twenty taxes that could be scrapped or significantly changed. If carried out, these reforms would simplify the tax system, reduce the overall burden of taxation, and eliminate harmful distortions that stifle the UKâ€™s productivity and prosperity. The TV Licence, Inheritance Tax, Stamp Duty Land Tax, stamp duties on buying shares, Apprenticeship Levy, Vehicle Excise Duty, Capital Gains Tax, the bank surcharge, and duties on alcohol, tobacco, and gambling, could be scrapped. Other property taxes, such as Council Tax, Community Infrastructure Levy, business rates, and affordable housing and other s106 obligations, could be replaced with a single land value tax. Under this proposed system, disincentives for property improvements and housebuilding would be removed. The Climate Change Levy and renewables obligations add economic distortion and complexity to the tax system and could be revamped into either through the Emissions Trading Scheme or a comprehensive carbon tax. Corporation Tax and the Diverted Profit Tax could be replaced with a single tax on capital income administered at the corporate level, similar to how PAYE works on wages. Doing so would promote neutrality between capital income and labour, eliminate the debt-capital bias, and spur productivity growth.","Submitter, Institute of Economic Affairs","https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3850620","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19559,""
"Novel AI to avert the mental health crisis in COVID-19:Â Novel application of GPT2 in Cognitive Behaviour Therapy","The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health is substantial. The World Health Organization has called for action to avert an impending mental health crisis. To respond to this call, this paper contributes a novel application of Deep Learning in Natural Language Generation (NLG) to seed healthy thoughts for mental health therapy. For the 1 st time in literature, a transfer learning capable large neural network with more than 100 million parameters for a NLG based mental health therapy application is proposed & demonstrated. This AI is designed to address scalable impact for millions of families with a timely health intervention in a privacy-safe approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research paper to apply GPT2 (Generative Pretrained Transformer) for Cognitive Behavior therapy (CBT). Further, the paper demonstrates the proposed neural network architecture with a lab prototype implementation with reproducible results. This paper demonstrates this AIâ€™s ability to generate conditional synthetic human-like text intended to seed a healthy mental outlook. This is accomplished by fine tuning a pre-trained GPT2 language model. The source code and video demonstration is contributed at https://sites.google.com/view/ai-in-mental-health.Also, for the 1 st time in literature, a novel idea of NLU (Natural Language Understanding) activated NLG therapy is demonstrated with reproducible results using a BERT based classifier to activate the GPT2 based therapy. Performance of GPT2 models of three different sizes (124, 355, 774 million parameters) was the same for a very small dataset, thus a small GPT2 model is suggested for on-device AI inference. This AI is a step forward in responding to WHOâ€™s call for action to avert the crisis. Towards addressing all the three dimensions of the monumental challenge, the paper designed a novel AI architecture by taking advantage of both BERT & GPT2. It also demonstrated the feasibility of Transformers-based AI for developing a mental health therapy solution. Further, this paper contributed an open-source AI prototype to support research communities to transform global mental wellness.","Rajagopal, A.; Nirmala, V.; Andrew, J.; Arun, M.","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-382748/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19560,""
"5G Technologies Based Remote E-Health: Architecture, Applications, and Solutions","Currently, many countries are facing the problems of aging population, serious imbalance of medical resources supply and demand, as well as uneven geographical distribution, resulting in a huge demand for remote e-health. Particularly, with invasions of COVID-19, the health of people and even social stability have been challenged unprecedentedly. To contribute to these urgent problems, this article proposes a general architecture of the remote e-health, where the city hospital provides the technical supports and services for remote hospitals. Meanwhile, 5G technologies supported telemedicine is introduced to satisfy the high-speed transmission of massive multimedia medical data, and further realize the sharing of medical resources. Moreover, to turn passivity into initiative to prevent COVID-19, a broad area epidemic prevention and control scheme is also investigated, especially for the remote areas. We discuss their principles and key features, and foresee the challenges, opportunities, and future research trends. Finally, a node value and content popularity based caching strategy is introduced to provide a preliminary solution of the massive data storage and low-latency transmission.","Duan, Wei, Ji, Yancheng, Zhang, Yan, Zhang, Guoan, Frascolla, Valerio, Li, Xin","https://www.google.com/search?q=5G+Technologies+Based+Remote+E-Health:+Architecture,+Applications,+and+Solutions","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19561,""
"Depression and anxiety in the Malaysian urban population and their association with demographic characteristics, quality of life, and the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic","The prevalence of depression and anxiety have been shown to be higher in the urban population compared with the rural population. The present study investigated the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and depression with comorbid anxiety and their associated factors in a random sample drawn from several urban communities in Malaysia. This study also compared the odds of developing depression, anxiety, and depression with comorbid anxiety before and after the emergence of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We recruited 326 participants who were administered a sociodemographic characteristics questionnaire, the 21-item Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), to assess the presence or absence of depression, anxiety, and depression with comorbid anxiety, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQoL-BREF) to assess their QoL. The following prevalence values were obtained among the participants: depression, 23.9%;anxiety, 41.7%;and depression with comorbid anxiety, 19.9%. The factors significantly associated with higher odds of psychological complications included those assessed after the emergence of COVID-19 as a global pandemic and the presence of comorbid stress. Higher physical health-related QoL, psychological QoL, and environment-related QoL reduced the odds of psychological complications. Based on our findings, we recommended a few measures to curb psychological complications among the urban population, particularly as the battle to contain COVID-19 is still ongoing.","Abdullah, Mohammad Farris Iman Leong Bin, Yusof, Hazwani Ahmad, Shariff, Noorsuzana Mohd, Hami, Rohayu, Nisman, Noor Farahiya, Law, Kim Sooi","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-114780/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19562,""
"Quality of life of university students during the COVID-19 pandemic: Assessing the level of quality of life and the associated factors after the end of movement lockdown","Purpose:  Despite the significant impact of COVID-19 on mental health among university students, data on the related quality of life (QoL) are lacking in this group of the population. This study aimed to evaluate quality of life (QoL) and determine its association with various factors and social support among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic after the end of movement lockdown. Methods: : This was an online, cross-sectional study recruited a total of 316 participants. Participants were administered a self-reported questionnaire to gather data on demographic, personal, clinical and psychological characteristics;the 21-item depression, anxiety and stress scale (DASS-21) to assess the severity of their depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms;the multidimensional scale of perceived social support (MSPSS) to assess the degree of social support;and the World Health Organization quality of life-BREF (WHOQoL-BREF) to assess QoL. Results: : The psychological and social QoL scores were lower than the non-pandemic norms of the general population, while the physical health and environmental QoL scores were comparable. After adjusting for relevant demographic, personal, and clinical variables, religious coping;greater number of hours of online classes attended;and greater social support from family, friends and significant others were found to be significantly associated with higher QoL among the participants. Frustration because of study disruption, living in areas with a high prevalence of COVID-19 cases, and a higher severity of depressive and stress symptoms were significantly associated with lower QoL. Conclusion:  COVID-19 impaired the QoL of university students even after the movement lockdown was lifted.","Abdullah, Mohammad Farris Iman Leong Bin, Murad, Nor Shuhada, Teoh, Soo Huat, Mohamad, Mohd Afifuddin","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-104496/v2","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19563,""
"Psycho-Educational Affirmations from the Qurâ€™An on Sadness to Prevent/Treat Depression for Muslim Clients of Cognitive Behavior Therapy Approach","Introduction: This study accommodates existential crisis provoked by the Covid-19 pandemic as observed in previous plagues. It is filling the gap of underrepresentation by academics of Islamic Studies in Islamicizing Psychology, in general. Furthermore, it specifically becomes a collective duty (far<U+1E0D> al-kifayah) to deliver Muslimsâ€™ spiritual existential needs during pandemic and preparing for anticipated post-pandemic breakdown. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Methods: The main keyword of sadness (Ar: Al-<U+1E25>uzn) are searched throughout the Holy Qurâ€™an as it frequently pairs with stressing life events. The compiled Qurâ€™anic verses from Mushaf Uthmani, English translation by Dr. Mustafa Khattab - The Clear Qurâ€™an, and exegesis for each verse from the renowned Andalusian Exegete: Al-Qurtubiâ€™s Exegesis (Tafsir al- Qurtubi) are thematically analyzed based on the Qurâ€™anic Thematic Exegetical Analysis (al- Tafsir al-Maw<U+1E0D>u<U+1D9C>i) method. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Results: The interpretation of the analysis are converted into Qurâ€™anic culturally adapted psychoeducational affirmations on sadness as an integration into the Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for depression among Muslim clients. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Conclusion: The Cognitive Behavioural Therapy is compatible with the nature of Islam according to the late Prof. Malik Badri, e.g. the idea of fixing the â€˜beliefsâ€™ (I<U+1E63>la<U+1E25>). Thus, theoretically, this set of Qurâ€™anic psychoeducational affirmations should offer an effective integration for either preventing or treating depression. Essentially, it is more important for all Muslims to be psycho-educated about this from their childhood to develop their existential resilience in facing the challenges of life in general, specifically during and post-pandemic.","Abas, Afifah, Sahad, Mohd Nizam bin","https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3887849","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19564,""
"Preparing for the COVID-19 Mental Health Crisis in Latin America â€“ Using Early Evidence From Countries That Experienced COVID-19 First","The Covid-19 started in China and took over the world, becoming a pandemic. Especially in Latin America, the coronavirus arrived on the continent in mid-February 2020. The South American continent is going through a delicate political, economic and social moment, which is reflected in the fragility of our health systems and science and to reduce the rates of contagion and not overburden health services, including hospitals. Nevertheless, several studies are being carried out in Brazil and worldwide, with the objective sought to understand the characteristics, and even, the cure of people infected by the coronavirus.

"Public Health in the Opioid Litigation","Today, the opioid crisis is playing out in the nationâ€™s courts. Litigants have taken a microscope to defendant opioid companies, whose misconduct ignited and exacerbated the opioid crisis. As the litigation continues, one could imagine numerous ways its resolution could contribute to the end of a mutli-decade overdose crisis and prevent future ones. Options include holding defendant companies accountable, releasing previously secret information for research on root causes of the epidemic, and injunctive relief prohibiting future misconduct. Unfortunately, to date, the litigation has not been so capacious. Rather, the participantsâ€”judge includedâ€”have been preoccupied with rapid monetary settlement. Though understandable, attempts to obtain rapid monetary relief take a narrow view of public health. That is, we will help the most readily identifiable victims, with less regard for structural factors that led to the crisis in the first place. This avoidance of structural change is at odds with public health and fails to meet this moment, defined by the most urgent public health crisis in modern history, the COVID-19 pandemic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To explain why the litigation participants have pursued rapid monetary settlement, this paper uses the lens of agency. As will be shown, the opioid litigation is an agent of public health. That is, given the litigationâ€™s tight connections with public health, it must represent the broad health of the populace. The paper then identifies numerous incentive problems that create misalignment with public health. Viewed in this light, the pursuit of rapid monetary settlement becomes more understandableâ€”though not justifiable. This paper offers solutions for curing these agency problems and ensuring that public health is properly represented in future public health litigation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If there is any time to be capacious as to the scope of public health, that time is now. While corporate misconduct plays a significant role in the spread of COVID-19, it is even more relevant to the opioid crisis, a public health emergency initiated and exacerbated by defendants in the litigation. Therefore, relief must consider not only how to help opioid victims, but to release as much information as possible about root causes and to discourage the misconduct that helped precipitate the epidemic. In other words, the court can and must take a deeper look at broader relief that benefits more people on a longer time scale. Expanding the scope of public health in the opioid litigation could yield more robust public health benefits for current and future generations. It could also create lasting precedent by expressing the norm that sales revenue and economic growth must not come at the expense of human life. Such a norm, operationalized through law, could offer significantly more enduring value than a one-shot bolus of money.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This paper, and its companion, together offer a new way of conceiving of public health litigation to maximize its benefits. This conception is grounded in a broad definition of public health. It is too soon to forsake public health for feasibility or realism;in fact, this paper suggests extremely practical ways the judge and litigants can improve the impact of the opioid litigation within civil procedureâ€™s bounds.","Aaron, Daniel","https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3847974","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19566,""

"Review of Socio-Economic and Psychological Aspects of Lockdown during COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 wasdeclared as pandemic on March 11 2020 by WHO., which proved to be the most pervasive and deadliest pandemic of 21st century. The flu-like illness resulted in millions of deaths. Coronavirus is a respiratory virus, which means that it infects a host through the pulmonary pathway. Droplet expulsions from an infected patient (cough, sneeze, spit) releases the virus into the air and the surrounding non-infected person can breathe in the virus particle, continuing the infection chain. Contact between individuals had to be minimized completely to stop the virus from spreading from one person to another. So, as an effective measure of ""breaking-the-chain"", several of the countries issued partial and complete lockdown. Along with stringent local/international travel restrictions, frequent use of sanitizers, washing hands, wearing personal-protective-equipment (PPE), are being advised to the personnel working in this situation, especially the forces of law, medical staff, and persons associated with essential services. The pandemic has caused major disruption and devastation to the lives, expectations and livelihoods of people all over the world.

The disease is still not fully understood and created a worldwide panic due to non-availability of definitive treatment option. In spite of intense rigorous research, novel diagnostic approaches, latest drug trials, prevention remains the mainstay to avoid any health complications and limit the spread. Strategies were designed by healthcare experts to create awareness to prevent transmission. Quarantine and isolation deteriorates mental health in certain individuals it causes irritation, depression, anxiety and their mental health problems thus proper counselling should be done for such individuals. It also causes financial loss and there is a lot of social stigma surrounding it. Managing mental health plays a key role during isolation or during quarantine. Social media has also been essential in creating awareness related to this pandemic.

"Parenting and child mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: An online study with Portuguese and British Families","COVID-19 and the subsequent public health response created many additional stresses for families. We examined parental behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic in two European Countries and explored the association between parents' behaviour and children's anxiety and quality of life. Caregivers of children and adolescents (N= 442;86.7% mothers) between 6 and 16 years old (M= 10, SD= 2.85) participated in an online cross-sectional survey in Portugal and the United Kingdom. Results show that higher children's anxiety and lower quality of life were associated with higher levels of unrealistic parental demands, lower parental self-care, and higher parental emotional dysregulation. Encouragement of children's emotion expression and management of exposure to COVID-19 information was negatively associated with children's anxiety. Promotion of routines, support of children's emotion modulation and promotion of children's healthy lifestyles were positively associated with children's quality of life. The predictors differed according to country and age group. These results highlight the importance of specific parenting behaviours on children's mental health during COVID-19. The need to moderate unrealistic demands and attend to parental self-care to reduce parental emotional dysregulation is important.","Pereira, A. I.; Stallard, P.; Roberto, M.

"Academic and Psychosocial Challenges of Health Sciences Students during the Covid-19 Pandemic: A University of Technology Perspective","The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in South African universities and institutes of higher learning experiencing an unprecedented shift to online learning in 2020, coupled by limited access to campus, in order to prevent community transmission. However, the potential impact of the outbreak on the academic and psychosocial wellbeing of students warrants further exploration, as the rapid changes and the disruption to normal academic life, has left many students feeling socially isolated and struggling to cope with massive uncertainty. In addition, Health Sciences students may experience added anxiety due to their line of work, which places them at the forefront of the healthcare environment. This study explored the academic and psychosocial challenges experienced by students enrolled in a Health Sciences faculty in a University of Technology (UoT), as they transitioned through the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdown. A qualitative approach with an exploratory descriptive design was used to guide the study. A sample of students across all levels of study (first, second and third years as well as postgraduates) from the Faculty of Health Sciences at the Durban University of Technology (DUT) in South Africa were selected. Sample recruitment was done through non-probability sampling techniques which include purposive and convenience sampling. Data saturation was reached after interviewing 15 participants on Microsoft Teams. The interview schedule comprised key points on understanding how the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdown affected students personally and academically. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and subjected to content and thematic analyses. Six broad themes emerged from the data, which captured the disruption students experienced within the context of their academic life, their personal fears and anxieties, struggles with online learning and connectivity issues. Students also expressed challenges whilst studying remotely at home. The findings suggested that there is an urgent need for universities to reflect on ensuring students' mental health wellbeing as well as ensuring academic success amidst a turbulent physical and psychological environment.

"Psychological and Psychiatric Problems among Women - Victims of Domestic Violence and Their Peculiarities during the COVID-19 Lockdown (Scientific Review)","The review is dedicated to analysis of Russian and foreign publications studying psychological and psychiatric problems of the women subjected to domestic violence. Specifics of this phenomenon emerging during the COVID-19 pandemic have been shown. The upsurge in domestic violence is caused by factors such as uncertainty about the current situation and the future, deterioration in social and material well-being, restricted social contacts, use of psychoactive substances. Women have little or no access to help from social institutions (outpatient clinics, social welfare centers including shelters for victims of domestic violence, educational institutions for children, churches), which becomes a complicating factor. Due to enforced lockdowns, violence in families is becoming a widespread ""hidden"" epidemic, ""a pandemic in the pandemic times"". Typical effects of domestic violence are adjustment disorders, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, addiction to psychoactive substances. The most unfavourable outcome is hetero- and autoaggressive behavior, right up to committing ""extended suicide"" by a domestic violence victim (not only taking the victim's own life but also killing her children for pseudoaltruistic reasons). The data pertaining prevention of domestic violence and aiding its victims have been summarized.","Kachaeva, M. A.; Shishkina, O.

"A Qualitative Study on Emergency Health Care Worker (EHCW) Perception towards COVID-ACLS Simulation Training in Resuscitating Suspected COVID-19 Patients","The emergence of COVID-19 pandemic has caused difficulty to emergency-HCW (EHCW) in resuscitating high-risk patients. We set out to explore EHCW's perception after undergoing COVID-ACLS resuscitation training and address their anxiety of working in this pandemic. A qualitative case study using focused group discussion was conducted among EHCW who have undergone COVID-ACLS training. Five semi-structured questions exploring respondent's confidence level, anxiety factors, areas of improvement for COVID-ACLS and if this COUD-ACES training is sufficient. Inductive and deductive thematic analysis approach was done to analyse the result. 20 EHCW participated in this study. Out of 4 themes, 11 subthemes were identified based on the respondents. They were acquired new knowledge, self-precaution, method of delivery, concerns of self and family members, stigmatisation, insufficient protective methods, underappreciation, regular training sessions, other modalities for learning, course duration;and unsatisfactory reading material. New knowledge and self-precaution were noted to be an important aspect that boosts confidence among EHCW. The main factor that increased anxiety was safety issues and disease spreading to family members, colleagues, and society. In conclusion, COVID-ACLS training is able to boost EHCW confidence in resuscitating high-risk patients. Factors leading to anxiety among EHCW should also be addressed during this pandemic to ensure psychological welfare and mental health are not affected Regular training and utilisation of other teaching modalities such as video are perceived as a helpful adjunct in boosting their confidence. The utilisation of new training approach should be explored in enhancing EHCW's knowledge and confidence.","Yii, J.; Mahmud, A.; Abd Samat, A. H.; Sabardin, D. M.; Isa, M. H. M.; Saiboon, I.

"Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of Critically Ill Neurological Patients with COVID-19 Infection in Neuro-intensive Care Unit: A Retrospective Study","Background:There are insufficient data about clinical outcomes in critically ill neurological patients with concomitant coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This study describes the clinical characteristics, predictors of mortality, and clinical outcomes in COVID-19 positive neurological patients managed in a dedicated COVID-19 neurointensive care unit (CNICU). Methods:This single-center, retrospective cohort study was conducted in critically ill neurological and neurosurgical patients with concomitant COVID-19 infection admitted to the CNICU at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru, from July to November 2020. Patients'demographic, clinical, laboratory, imaging, treatment, and outcome data were retrieved from the manual and electronic medical records. Predictors of mortality and neurological outcome were identified using logistic regression. Results: During the study period, 50 COVID-19 positive neurological patients were admitted to the CNICU. Six patients were excluded from the analysis as they were managed in the CNICU for &lt;24 hours. A poor outcome, defined as death or motor Glasgow Coma Scale &lt;5 at hospital discharge, was observed in 34 of 44 patients (77.27%) with inhospital mortality in 26 of /44 patients (59%). Worst modified sequential organ failure assessment (MSOFA) score, lactate dehydrogenase maximum levels (LDHmax) levels, and lymphocyte count were predictors of inhospital mortality with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.88, 1.01, and 0.87, respectively, whereas worst MSOFA and LDHmax levels were predictors for poor neurological outcome with OR of 1.99 and 1.01, respectively. Conclusions: Mortality is high in neurological patients with concomitant COVID-19 infection. Elevated inflammatory markers of COVID-19 suggest the role of systemic inflammation on clinical outcomes. Predictors of mortality and poor outcome were higher MSOFA score and elevated LDH levels. Additionally, lymphopenia was associated with mortality.","Surve, R. M.; Mishra, R. K.; Malla, S.

"A Contemporary Approach to Clinical Supervision: The Supervisee Perspective","The most critical and influential relationship affecting one's growth as a mental health professional is the relationship between the clinician and the supervisor. Good supervisors breed good therapists. This book goes beyond facts and figures to provide an innovative perspective on the supervision process. Through contributions by seven supervisees and the supervisor they all shared, readers are offered a rare glimpse into what takes place during the supervision hour. This book not only offers insight into the elements integral to effective supervision, but also teaches about the supervisory relationship. With contributors from various disciplines, theoretical orientations, and cultures, it shows how the supervisee and supervisor are able to navigate these differences while still gaining the most from supervision. Topics that are covered include cultural competence in multicultural supervision and remote supervision when it is conducted between clinicians in different countries, as well as an original study by the authors on the experiences of supervisees during the global Covid-19 pandemic and the transition to remote supervision. For mental health professionals who are training to be supervisors or experienced supervisors looking to improve their skills, this book will serve as an invaluable resource for professional development.

"Which consequences of african swine fever on the global swine industry and other animal industries?","ASF caused a significant drop in Chinese pork production between 2018 and 2020. To make up for this deficit, China significantly increased its meat imports in 2019 and 2020, thus strengthening the growth trend of European and American exports and driving up meat prices in these regions. However, from the start of 2020, COVID-19 disrupted the usual marketing channels for meat products in these domestic markets and in export markets, and caused disruption in the meat industries, with a depressive effect on prices. In addition, the emergence of ASF in Germany in September 2020 also severely hampered the possibilities for European pork exports. The two ASF and COVID-19 epidemics highlight the importance of health security for the economic development and the resilience of the animal sector.","Duflot, B.","https://doi.org/10.3406/BAVF.2021.70947","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Bulletin de l'Academie Veterinaire de France; 174, 2021.; Publication details: Bulletin de l'Academie Veterinaire de France; 174, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19580,""

"Rates, risks and routes to reduce vascular dementia (R4VAD)","Background and Aims: R4VAD is a multi-site longitudinal, inclusive observational study of patients presenting with stroke to UK stroke centres aiming to determine rates of, and risk factors for, cognitive and related impairments after stroke, assessmechanisms and improve predictionmodels. Methods: R4VaD is recruiting patients within 6 weeks of stroke and collecting clinical, socioeconomic, lifestyle, cognitive, mood and informant data using clinical trialmethods. Detailed assessments are obtained at 6+/-2 weeks post baseline assessment, with annual follow-up by phone and post to at least 2 years and data linkage for 10 years. Diagnostic neuroimaging is assessed in all, and inflammatory blood markers and genetic analysis in as many patients as possible. Recruitment opened in September 2018, paused briefly inMarch 2020 and reopened in April 2020 with a COVID-19 substudy. Results: We have recruited 2143 participants to date (initial a target 2000) in 53 Centres across the UK (mean age = 68.5 years, SD = 13.5;39.8% female). So far, 85% of participants have ischaemic stroke;8% ICH;6% TIA;mean NIHSS = 2.9 (SD = 3.4);6% lack capacity;31% have an informant.

"The importance of cognitive and behavioural support on the hyper acute stroke pathway during winter pressures/covid-19","Background and Aims: Cognitive and behavioural assessments are routinely performed on the hyperacute stroke unit (HASU). These may not provide a comprehensive patient profile. On an acute neurorehabilitation step-down unit for COVID-19/winter pressures, we assessed cognition and behavioural needs using stroke specific tools, functional tasks and detailed collateral information. Setting: 6-bedded acute neurorehabilitation step down unit developed for COVID-19/winter pressures, St. Pancras Hospital, London, UK. January 4th-April 1st 2021. We accepted patients triaged by an MDT neuro-navigation HASU team. We used standardised stroke specific screening tools: Oxford Cognitive score (OCS), detailed collateral and more comprehensive functional tasks. We assessed delirium, mood, anxiety and behavioural needs, eg, enhanced observations, impaired safety awareness, impaired attention affecting rehabilation, poor carry over, impulsivity, and need for Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS). Results: 80 patients accepted;mean age 72.3years (SD 17.3);41% &gt;80years. 30 (27%) had cognitive impairment identified pre-transfer, increasing to 52 (75%) on comprehensive assessment post-transfer. 35 (45%) had complex behavioural needs necessitating specialist nursing. 20 (25%) required DoLS;18(23%) had documented delirium on transfer. 34 (43%) had depression and anxiety. Anxiety 13(16%);depression 8(10%), combined 13 (16%). 36(45%) could benefit from formal psychology input. Average length of stay for those with psychology needs was greater than those without (16.1 v 12.6 days). Conclusions: Three quarters of patients had significant cognitive impairment;One quarter had delirium;nearly half required additional nursing for behavioural needs.

"Multidisciplinary tracheostomy teams: Transforming care and preventing harm amid the pandemic","Session Description: A landmark study found that in intensive care units (ICUs), tracheostomy incidents accounted for up to half of all airway-related deaths and hypoxic brain damage. Multidisciplinary adult and pediatric tracheostomy teams have achieved dramatic reductions in adverse events and improved patient outcomes, but dissemination of highly reliable practices has lagged. This panel addresses this gap by providing a strategy for rapid performance improvement with specific building blocks for enhancing care. Five key drivers-multidisciplinary ward rounds, standardized protocols, interdisciplinary education and staff allocation, patient and family involvement, and using data to drive improvement-can result in transformative change. We present data from 4 institutions, providing turnkey solutions and lessons learned from the creation of teams. We cover from the index procedure to decannulation and discharge, discussing obstacles encountered and how they are overcome. After presenting institution-level experience, we report on the largest implementation of these principles to date, drawing on prospectively captured patient-level global data from nearly 10,000 cases. We take a deep dive into a 3-year-long, 20-hospitalwide multipronged implementation that involved mixedmethods analysis, data tracking, and benchmarking to demonstrate powerful, statistically significant effects of reducing hospital and ICU length of stay, ventilator duration, time to cuff deflation, time to first vocalization, time to first oral intake, prevalence of anxiety and depression, and cost savings, projected at &gt;$15,000 per patient. While heterogeneity is a defining feature of tracheostomy, we demonstrate how across age and geographies, multidisciplinary teams are a game changer in tracheostomy care. In addition, the imperatives of the COVID-19 pandemic have necessitated additional measures in relation to aerosol-generating procedures. We curate salient data and present practical evidence-based recommendations. Outcome Objectives: (1) Present building blocks and discuss obstacles to creating a multidisciplinary tracheostomy care team. (2) Leverage data-science and ongoing efforts to improve tracheostomy outcomes.

"Minding the gap: How COVID-19 widens gender disparities, actionable solutions","Session Description: Gender differences in reimbursement and career development are deeply rooted in surgery. Relative to their male counterparts, women surgeons have been paid lower mean incomes, shouldered more work at home, and experienced slower career advancement. Female otolaryngologists are paid 77 cents on the dollar relative to male colleague, are underrepresented in leadership positions, and have significantly lower average academic rank. The pandemic has greatly widened this professional chasm between men and women surgeons, hindering advancement of women physicians' careers and stymieing leadership growth. Compared with male colleagues, women in medicine bear substantially more responsibility for dependent care, teaching of children, and performing domestic duties during the COVID-19 pandemic. These structural differences impede women physicians' clinical and academic productivity, creating a formidable barrier to career advancement or to achieving equal compensation. These challenges also have potentially corrosive effects on morale, affecting well-being, resilience, and risk of burnout and other aspects of mental health. It is therefore imperative for organizations to recognize the unbalanced effects of the pandemic and work-life ramifications for women physicians across the career continuum. Whereas the past decade has witnessed progress in narrowing gender inequities, the pandemic has placed such gains on unstable footing, with the possibility of a precipitous fall without anticipatory measures. This session will present data on the current state of the gender gap and will cover strategies for organizations and their leaders to manage the widening of disparities in career/ professional advancement, compensation, and productivity for women within otolaryngology and medicine. Outcome Objectives: (1) Summarize data on prepandemic gender inequities within otolaryngology-head and neck surgery (OTO-HNS). (2) Identify the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on women in OTO-HNS at home and at work. (3) Present strategies for institutions and their leaders to prevent widening of disparities in career advancement, productivity, and compensation for women within OTO-HNS.","Faucett, E.

"Mental health and daily and occupational activities of otolaryngologists in Colombia","Introduction: The current COVID-19 pandemic has placed an unprecedented burden on health care specialists who perform high-risk medical procedures and are frequently exposed to the respiratory tract, such as otolaryngologists and allergists. This study aims to assess the prevalence and associated factors of anxiety, depression, and stress as well as changes in daily and occupational activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic in otolaryngologists and allergists in Colombia. Method: An observational, cross-sectional study was conducted between October and November 2020. Mental health tools such as the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and the Perceived Stress Scale-10 were applied. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the associated factors with these mental health outcomes. Results: Among 133 specialists (61.65% otolaryngologists, 38.35% allergists), the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress was 63.91% (95% CI, 55.45-71.58), 33.83% (95% CI, 26.33-42.24), and 36.09% (95% CI, 28.41-44.54), respectively. Anxiety (odds ratio [OR], 0.34;95% CI, 0.14-0.81) and stress (OR, 0.38;95% CI, 0.16-0.9) were less frequent in otolaryngologists and more frequent in individuals who expressed fear of the possibility of a negative outcome (death/ sequelae) due to COVID-19 (OR, 2.65;95% CI, 1.01-7.12). Older age was associated with anxiety (OR, 0.94;95% CI, 0.90-0.98) and depression (OR, 0.96;95% CI, 0.93-0.99). The reduction in consultation and surgery during the pandemic was associated with anxiety (OR, 1.03;95% CI, 1.01- 1.05). Most of the specialists expect to incorporate long-term (&gt;1 year) drastic changes in their clinical setting and daily activities due to the pandemic. Conclusion: The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress was high among otolaryngologists and allergists in Colombia compared with previous international mental health reports.

"Opioid-sparing strategies in otolaryngology: Approaches to reduce opioids","Session Description: The ongoing opioid crisis and opioidrelated fatalities have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although opioids are sometimes necessary to manage pain, they carry substantial side effects as well as serious risks including abuse, misuse, diversion, addiction, overdose, and even death. Even short-term postoperative prescriptions can lead to chronic opioid use or an opioid use disorder. As surgeons and otolaryngology providers, we must contribute to safely reducing the use of opioids and their associated risks. There are evidence-based approaches to reduce postoperative opioid use, utilize multimodal nonopioid pain management, and administer opioids safely when they are necessary. The purpose of this session is to review the evidence around these perioperative strategies in both children and adults. Specific and practical strategies to apply opioid-sparing techniques as well as how to safely provide opioids will be provided. Tips to incorporate these strategies into everyday otolaryngology practice will be discussed. Evidence-based strategies utilized by anesthesiologists and pain medicine physicians will be shared along with recommendations for collaborating with these colleagues regarding your patients' pain management. Time will be available for questions regarding safe and effective perioperative pain management. Outcome Objectives: (1) Evaluate the current evidence and knowledge gaps for opioid and multimodal nonopioid postoperative pain management strategies. (2) Implement evidencebased strategies to reduce opioid use while effectively managing pain after otolaryngology procedures. (3) Apply safe practices when prescribing opioids and caring for patients taking opioids.","Ryan, M. A.; Tan, G.; Vosler, P.

"Improving otolaryngology access through telehealth: Cutting no-show rates in half","Introduction: The use of telehealth visits was a necessary adjustment in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Even after clinics were either shut down or restricted, synchronous telehealth became an alternative for maintaining essential patient care. As we emerge from the pandemic, further benefits of telehealth services are being discovered, including the reduction in missed-or no-show-visits when compared with in-person visits. The primary aim of this study was to compare the rates of missed visits between telehealth and inperson visits and comment on potential benefits of telehealth. Method: The study was conducted at an otolaryngology department from a quaternary academic medical center. Telehealth visits were rendered as primarily audio and video or audio only. Data were obtained from the institutional electronic financial data system. Overall visits were analyzed from April 2020 to December 2020 for the otolaryngology service by type of visit. The rates were calculated individually from the total number of in-person and telehealth visits. Statistical analysis for the difference in the proportion of encounters between groups was calculated using the prop.test function in R. Results: During the intervention period from April 2020 to December 2020, 25,854 otolaryngologic encounters were seen by the Department of Otolaryngology. The 'no-show' rate for telehealth visits was found to be significantly lower at 9.9% when compared with 18% for in-person visits (P &lt; .001). From those telehealth visits, 57% were rescheduled for another day. Conclusion: The benefits of telehealth in a postpandemic world extend beyond providing an alternative to in-person visits, providing a significant reduction in no-show rates. Reducing missed appointments has multiple benefits, including improved resource utilization in clinics, better access for patients, and productivity for providers. It should be considered as one of the primary benefits when adding telehealth visits to a practice both during and post-pandemic.","Cabrera, C. I.; D'Anza, B.

"The impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of Canadian children and youth","Children and youth flourish in environments that are predictable, safe, and structured. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted these protective factors making it difficult for children and youth to adapt and thrive. Pandemic-related school closures, family stress, and trauma have led to increases in mental health problems in some children and youth, an area of health that was already in crisis well before COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic. Because mental health problems early in life are associated with significant impairment across family, social, and academic domains, immediate measures are needed to mitigate the potential for long-term sequalae. Now more than ever, Canada needs a national mental health strategy that is delivered in the context in which children and youth are most easily accessible-schools. This strategy should provide coordinated care across sectors in a stepped care framework and across a full continuum of mental health supports spanning promotion, prevention, early intervention, and treatment. In parallel, we must invest in a comprehensive population-based follow-up of Statistics Canada's Canadian Health Survey on Children and Youth so that accurate information about how the pandemic is affecting all Canadian children and youth can be obtained. It is time the Canadian government prioritizes the mental health of children and youth in its management of the pandemic and beyond.","Vaillancourt, T.; Szatmari, P.; Georgiades, K.; Krygsman, A.","https://doi.org/10.1139/facets-2021-0078","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Facets; 6:1628-1648, 2021.; Publication details: Facets; 6:1628-1648, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19590,""
"Service evaluation of a patient centred pathway to support self management and weight loss for patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease","With increasing rates of obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now the most common cause of abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) in the UK.1 Lifestyle change is the mainstay of clinical management for NAFLD.2Patients achieving = 5-10% weight reduction show regression in fibrosis score and improvements in histological aspects of NAFLD.3 However, there is limited evidence of what works to support weight loss/improve self management in clinical settings. Evidence highlights just providing patients with NAFLD with information and advice to change behaviour is an insufficient intervention. Readiness to change weight-related behaviours is often low and not associated with severity of liver disease. The Lead Clinician and Hepatology Nurse Specialist led on development of a new NAFLD pathway. They established a multidisciplinary clinic with input General Practitioners, dietitians and psychologists. Eligible patients (Fib 4&gt;1.45) were offered input from a Liver Nurse, Health Psychologist, dietitian and Consultant. Over 6 months patients received a low intensity psychology intervention. Each participant was seen for an assessment (and 8 weekly follow-ups via email, telephone or video call). Psychologist reviewed patients at three and six months. 101 patients, (53% Males and 47% Females) agreed to participate in the health psychology intervention. Average BMI of patients assessed was 40.1 (113.5kg). Baseline daily step count was 1635. Majority of patients presented with two or more Long Term Conditions alongside NAFLD. Most common being Type 2 Diabetes (44%) and anxiety/depression (27%). Average Fib 4 score was 1.4, KPa 14.4. HbA1c 58.8, Cholesterol 5.0, ALT 81.4, AST 58.4. 91% of patients were followed up (9% drop out). Average weight loss 5.5kg (range 0.5kg- 23kg). 82% increased daily step count (1635 to 5958). Anxiety scores (HADs) decreased from (7.4 to 6) and Depression scores reduced 6.3 to 3.3 Due to Covid 19 restrictions we don't have repeat measures on medical markers. However self reported outcomes at 6 months are encouraging. A learning point when we are able to fully resume normal service delivery is to try and increase the number of patients benefitting from this service. We see scope to access patients earlier in primary care thus reducing waiting times and freeing up secondary care medical staff for more complex cases. Overall, it is considered that this new pathway and multidisciplinary clinic has been very worthwhile. There were noticeable improvements identified through the use of appropriate assessment tools and from positive qualitative patient/ clinician feedback.","McCallum, M.; Mukhopadhya, A.; Dundas, P.","https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2021-BASL.13","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Gut; 70(SUPPL 3):A8, 2021.; Publication details: Gut; 70(SUPPL 3):A8, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19591,""

"Policewomen's Experiences of Working during Lockdown: Results of a Survey with Officers from England and Wales","Policing is a high-stress occupation requiring emotional management when facing job-related violence, threats to safety and well-being, work-life disruption, and unpredictable hours. A national health pandemic coupled with public order and restraint imperatives has compounded the levels of stress in policing. In the UK, new working patterns have been negotiated to manage the constraints of a different working environment during COVID-19. Using a self-administered survey, this article explores the experiences of 473 female police officers working during the first lockdown in 2020. The article shows that the COVID-19 preventative measures forced police services to navigate new and varied working patterns for their employees. Previous resistance to flexible working practices in policing was put aside as police services sought to manage the virus in its own ranks as well as policing the public. Preliminary findings suggest that officers working from home were more likely to feel satisfied with management responses compared with those working on the front line, although negative attitudes from colleagues and management towards those working from home were present. Those not working from home reported higher levels of stress related to their Force's lack of communication with them about their welfare.","Fleming, J.; Brown, J.","https://doi.org/10.1093/police/paab027","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Policing-a Journal of Policy and Practice; 15(3):1977-1992, 2021.; Publication details: Policing-a Journal of Policy and Practice; 15(3):1977-1992, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19596,""
"Virtual Community Mental Health Support during the COVID-19 Pandemic Crisis: Balancing Accessibility with Online Security","The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent quarantine orders led to a lot of uncertainty, fear, and mental health difficulty around the world. To be able to support the community during this time of crisis, especially when no in-person crisis services could be provided, an online mental health support and parenting group was offered to the community. While the primary goal of this group was to provide communitywide mental health support to as many parents as possible, the group was quickly compromised by people using the technology to disrupt the support program. The interference from disruptors to the security of the online program through so-called Zoombombing quickly created a dilemma as to how to safely provide quality care. This article provides a case report of a community-based parenting support program and explores the challenge of providing wide-scale online mental health care while also protecting the privacy and security of community members and the integrity of the program. In developing this project to support the community during the pandemic, several lessons were learned about use of virtual platforms, online security, and finding ways to care for the community through crisis.

"Virtual Termination amid COVID-19: Strategies for School Social Work Interns and Field Instructors","The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the natural rhythm of the school year, affecting the way services are rendered. This shift has implications for the termination of services and the guidance of school social work interns through the termination process. This article provides lessons learned from the rapid transition from face-to-face practice to telemental health services in schools. The authors present strategies for supervising the termination process in a remote environment. In keeping with social work's professional mandate, field instructors must guide interns on conducting termination services properly and engage interns in this reflective process. This article also addresses issues of equity and access for students and their families. Attention is given to the impact of termination on student clients, families, school social work interns, and field instructors. Telemental health demonstrates promise in supporting a model of practice that provides opportunities for innovation. Researchers and practitioners are encouraged to continue this discourse for engaging in and developing best practices for telemental health services, termination of services, and supervision of social work interns in the school setting. The school social work profession must continue to augment policies related to the provision of telemental health services in school settings.

"Impact of the Coronavirus Lockdown on Older Adolescents Engaged in a School-Based Stress Management Program: Changes in Mental Health, Sleep, Social Support, and Routines","The mental health effects of the coronavirus pandemic are likely to be significant and sustained, especially for those who experience adversity or preexisting mental health difficulties. This article examines the experiences of older adolescents during the United Kingdom government's ""lockdown"" period (April 2020 to June 2020) on mental health, social support, sleep, and routines using both quantitative and qualitative methods. Participants were enrolled in DISCOVER, a school-based stress management program, in London (N  =   107;72 percent Black, Asian, or minority ethnicity). The Coping with COVID-19 questionnaire was developed and administered online. Changes in mental health, sleep, and routines were reported during the lockdown period as well as increased worry about family members' physical and mental health. Positive experiences of the lockdown period included improvements in quality of relationships and increased time to spend on hobbies. Participants reported the use of cognitiveâ€“behavioral therapy techniques for coping. Results have implications for supporting older adolescents during the pandemic, including on their return to school.

"Resources for Families during COVID-19: A Content Analysis of Information Provided on School District Web Sites","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted the educational system not only in regard to teaching and learning, but also in relation to the other services and supports (mental health services, meal and nutrition programs, and so on) provided to students and families. School district Web sites are critical access points for families during this crisis to learn information about key resources being provided during school closure. This study used content analysis to examine whether school district Web sites in one southeastern state provided information about COVID-19 and 11 other resources. Findings indicate that about half of the Web sites provided both COVID-19 information and additional resources. Few districts provided information on resources for students with disabilities, a subgroup of students at heightened vulnerability during this time of virtual learning. Approximately a third of school district Web sites provided no information on COVID-19 or any of the other resources. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications for school social workers related to crisis response and leadership around contributing to efforts that aim to address educational disparities and inequities and maximize student success during this time of crisis.

"Tales from Three Countries and One Academia: Academic Faculty in the Time of the Pandemic","Unsurprisingly, there are also disparities in how different segments of the faculty community have been affected - it is clear that the pandemic has ""disproportionately affected ... women, Black, brown, gay, nonbinary and disabled faculty members"", while ""faculty of color also often come from or have family or friends in communities with high rates of COVID-19"" (CHE [6], 5;Weyandt et al. [25]). I have been repeatedly impressed by how the directors within our college supported faculty and how faculty supported each other, staff, and the student body throughout the period of pandemic-related social restrictions. Since the start of the pandemic and the related major disruptions introduced to all aspects of university work and life, one invariable focus has been on students and the effects of dislocation, lockdown, illness, and isolation, not only on their academic performance and career advancement but also on their physical well-being and mental health. Fortunately, the university offered pandemic accommodations, including 1-year COVID-19 tenure extensions, work-from-home options for faculty and staff, and teaching accommodations for those with health issues during this time.

"Risk and protective factors, stressors, and symptoms of adjustment disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic - First results of the ESTSS COVID-19 pan-European ADJUST study","Background The COVID-19 pandemic exposes individuals to multiple stressors, such as quarantine, physical distancing, job loss, risk of infection, and loss of loved ones. Such a complex array of stressors potentially lead to symptoms of adjustment disorder. Objective This cross-sectional exploratory study examined relationships between risk and protective factors, stressors, and symptoms of adjustment disorder during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Data from the first wave of the European Society of Traumatic Stress Studies (ESTSS) longitudinal ADJUST Study were used. N = 15,563 participants aged 18 years and above were recruited in eleven countries (Austria, Croatia, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, and Sweden) from June to November 2020. Associations between risk and protective factors (e.g. gender, diagnosis of a mental health disorder), stressors (e.g. fear of infection, restricted face-to-face contact), and symptoms of adjustment disorder (ADNM-8) were examined using multivariate linear regression. Results The prevalence of self-reported probable adjustment disorder was 18.2%. Risk factors associated with higher levels of symptoms of adjustment disorder were female gender, older age, being at risk for severe COVID-19 illness, poorer general health status, current or previous trauma exposure, a current or previous mental health disorder, and longer exposure to COVID-19 news. Protective factors related to lower levels of symptoms of adjustment disorder were higher income, being retired, and having more face-to-face contact with loved ones or friends. Pandemic-related stressors associated with higher levels of symptoms of adjustment disorder included fear of infection, governmental crisis management, restricted social contact, work-related problems, restricted activity, and difficult housing conditions.

"COVID-19 and School Psychology: Contemporary Research Advancing Practice, Science, and Policy INTRODUCTION","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which began in January 2020, has had numerous deleterious impacts on children, families, schools, and communities around the world and in the United States. Schools around the globe have implemented an array of instructional strategies, including in-person, remote/distance learning, and assorted hybrid configurations involving both. This second series of articles in this special topic section of School Psychology Review further informs innovations and adaptations in research, training, and practice relevant to the field of school psychology during the COVID-19 pandemic. This introductory article highlights the impacts on children, schools, and communities around the world, offers reflections on recent scholarship focused on the COVID-19 pandemic and school psychology, and also shares a synthesis from the next five articles featured in this second edition of the special topic section focused on adaptations and new directions for the field of school psychology. IMPACT STATEMENT The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had extensive implications on the fields of education and school psychology around the globe. Recent scholarship informs innovations and adaptations further informing practice, graduate preparation, scholarship, and policies that help to advance the field of school psychology within and beyond the COVID-19 syndemic. Contemporary research contributes important knowledge and guidance related to the impact on teacher's mental health and harm, coping, teaching, self-efficacy, compassion fatigue, and concerns, as well as the concerns and perspectives of parents, and also the measurement of increased stress reported by students.","Song, S.

"Transforming School Mental Health Services Based on a Culturally Responsible Dual-Factor Model","In this article the authors advocate for a culturally responsible dual-factor model for the delivery of mental health services in the schools. This case is made because too many children are not receiving the mental health care they need in order to succeed in school and life. This is especially true for Black, Indigenous, children of color, and other minoritized youth. This transformative approach will require a dramatic change in how school psychological services are currently being delivered. The culturally responsible dual-factor model places a much greater emphasis on psychological well-being (as opposed to psychopathology), unwavering attention to rectifying discriminatory disparities in school mental health practices, an emphasis on population-based over individually focused mental health services, and a commitment to ensuring access for all children-not just those who are receiving special education services or 504 accommodations. This model is proactive and prevention oriented and focuses on equity. The case is presented that we continue to have a mental health crisis in today's youth with an increase in anxiety and depression. The authors conclude the article with implications for school psychology training, public policy and advocacy, and school-based practice. Impact Statement The culturally responsible dual-factor mental health framework is a transformative approach to school mental health services that is needed to address the nation's mental health crisis. It is needed because traditional approaches, models, and practices have been too narrow and, thus, continue to fail for diverse and minoritized children, families, and schools. A culturally responsible dual-factor mental health approach expands traditional approaches by emphasizing well-being, cultural strengths of minoritized communities, accessibility of services, and systems and structures (e.g., racism) that contribute to discrimination and disparities in mental health services.","Lazarus, P.

"Psychoenvironmental and cognitive factors of womenâ€™s emotional states during confinement due to Covid-19 (Factores psicoambientales y cognitivos de los estados emocionales en mujeres durante el confinamiento ante la Covid-19)","Before the health crisis began, there was already evidence that women are twice as likely as men to experience negative emotions in stressful situations. Given these precedents, analysing the environmental and psychological factors that can influence this state, as well as the coping strategies aimed at mitigating or preventing this emotional response to confinement, is essential. The results of this study indicate that the negative emotions experienced by women during confinement are affected by their perception of the world, response to uncertainty, emotional intelligence and the habitability of their home. Similarly, the study found that these same factors influence womenâ€™s coping patterns during confinement, with the exception of response to uncertainty. These results may help develop intervention strategies aimed at protecting womenâ€™s mental health in similar future situations. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] RESUMEN Antes de que comenzara la crisis sanitaria ya existÃ­an evidencias de que las mujeres tienen el doble de probabilidad que los hombres de experimentar emociones negativas ante situaciones de estrÃ©s. Dados estos precedentes se hace necesario indagar sobre aquellos factores ambientales y psicolÃ³gicos que pueden influir en dicho estado, asÃ­ como sobre las estrategias de afrontamiento encaminadas a mitigar o evitar esa respuesta emocional ante el confinamiento. Los resultados hallados indican que las emociones negativas experimentadas por las mujeres durante el confinamiento se ven afectadas por su percepciÃ³n del mundo, su respuesta a la incertidumbre, su inteligencia emocional y la habitabilidad de su vivienda, esencialmente. AsÃ­ mismo, se vio que estos mismos factores influyen en las pautas de afrontamiento llevadas a cabo por las mujeres durante el confinamiento, a excepciÃ³n de la respuesta a la incertidumbre. Estos resultados pueden ayudar a desarrollar estrategias de intervenciÃ³n destinadas a proteger la salud mental de las mujeres en situaciones similares futuras.

"Lessons for mental health systems from the COVID-19 front line: Chinese healthcare workers' challenges, resources, resilience, and cultural considerations","Frontline health providers who worked in Hubei, China, during the initial outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) experienced poorer mental health outcomes than those who worked elsewhere in China, but many of these workers denied psychological challenges and did not use resources when offered. This study investigated challenges, mental health, sources of strength, and coping strategies among frontline healthcare professionals working in the initial Hubei COVID-19 outbreak. Healthcare workers (N = 23) who went to Hubei during the COVID-19 outbreak completed a semistructured interview about their experiences at the front line and use of mental health resources. Thematic analysis revealed several challenges participants faced as a result of their work conditions. The vast majority of participants reported physical and psychological symptoms. Nevertheless, some denied experiencing any distress, and none accessed psychological assistance as a way of self-care. Participants described their social network as particularly helpful as they were coping with the intensive work demands and that their strong sense of responsibility for patients and trust in the medical system were sources of strength. Our findings highlight that even in the face of stress-related challenges, healthcare workers may not seek care for their physical and psychological symptoms, which may lead to persistent mental health consequences. Implications for providing mental health services to healthcare providers and first responders are discussed in the Chinese cultural and societal context;we offer considerations for bridging health resources in China with the potential for establishing a more responsive and equitable mental health infrastructure.

"""I hate it, it's ruining my life"": College students' early academic year experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic","Due to strategies aimed at controlling COVID-19, governments across the world implemented social distancing and stay-at-home measures, which has resulted in isolation and economic crisis (Golberstein et al., 2019). To date, few studies have examined individuals' experiences of COVID-19, but these have mostly been focused on frontline workers and the medical field. The purpose of this study was to determine how COVID-19 has affected collegiate student mental health by assessing their perceived challenges and coping strategies. A total of 585 students completed an online survey between July 27 and October 12, 2020, which included open-ended questions on challenges they faced due to COVID-19. Students' average age was 22.46 years, with 75% identifying as female, and primarily from racial/ethnicity groups of Hispanic/Latino (39.5%), White/Caucasian (33.3%), Asian (11.5%) and Black/African American (4.6%). Content analysis revealed themes for challenges due to COVID-19 and coping strategies. Challenges included (a) mental, emotional, physical challenges, (b) online learning, (c) confronting the ""new normal"", (d) concern for self and others, (e) positive experiences, and (f) societal challenges. Coping strategies were classified into (a) problem-focused coping, (b) emotion-focused coping, and (c) avoidant coping. Emotion-focused coping strategies were indicated by many;however, students engaged in all coping dimensions during the pandemic. Administrators, mental health care workers, and other university staff can use these themes as a framework to redistribute resources for students to better cope with adverse situations to promote academic, mental, and personal success.

"Traumatic stress among frontline American nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic: A survey study","Nurses working on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic are at inherent risk of traumatic stress working in understaffed, poorly equipped, high acuity environments. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may develop following exposure to trauma or stress associated with depressive symptoms, flashbacks, and mood disturbance. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of traumatic stress among American frontline nurses following the initial COVID-19 surge in the United States during March 2020 using the Trauma Screening Questionnaire. This cross-sectional survey study was distributed via social media in May 2021 following the initial COVID-19 surge. The (TSQ) was selected for its strong psychometric performance in previous studies and high clinical reliability in detecting those at risk for PTSD. Results: Out of the 298 acute care nurses practicing in the United States who participated in the survey, 58.7% had a positive score of greater than 6 indicating the risk of PTSD. Front line nurses who provided care during the initial COVID-19 surge reported high levels of traumatic stress and demonstrated the risk of developing PTSD as measured by the TSQ. Health systems that employ frontline nurses must increase screening for mental health ramifications during the global pandemic.

"Psychological functioning during the COVID-19 lockdown: The role of exposure to continuous traumatic stress in conflict-ridden regions","The present study investigates the role of two risk factors (exposure to continuous traumatic stress and unemployment) and two psychological stress-related factors (resilience and coping) on individuals' emotional state during the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak. The data were collected using online questionnaire from 778 individuals in April 2020 during Israel's first lockdown. Israeli citizens who had been exposed for many years to recurrent missile attacks (n = 379) reported higher rates of anxiety and stress following the COVID-19 lockdown and lower rates of resilience, compared with those residing in regions not exposed to missile attacks. During the lockdown, unemployed participants (n = 416), in comparison with working respondents, reported more depression and stress, lower resilience, and greater use of behavioral and mental disengagement coping strategies. The results showed that resilience (beta = -.38, p &lt; .001) is associated with lower depression, anxiety, and stress, whereas the more frequent use of disengagement coping (beta = .31, p &lt; .001) is associated with higher depression, anxiety, and stress. Furthermore, resilience was shown to moderate the association between disengagement coping and emotional state. Findings suggest that exposure to continuous traumatic stress and unemployment may comprise potential risk factors for psychological difficulties during COVID-19 lockdown, whereas resilience and applying less disengagement coping can be considered protective factors. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement The study advances our understanding of how populations with a history of exposure to traumatic stress in conflict-ridden regions approach the COVID-19 crisis emotionally. The findings highlight the risk of continuing stress and unemployment and the protective role of resilience. The study may contribute to the design of interventions tailored to the needs of various vulnerable groups.

"The COVID-19 International Student Well-Being Study (C-19 ISWS) The Case of Cyprus","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a great impact on the mental health and well-being of different populations including young adults. This study replicates and extends previous research by evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the well-being of college students in Cyprus, a Mediterranean island with unique sociocultural and genetic characteristics, and to identify risk factors related to the poor mental health of university students. Behavioral changes in the students before and during the quarantine period were also examined. A total of 387 university students completed an online survey coordinated by the Young Universities of Europe (YUFE) network. Results indicated that most of the sample (89.3%) reported depressive symptoms. Academic stress and academic satisfaction were associated with depressive symptoms and loneliness. Specifically, students with greater academic stress and lower academic satisfaction reported more symptoms of depression and felt lonelier. Younger students with poorer economic capital were more likely to feel depressed, and younger college students with higher academic stress were more likely to feel lonely. The results of t-test analyses indicated that quarantine affected students' time and type of study turning to online studies and to moderate physical activities. The present study's findings add to the existing literature and support the development of new measures to support students, both financially as well as psychologically.","Solomou, I.; Constantinidou, F.; Karekla, M.; Psaltis, C.; Chatzittofis, A.","https://doi.org/10.1024/2673-8627/a000014","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: European Journal of Psychology Open;: 12, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Psychology Open;: 12, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19611,""
"Pre-sleep arousal and sleep quality during the COVID-19 lockdown in Italy","Objective The COVID-19 pandemic has strongly affected daily habits and psychological wellbeing, and many studies point to large modifications in several sleep and sleep-related domains. Nevertheless, pre-sleep arousal during the pandemic has been substantially overlooked. Since hyperarousal represents one of the main factors for the development and the perpetuation of chronic insomnia disorder, the assessment of variables associated with high levels of pre-sleep arousal during the pandemic is clinically relevant. The study aimed to assess the prevalence and predictors of perceived sleep quality and pre-sleep arousal in an Italian sample during the COVID-19 lockdown. Methods We used an online survey to collect self-reported sociodemographic, environmental, clinical, sleep, and sleep-related data. Our final sample included 761 participants. Results Beyond a high frequency of poor sleep quality, depressive and stress symptoms, our results show that almost half of the sample suffered from clinically relevant levels of at least one component (i.e., cognitive, somatic) of pre-sleep arousal. Subjects with greater pre-sleep arousal exhibited poorer sleep quality. Also, sleep quality was strongly associated with somatic and cognitive pre-sleep arousal. Regarding the predictors of sleep and sleep-related measures, depressive and event-related stress symptoms were the main factors associated with both poor sleep quality and pre-sleep arousal components. Moreover, specific sociodemographic and environmental variables were uniquely related to sleep quality, cognitive or somatic pre-sleep arousal. Conclusions These findings suggest that the assessment of specific sleep-related factors (i.e., pre-sleep arousal), together with more global measures of sleep quality, may be crucial to depict the complex impact of the pandemic on sleep, and to help prevent and counteract the spread of insomnia symptoms.","Gorgoni, Maurizio, Scarpelli, Serena, Mangiaruga, Anastasia, Alfonsi, Valentina, Bonsignore, Maria R.; Fanfulla, Francesco, Ferini-Strambi, Luigi, Nobili, Lino, Plazzi, Giuseppe, De Gennaro, Luigi, Arnaldi, Dario, Bonanni, Enrica, Bonetti, Giulio Alessandro, Castronovo, Cinzia, Maestri, Michelangelo, Garbarino, Sergio, Guarnieri, Biancamaria, Manni, Raffaele, Palagini, Laura, Puligheddu, Monica, Ferri, Raffaele, Silvani, Alessandro, Vicini, Claudio","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2021.10.006","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Sleep Medicine;2021.; Publication details: Sleep Medicine;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19612,""
"Evaluation of Anorexia and Analysis of Related Factors in Patients with COVID-19","Objective: COVID-19 may cause an anorexic situation. This in turn leads to underfeeding, puts the patient in an energy protein malnutrition state, develops the hyperinflammation, weakens the immunity, and makes COVID-19 conditions more dangerous. Meanwhile, the more severe inflammation conditions in the body, the more severe the anorexia, which in turn affect the disease severity. Studies evaluating appetite in COVID-19 patients are very rare;therefore, we evaluated anorexia and analyzed the related factors in patients with COVID-19. Material and Methods: In this cross sectional study, adult patientsâ€™ =18 years old with the positive real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction for COVID-19 were included. The patients were classified as mild, moderate, and severe based on the WHO classification. We measured the appetite score, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), depression and anxiety score, at admission for every patient. Results: A total of 301 patients participated in the study. The prevalence of admission anorexia was 58%, and this rate was significantly more in the severe group compared to the mild and moderate groups (P&lt;0.001). Comorbidities, depression and anxiety were independently correlated with anorexia risk [(OR=3.6, 95% CI 1.68- 7.70, P=0.001), (OR=1.23, 95% CI 1.16- 1.30, P&lt;0001), and (OR=1.24, 95% CI 1.17- 1.31, P&lt;0001)], respectively. This correlation was adherence to a U-shape association for BMI, which means BMI&lt;18.5 (OR=3.35, 95% CI 1.8- 10.42, P&lt;0001) and BMI =30 (OR=2.45, 95% CI 1.02- 6.53, P=0.048) were related to higher risk of anorexia. Conclusion: We reported a high prevalence of anorexia (58%) in COVID-19 patients, which was positively correlated with disease severity. Furthermore, any factor worsening inflammatory state, including underweight, obesity, comorbidities, depression and anxiety can exacerbate anorexia in these patients.","Shahbazi, Shaahin, Hajimohammadebrahim-Ketabforoush, Melika, Shariatpanahi, Maryam Vahdat, Shahbazi, Erfan, Shariatpanahi, Zahra Vahdat","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nupar.2021.08.001","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Nutrition Clinique et MÃ©tabolisme;2021.; Publication details: Nutrition Clinique et MÃ©tabolisme;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19613,""
"Motor skills dysfunction and fatigue persist after mild infection by SARS-CoV-2","Background and aims: Although neuropsychiatric manifestations have been reported after COVID-19, little is known about fine motor difficulties after mild infection. We evaluate fine motor impairment, fatigue, depression, anxiety and somnolence after COVID-19. Methods: We applied the 9-hole peg and the â€œbox and blocksâ€ tests to fine motor skills;and Hanoi tower test to evaluate executive functions. Individuals answered the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Chalder fatigue questionnaire (CFQ) and Epworth sleepiness Scale (ESS). We used SPSS26 with Mann-Whitney U-test to compare variables between groups and partial correlations to correlate the continuous variables. Results: We evaluated 23 subjects recovered from COVID-19 (after 4 months from diagnosis) (16 women;median of 39 years)) and 35 healthy controls (23 women;median 33 years) balanced for sex (p = 0.8), age (p = 0.3) and education (p = 0.6). COVID group presented excessive sleepiness (ESS, median 10 points (range 0â€“18)), and fatigue (CFQ, median 18 points (range 0â€“32)). Fatigue correlated with depression symptoms (r = 0.5;p = 0.018), with anxiety (r = 0.49;p = 0.021), and with sleepiness (r = 0.4;p = 0.06). COVID group was slower on the 9-Hole Peg Test for dominant (p = 0.004) and non-dominant hands (p = 0.002), and performed poorer on Box and blocks test (p = 0.047). They were slower on the Hanoi Tower test with 3 pieces (p = 0.04). Conclusions: We identified persistent neurological symptoms (mainly fatigue and somnolence) motor slowness and difficulties in patients with mild infection and without hospital treatment. Fatigue associated with other neuropsychiatric symptoms. The longitudinal evaluation and neuroimaging correlations in a larger sample may clarify the duration of deficits and the associated cerebral abnormalities.","Julia Mendes, M.; Cendes, F.; Yasuda, C.; Scardua Silva, L.; Alvim, M.; Aventurato, I.; Henrique Nogueira, M.; JoÃ£o, R.; Amorim Da Costa, B.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2021.119920","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Journal of the Neurological Sciences; 429, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of the Neurological Sciences; 429, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19614,""
"Sars-CoV2 pandemic and lockdown reported consequences on people with multiple sclerosis","Background and aims: During SARS-CoV-2 pandemic people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) may experience a worsening due to increased anxiety and depression, reduction in rehabilitation, and less strict connection to MS centres. The aim of our study was to describe the self-reported impact of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and lockdown on PwMS. Methods: On June 2020, we enrolled PwMS who underwent teleconsult during the lockdown phase (Marchâ€“May 2020). Self-rated worries for pandemic, perception of change in anxiety, depression, fatigue and spasticity was asked, as well as changes in weight, physical activity and food intake. We compared patients with and without reported increase in: spasticity, anxiety, depression and fatigue. Binary logistic regression analyses were applied including significant variables. Statistical significance was set at p &lt; 0.05. Results: Ninety-three MS patients were enrolled (71% female, 77% RR, median age 50.3 y, mean disease duration <U+2245>13 y). Many patients reported an increase of anxiety (36.6%), depression (34.4%), fatigue (26.9%) and, spasticity (18.3%), weight (47.3%) and 63.4% of patients reported e reduction of physical activity;moreover 59.1% and 43% reported particular worries for the pandemic and the perception of greater impact on PwMS of the pandemic compared to general population, respectively. In the multivariate models, anxiety was predicted by depression, particular worries for SARS-CoV2 pandemic and reduction in physical activity;depression by anxiety;fatigue by reduction in physical activity;spasticity by EDSS. Conclusions: The self-reported impact of pandemic on PwMS was deep in terms of increased depression, anxiety, fatigue and spasticity, mainly related to reduction in physical activity and pre-existing disability.","Sartori, A.; Dinoto, A.; Pasquin, F.; Baldini, S.; Bratina, A.; Bosco, A.; Manganotti, P.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2021.119831","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Journal of the Neurological Sciences; 429, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of the Neurological Sciences; 429, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19615,""

Patients with previous cognitive disorders were excluded. Three months after ICU discharge, patients underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation and filled out validated questionnaires. Results: Seven of 22 resulted mildly cognitively impaired. Memory was the most impaired domain, followed by attention and verbal fluency. Three out of 22 patients reported an average high level of anxiety but no depression. Quality of life was mild impaired for 19 patients. Lower performances at MoCA were related to higher APACHE score at T0 (r = -.44;p &lt;.04). Lower performances in working memory, short- and long-term memory and verbal fluency were correlated to longer ICU stay, duration of mechanical ventilation and longer treatment with opioid and antipsychotics drugs (rs &gt; -.48;ps &lt;.04). Long term memory performances were related to higher Sequential Organ Failure assessment (SOFA) score and longer treatment with propofol and benzodiazepines (rs &gt; -.53;ps &lt;.02). Higher patientâ€™s anxiety was correlated to higher psychological distress of the caregiver (r = -.64;p &lt;.001). Higher SOFA score is related to lower caregiver quality of life and lower satisfaction with information received (rs &gt; -.53;ps &lt;.02). Conclusions: At 3 months from ICU admission, cognitive and psychological distress sequelae can be observed in SARS-CoV2 ICU patients.","Sambati, L.; Mattarozzi, K.; Mascia, L.; Tonetti, T.; Santoro, R.; Cretella, L.; Della Giovampaola, M.; Bottausci, P.; Romano, L.; Cortelli, P.; Guarino, M.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2021.119792","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Journal of the Neurological Sciences; 429, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of the Neurological Sciences; 429, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19616,""
"Enhancing memory and quality of life through novel home-based neuropsychological rehabilitation for epilepsy: A randomized controlled trial","Background and aims: Memory impairment in epilepsy is a critical determinant of Quality of Life (QoL). Subjective complaints may reflect depression. 6-week home based Neuropsychological Rehabilitation (NR) program was developed for patients with Drug Refractory Epilepsy (DRE) [Post-Operative (PO) & Not Cleared for Surgery (NCS)]. This includes psychoeducation, compensatory training and cognitive retraining aimed at improving memory. Neuropsychological outcomes were studied. Methods: 27 adults with DRE were recruited in a single blind RCT (CTRI/2019/10/021777) with 14 patients in the Intervention (IG) (PO = 13, NCS = 1), and 13 in the Treatment As Usual (TAU) (PO = 11, NCS = 2) groups. They were aged 18â€“45 years with minimum primary level of education, IQ &gt; 80 and available primary caregiver. Pre-post neuropsychological assessment included Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Everyday Memory Questionnaire (EMQ), Hamilton Depression Inventory and Quality of Life in Epilepsy-31. Due to COVID-19, a booster session (focused on internal & external aids) was given at 3 months and all follow-ups were done through tele-assessment at 6 months. Results: At baseline, there was no significant difference between the groups on objective and subjective measures. Linear regression analysis post adjustment for depression at follow-up revealed a significant difference between the groups on objective cognitive measures of learning (p = 0.019), delayed recall (p = 0.003), retention (p = 0.045) with IG showing higher performance. Similar results were noted for subjective measures of EMQ (p = 0.001) and cognitive (p = 0.001), seizure freedom (p = 0.030), overall QoL (p = 0.046) subdomains of QoL with its total score (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Despite depression, IG reported higher performance on objective tests, lower subjective complaints and better QoL at long term follow-up.","Sharma, S.; Nehra, A.; Tripathi, M.; Chandra, P.

"Behavioral and psychological symptoms in dementia, often reversibile conditions","Background and aims: In the later stages of dementia some people with develops what's known as behavioural and psycological sympotoms of dementia, BSPD. Sympotoms of BPSD can include increased agitation, agression, delusions, hallucinations, sleep disturbance and night-time waking. Behaviour changes could be caused by brain-related issues or from changes to someone's environment, health or medication. Methods: Dementia is an umbrella term used to describe a group of symptoms that affect brains work. Many conditions, such as stroke, depression, infections, as well as normal ageing, can cause dementia-like symptoms. We describe 120 patients than have been admitted in the emergency setting because of acute symptoms. We examinated the patients to see if they have any infection, pain constipation, depression or side-effects of their medicine that could be contributing to or causing the behaviors change. Results: The mean age was 81,68 women and 52 men. Hypertension was present in 96 and vascular changes in the brain were found in the neuroimaging. 78 patients had reversibile symptoms of dementia due to such conditions: urinary infection, hydrataion, costipation, fever and Covid infection. Conclusions: Dementia is always changing and unique for each person. Everyday life can be a stressful ordeal for a person with a dementia-related disorder. As the disease progresses, behaviors changes can occur. The pandemic worsened such situation. It is important in the acute setting to rule out any concomitant illness that can cause or worsen behavioral and psychological symptoms in dementia.","Nucera, A.; Vazzana, M.; Papa, M.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2021.119050","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Journal of the Neurological Sciences; 429, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of the Neurological Sciences; 429, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19618,""
"Movement disorders in emergencies","Movement disorder emergencies refer to clinical scenarios, evolving acutely or subacutely in which the clinical presentation is dominated by a primary movement disorder, and failures to accurately diagnose and manage the patient may result in significant morbidity or even mortality. Whilst this entity may seem to be relatively uncommon compared to other medical emergencies, the last two decades have seen increasing recognition of various movement disorder emergencies as recognised in the literature to include such diverse entities from acute forms of parkinsonism, chorea, dystonia, myoclonus, and tics to acute abnormal movements manifestations in those with underlying disorders like Wilson's disease, NMDA-receptor antibody encephalitis, and several acquired disorders. In this session, important not-to-miss emergencies will be divided into hypokinetic, hyperkinetic, and movement disorder conditions with neuropsychiatric emergencies. The presentation of each example will be supported by video illustrations with the objectives to highlight clinical features, precipitating factors, prodromal symptoms or signs that are associated with specific forms of movement disorder emergencies as well as management strategies. During this pandemic era, examples of movement disorder emergencies related to COVID-19 infection will also be presented and discussed.","Bhidayasiri, R.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2021.117938","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Journal of the Neurological Sciences; 429, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of the Neurological Sciences; 429, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19619,""
"Improving sentiment analysis accuracy with emoji embedding","Due to the diversity and variability of Chinese syntax and semantics, accurately identifying and distinguishing individual emotions from online texts is challenging. To overcome this limitation, we incorporate a new source of individual sentiment, emojis, which contain thousands of graphic symbols and are increasingly being used for expressing emotion in online conversations. We examined popular sentiment analysis algorithms, including rule-based and classification algorithms, to evaluate the impact of supplementing emojis as additional features to improve the algorithm performance. Emojis were also translated into corresponding sentiment words when constructing features for comparison with those directly generated from emoji label words. In addition, considering different functions of emojis in texts, we classified all posts in the dataset by their emoji usage and examined the changes in algorithm performance. We found that emojis are effective as expanding features for improving the accuracy of sentiment analysis algorithms, and the algorithm performance can be further increased by taking different emoji usages into consideration. In this study, we developed an improved emoji-embedding model based on Bi-LSTM (namely, CEmo-LSTM), which achieves the highest accuracy (around 0.95) when analyzing online Chinese texts. We applied the CEmo-LSTM algorithm to a large dataset collected from Weibo from December 1, 2019 to March 20, 2020 to understand the sentiment evolution of online users during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that the pandemic remarkably impacted individual sentiments and caused more passive emotions (e.g., horror and sadness). Our novel emoji-embedding algorithm creatively combined emojis as well as emoji usage with the sentiment analysis model and can handle emotion mining tasks more effectively and efficiently.","Liu, Chuchu, Fang, Fan, Lin, Xu, Cai, Tie, Tan, Xu, Liu, Jianguo, Lu, Xin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnlssr.2021.10.003","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Safety Science and Resilience;2021.; Publication details: Journal of Safety Science and Resilience;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19620,""
"Treating Women with Endometriosis-Associated Pain during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Study Objective The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the world in unforeseen ways, particularly healthcare. This study evaluated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women with endometriosis-associated pain, including its influence on quality of life, healthcare access, and pain symptoms. Design This is a cross-sectional study using an online, anonymous 30-question survey. Women were invited to participate via e-mail or invitations posted on the Facebook page for MyEndometriosisTeam (a social network support group for women living with the disease) between December 9, 2020, to January 31, 2021. Setting United States (US). Patients or Participants 155 women with a self-reported history of endometriosis, 21yrs or older, living in the US completed the survey. Interventions None. This was an observational study. Measurements and Main Results Most women (76%) were 30-49 years old, 51% had daily pain symptoms, 25% experiencing pain a few times a week. Of a separate group of women who reported that that their endometriosis-associated pain worsened since the beginning of the pandemic (52%), the most common triggers for worsening pain were stress (80%), fatigue (74%), depression/anxiety (71%), financial concerns (45%), inability to undergo surgery (40%) and inability to exercise (38%). More than a third of women conveyed (38%) challenges with obtaining prescription medications and scheduling surgeries. Of the 17% for whom surgery was postponed, 50% of the women reported this as indefinite. Women's concerns about their endometriosis in relation to COVID-19 included whether it makes COVID-19 symptoms worst (53%), whether they are at a greater risk of acquiring COVID-19 (44%), and whether it is safe to visit a doctor/hospital (28%). Only 32% spoke with their doctor about treating their pain and 35% had no interaction with their doctor during the pandemic. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has had a multifaceted impact on women with endometriosis, from worsened endometriosis-associated pain due to stress and reduced quality of life, challenges with prescriptions/surgeries, and financial concerns.","Carrillo, J.

"Impact of COVID-19 mitigation measures on inner-city female youth in New York City","Purpose New York City (NYC) was the global epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020. A â€œshelter in placeâ€ mandate was issued in March 2020. The effect on vulnerable populations of adolescent and young adult (AYA) females has not been well documented. Methods We administered a monthly online survey between May and November 2020 to AYA females participating in a longitudinal study at Mount Sinai Adolescent Health Center. Surveys asked about death of loved ones, financial impacts, social interactions, exposure to dangerous situations, and mental health impacts. Differences in responses by age, race/ethnicity and living situation were assessed, and compared to data obtained on the same cohort prior to the pandemic. Results 417 females aged 15-28 years completed at least one survey, 94% of whom were youth of color. A third of responders (33%) had lost relatives or other people they were close to (loved ones). Most (68%) reported one or more financial losses, and 21% reported food insecurity, with those not living with parents or a guardian experiencing significantly higher rates. One in ten reported experiencing sexual abuse or interpersonal partner violence during the â€œshelter in placeâ€ period. Over a third (37%) reported symptoms of clinical depression, which represented a significant increase compared to before the pandemic (p=0.01). The negative financial impacts and higher proportion of patients with depressive symptomatology remained elevated for adolescents without support at home. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic had unprecedented negative short-term financial and psychosocial health impacts on inner-city female youth with potential long-term negative impacts.","Diaz, Angela, Nucci-Sack, Anne, Colon, Rachel, Guillot, Mary, Hollman, Dominic, Brunelli, Marie, Burk, Robert D.; Schlecht, Nicolas F.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.10.015","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Adolescent Health;2021.; Publication details: Journal of Adolescent Health;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19622,""
"An Innovative Approach to Address the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Shortage: Extended Consultation Model","Objectives: Novel approaches are needed to address the shortage of child and adolescent psychiatry providers in the United States. As of 2018, 1 in 5 children in the United States have a mental, emotional, or behavioral disorder, yet only 20% of those children receive care from a specialized mental health provider. Exacerbation of child and adolescent mental health problems were evident amidst the COVID-19 pandemic;from mid-March to October 2020, the proportion of pediatric emergency department visits that were mental healthâ€“related rose by 44%. The Massachusetts Child Psychiatry Access Program (MCPAP) provides one-time consultation from a child and adolescent psychiatry provider to support primary care providers (PCPs) in treating mental health patients. However, PCPs continue to feel overwhelmed regarding the ongoing lack of direct care by specialists that is often necessary for complex mental health cases. Inspired by the Chronic Care Model, we propose an extended consultation model that includes 6 to 9 months of evaluation, treatment initiation, and reevaluation with treatment plan adjustments as indicated by a child and adolescent psychiatry provider with subsequent referral back to the PCP after stabilization. Methods: We conducted a prospective longitudinal study that evaluated the time from referral to child and adolescent psychiatry care access based on referral of 50 patients ages 5 to 17 to this specialized clinic. To track clinical improvement, relevant treatment scales were compared. Results: We found that the average duration from referral to care access was 13.5 days with a range of 0 to 63 days and median of 7 with the 25th percentile at 4 and 75th percentile at 18. The Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED) score provided the most analyzable data, and by performing a t test, we found that the score decreased by an average of 4.8 after 3 months of treatment (p = 0.0126). Conclusions: Overall, our study shows that an extended consultation model can be used to increase access to quality child and adolescent psychiatry care. There needs to be more similar studies that can ascertain the promise of this study.

"The Effect of an Ongoing Pandemic on Mental Health Service Requests","Objectives: The aim of this study was to describe the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on a group of community clinics. Methods: Bay Area Clinical Associates (BACA) serves the majority of the San Francisco Bay Area and provides outpatient and intensive outpatient (IOP) services for youth aged 26 years and under, and their caregivers. BACA employs a multidisciplinary team of mental health practitioners (child and adolescent psychiatrists, psychologists, therapists, and trainees) in 3 different physical locations. Secondary to the pandemic, all services were converted to telehealth beginning in April of 2020. To assess the impact of an extended pandemic on youth mental health, service requests to the agency for the year prior to the pandemic were compared to requests received during the pandemic. In addition, we compared how often the pandemic was mentioned in appointment requests from April 2020 through September 2020 (first 6 months) as compared to October 2020 through March 2021 (next 6 months). Results: In the year prior to the pandemic (April 2019 through March 2020), there was a total of 1757 requests for services, with 648 (36.9%) for IOP services. For the pandemic year (April 2020 through March 2021), there were 2617 new service requests, with 735 (28.1%) for IOP services. Although this represents a 48.9% increase in service requests, the proportion of requests for higher-intensity IOP services was significantly lower (<U+03C7>2 = 37.6;p &lt; 0.0001). For comparison, the number of requests for services from April 2018 to March 2019 was 1830, with 617 (33.7%) IOP requests. The 4.0% decrease in service requests between 2018 and 2019 suggests that the pandemic was the primary factor for the massive increase in service requests during the first year of the pandemic. During the first 6 months of the pandemic, 94/1067 (8.8%) requests mentioned COVID-19 or its effects vs only 72/1549 (4.7%) during the next 6 months (<U+03C7>2 = 18.4, p &lt; 0.0001). Conclusions: Almost every news story since April 2020 has discussed mental health. The pandemic appears to be the primary cause for a massive surge in new mental health requests for youth, although specific mention of the pandemic in service requests has decreased. Unfortunately, our already strained mental healthcare system does not have the capacity to correctly address this need. Radical solutions, on many levels, are needed to ensure proper mental health care for our youth.

"Building Resilience and Attachment in Vulnerable Adolescents (BRAVA): Piloting a Virtual Adaptation of a Brief Group Intervention for Adolescents With Mild-to-Moderate Suicidal Ideation and Their Caregivers","Objectives: Suicidal ideation (SI) is common in adolescents and increases the risk of completed suicide. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers rapidly shifted to providing telehealth and virtual options for clients. Building Resilience and Attachment in Vulnerable Adolescents (BRAVA) is a group intervention designed for adolescents and their caregivers to reduce adolescent SI. The objective of this study was to adapt BRAVA for virtual delivery and evaluate the feasibility of this adaptation. Methods: We conducted an 8-week open trial between October and December 2020. Twelve participants (6 adolescents and 6 primary caregivers) were recruited from a pediatric hospital in Eastern Ontario. Through Zoom, adolescents and caregivers completed an intake assessment together, 6 weekly BRAVA group sessions separately, and an exit assessment together 1-week post-BRAVA. The primary adolescent outcome variable was the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire Junior (SIQ-JR). Data were analyzed in IBM SPSS v.27. Pre-post comparisons on the SIQ-JR were done with a 2-tailed t test for matched pairs. Results: The study uptake rate was 42.9% of the eligible participants. There were no study dropouts. Adolescent (Mean [M] age = 15.3 years;SD age = 1.0;66.7% female) and caregiver attendance rates for BRAVA group sessions were high (median = 6). Overall group satisfaction scores were high for adolescents (M = 4.2;SD = 0.8) and their caregivers (M = 4.2;SD = 0.7). Most youth (83.4%) and caregivers (66.7%) reported that the virtual process worked well. Whereas all caregivers (100%) agreed they would participate in a virtual group session again, youth responses were more variable (50% agree, 33.3% neutral, 16.7% disagree). Adolescent SI decreased after completing the intervention (M pretreatment [tx] = 50.7, SD pretreatment [tx] = 16.7;M post-tx = 29.7, SD post-tx = 20.4;t = 5.7;95% CI, 11.52-30.5;p = 0.002). Conclusions: Study results indicate that the virtual delivery of BRAVA is feasible. Study uptake was good, retention was complete, and satisfaction was high for adolescents and their caregivers. Importantly, initial results suggest that this adaptation of BRAVA may help reduce SI in adolescents. Feedback from participants will inform further changes to improve the adaptation of BRAVA for use in a planned RCT.

"Cannabis Vaping in Adolescents: A Review of Prevalence, Comorbidities, Appraisal of Lung Injury, and Long-Term Complications","Objectives: As of 2020, there were 2807 hospitalizations for electronic cigarette (e-cigarette)- or vaping-associated lung injury (EVALI) reported to the CDC, of which 15% were adolescents. As per a 2020 NIDA survey, there was a twofold increase in marijuana vaping in adolescents from 2017 to 2019. Recent studies have shown associations between marijuana smoking or vaping with bronchitis, increased risk of respiratory infections, and acute lung injury. Eighty-five percent of patients with vaping-associated lung injury had tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or its metabolites in alveolar fluid samples. The objective of this study is to review the available literature on cannabis vaping in adolescents and understand the possible risks and pulmonary complications of vaping. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of literature using PubMed with keywords â€œcannabisâ€ OR â€œmarijuana,â€ â€œvapingâ€ OR ""e-cigarettes,"" â€œlung injuryâ€ OR â€œpneumonia,â€ in all fields. We included RCTs, cross-sectional studies, longitudinal studies, review articles, and case reports published until December 2020. The search resulted in 63 articles. After filtering for children and adolescents, 15 articles (2 cross-sectional surveys, 1 retrospective cohort, 7 case series or reports, 4 review articles, and 1 novel mental health metric) were identified for abstract and full paper review. We are currently conducting retrospective chart reviews of patients admitted to a tertiary care childrenâ€™s hospital for lung infection or injury. Results: Upon review of the selected 15 articles, there were no relevant longitudinal studies, which focused on the adolescents with e-cigarette- and cannabis-associated lung injuries or pneumonia. Out of the works that included adolescents, many focused on and surveyed only adults. The literature from PubMed about adolescent cannabis vaping was limited to a few case reports and case series. Conclusions: There are no comprehensive studies that have rigorously investigated cannabis vaping in adolescents. There needs to be more investigations into how e-cigarettes containing THC affects the adolescent population. Many complications have been associated with vaping of cannabis, nicotine, and combined products, such as COVID-19 susceptibility, EVALI, and pain and sedative management. More research needs to be done to explore these connections, especially in adolescents. ADOL, SUD, CM","Huynh, E.

"Psychological IMPACT of Remote Learning in Children and Adolescents With Mental Health Disorders in the Community New York City Area","Objectives: The global crisis of COVID-19 demanded that schools adapt to online education at an unprecedented pace. Remote learning has followed social distancing protocols and helped in continuation of education. However, in children with mental health disorders (C-MHD), the outcomes of online learning are not similar to normal individuals. The primary objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of psychological distress of transitioning to remote learning in C-MHD. The secondary objective is to provide directions to increase student satisfaction for online education. Methods: An IRB-approved cross-sectional analysis was done on children aged 5 to 17 years (N = 172), including 87 boys (50.6%) and 85 girls (49.4%), from January to May 2021, at South Bronx Community Hospital, NY. A total of 111 children were Hispanic (65%) and 53 were African American (31%). Structured questionnaires were used by residents/fellows to determine effects of remote learning on children. A <U+03C7>2 test was used to analyze the data, and p values were calculated across the variables of remote learning and psychiatric diagnosis of MDD, ADHD, and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Results: Our analysis showed that 105 (61%) of C-MHD students struggled to learn remotely compared to in-person learning (more children with MDD [20.35%, p &lt; 0.05] as compared to GAD and ADHD). Due to long screen hours, more felt distracted (37%) than tired (14.5%). More felt sad (17%) than happy (0.06%), and 21.5% felt anxious. More children with GAD (42% vs 27%) as compared to MDD (35% vs 24%), rated e-learning as good. More children with ADHD (35% vs 30.6%) did not like e-learning. More children with MDD (26%, p &lt; 0.05) reported feeling safe from COVID-19 in e-learning than did children with GAD (23%) and ADHD (17%). Conclusions: During the pandemic, C-MHD patients presenting to the emergency department with anxiety, aggression, and irritability have increased dramatically, where one of the main precipitating stressors was the inability to transition to remote learning.

"Trajectories of Contamination-Related Fears During the Pandemic Among Adolescents: The Role of Baseline Anxiety and Depression","Objectives: As concerns about the mortality and morbidity associated with COVID-19 wane, the mental health consequences of the pandemic are gaining attention. Studies have shown that the prevalence of depression and anxiety have grown among youth over the past year, which has been attributed largely to stress and isolation. Less attention has been paid to how concerns related to being infected with COVID-19, along with guidelines for mask wearing, hand washing, and sanitizing objects, may have led to compulsive washing rituals, which are symptoms present in OCD. It is also critical to identify vulnerability factors, including preexisting anxiety and/or depression. The goal of this study was to examine contamination fears among community adolescents over the first year of the pandemic. Methods: Adolescent participants (aged 14-22 years) were recruited through social media in late March/early April 2020. Consenting participants completed self-reports including the contamination subscale of the Dimensional Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (DOCS), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) every 2 months. Multilevel models, controlling for age and gender, assessed the trajectory of contamination-related fears from April 2020 to April 2021. Results: Participants (N = 332) were 16.5 years old on average, and 88% were female. Only 3 reported having a diagnosis of OCD at baseline. Across the sample, contamination-related fears were highest in April 2020 (M = 12.61;SD = 3.6) and reduced at each follow-up. Participants who reported experiencing significant symptoms of GAD or depression at baseline experienced elevated contamination-related fears at every time point (ÃŸ = 0.14, p = 0.001 for anxiety;and ÃŸ = 0.07, p = 0.03 for depression). Even in April 2021, youth with anxiety (M = 8.97) or depression (M = 8.58) reported contamination-related fears. Conclusions: Adolescentsâ€™ mental health has been affected by the pandemic;depression and anxiety have been a focus, but symptoms of other mental health concerns have been exacerbated. Contamination-related concerns can perpetuate anxiety and depression;youth fearful of COVID-19 infection may be more isolated and less able to resume typical activities. Considering the full spectrum of mental health domains affected by the pandemic will be important to aiding youth experiencing the mental health sequelae of COVID-19.

"The Model Minority and Its Impact on Asian American Development: A Literature Review","Objectives: The concept of the â€œmodel minority mythâ€ (MMM), a stereotype that Asian Americans have more academic success and social mobility compared to other people of color, has been a prominent point of discussion during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the increase in discrimination against Asian Americans (even children). This literature review aims to pinpoint the positive and negative impacts of the stereotype on Asian American development, then expands the discussion to include how COVID-19 may change this dialogue. Methods: A PubMed search for the phrase â€œmodel minorityâ€ was conducted, searching for studies from 2001 to 2021 investigating how the MMM affects Asian development and health. These studies were then categorized by the age group of the participants and the themes of the paper. Results: The PubMed search returned 71 results, 28 of which were excluded due to not discussing the MMM (18) or not being a study (10). The eligible studies largely fell into 2 categories: 1) the integration of the MMM into personal identity (12);and 2) mental healthcare disparities due to the MMM (25). The former category described positive effects of the MMM like a greater drive to academically succeed, although they were outweighed by multiple negative factors including decreased help-seeking behavior, pressure to meet lofty expectations, and increased anti-Black attitudes. The majority of the latter category stated how the MMM directly contributed to the underutilization of mental health services given sociocultural expectations across all age groups. Conclusions: These data highlight how the MMM can both worsen the mental health of Asian American youth while discouraging the pursuit of treatment. Asian American youth are especially at risk for the negative consequences of the stereotype given their dependence on family. That said, the recent press regarding anti-Asian racism during the pandemic may impact how the MMM is discussed in the future, questioning its validity. SREG, CUL, DEV","Lee, J.

"CHILDREN AND GUN VIOLENCE DURING THE PANDEMIC","Objectives: Nationwide, adolescents and young adults are at highest risk for death and injury by gunshot wound. Black youth are at the highest risk of gunshot wound as a result of assault, and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth are at highest risk for gunshot wound as a result of a suicide attempt. There is evidence that youth-involved gun violence has increased during the pandemic. This session will explore the history of youth-involved gun violence, changes in gun violence during the COVID-19 pandemic, and therapeutic considerations about gun violence. Methods: This session will be organized around themes of â€œdysregulationâ€â€”how gun violence affects the lives of youth and how we respond to it as child and adolescent psychiatrists. For the theme of community dysregulation, Renuka Patel, MBBS, and Jennifer Zaspel, MD, will explore the history and epidemiology of youth-involved gun violence and look at changes during the pandemic. Alison M. Duncan, MD, will describe hospital and community response programs to promote recovery from gun violence and prevent future victimization. For the theme of individual dysregulation, Eva Ihle, MD, PhD, and Dr. Patel will present case vignettes and a literature review that will explore emotional and behavioral dysregulation before gun violence occurs (coping through affiliation and risk-taking behavior) and afterward (the sequelae of PTSD, a sense of foreshortened future, anger, and hopelessness). Inpatient acute rehabilitation and outpatient programs to promote posttraumatic growth and resilience in gunshot wound survivors will be discussed. Results: After this Clinical Perspectives session, participants will be able to: 1) discuss epidemiological changes in gun violence involving children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic;2) recognize acute clinical needs for children and adolescents who are hospitalized for gunshot wounds;3) discuss gun safety with families;and 4) identify community supports and rehab resources for children and adolescents in postacute recovery from gun violence. Conclusions: Youth-involved gun violence has increased since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Gun violence is something that child and adolescent psychiatrists can address in the clinic, in the hospital, in their communities, and in politics. Terry Lee, MD, will discuss the roles that child and adolescent psychiatrists can take to reduce these tragic outcomes in our youth. Jeanette Scheid, MD, will discuss child maltreatment exposure and gun violence. AGG, EPI, PUP","Duncan, A. M.; Lee, T. G.; Scheid, J.

"PSYCHOTHERAPY WITH MEDICALLY ILL CHILDREN: EARLY CHILDHOOD TO TRANSITIONAL-AGE YOUTH IN 2021","Objectives: This session aims to equip attendees with selected psychotherapeutic tools for the mental health assessment and treatment of medically ill children and adolescents situated in a developmental framework. Methods: Participants will have an opportunity to discuss the effects of medical illness on development from early childhood through adolescent and young adult (AYA) age groups. They will learn about therapeutic interventions with young medically ill children aged 0-6 years and their families. Presenters will share experiences on establishing remote services on the pediatric unit and emergency service with medically ill children during the pandemic and discuss bedside psychotherapy strategies. Participants will also have an opportunity to learn about psychotherapeutic strategies regarding chronic illness themes in the AYA age group, leading up to and including end-of-life care. Results: Participants will gain a new understanding of the effects of medical illness on development from early childhood through AYA age groups. Methods of psychotherapeutic engagement are evolving, whether due to forced adaptations during the COVID-19 pandemic or through recently developed psychotherapeutic tools from parent-child interaction, dignity, and meaning-centered psychotherapies for patients and families. Effective psychotherapeutic applications across the pediatric continuum of care are essential for optimal implementation and outcomes. Conclusions: Children and adolescents remain subject to chronic and terminal medical illnesses with comorbid mental health conditions and considerations. Even as medical advances have extended life expectancies, the need for relevant, practical, and effective delivery of psychotherapeutic interventionsâ€”both in person and virtualâ€”has also increased. Child and adolescent psychiatrists are advised to be current with helpful treatment modalities in their roles as psychotherapists and multidisciplinary treatment team leaders working in settings with medically ill youth.

"REACHING FOR RESILIENCE: NEW DATA ON OVERCOMING ADVERSITY IN YOUTH","Objectives: As appreciation for the role of adversity and trauma in the development of psychopathology has risen, so has the need to better understand resilience and how to enhance it. The goal of this session is to update attendees on new research in the area of resilience with an emphasis on the methods to increase it through interventions and education. Methods: New data from multiple study designs, settings, and ages will be presented. Samples used for this Symposium include: 1) high-risk newborns and toddlers, including a twin sample, many of whom were born into poverty and had histories of maltreatment and were followed prospectively;2) 39 classrooms of young children who received 0, 10, or 20 weeks of early childhood mental health consultation;3) a sample of 484 older adolescent college students who completed daily ratings of mental health and wellness prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic using a smartphone app;and 4) another sample of 88 college students, some of whom were taught specific resilience skills in an undergraduate class. Results: Prospective data from the high-risk samples of newborns and toddlers reveal more favorable long-term outcomes for those at risk than are often assumed. Classroom mental health consultation was found to improve the classroom climate in young children, especially with longer intervention periods. For college students, those taught resilience skills showed improved coping skills, decreased stress, and a reduction in dysfunctional attitudes. In another college sample, specific personality traits, some of which had not been previously associated with resilience, were found to buffer against the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: These presentations reveal a more hopeful picture for those who have experienced trauma and adversity than is sometimes assumed in discussions of toxic stress. Further, specific resilience-focused interventions can be successful at both the individual and group levels and across different ages. Data also suggest that some resilience factors should not be considered universal and may instead vary based upon the particular characteristics of the stressor itself. PRE, WL, SC","Rettew, D.

"MOVING UPSTREAM: PRIMARY AND SECONDARY PREVENTION STRATEGIES TO MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF EXPOSURE TO ADVERSE EXPERIENCES IN EARLY CHILDHOOD","Objectives: National surveys indicate worsening mental health symptoms among parents during the COVID-19 pandemic, exacerbated by stressors including caregiving burden, social isolation, and lack of financial resources. Low-income families and families from Black and Brown communities, where the pandemicâ€™s economic and health effects are most acute, may be particularly vulnerable to emotional distress impacting caregivers. Caregiver stress and mental health problems are modifiable risk factors highly correlated to early childhood social-emotional development and increase vulnerability to disrupted attachment and maladaptive parenting. This Symposium presents emerging findings from 4 empirically based preventative interventions. Methods: Presenters describe promising new research findings from 4 initiatives with high-risk families that: 1) identify at birth and provide resources to families at elevated risk for maltreatment in a prospective clinical study emphasizing tolerability, feasibility, and engagement, for which the final phase is a randomized controlled trial;2) promote caregiver-infant bonding in a clinical sample of depressed mothers, using methods validated in Circle of Security;3) initiate a proof-of-concept and feasibility study using video feedback in primary care to screen and educate caregivers around parent-child interactions;and 4) implement a parent mindfulness training program in preschools for reduction of stress and mental health symptoms in parents, using a mixed-methods open-label design. Results: Across 4 projects demonstrating new clinical research data, presenters share examples of preventative interventions showing feasibility, engagement, and effectiveness, with noteworthy benefits for underserved families via delivery in a range of clinical and nonclinical settings. Conclusions: Despite stressors exacerbated by the pandemic, these novel projects demonstrate with new research findings that high-risk families with infants and young children can be engaged in a range of psychosocial supports toward prevention of maltreatment, improvement in bonding with Circle of Security, assessment and tailored video feedback around parent-child interactions delivered in primary care, and mindfulness to improve caregiver mental health.

"COMPARING TECHNOLOGY USE BETWEEN OLDER TEENAGERS AND MILLENNIALS, TESTING PREDICTIVE MODELS USING TECHNOLOGY MEDIATOR VARIABLES, AND ASSESSING AND EXAMINING THE IMPACT OF INTERVENTIONS TO REDUCE OBSESSIVE SMARTPHONE USAGE","Objectives: The aims of this session are to: 1) compare self-report and app-reported measures of smartphone use between older teenagers and millennials;2) examine the impact of affective and cognitive variables in predicting a variety of constructs (sleep quality, academic performance, stress, anxiety, depression) as mediated by technology use;and 3) assess the efficacy of interventions to reduce technology use. Note that some observations were collected before and during COVID-19 at-home instruction, providing a serendipitous opportunity to examine smartphone usage as a function of the pandemic educational demands. This was not a study variable and involved limited data. Methods: For each study, online surveys assessed self-reported technology use, app-reported smartphone use, social media use, digital metacognition, executive functioning problems, technological anxiety (nomophobia), and multitasking preference. Most studies also assessed a variety of affective, cognitive, and technology use variables. Some included an intervention to reduce screen time. Results: Although the most recent data are currently being analyzed, studies demonstrated that both older teenagers (17-18 years) and millennials (Mage = 25 years) showed the same pattern of daily smartphone unlocks and daily smartphone minutes, indicating that they averaged approximately 70 daily unlocks for 265 smartphone minutes. Interventions changed smartphone use during the intervention but reverted to baseline soon thereafter. Models demonstrated the impact of both cognitive and affective variables on sleep, academic performance and depression, stress and anxiety as mediated by smartphone use, and social media use and digital metacognition for millennials and older teenagers. Conclusions: 1) Smartphone usage is increasing for both millennials and older teenagers. 2) Affective and cognitive variables do indeed predict sleep quality, academic performance and stress, and anxiety and depression, and they are powerfully mediated by social media use, smartphone use, and digital metacognition. 3) Efforts to ameliorate these smartphone usage behaviors failed to enact even temporary changes when the interventions were removed.

"REMOTE COACHING AND TECHNOLOGY FOR TRAINING COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS TO TREAT DEPRESSION IN PRIMARY CARE: CASE EXAMPLE FROM INDIA AND OPPORTUNITIES TO SCALE UP MENTAL HEALTH CARE GLOBALLY","Objectives: Depression is a leading cause of disability that disproportionately impacts low- and middle-income countries. With greater likelihood of access to a mobile phone than mental health care in most countries, there may be opportunities to leverage these digital tools toward increasing access to depression care. We present a case example from the ESSENCE project in India using digital technology to build capacity of community health workers (CHWs), the essential workforce responsible for frontline maternal and child health services in the country, to deliver a brief evidence-based psychological treatment for depression in primary care. Methods: We discuss key considerations in the design and evaluation of the digital training program, with emphasis on strategies to overcome poor mobile connectivity in rural and underresourced settings, and ensuring participant engagement. We describe the systematic approach to tailor the program to meet the needs of the target user group of CHWs. This involved careful design of the digital program and adapting the training content to the local culture and context. We also describe the use of remote coaching and other support techniques to promote engagement and completion of the training program. Results: We present findings from a pilot study with 42 CHWs that directly informed refinements to the training program and design of a subsequent randomized controlled trial enrolling 340 CHWs. We illustrate the progression from formative research to a larger trial, and the integration of remote coaching support, text messaging, and automated reminders within the digital program to promote engagement. We describe how these efforts are informing the design of a digital platform for training frontline health workers to deliver brief psychological treatments in other settings, including the United States. Conclusions: This example of reciprocal learning in global mental health is particularly timely given the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and renewed efforts to train and support frontline health workers to meet the anticipated surge in mental health challenges globally. This study could yield a blueprint for using widely available digital technology for training and supporting frontline health workers toward scaling up mental health services in India and globally.

"IMPROVING ACCESS TO PSYCHOSOCIAL INTERVENTIONS FOR PERINATAL DEPRESSION IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES: LESSONS FROM THE FIELD","Objectives: Over 90% of women with perinatal depression in low- and middle-income countries do not receive treatment. Scale-up of evidence-based psychosocial interventions is a key challenge. We developed the Thinking Healthy Program (THP), a psychosocial intervention that can be delivered by nonspecialist providers such as community health workers in primary and secondary care settings. Methods: A number of trials have been conducted on the THP, which have established its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in diverse settings. In the original trial based on 903 women, results at 6 months postnatal showed that 77% of intervened mothers (vs 47% of the nonintervened group) recovered from depression (adjusted OR = 0.22;95% CI, 0.14-0.36;p &lt; 0.0001). This effect was sustained at 12 months postnatal. More recently, we pooled data from 2 new trials with a total of 850 women across Pakistan and India. Mothers in the intervention arm had higher odds of remission rates and lower symptom severity at 6 months postnatal compared to control mothers (adjusted OR = 1.35;95% CI, 1.02-1.78) (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9] score adjusted mean difference = â€“0.78;95% CI, â€“1.47 to â€“0.09). All trials also showed improvements on a number of secondary outcomes including child outcomes. We synthesize and discuss the global lessons and implications of having shown that THP is effective in diverse settings and that the policy and practice uptake of the program globally has been promising. Results: We find that the THP is relatively inexpensive and culturally transferable;the intervention can be integrated with existing maternal and child health programs;the program is amenable to â€œtask-sharing/task-shiftingâ€ via lay peers, nurses, community health workers, and other frontline workers;there are cascaded models of training and supervision;and the technology is used for training and delivery to provide exciting future avenues for scaled-up implementation. Conclusions: These innovations are relevant to the neglected field of public mental health, especially in the postâ€“COVID-19 era when rates of anxiety and depression are likely to rise globally.

"THE EMERGENCY PSYCHIATRIST IS IN YOUR HOME","Objectives: The objectives of this presentation are to review the challenges and benefits of utilizing telepsychiatry in emergency settings and to describe adaptations needed to safely provide emergency and crisis psychiatry services to patients in their homes as well as digital tools to help support families during the pandemic and beyond. Methods: The Northwell Emergency Telepsychiatry Service was established in 2012 with the primary goal of providing timely access to psychiatry consultation 24/7 across 19 emergency departments within our health system. The Behavioral Health Urgent Care opened in 2017 to help provide access to a child and adolescent psychiatrist in an ambulatory environment to allow families to avoid the emergency department. The stay-at-home orders and the relaxation of regulations resulting from the public health emergency of the COVID-19 pandemic required rapid adaptations to our workflows on both of these services, which allowed our teams to continue to provide emergent/urgent consultations to families presenting to the hospital as well as caring for them in their homes whenever possible. Results: Our home-based team completed 381 emergency psychiatry evaluations with patients in the emergency department and 461 crisis consultations to patientâ€™s homes during the initial stay-at-home orders from March to August 2020. Chart reviews and provider satisfaction surveys were completed and showed that consultations were safe (no adverse events), received in a timely manner, and accepted by families and providers alike. Providers felt that the safety protocols were established, and that utilization of telepresenters, digital patient intake forms, and safety planning tools were all helpful in guiding and streamlining care. Conclusions: Telepsychiatry can be safely utilized to provide crisis care to patients in their homes. With rising mental health needs and a continued workforce shortage, telepsychiatry can help provide an accepted and safe alternative for families seeking emergency care during and beyond the pandemic.

"VIRTUAL IN-HOME EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH","Objectives: The pressures related to the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in the need to develop innovative ways to deliver mental health (MH) care to patients with emergent needs. This study evaluates the Emergency Department Virtual Care (EDVC) program providing virtual in-home assessments completed by emergency department (ED) physicians for patients with emergent MH needs compared to those seen in person. Methods: We used a mixed-methods design to evaluate the EDVC program with input from patients, caregivers, and ED physicians. Data were collected on those who used or provided in-person or virtual ED services from May 4 through December 31, 2020. Data sources included online surveys, focus groups, and retrospective chart audits. Results: A total of 1499 youth aged 3 to 17 visited the Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO) ED in person for an MH concern, and 61 booked a virtual appointment. The groups differed in presenting problem (47% depression/suicidal/deliberate self-harm vs 31% anxiety), age (13.75 vs 12.26;p &lt; 0.001), and suicide score on the Home, Education, Activities/peers, Drugs/alcohol, Suicidality, Emotions/behavior, Discharge resources (HEADS-ED;0.843 vs 0.529;p = 0.096). Families who visited the ED in person (n = 67) or who used the EDVC (n = 13) platform responded to the experience survey. Most families (83%) who used EDVC reported a willingness to recommend the platform to others and felt it was as good as an in-person ED visit (66.67%). Two-thirds of the ED physicians who completed the survey (n = 25) reported that patients benefited from EDVC (64%);however, responses were mixed regarding the impact on job satisfaction, with 44% reporting feeling neutral and only 24% reporting a positive impact. Conclusions: ED physicians providing in-home virtual assessments for patients with emergent MH needs have been well received by families who indicated they would use the service again. The EDVC program potentially prevents unnecessary ED visits for patients with MH needs, which is crucial during a pandemic.

"ENHANCING THE MODEL: TELEPSYCHIATRY WITHIN EMERGENCY CARE AT CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO","Objectives: The objectives of this presentation are to: 1) describe the many barriers to timely psychiatric emergency consultation, both before and in the midst of a pandemic;and 2) describe innovative teleconsultative services afforded to emergency department (ED) and urgent care (UC) settings at a large, tertiary care pediatric hospital. Methods: Attendees will learn about telepsychiatry services developed and utilized at Childrenâ€™s Hospital Colorado (CHCO) prior to the initiation of the COVID-19 pandemic. A brief description and timeline of the systems of care issues initially identified will be shared as well as a description of the initial model of telepsychiatry services implemented at CHCO. The initial goals of telepsychiatry utilization were to decrease the number of transports from urgent cares and from satellite emergency rooms to the main emergency room located on Anschutz Medical Campus for mental health evaluation, and to decrease the overall wait times for evaluation. Attendees will then learn about how this model of telepsychiatry was enhanced at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic by the utilization of home telepsychiatry and onsite telepsychiatry, allowing decreased exposure risk to COVID-19 and having substantial positive impact on the health of the workforce to continue to care for high volumes of patients. Results: This presenter will share data showing the initial success in accomplishing goals of decreasing transfers and length of stay with the telepsychiatry model prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. This presenter will then: 1) share data encompassing the total number of consults conducted using telecommunication in the different elements/models described above;and 2) review feedback from onsite staff, clinicians working in the tele model, and some patient/family experiences. Conclusions: CHCO successfully enhanced its telepsychiatry crisis evaluations to accommodate many of the unique clinical challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic has presented. Many lessons learned from these enhancements will likely be integrated into our standard of care in the years to come and will far outlast the pandemic itself.

"CRISIS THROUGH THE SCREEN: VIRTUAL EMERGENCY CARE DURING THE PANDEMIC AND BEYOND","Objectives: We will address utilization of telepsychiatry in emergency crisis settings. We will review characteristics and results of emergency telepsychiatry programs providing care into controlled healthcare settings and how they pivoted to provide home-based crisis care to families during the stay-at-home orders from the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Telepsychiatry has been utilized for years in the emergency department (ED), and its safety, equivalent outcomes compared with face-to-face care, and patient and provider satisfaction have been demonstrated in numerous studies. Public health orders to stay home and local hospital directives to eliminate all nonessential hospital staff resulted in a newly emerging need to utilize and adapt virtual care workflows. We will describe the telepsychiatry services developed and utilized at Childrenâ€™s Hospital Colorado (CHCO) prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, discussing initial implementation and various adaptations including utilization of home-based providers and room-to-room telepsychiatry (to decrease exposure). We will then review a mixed-methods design study at the Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Canada, that aimed to evaluate the Emergency Department Virtual Care program that was established during the pandemic to help meet the needs of patients and offer assessments to families in their homes. Finally, we will briefly describe a large hub-and-spoke emergency telepsychiatry program at Northwell Health and will detail rapid transformation of workflows and their adaptations including safety protocols and digital intake processes that were implemented to support safe and efficient home-based care delivery. Results: Telepsychiatry is a well-accepted and feasible modality of care within the emergency setting, even when it is expanded to include care to nonemergency as well as nonclinical environments. Conclusions: Telepsychiatry helps prevent unnecessary ED transfers and visits for patients with mental health needs, which is crucial during a pandemic, and will continue to be beneficial and sustainable beyond. Adaptations for home-based care require a focus on safety protocols, streamlined workflows, and digital tools to enhance the patient experience. TVM, S, RF","Feuer, V.; Hoffman, P.

"SYSTEMIC RACISM AND MENTAL HEALTH DISPARITIES: CALL TO ACTION FOR CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRIST RESEARCHERS, PRACTITIONERS, AND POLICYMAKERS","Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic and heightened awareness of police brutality after the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and many others, have shifted our focus so that systemic racism finally centers in the discussion of childrenâ€™s mental health. Specifically, racism has been identified as a social determinant of mental health. Although this pivot in the collective consciousness and the canon of child and adolescent psychiatry has recently begun, previous research exploring racismâ€™s direct effect on child mental health, while limited, has been overlooked and underfunded despite this problem persisting for several decades. We will review data on systemic racism and discrimination and its impact on the mental health for youth and their families with an emphasis in systems of care settings, juvenile justice, and child welfare. This presentation will explore 3 theoretical frameworks: 1) Public Health Critical Race Praxis (PHCRP);2) structural competency;and 3) racism as a root cause, to propose determination of research, policy, and practice priorities to address mental health inequity in Black, Latinx, and Native American (BLNA) youth whose well-being has been historically marginalized in these systems of care settings. Methods: This presentation includes a review of data on racial inequity across child mental health serving systems. Findings from research conducted by the presenter and colleagues investigating promising practices applying antiracist praxis will be discussed. Results: Systemic racism in various sectors (eg, education, legal, health) drives the disproportionate contact that BLNA youth have with systems of care and influences negative health outcomes across their developmental trajectories. In particular, BLNA youth experience greater gaps between treatment need and receipt. These gaps in both service linkage and quality of care received have lifelong intersectional implications on long-term adverse outcomes. Conclusions: Addressing systemic racism requires multimodal interventions that apply antiracist frameworks to create actionable praxis across the domains of research, policy, and practice. PHCRP, structural competency, and racism-as-a-root-cause frameworks can help center the needs and voices of historically marginalized groups and stimulate new approaches to achieve equitable health outcomes.

"ETHNIC/RACIAL IDENTITY AND DISCRIMINATION: IMPLICATIONS FOR ADOLESCENT AND YOUNG ADULT DEVELOPMENT","Objectives: Ethnic/racial identity (ERI) development can be a central aspect of self-concept for youth of color. This presentation reviews research on how ERI moderates associations between discrimination and mental health, academics, risky health behaviors, and physical health. Research on whether ERI buffers or exacerbates the detrimental impact of discrimination differs by ERI, age, ethnic/racial group, and outcome. Methods: This presentation includes results from 2 studies. The first is a meta-analysis of over 50 studies and 18,000 participants. The second is a study focused on vicarious racismâ€”witnessing or hearing about other individuals of oneâ€™s ethnic/racial group being the target of racismâ€”experienced among Asian Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 600;ages 18-88 years). Results: Meta-analytic data found that having a strong overall sense of ERI conferred protection against discrimination stress, mitigating the impact of racism on health outcomes. However, results also differ by various subdimensions of ERI. Individuals who reported high levels of identity search and exploration were more negatively impacted by discrimination, and this association was most evident at age 24 years. On the other hand, individuals who reported high levels of comfort and commitment to their ethnic/racial identity were more protected from the negative impact of discrimination. Compared to Asian- and African-heritage individuals, Latinx respondents benefited from a strong ethnic/racial identity especially for risky health behaviors. Data from the second study of Asian Americans (April to June 2020) suggest that experiences of vicarious racism were associated with poorer sleep quality;this effect was attenuated for individuals reporting high levels of centrality. Conclusions: The development of an ERI offers social bonds and a sense of belonging and common fate between similar others. Existing research finds that a strong sense of ERI confers overall positive health benefits, suggesting that 1 mechanism for promoting health may be through mitigating the impact of racism among individuals who have a clear and committed sense of their ERI group membership. However, individuals who are still unclear or exploring their ERI may be particularly susceptible to the negative health impact of racism.

"TRAUMA AND STRESSOR-RELATED AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS IN ADOLESCENCE: A PRACTITIONER'S GUIDE TO UNDERSTANDING AND TREATING THESE CO-OCCURRING DISORDERS","Objectives: We will review clinical impacts and explore overlapping symptoms and neurobiological functional domains. Practical approaches to engaging families and a transdiagnostic approach to understanding and treating co-occurring trauma and substance use disorders (SUDs) in adolescents will be presented. Methods: First, Destiny Pegram, MD, will present a case vignette to demonstrate the interaction of early-life trauma and SUD. She will highlight the prevalence, risk factors, and treatment outcome implications of co-occurring trauma and SUD. Iliyan Ivanov, MD, will provide an update on trauma and SUD in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, Jesse Hinckley, MD, PhD, will discuss the biologic intersections of trauma and SUD. He will present clinical vignettes to illustrate overlapping symptoms and functional domains, review shared neurobiological factors, and explore how these factors may maintain or exacerbate the co-occurring disorders. Third, Abita Raj, MD, will present video clinical vignettes to demonstrate Solution-Focused Brief Therapy as an evidence-based approach to engage families in the treatment of trauma and SUD. Fourth, Liza Suarez, PhD, will present an integrated treatment approach for youth with traumatic stress and co-occurring substance use problems. Steve Berkowitz, MD, director of the Stress, Trauma, Adversity Research, and Treatment (START) Center at the University of Colorado and co-chair of the AACAP Disaster and Trauma Issues Committee will serve as the discussant. Results: At the end of this Clinical Perspectives, participants will identify the importance of co-occurring trauma and SUD and will better understand the clinical and biological factors that maintain or exacerbate co-occurring disorders. Participants will learn best practices and practical approaches for screening in a trauma-informed process and for implementing Solution-Focused Brief Therapy to engage families in treatment. Participants will be introduced to a transdiagnostic approach to understand and treat co-occurring PTSD and SUD in adolescents through an in-depth case presentation. Conclusions: Trauma and SUD commonly co-occur in youth. There is a need for mental health clinicians to implement trauma-informed screening processes and to identify principles of treating these co-occurring disorders.

"LEVERAGING FAMILY STRENGTHS DURING CRISIS: TOOLS FOR THE BUSY OUTPATIENT PSYCHIATRIST","Objectives: Strategies that boost the caregiving capacity of families dealing with childhood mental disorders have a clinically significant impact on health outcomes. Despite their proven efficacy in childhood mental illnesses like depression, disruptive behaviors, psychosomatic illness, anorexia, and substance abuse, family interventions tend to be underutilized and underemphasized during training. Our objective is to highlight the feasibility of implementing family-based interventions in outpatient practice and add to the child and adolescent psychiatristâ€™s toolkit in crisis situations. Methods: The case of an adolescent outpatient with a complex family backgroundâ€”sibling with autism spectrum disorder, death of mother, father with depression, and history of somatoform disorder presenting with depression, self-injurious behavior, and suicide attempts (including one after COVID-19 exposure)â€”precipitating multiple emergency department visits, psychiatric admissions, and consultation-liaison involvement will be presented. The case will be used to illustrate techniques from attachment-based family therapy (ABFT), as treatment tools to engage family strengths in times of crisis. Results: The ABFT adolescent alliance task was used to increase the youthâ€™s awareness of sadness and anger at the death of her mother and the caregiving role she played for her brother while navigating difficult social dynamics at school. The parent alliance task allowed the father to share his worries about keeping his job while single-parenting a child with special needs and another with significant socioemotional needs. The fatherâ€™s increased empathy about the youthâ€™s lived experience helped to decrease demands on the youth and defuse conflict. Conclusions: Modifiable family factors, such as conflict, are well-established correlates of youth mental illness and present powerful opportunities for intervention. Evaluating youth perceptions of negative family environments and communication styles (eg, parental criticism) during clinical care, acutely and throughout monitoring, helps clinicians select treatment strategies to optimize the treatment response. Attention to family processes, leveraging family strengths, and decreasing the stresses of a negative family environment can contribute to better treatment engagement and retention, reduce hospitalization rates, and increase adherence to medication.

"TRANSCENDING CULTURAL AND RELIGIOUS BARRIERS: WORKING WITH GENDER-DIVERSE YOUTH AND THEIR FAMILIES IN THE PANDEMIC AND BEYOND","Objectives: Like all families, the families of gender-diverse youth present with beliefs, values, and patterns of interacting stemming from their lived experience of community, culture, and ethnicity. Appreciation of a familyâ€™s values can help family members find common ground and enable them to provide crucial affirmation for gender-diverse youth. However, child and adolescent psychiatrists often receive little training in incorporating cultural differences in family therapy and may struggle to address culturally based beliefs about gender identity and sexuality that differ from their own. Changes necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic have presented additional, unforeseen treatment challenges but have also provided unexpected opportunities, including some relevant for gender-diverse youth, especially transitional-aged youth impacted by devastating losses in employment and education. Attendees will leave with an increased awareness of cultural factors that can affect family acceptance and new ideas for utilizing telehealth and other unusual approaches. Methods: The presenter will provide a review of available evidence about applicable cultural factors and telehealth modalities, with a focus on gender-diverse transitional-aged youth. The presenter will use clinical case vignettes and video clips to highlight challenges and opportunities under pandemic conditions and beyond. Results: Understanding a familyâ€™s underlying cultural values can play an important role in establishing a solid therapeutic alliance and allow for more meaningful communication, which is especially important in family therapy with gender-diverse, transitional-aged youth, and their families, who may be struggling with additional pandemic-related stressors. Awareness of the unique benefits of telehealth may improve cliniciansâ€™ effectiveness. Together, these can help promote positive outcomes for gender-diverse youth. Conclusions: It is important to consider and address culturally influenced beliefs and values when working with gender-diverse youth and their families, and it is important to incorporate available resources, such as telehealth modalities. This can lead to improvements in therapeutic relationships and communication, which can have a significant impact on family acceptance and lead to more positive mental health outcomes for youth.

"PARENTS, PRONOUNS, AND PUBERTY DURING THE PANDEMIC: AFFIRMING CARE FOR THE GENDER-TRANSITIONING ADOLESCENT","Objectives: Youth presenting with gender-identity concerns across development require a level of assessment that goes beyond what is typically taught in child and adolescent psychiatry residency. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic presented new, immediate challenges to deliver equitable care over telehealth to youth with varying levels of family acceptance at home, and with different levels of privacy for the youth to engage in confidential conversations. Complicated family situations (eg, divorced parents, disagreeing parents) often introduce a more difficult element to an already challenging situation. Working to understand the relationship between the youthâ€™s gender presentation and other co-occurring mental health issues, often entails navigating these complicated systems and family situations very delicately. Methods: Through the use of clinical case vignettes and presentation of the available evidence regarding family support for youth with gender-identity issues, the presenter will illustrate the complexity of working with gender-diverse youth presenting with challenging family situations, both with telehealth and in the typical office setting. Results: Understanding the impact of challenging family situations on decision making with gender-diverse youth is important for child and adolescent psychiatrists when promoting positive outcomes for these youth. Conclusions: Addressing complicated family dynamics is a crucial part of the treatment frame for many youth presenting with gender-identity concerns. The lack of training that child and adolescent psychiatrists receive to manage these delicate situations can negatively affect patient outcomes. This session aims to mitigate those effects.

"USE OF FAMILY THERAPY IN WORKING TOWARD FAMILY ACCEPTANCE WITH GENDER-DIVERSE YOUTH","Objectives: Gender-diverse youth and their families are increasingly presenting to mental health settings beyond specialized gender clinics, yet clinical competence lacks among providers. Child and adolescent psychiatrists should understand the impact of family acceptance and rejection for these individuals and incorporate family therapy in the clinical setting when appropriate. Knowledge of the possible modifications from traditional family therapy interventions should be understood and applied. Methods: An overview of the clinical issues in treatment will be provided with a focus on transitional-age youth. We will also focus on the impacts of COVID-19 on gender-diverse youth and how telehealth has changed our work as child and adolescent psychiatrists. We aim to be interactive, with the use of case presentations, role-play, and/or a recording of a family therapy session. We will highlight complex family issues including religious or cultural barriers to family acceptance and the nuanced differences of working with adolescents vs young adults seeking gender-affirming treatment (medical transition). An ensuing discussion will synthesize the main topics and facilitate awareness of acceptance, rejection, stigmatized identities, and family dynamics in the clinical setting. Results: Understanding family acceptance and rejection for gender-diverse youth is a treatment priority for clinicians. Incorporating family therapy interventions can enhance understanding, acceptance, well-being, and positive outcomes for gender-diverse youth from across the life span. Conclusions: Addressing these issues with clinicians enhances clinical competence in an area that has become increasingly more visible to the public yet remains underserved by child and adolescent mental health providers.

"A SYSTEMS OF CARE APPROACH IN ACTION: ILLUSTRATIONS FROM DISASTER RESPONSE, PANDEMICS, AND EVEN ORDINARY TIMES","Objectives: The objective of this presentation is to offer case examples for illustrating the application of a systems-of-care approach. Participants will have the opportunity to enhance their understanding of the utility and importance of this approach for supporting the mental health of children, adolescents, and their families, promoting their well-being and addressing barriers and inequities in care. Methods: The application of a systems-of-care approach is illustrated using 2 detailed examples. The first example focuses on disaster readiness and recovery and presents material from the AACAP Systems of Care, Systems-Based Practice Disaster Response Module. The second illustration focuses on responding to the mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Both examples include considerations for addressing mental health disparities and inequities in care. This presentation will utilize poll questions and other interactive strategies for reinforcing the core principles of the systems-of-care approach. Results: Systems of care is a service delivery approach that builds partnerships to create a broad, integrated process for meeting the multiple needs of children and their families. This approach is based on the principles of interagency collaboration, individualized strengths-based care practices, cultural competence, community-based services, accountability, and full participation of families and youth at all levels of the system. Conclusions: A systems-of-care approach assists in building the infrastructure needed to result in positive outcomes for children, youth, and families, and to address systemic challenges to child mental health services during public health crises and even in ordinary times.

"SYSTEMS OF CARE: A PRIMER FOR CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRISTS","Objectives: This Clinical Perspectives will provide an overview of the key principles and concepts of systems of care to child and adolescent psychiatrists. The presentation will also review training issues and recent challenges addressed by systems of care and discuss the ongoing evolution of the approach. Methods: These presentations will result from a review of the literature with a focus on the recent AACAP Clinical Updates and Systems-Based Practice Tool Kits for trainees. In addition, speakers will present from their experiences as clinicians and policymakers in child-serving systems of care organizations. Results: William David Lohr, MD, will define the core values and guiding principles of systems of care. Kaye McGinty, MD, will review training issues related to preparing future child and adolescent psychiatrists for a systems-based practice. Lisa Fortuna, MD, MPH, will address current trials including disaster readiness and the COVID-19 pandemic, and how the systems of care philosophy may address these challenges. Jeff Bostic, MD, EdD, will review strategies that the National Training and Technical Assistance Center for Child, Youth, and Family Mental Health (NTTAC) employs to implement more effective systems of care programs. Melinda Jane Baldwin, PhD, LCSW, will address the future structure that systems of care may take as they evolve to better serve youth and families. Justine Larson, MD, will take themes of all presentations to summarize the essential elements of systems of care that are crucial for child and adolescent psychiatrists to understand. Conclusions: Systems of care approaches continue to evolve to improve the lives of youth and families to overcome challenges and reduce disparities.

"PEDIATRIC CHRONIC PAIN MANAGEMENT IN MEDICAL-PSYCHIATRIC INPATIENT UNITS","Objectives: Among multiple levels of care available for chronic pain patients, the most intensive and restrictive is the inpatient model. Patients who suffer from chronic pain, whether due to a physical injury, a chronic medical illness, psychosomatic pain, or a combination, can have significantly low functioning levels and may be unable to participate in outpatient models. Therefore, such patients require a higher level of care. The goal of this session is to describe the inpatient model for the treatment of pediatric chronic pain. Methods: Mirabelle Mattar, MD, describes the diverse structure, treatment principles, and functionality of inpatient programs. The focus is drawn on medical-psychiatric programs and the advantages of this holistic treatment approach. We also address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on inpatient treatment. Results: Dr. Mattar discusses programs ranging from a strictly medical rehabilitation approach to integrated medical-psychiatric units, which are less common and available. Inpatient rehabilitation treatment programs provide daily therapy that addresses physical/medical, psychological, educational, and daily living goals in patients with more stable mental health conditions not requiring inpatient mental health care. Medical-psychiatric programs cater to patients that are too mentally ill to be treated on medical wards and too medically ill to be treated with conventional mental health inpatient services. Such a holistic treatment approach often reduces readmission rates. The integration of medical and mental health care often allows for improvement of mood, monitoring, and treatment of suicidal thoughts (should they exist), in addition to providing intensive rehabilitation and medical services. Patients are also exposed to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in regard to absence of direct family support in their treatment course. Conclusions: Inpatient integrated care programs adopt the multidisciplinary treatment model to address pain with biological, psychological, and social approaches. These programs, already quite saturated and uncommon, have become almost inaccessible to out-of-state patients due to COVID-19 rules and restrictions. The therapeutic model has been further impacted by COVID-19 restrictions, thus driving the transition of several aspects of care, even family sessions, to virtual platforms.

"PEDIATRIC CHRONIC PAIN: INFRASTRUCTURES AND LEVELS OF CARE","Objectives: Successful management of chronic pain requires addressing physical symptoms and comorbid mental health conditions. Pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions can be successfully provided by a multidisciplinary approach that is both effective and safe. This model can be delivered in different settings, including outpatient, intensive outpatient, and inpatient. In this module, we focus on assessing the patientâ€™s presentation, establishing the appropriate level of care, detecting the need to transition or modify settings, and understanding the prevalent challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Souraya Torbey, MD, will: 1) highlight the distinction between outpatient clinic program and intensive day treatment, with an emphasis on the advantages and challenges of each model;2) clarify the intensive day treatment programs, their types, and structures;3) discuss medical decisions in the appropriate level of care;4) review the referral processes;and 5) discuss treatment modalities in the setting of COVID-19, including telehealth. Results: Outpatient pain treatment programs allow the child to stay at home in a familiar environment. However, such arrangements may lack the intensity, consistency, and integration necessary to make progress. Intensive day treatment or partial hospitalization programs are a midway between inpatient and outpatient. They provide a smooth transition from inpatient to outpatient through the support of a structured treatment program. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an increase in pediatric chronic pain and mental health issues, concomitant with a decrease in availability of in-person psychiatric and rehabilitation services. The development of telehealth/hybrid models arose to respond to these needs and to increase access for those who might not be close to big centers. We discuss the implementation of these virtual platforms in the outpatient treatment models of chronic pain. Conclusions: This presentation aims to explore the distinction between outpatient clinic and intensive day treatment, highlighting the advantages and challenges of each model respectively, including the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"USE AND ABUSE OF SOCIAL MEDIA IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING","Objectives: The internet has changed the way that society buys and sells literally everythingâ€”including children. Knowing the way in which victims of trafficking, survivors, and children engage with social media is essential to understanding the emerging trends surrounding the recruitment process of minors, as well as how traffickers proliferate their lucrative operations through selling victims online. Methods: Presented from the perspective of a lived experience expert who is now a mental health professional, this presentation will: 1) explore case studies of social media use as primary tool used in recruiting and exploiting children into sex trafficking, and minor victimsâ€™ use of social media as a tool to reach out for assistance, help, and support;2) discuss how social media often sensationalizes trafficking creating societal norms that are not recognized as trafficking by children and their families even though they may become victims of trafficking according to the federal definition of trafficking via this means;and 3) discuss how trafficking is adapting to meet the ways social media evolves with changing technology and the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: This presentation will enable participants to better understand the role of social media in the phenomenon of recruiting and exploiting children into sex trafficking. A framework will also be provided that indicates the essential need for kid-friendly education surrounding social media safety and the realities of exploitation for children, adolescents, and families. Conclusions: Child and adolescent psychiatrists can play a critical role in educating children and families of the negative impact of social media use and abuse as it relates to human trafficking.

"ONLINE MINDFUL PARENTING AND CASE EXAMPLE","Objectives: Mindful parenting (MP) can be defined as the process of intentional, kind, moment-to-moment awareness of oneâ€™s experience, including parenting. MP can increase the parentsâ€™ capacity for parenting calmly with more consistency, and in accordance with their goals and values, while fostering a warm and nurturing parent-child relationship that can result in less parenting stress, more effective parenting strategies, and increased well-being in their children. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, a rise in parent and child stress has led to increased risk for, and prevalence of, parent and child psychopathology. Telehealth offers a unique and effective way to reach families in need and to deliver parenting interventions to reduce parenting stress and improve parent-child functioning. Telehealth MP interventions remain effective in decreasing parenting stress and improving the parent and childâ€™s well-being. This presentation will provide an overview of core MP skills and the evidence for MP interventions delivered via telehealth. Modifications for telehealth with its benefits and challenges will be discussed. Methods: Presenters will review the key MP skills and current empirical evidence on online MP interventions and their impact on caregiver stress and well-being and improved treatment outcomes. Adaptations for MP interventions delivered in a telehealth format will be discussed, including the benefits and challenges. Case examples will be used to enhance learning. Results: Participants will learn the core aspects of MP and how it can decrease caregiver stress and improve treatment outcomes for children, as well as online MP adaptations. Participants will also learn the benefits and challenges of online MP. Conclusions: Given the current climate of COVID-19, including the rise in family mental health needs and enhanced opportunities for telehealth services, supporting caregiver well-being and the treatment of young children is critical. Improving cliniciansâ€™ understanding of MP interventions and best practices when delivering via telehealth will support the growing need for these services.

"ICARE: INTERNET-BASED CHILD-ADULT RELATIONSHIP ENHANCEMENT FOR FAMILIES AT RISK FOR EMOTIONAL DYSREGULATION AND CHILD MALTREATMENT","Objectives: Slowing the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has necessitated families to remain socially isolated at home. The pandemic has led to increased emotional, financial, and educational turmoil. Its impact has exacerbated underlying mental health issues for both parents and children and has increased risk for child maltreatment. The pandemic has also posed unique challenges to delivering mental health interventions to families. Internet-Based Child-Adult Relationship Enhancement (iCARE) is a tier 1 and 2 intervention that aims to enhance parentsâ€™ relationship with children with emotional and behavioral problems and those at increased risk of maltreatment. Parents are taught to connect with children of different ages, support social-emotional learning, give effective directions, and address mild problematic behaviors. Methods: The presentation will focus on describing a novel 6-week parenting skills workshop called iCARE for parents of children aged 2 to 6 years. It will also provide preliminary qualitative and quantitative results on the feasibility and possible effectiveness of this intervention. Changes in parentsâ€™ satisfaction and parenting attitudes, parental stress level, and child behavior problems will be shared. Results: Participants will learn about an intervention for parents who are already seeking mental health services in an academic outpatient center. They will understand the feasibility of using an internet-based group format as a mental health intervention. Participants will consider its potential effectiveness. Lastly, they will understand how this type of group may be implemented in their own practice. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has created an acute mental health crisis. Many families are requiring mental health care. Providing accessible, effective interventions for families will continue to be of great importance. P, PSC, TREAT","Mann, A.

"I-PCIT: INTERNET-DELIVERED PARENT-CHILD INTERACTION THERAPY","Objectives: Parent-child interaction therapy (PCIT) is an evidence-based behavioral parent-training program that was initially developed for families with young children (ages 2-7 years) who exhibited socially disruptive behaviors (aggression and noncompliance). It is a dyadic parent-child therapy with unique elements of in vivo parent coaching via a bug in the ear by the therapist who works from behind a one-way mirror. Most important, PCIT allows for individually tailored coaching that can address unique difficulties of particular parent-child dyads. Despite the effectiveness of PCIT, a high dropout rate (in some studies as high as 50%) prior to completion of the treatment remains a significant problem. The use of new technologies such as telehealth to remotely deliver real-time therapy to the patientâ€™s home has shown to overcome the many barriers including treatment availability, accessibility, and acceptability. During the COVID-19 pandemic, internet-PCIT (I-PCIT) became the treatment of choice for many centers around the country. Methods: This presentation will introduce the basic concepts of I-PCIT. We will focus on the similarities and differences between standard PCIT delivered in the office setting and I-PCIT. We will show video clips of I-PCIT sessions to illustrate the novel aspects of the treatment. Results: Participants will learn how to conduct PCIT using remote technology. They will be able to discuss various aspects of the PCIT treatment done in the home environment. They will be able to review problem-solving strategies such as ways to keep the young child in the room, time-out routine practice, and siblings needing to be present in the session, and other challenging situations will be discussed. Participants will have an opportunity to present their challenging cases and ask questions. Conclusions: A small but growing literature shows that I-PCIT is an acceptable adaptation of PCIT. It allows for expansion of the reach of mental health services, helps with compliance, and allows for continuation of treatment for many families during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"ICARE, SPACE, I-PCIT, AND ONLINE MINDFUL PARENTING: IMPROVING ACCESS BY INTERNET-DELIVERED THERAPIES FOR YOUNG CHILDREN AND FAMILIES","Objectives: Telepsychiatry has become increasingly common over the past 2 decades, with numerous benefits that include increasing accessibility by overcoming geographical and transportation barriers, increasing efficiency, reducing cost, and diminishing stigma linked to mental health clinics. This past year, the wider dissemination of telehealth services has been expedited due to the current COVID-19 public health crisis and stay-at-home orders that have resulted in decreased restrictions and historic expansion of telehealth insurance coverage. This Clinical Perspectives will discuss internet-delivered parent-based young child interventions (ages 0-5 years), such as internet-based Child-Adult Relationship Enhancement (iCARE), Supportive Parenting for Anxious Childhood Emotions (SPACE), Internet-Delivered Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (I-PCIT), and Mindful Parenting, and their empirical evidence, underlying theories, and clinical and supportive applications. Methods: This presentation will consist of a discussion of 4 interventions adapted to be delivered virtually: 1) I-PCIT will use case examples to illustrate various challenges and necessary adaptations for internet therapies for young children;2) iCARE;3) a parent-based treatment program called SPACE that was developed for children with anxiety and OCD;and 4) internet-delivered mindful parenting with challenges and adaptations for digital delivery with case examples. At the conclusion of our presentation, we will invite the participants to bring their own practical challenges regarding online treatments of young children and their families. Results: Participants will learn about different innovative internet-delivered therapies for young children and their families. They will develop strategies on â€œwebsite manners,â€ treatment tools and strategies on engaging children and their families via the internet. They will learn about treatment options for a variety of internalizing and externalizing disorders in young children that can be delivered effectively online. Conclusions: Video engagement of young children and their families presents unique challenges. Evidence-based interventions have been successfully adapted for online delivery. This session will allow participants to discuss and explore ideas and gain tools for optimizing internet-delivered therapies for young children. P, EC, TVM","Harrison, J.

"POLICY STRATEGIES AND LANDSCAPES TO ADVANCE INFANT AND EARLY CHILDHOOD MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATION (IECMHC) IN PEDIATRICS","Objectives: The objective of this presentation is to describe the policy and systems context of early childhood mental health consultation to primary care. Methods: This presentation will provide an overview of the current contexts that contribute to opportunities and barriers to early childhood mental health consultation to pediatric primary care clinicians. Results: The triple crises within our nationâ€”the COVID-19 epidemic, the economic collapse, and the racial justice reckoningâ€”have laid bare the chasms of our social safety net, our racist infrastructures, and deepening impacts of poverty for young families, their children, and their communities. However, simultaneously, we have witnessed the mobilization of supports within neighborhoods and communities, the expansion of social connections, and the discovery of the power of relationships, hope, resiliency. And as the Biden-Harris American Recovery Act becomes a reality, we are witnessing unprecedented policy initiatives and leadership opportunities that â€œbuild back betterâ€ from the best knowledge of early childhood development and required community contexts. Elements of the act have the potential to support innovative approaches to early childhood mental health consultation and expanded team-based care models in primary care. In addition, federal investment in consultative models of care through the 21st Century Cures Act may be expanded in coming years as well as new financing initiatives and incentives to promote evidence-based models, like consultation, that contribute to population wellness over time. Conclusions: Early childhood mental health consultation in primary care offer examples of innovative approaches that apply two-generational, early relational health, and a relational workforce expansion for community rebuilding, advancing health equity and next-generation well-being.

"CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY INPATIENT HOSPITAL CAPACITY IN THE UNITED STATES: UNDERSTANDING OUR CURRENT STATE","Objectives: In communities across the United States, large numbers of children and adolescents with acute psychiatric presentations are being held for days and weeks in emergency departments and pediatric medical units, awaiting placement for inpatient psychiatric hospital treatment. These settings are not designed to safely and effectively care for these children. The prolonged waiting is usually attributed to an inadequate supply of beds, and the solution seems self-evident: build more beds. This simple statement belies the complexity of determining the adequate number of beds for a given community, a number dependent on a variety of factors including the epidemiology of childrenâ€™s mental illness, social determinants of health, the functioning of other mental health services, and the availability of community supports. The aim of this session is to provide a detailed background of the scope of our inpatient access problem and its consequences. Methods: Available state and national data will be reviewed and synthesized to describe the availability and distribution of inpatient child and adolescent psychiatry hospital beds. The impact of the limitation in beds on children and adolescents and families as well as healthcare systems will be described. The needs of special populations and the clinical profiles of patients most likely to experience prolonged boarding will be reviewed. As a case example, the efforts of state regulators in Massachusetts to address this problem will be described. Results: Boarding of children and adolescents with acute mental illness has been associated with scarcity and maldistribution of inpatient beds and is highly prevalent and widespread across the United States. The problem appears to have been severely exacerbated during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Conclusions: Boarding of children in emergency departments is associated with elevated safety risks, poor clinical quality, poor patient experience, disruption of nonpsychiatric emergency services, and excessive costs. In order to address this issue, state and local policymakers need tools to determine the number and types of childrenâ€™s psychiatric inpatient units needed for their communities.

"CRAZY STRESSED ASIANS: THEMES FROM DISCUSSION GROUPS SUPPORTING ASIAN/ASIAN AMERICAN TRANSITIONAL-AGED YOUTH","Objectives: Racism toward Asian ethnicities dates back to the 19th century. Such sentiments continue to have a presence and impact on Asian American youth. The objective of this presentation is to review the historical and current context of anti-Asian racism, understand how experiences of racism impact identity and mental health in Asian American youth, and identify approaches for clinicians to manage and treat Asian youth populations with cultural humility. Methods: The presenter will review the historical, social, and political contexts of anti-Asian racism in the United States and draw on themes and experiences gathered from facilitating university-based discussion groups among Asian/Asian American transitional-aged youth (TAY) students to explore the impact of anti-Asian racism and culture on mental health and identity. Results: Throughout US history, perceptions of Asians as a threat to America, commonly termed the â€œyellow peril,â€ resulted in the passage of laws barring migration and naturalization, as well as executive orders resulting in internment of Asian citizens. Today, anti-Asian racism manifests in the perpetuation of the â€œmodel minorityâ€ stereotype and rising attacks on Asian people during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the facilitated discussion groups of Asian/Asian American TAY students, emerging themes include forms of violence experienced during COVID-19, issues with the model minority stereotype, burden of acculturation with subsequent loss of cultural identity, and cultural clashes between Eastern collectivist and Western individualist values. These themes reflect the ongoing struggles of Asian students reconciling oneâ€™s identity, self-esteem, connection to oneâ€™s family and community, and experiences of mental illness. Conclusions: Anti-Asian racism impacts Asian American youth in multiple ways, particularly on their development of identity, sense of self, and mental well-being. Mental health clinicians need to be aware of the history of anti-Asian racism and the ways it is expressed today, and to gain insight into our own biases in order to best treat our Asian American populations.

"GREENSPACE AND MENTAL HEALTH: IMPLICATIONS FOR PEDIATRIC POPULATIONS FACING CLIMATE CHANGE","Objectives: The objectives of this presentation are to: 1) review the neuroscience of how greenspace impacts neural development;2) summarize epidemiological evidence studying the impacts of greenspace on mental health, mental health disorders, and behavioral development in adults and children (with special attention on how greenspace has impacted mental health during a global pandemic);and 3) explore greenspace clinical interventions on pediatric mental health and approaches to â€œnature therapeutics.â€ Methods: This section will start by reviewing the basic research of how greenspace affects physiological neural development. It will then discuss epidemiologic findings showing the protective nature of greenspace in children, as well as the racial and socioeconomic inequity in greenspace accessibility. Additionally, this section will explore research, conducted by myself and others, on the unique role of greenspace during the COVID-19 pandemic on maintaining mental wellness. We will conclude by briefly discussing the use of â€œnature therapyâ€ to help address certain pediatric mental health disorders. Results: At the end of this presentation, the audience should be able to recall how greenspace and natural landscapes impact mental health in pediatric populations, as well as generally describe the inequity in greenspace access and the unique role that greenspace has played during the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to mental health. Lastly, they should be able to appraise the merits of â€œnature therapyâ€ as a potential treatment for certain mental health disorders and the importance of mental health professionals actively working to preserve greenspace in the face of climate change. Conclusions: The impact of greenspace on pediatric mental health is an evolving field that should be of significant interest to AACAP members. Participants of this talk will walk away with a better understanding of how nature and greenspace impact neurological processing and childhood development, as well as implications for therapeutics. This topic addresses how green spaces and natural environments can shape pediatric mental well-being and, therefore, complements the other talks in this series discussing how climate change and environmental preservation are fundamentally important concepts for psychiatrists to integrate into their practice.

"CONSIDERING THE ROLE OF INTERGENERATIONAL TRAUMA","Objectives: The objective of this presentation is to increase clinician awareness about the intergenerational transmission of childhood maltreatment (including potential mechanisms), child behavioral and mental health outcomes, psychotherapeutic interventions, and changes to interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This presentation will review the mechanisms of intergenerational transmission, common behavioral outcomes associated with a maternal history of exposure to childhood maltreatment, and changes in therapeutic interventions during the pandemic. Results: There is growing evidence that the effects of childhood maltreatment are not limited to a single individual and may be transmitted across generations, increasing the risk for behavioral and mental health disorders in offspring. We will review potential mechanisms for mental health disorders in children and adolescents associated with a maternal history of exposure to childhood maltreatment. We will briefly examine less-established therapeutic interventions for children and families such as mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC), and Circle of Security. Special attention will be given to adaptations that have been successfully employed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: Understanding the potential mechanisms and outcomes associated with the intergenerational transmission of childhood maltreatment will aid child and adolescent psychiatrists in identifying interventions and developing appropriate treatment plans that address broader aspects of maltreatment, therefore leading to improved outcomes.

"ADDRESSING CHILDHOOD MALTREATMENT: A PRACTICAL APPROACH FOR THE CHILD PSYCHIATRIST IN A CHANGING HEALTHCARE SYSTEM","Objectives: Childhood maltreatment is a pervasive problem with long-lasting and intergenerational consequences for both mental and physical health. Child and adolescent psychiatrists frequently evaluate youth who are experiencing the lasting effects of maltreatment and should be well-versed in the current recommendations for the assessment, evaluation, and treatment of maltreated children. Methods: Four presentations will examine various aspects of the medical and mental health evaluation of maltreated children and adolescents, evidence-based treatment approaches, and mechanisms of intergenerational transmission. Special consideration will be given to how COVID-19 has affected the experience of maltreated youth and how technology may support or create barriers in the evaluation and treatment of maltreated children and adolescents. Results: The first presentation will focus on approaches to the assessment and evaluation of child maltreatment. The second presentation will address the scope of practice of child abuse pediatrics, including the medical evaluation of suspected abuse, commonly observed injuries, and changes in reporting, prevalence, and evaluation methods that occurred thus far during the COVID-19 pandemic. The third presentation will discuss the evidence base and trauma-informed approaches for the application of psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacologic treatments in survivors of maltreatment. The final presentation will explore the role of the intergenerational transmission of childhood maltreatment on child behavioral and mental health outcomes and will discuss additional therapeutic interventions. Conclusions: Child abuse is a pervasive problem with significant physical and mental health morbidity. Despite the growing recognition of the lasting and intergenerational effects of childhood maltreatment, it is still underrecognized and underreported. The COVID-19 pandemic has influenced both the assessment and treatment of childhood maltreatment as encounters have shifted to virtual settings. It is vital for child and adolescent mental health providers to stay informed of structural changes and evidence-based advances in the diagnosis, protection, evaluation, and treatment of maltreated children.

"TRANSLATING EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICES FOR ADOLESCENT SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS IN RURAL SYSTEMS OF CARE","Objectives: Evidence-based practices bring hope for improved outcomes for adolescents and their families living in rural areas who are impacted by substance use disorders. However, many rural youths do not receive needed services, and systems of care face challenges to providing these services. Methods: Presenters with experience delivering services in rural areas will review the relevant literature and summarize key evidence-based practices. They will use case-based methods, explain opportunities and challenges, and describe recent programs addressing adolescent substance use in several rural areas. Sandi Kazura, MD, will provide background with summaries of the epidemiology of youth substance use and risk factors, a list of evidence-based interventions, and results of a literature search on rural-specific interventions. Kaye McGinty, MD, will describe the evolution of mental health/substance use services within a large rural health system during a rapid need of increase in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Catherine Martin, MD, will describe the findings from a telehealth tobacco treatment program in Kentucky, including a focus on adolescent/grandparent dyads and lessons learned about telepsychiatry in urban vs rural sites. Susan Therese Garrett, MD, will discuss how claims data and restrictions on data sharing inform payor care management and youth transitions of care. John Diamond, MD, will summarize the findings with expert commentary and facilitation of Q&A with the audience and presenters. Results: Adolescent substance use is a large problem in rural areas, with multiple challenges to provision of evidence-based services, including workforce shortages, training needs, cultural factors, and data needs. The current pandemic amplified the existing service needs and inspired creative solutions. Thoughtful qualitative and quantitative data collection and communications of findings is needed to expand the knowledge base about successful programs. Conclusions: Clinical science has developed interventions that can improve outcomes for adolescents with substance use disorders living in rural communities. Systems of care face opportunities and challenges in making this happen. SUD, RP, EBP","Kazura, S.; McGinty, K. L.; Diamond, J.

"TECHNOLOGY IN PRACTICE: IMPROVING COMPLIANCE AND OUTCOMES","Objectives: The objectives of this presentation are to: 1) review how new technology and smartphone applications can be used to facilitate engagement in care and improve behavioral health outcomes;and 2) review available applications and evidence for use, as well as a quality improvement initiative using MindLogger, an open-source data collection platform, to improve utilization of diary cards for DBT and token economies for behavioral interventions. Methods: A literature review was conducted to assess how technology and smartphone applications can facilitate provision of care and improve behavioral health outcomes. The presentation will incorporate the most important and applicable findings, combined with clinical experiences, and recommend available resources and guidelines for the use of technology in behavioral health care. Results: With the ubiquitous use of technology in todayâ€™s world, clinicians, parents, and youth increasingly seek online resources and interventions for behavioral health concerns. Growing evidence supports that technology-based interventions can improve behavioral health outcomes, including symptoms of anxiety and depression. In addition, the importance of technology in the delivery of care during COVID-19 has emphasized the need to develop novel ways to provide care and improve access. Evidence for the use of mobile applications will be presented for clinicians to use and recommend to patients and families. Novel applications available through MindLogger and the ability to improve compliance and outcomes will also be discussed. Conclusions: Mobile applications continue to influence the psychosocial well-being of youth. Research has shown that novel interventions can positively impact behavioral health outcomes and that there is growing interest in developing evidence-based interventions that facilitate behavioral health care.

"â€œWHAT IS THE APP FOR THAT?â€ HOW MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIANS CAN MAKE INFORMED MENTAL HEALTH APP RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOUTH","Objectives: There are thousands of mental health apps available today for immediate download. Among youth aged 14 to 22 years, 64% already report using apps specifically to help manage personal health conditions, and the current COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of accessible, digital treatment options. However, many mental health apps are not evidence-based, particularly for the pediatric population. Moreover, some apps may not only be ineffective, but also harmful, with many sharing health data with third parties. Through this presentation, participants will: 1) review core ethical considerations surrounding app recommendations in clinical practice;and 2) learn informed decision-making skills to help better navigate the app space. Methods: This talk will discuss ethical concerns surrounding use of apps, particularly in child and adolescent psychiatry. It will also review the current state of apps for varied mental health disorders on the Apple and Android app stores, and then guide participants in real time through evidence-based strategies for selecting the â€œrightâ€ app for a patient using evidence-based tools and clinical judgement. Results: Few mental health apps have been developed specifically for children and adolescents, and even fewer apps are supported by evidence-based research. Concerningly, prior research has found that these apps often lack privacy policies or information on how to help users navigate safety crises. The mHealth Index & Navigation Database is a helpful tool that can help providers assess which app might be most helpful for their patients based upon not only mental health conditions but also specific target (eg, insomnia) and app features (eg, journaling), which may be especially helpful for youth who are reluctant to identify as having a particular disorder. Conclusions: Our young patients and their families are increasingly asking providers about mental health apps, and accessible digital tools to augment existing treatment options are increasingly available. However, not all apps carry the same evidence base and risk, making it important that mental health professionals be informed before making any recommendations.

"WHEN A VIDEO GAME BECOMES THE TREATMENT: HARNESSING DIGITAL AND SCREEN TECHNOLOGY AS THERAPEUTIC MODALITIES IN CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY","Objectives: American teens consume approximately 7 hours of screen time daily, with use extending into social, recreational, and academic spheres of life. Youth also appear increasingly invested in using digital media to address health issues, with 64% reporting the use of a mobile app for health-related purposes. As their patients become more reliant on the use of screens, it is incumbent on child and adolescent mental health professionals to understand evolving digital technologies and their potential role in mental health treatment. The presentationâ€™s overall objectives are both to review the most salient examples of mobile health (mHealth) technologies useful in the clinical encounter and to guide participants through how to make informed recommendations surrounding the use of mHealth technology. Methods: Specifically, this presentation explores the use of video games in psychotherapeutic treatment, including case studies to exemplify this practice, as well as the use of varying mHealth technologies (eg, digital phenotyping, electronic diary cards). Programs will review each technologyâ€™s potential risks and benefits. The presentation will also use a mixed didactic and interactive approach to guide participants through specific treatment decisions regarding incorporation of these technologies into the treatment setting (including through use of an online decision-making tool). Results: Psychiatrists have begun exploring clinical use of novel mHealth technologies. However, through its emphasis on remote forms of mental health care, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced more expedient clinical adoption of these novel technologies. Overall, treatments that incorporate video gaming, behavioral health apps, and apps that collect survey and phone sensor data appear feasible and acceptable to young patients;however, recommendation of a particular technology relies on cautious, calculated decision making. Conclusions: The patients of child and adolescent psychiatrists are rapidly adapting to new digital technologies, increasingly incorporating them into their lives, including their health. Adoption of mHealth technology has the potential to improve quality and facilitate obtainment of important clinical information. Mental health professionals should become proficient in both using and discussing mHealth technologies with their patients.

"CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRISTS AS MENTAL HEALTH ADVOCATES: EVERY VOICE MATTERS","Objectives: During the COVID-19 pandemic, adaptations in child mental health treatment delivery methods, such as the use of telehealth, have been supported by specific changes in healthcare legislation and policy. This presentation will describe the unique role of child and adolescent psychiatrists as physician advocates in educating legislators and other decision-makers about the specific developmental needs of children and adolescents. Methods: We will highlight the specific advocacy actions that have been organized by AACAP at the state and federal levels to support the promotion of childrenâ€™s mental health during the pandemic. Moreover, we will describe the impact of organized advocacy efforts, including specific examples from AACAPâ€™s Advocacy Liaison Network. We will also present case examples to describe the way in which advocates have leveraged preexisting relationships with stakeholders and legislative champions to advance proâ€“mental health legislation. Next, we will illustrate the benefits and challenges of advocating in a virtual world during the pandemic. Finally, attendees will be provided with a list of potential advocacy actions and will be invited to choose from the list to develop a personal advocacy action plan. Results: At the end of the presentation, attendees will recognize the unique role of child and adolescent psychiatrists as mental health advocates and the greater impact of organized advocacy efforts. Attendees will also identify specific AACAP advocacy resources that have been utilized during the pandemic and will remain available to members interested in engaging in advocacy. Conclusions: Attendees will be invited to participate in organized AACAP advocacy actions at the state and federal levels. ADV","Koss, D.

"THE LIGHTS ARE STILL ON! HOW CHILD PSYCHIATRISTS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS LEVERAGED NETWORKS TO PROMOTE CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH IN 2020","Objectives: Child and adolescent psychiatrists and child psychologists (CPs) have a storied history of child mental health promotion (CMHP). The COVID-19 pandemic increased the risks to the mental health of children and adolescents. Concurrently, physical distancing stymied many traditional routes for CMHP, including advocacy and the identification of children at increased risk for mental illness. However, it did not destroy the strong health-promoting networks that child and adolescent psychiatrists and CPs built prior to COVID-19. This presentation will describe how preexisting interdisciplinary networks were leveraged to provide child mental health (CMH) advocacy, education, and outreach during COVID-19. Methods: The presenters will describe the CMHP network that they built prior to COVID-19, the impact of COVID-19 on their health promotion practices, and how they utilized their networks to maintain CMHP. The presentations include: Shirley Alleyne, MB, BS, Finding Purpose in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Partnering of Child Psychiatrists and Educators for Childrenâ€™s Health and Academic Success;Debra Koss, MD, Child and Adolescent Psychiatrists as Mental Health Advocates: Every Voice Matters;Elise Fallucco, MD, Shifting Gears: Statewide and National Efforts to Integrate Mental Health in Pediatric Primary Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic;and Dominique Charlot-Swilley, PhD, and Matthew Biel MD, MSc, Nurturing the Nurturers During COVID-19: Rapid-Response Virtual Support Groups for Parents and Educators of Young Children. Participants will be invited to share their CMHP initiatives. Jeff Bostic, MD, EdD, will then synthesize themes from the presentations, providing guidance on best practices for CMHP maintenance during national crises. Then there will be a Q&A session. Results: Child and adolescent psychiatrists and CPs were uniquely skilled to forecast and address CMH needs during COVID-19. They utilized innovative adaptations to facilitate a rapid shift in their CMHP models. In the process, child and adolescent psychiatrists and CPs have strengthened their interdisciplinary CMH training, parent education, and advocacy skills. Conclusions: COVID-19 presented unique challenges to all medical professionals. Child and adolescent psychiatrists and CPs have risen to COVID-19â€™s challenge, leveraging prior networks to amplify the voices of children and families and maintain CMHP. Lessons learned during COVID-19 must inform national policy and permanently keep the CMHP â€œlights ONâ€ during national crises. PSC, ADV, CON","Alleyne, S.; Biel, M.

"ESCAPE FROM THE ESCAPE: ADDRESSING SCREEN MEDIA HABITS IN INDIVIDUAL PSYCHOTHERAPY","Objectives: The objective of this presentation is to review therapeutic tools for screening, assessment, and treatment of excessive and problematic screen use in children and teens in the setting of outpatient individual therapy. Methods: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in unprecedented screen exposure and decline in daily structure in youth, making recognizing and treating problematic screen use essential to mental health care. Despite internet gaming disorder (IGD) in section 3 of the DSM-5 and gaming disorder in the ICD, there is a lack of standards for screening, assessment, and treatment of media-related problems in child and adolescent psychiatry. The audience will be polled to gauge current related practices. The author will share valuable techniques for assessing this topic and approaches to maintain neutrality and alliance with patients and their parents, while maximizing engagement. Psychotherapeutic treatment options will be explored, including CBT and motivational interviewing (MI), psychoeducation, psychodynamic approaches, and mindfulness. Effective treatment courses may include a â€œdopamine detoxification,â€ followed by a phase of external regulation with the eventual goal of self-regulation. Aspects of the authorâ€™s 12-year experience as an internet and video game addiction specialist will be incorporated, including cases highlighting clinical themes. Results: Problematic screen use frequently presents in clinical practice and is often obscured and complicated by a lack of insight. Such problems are easily missed by psychiatrists without careful inquiry. Patients often resist frank discussion of problematic habits and remain ambivalent toward addressing them. Many have evaded attempts by authority figures to restrict their use and are predisposed against similar attempts by providers. MI can help assess and address these challenges and encourage a healthy relationship with technology. Clinicians must effectively psychoeducate their patients and guide them through the stages of change and phases of treatment to achieve a healthy, self-regulated relationship with digital technology. Conclusions: The need for clinicians to screen for, assess, and treat problematic screen use continues to grow at an overwhelming pace. Psychiatrists meet this challenge by adapting and enhancing psychotherapeutic tools to assess and treat children and teens with problematic screen media use.

"SELF-INJURIOUS BEHAVIOR IN CATATONIA IN AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER: POINTERS, PEARLS, AND CHALLENGES","Objectives: The objectives of this presentation are to provide an overview of the current understanding regarding repetitive self-injurious behavior as a symptom of catatonia in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the paradigms and lessons learned, as well as longstanding and novel challenges. Methods: The literature review and direct clinical experience will be discussed. Results: Catatonia is reported to occur in 12% to 20% of youth with ASD, with significant advances in understanding over the past 2 decades. Some youth with ASD experience more â€œexpectedâ€ psychomotor-retarded catatonic symptoms, such as slowness, rigidity, getting â€œstuck,â€ and posturing, speech abnormalities, or frank mutism, which are often coupled with prominent skill regression. This presentation can lead to massive clinical devastation, as is also the case when psychomotor agitation dominates the catatonic picture, often in the form of intractable self-injury devoid of any operant function, unresponsive to any behavioral intervention, and often requiring the most desperate measures of bodily restraint to prevent catastrophic tissue damage. Three current cases will be reviewed describing catatonia in ASD, where life-threatening self-injurious behavior (SIB) dominated the catatonic clinical picture. One youth had experienced prior catatonic episodes resulting in severe malnutrition and bilateral retinal detachment from head-directed SIB before relative stability was achieved with ECT;maintenance ECT remained de rigueur for months as this patientâ€™s illness course waxed and waned. Another youth spent 9 months restrained in a pediatric unit in a state of chronic agitated catatonia until ECT introduction;despite massive improvement with ECT, this patient exemplified the complexity of such cases in terms of additional behavioral complexities requiring intensive management. A third youth with intractable head-directed SIB experienced prompt relief with ECT introduction;his treatment, however, was inadvertently disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many lessons learned from his brief relapse and subsequent renewed recovery. Conclusions: Recognition of repetitive SIBs devoid of environmental function as part of the catatonic spectrum in ASD is no longer novel. Much continues to be learned, however, about both the acute and long-term management of such patients, with pearls, new challenges, and vistas for improvement.

"THE TEXAS CHILD MENTAL HEALTH CARE CONSORTIUM: BRINGING ACADEMIC EXPERTISE TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH ARENA","Objectives: The objective of this presentation is to share with child and adolescent psychiatrists the unique nature of the Texas Child Mental Health Care Consortium (TCMHCC) and its contributions to improving mental health treatment for children in the state of Texas. Methods: This panel presentation discusses development of a comprehensive state program designed to support mental health education for primary care providers, mental health research, access to mental health services through schools, and expansion of the child and adolescent psychiatry workforce in the public sector. Results: In Texas, the chairs of psychiatry in every medical school in the state meet with the intent to improve mental health outcomes for all Texas residents. These efforts resulted in the passage of Texas Senate Bill 11, creating the TCMHCC. At the core of the plan for these improvements is the Child Psychiatry Access Network (CPAN), a peer-to-peer consultation service for primary care providers enabling them to get immediate assistance with their patients presenting with mental health symptoms. The TCMHCC includes not only CPAN but also a 4-session psychiatric telemedicine service that is accessible through public schools, expansion of existing child and adolescent fellowships and the creation of 3 additional fellowships, residency rotations in community mental health clinics to include salary support for the attending psychiatrists supervising the rotation, and 2 statewide research networks. Our consortium has the potential to reach all of the children in our state by removing barriers of insurance, increasing ease of access by meeting children where they already are (school), and providing excellent and consistent funding directly from the state budget, instead of a short-term grant. Because our programs are all virtual, implementation has continued forward even in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: The state of Texas supports its children by leveraging the expertise of every medical school in the state to create sweeping improvements in mental healthcare access.

"BECOMING CHAMPIONS FOR CHILD MENTAL HEALTH ACCESS: LESSONS FROM IMPLEMENTING A CHILD PSYCHIATRY ACCESS PROGRAM IN MISSISSIPPI","Objectives: A rural state with many healthcare disparities, Mississippi experiences a lack of child and adolescent psychiatry workforce availability. To extend available capacity to meet significant needs, Mississippiâ€™s Child Psychiatry Access Program (CPAP), known as the Child Access to Mental Health and Psychiatry program (CHAMP), was formed in 2018 to provide telepsychiatry consultation services to underserved areas in the stateâ€™s Delta region along the Mississippi River. CHAMP has since expanded statewide in response to increased need for services created by the COVID-19 pandemic. We briefly review the initial implementation of CHAMP as a prototypical program for rural and underserved Southern states. Methods: We present 2-year program outcome data characterizing provider composition and consultation activities overall and based on various geographical and sociodemographic groups. We review past and ongoing internal quality improvement efforts identifying important recruitment strategies of providers, including novel strategies tested due to the pandemic. We review efforts to adapt CHAMP to involve trainees (psychiatry residents/child and adolescent psychiatry fellows) as CPAP members. Results: CHAMP has enrolled 114 pediatric primary care providers (10% of state workforce) consisting of 46 pediatricians, 16 family medicine physicians, and 43 nurse practitioners. We have provided 225 consultations for young children (4%), elementary-aged children (41%), and adolescents (55%). Consultations have been primarily for minority children (54%) and those on public insurance (72%). Quality improvement shows variation across engagement and recruitment strategies with teleconference (6.0) and in-person (2.4) contact yielding the best enrollment per contact attempt. Conclusions: Extending the reach of a very small child and adolescent psychiatry workforce into primary care is possible through a CPAP in rural, underserved Southern states. CPAPs like CHAMP have the potential to be a significant addition to mental healthcare accessibility. We discuss the promise and challenges common to developing, implementing, and expanding CPAPs in rural, diverse Southern states, while highlighting the clinical perspectives of our CPAP team including the training opportunities experienced by a child and adolescent psychiatry fellow.

"MICHIGAN CHILD COLLABORATIVE CARE PROGRAM (MC3): TEN YEARS OF GROWTH, ADAPTATION, AND LEARNING","Objectives: This presentation aims to describe the unique opportunities and challenges encountered in the development and delivery of telepsychiatric consultation services through the Michigan Child Psychiatry Access Program (MC3). We will specifically address outreach to vulnerable populations, and to adaptations during the time of COVID-19. Methods: A review of existing program data will describe the populations served, number of consultations provided, naming of types of services offered, funding relationships, and current state of service delivery within the MC3 program. Results: Over the course of 10 years, the MC3 program has provided 8500 consultations to pediatric primary care and perinatal providers. Pilot programming has also included services to populations of specific need, particularly the children and families of Flint, and the Tribal Health Centers of Michigan. The most common diagnoses discussed are related to anxiety, depression, and ADHD. During 2020, approximately 30% of consultations were related to the impact of COVID-19. The rate of consultation during the initial period of the pandemic fell by 37% from the year prior, and beginning in November of 2020, the rate of consultation resumed to rates maintained prior to the pandemic. We will present more detailed demographic data on the sociodemographic representation of patients we consulted on during the pandemic time period. We will also describe additional education efforts that include 87 live and recorded educational presentations on a variety of topics. Conclusions: Scaffolding a telepsychiatry program such as MC3 requires significant foundational and ongoing resources. A dedicated staff, ongoing relationships with the existing community mental health infrastructure, and sustainable funding allow for this program to be responsive to the changing needs of a stateâ€™s population. Despite this, significant work remains to leverage this service as a tool to narrow healthcare disparities in child mental health. Responsive changes to data collection and direct engagement with local community mental health centers can allow for the identification of needs specific to certain populations, particularly during this time of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"ACCESS MENTAL HEALTH CONNECTICUT: FAMILY-CENTERED PEDIATRIC MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATIONS","Objectives: The objective of this presentation is to review the family-centered, well-being-focused nature of the ACCESS (Access to all of Connecticutâ€™s Children of Every Socioeconomic Status) Mental Health program and its contributions to improving mental health treatment for children in the state of Connecticut. Methods: ACCESS Mental Health Connecticut is a state-funded initiative created as a line item in the Department of Children and Familiesâ€™ budget as a component of the gun-control legislation passed in the wake of the Sandy Hook school shooting. Initiated in June 2014 and modeled after the Massachusetts Child Psychiatry Access Project (MCPAP), the Connecticut model includes 3 Hubs to support mental health education and the well-being of pediatric primary care providers, and to support families regardless of insurance status. The model incorporates a team of child and adolescent psychiatrists, licensed social work clinicians, a program coordinator, and, uniquely, a peer specialist. The peer specialist is a parent with a child with mental health challenges who can support pediatric patientsâ€™ parents emotionally and practically as they attempt to process and navigate the mental health landscape. Results: Since its inception in June 2014, the ACCESS Mental Health Hubs have provided over 36,700 consultations supporting over 7000 youth and their families. During the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ACCESS Mental Health Teams initiated weekly well-being support Zoom meetings for the stateâ€™s pediatric primary care physicians (PPCPs). Now monthly, the Zoom â€œClinical Conversations with ACCESS Mental Healthâ€ provides mental health education to address the PPCPâ€™s unique needs. Hub child and adolescent psychiatrists also participate in Project ECHO (Extension of Community Healthcare Outcomes), AAP Connecticut webinars, grand rounds, and other venues. Conclusions: PPCP mental health education and early access to mental healthcare promises to identify, support, and treat children and families experiencing mental health challenges that have previously been unable to access services.

"PIVOTING WITH THE PANDEMIC: CHALLENGES AND SUCCESSES OF CHILD PSYCHIATRY ACCESS PROGRAMS NATIONWIDE","Objectives: A nationwide shortage of behavioral healthcare services has prompted primary care providers (PCPs) to fill the gap in providing behavioral health care. Pediatric behavioral health needs have further increased during the pandemic. However, PCPs often lack specialized training and resources to meet the behavioral health needs of their patients. Methods: Child Psychiatry Access Programs (CPAPs) augment mental healthcare resources through collaborative care models based on peer-to-peer consultation, ongoing psychiatry education for PCPs, and other services. To date, CPAPs have been developed in 40 states, scaffolded by the National Network of Child Psychiatry Access Programs including 21 programs with funding from the Health Resources and Services Administration. Informed by community-engaged collaborations, CPAPs have leveraged their child behavioral health expertise in creative ways such as integration of peer specialists for families, telemedicine partnerships with Tribal Health Centers and schools, expanded child psychiatry fellowship education programs, and novel research networks. Diverse programs from 4 different statesâ€”Connecticut, Michigan, Mississippi, and Texasâ€”will describe innovative strategies to implement and expand their programs, and lessons learned during the global pandemic. Furthermore, the discussant will provide an overview of CPAP functioning and innovation during the pandemic, including a focus on the Massachusetts program. Results: CPAPs have leveraged mental health expertise in various states, allowing more children from rural and other underserved communities to access mental health care in their relatively low-cost primary care setting, schools, or local communities. As these collaborative care programs are all virtual, implementation has continued forward even in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Child and adolescent psychiatrists can partner with CPAPs in their state and with primary care providers to improve the care for children. Conclusions: Nationwide, CPAP programs are transforming mental health care through this model of consultation, resource/referral coordination, ongoing medical education, research, and training opportunities.

"THERAPIST SELF-DISCLOSURE (TSD) DURING TIMES OF UNCERTAINTY","Objectives: This Clinical Perspectives is designed to explore the important considerations around therapist self-disclosure (TSD) when working with youth and their families. The focus will be on TSD during times of uncertainty, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, racial tensions, and political unrest, and on the use of self-disclosure in supervision with trainees. Participants will gain an understanding of the different ways in which TSD is defined and the various ways in which disclosures occur, with an eye toward developmental considerations that make TSD with youth and families unique. We aim to present a framework of TSD as it pertains to child and adolescent psychiatric care. Methods: This Clinical Perspectives will include an introduction to TSD, the various ways in which TSD occurs, and developmental considerations that make TSD with youth unique, as well as a proposed set of guidelines and factors to consider when considering TSD with youth and families. There will be 4 presenters focusing on TSD as it applies to the therapistâ€™s experience with COVID-19, politics, race, and use/instruction of self-disclosure in supervision with trainees, with time given for a discussant to reflect on this subject and a question-and-answer portion. Results: Therapistsâ€™ experiences with illness and uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, political orientation, and racial considerations come up in clinical work with youth and families. In particular, over the last 18 months, youth and families may have elicited guidance on topics that are not traditionally part of their mental health treatment. Despite the frequency of TSD, there is limited discourse and guidance to help clinicians navigate TSD. Both trainee and practicing therapists have been shown to underreport TSD, which can create and perpetuate clinical blind spots. The challenging events of the 2020 and 2021 calendar years presented unique opportunities for therapists to self-disclose around shared uncertainties with their patients and families. Conclusions: The past 18 months have presented unique opportunities for therapists to tackle self-disclosure. As such, it is imperative that therapists are cognizant of the myriad ways in which disclosures occur, and that they have a framework by which to navigate self-disclosure, as well as ways in which to promote discussion of TSD with trainees.

"FROM KNOWLEDGE TO PRACTICE, PUTTING BEST PRACTICES INTO PLACE IN THE CLINIC AND WARDS","Objectives: At the conclusion of the lecture, attendees will: 1) understand how to implement best practices in the mental health care of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID);2) review how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected mental health services for individuals with ASD/ID;and 3) develop expertise in utilization of telepsychiatry to enhance training opportunities to increase exposure of child and adolescent psychiatry fellows to individuals with ASD/ID across treatment settings. Methods: Kelly McGuire, MD, MPA, will discuss several training services developed to: 1) implement best practices in the mental health care of individuals with ASD/ID;and 2) increase child and adolescent psychiatry fellowâ€™s clinical competency in working with this population across treatment settings (including outpatient psychiatry, inpatient psychiatry, and psychiatric consultation-liaison). Dr. McGuire will also discuss how these services were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the transition to telepsychiatry. Results: Dr. McGuire will review the need for and development of an outpatient consultation service, a short-term psychiatry outpatient clinic, and a consultation-liaison service for individuals with ASD/ID. Dr. McGuire will present the substantial increase in demand for all of these services postâ€“COVID-19 shutdown, and how telepsychiatry allowed for the services to be maintained and even increased the capacity of providers to meet these needs during the shutdown. Conclusions: There are many opportunities across treatment settings for child and adolescent psychiatry to meet the needs of individuals with ASD/ID. The integration of psychiatry fellows on these teams can increase traineesâ€™ experience in caring for this population. Telepsychiatry has the potential to facilitate and improve these opportunities, thereby increasing access to mental health services for this population.

"BURNOUT AMONG PHYSICIANS IN TRAINING","Objectives: The objectives of this presentation are to: 1) review the current data on resident/fellow burnout and strategies to mitigate it;and 2) emphasize the trainee perspective on physician burnout and well-being. Methods: Being a physician is immensely demanding, leading to stress and burnout. Trainee physicians are more at risk for burnout due to a demanding work environment, little control of time management, and sleep deprivation. We aim to review and present factors contributing specifically to resident/fellow burnout, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and overall efficacy of interventions (therapeutic and preventative). Results: There has been growing research interest on physician burnout in recent times, likely related to high rates of burnout. Medscape National Physician Burnout surveys over the last 3 years have shown greater than 40% of physicians reporting burnout. Small studies done at residency programs around the time of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) reforms in trainee schedules in 2003 and 2011 (work hour limits, etc) show variable results of improvement in burnout rates. A systematic review of limiting work hours as an intervention has shown reduced emotional exhaustion and reduced burnout rates. Other interventions that have been studied include meditation, self-care workshops, protected sleep periods, communication, and stress management trainings;the effects of such interventions have been variable. While physician burnout is not a novel concern, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemicâ€“related increase in workload on physician trainees has only heightened the existing challenges. Conclusions: Although a well-known problem among healthcare professionals, burnout among resident/fellows is important to acknowledge and address appropriately. Creating more awareness among the physician community may help identify burnout early and prevent serious downstream effects such as anxiety, depression, and physician suicide.

"PHYSICIAN BURNOUT AND MAINTAINING WELLNESS: THE OTHER PANDEMIC","Objectives: This presentation will discuss the definition of physician burnout. We will discuss commonly cited causes of burnout as well as the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on burnout. Longitudinal data from the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Psychiatry department will be presented. This can serve as a representation of burnout within an academic setting in the Southeast. The Well-Being Index (WBI) will be discussed in further depth as a measure of burnout. Technology use in assessing wellness will be presented in an engaging way. We will take a closer look at wellness within residency and fellowship, and a personal story of burnout during training will be presented. Methods: A review of nationwide data will be presented to give an overview of the problem of physician burnout. We will take a closer look at the longitudinal UAB data on the WBI and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on physician well-being. Polls, breakout sessions, real-life cases, word clouds, and art will be used during the presentation to engage the audience. Finally, a personal story of burnout will be presented in an interview format. Results: Nationwide, 41% of psychiatrists are reporting burnout in a recent study. At UAB, this was somewhat lower at 27.27%. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the level of burnout. At UAB, the burnout level among psychiatry residents and child and adolescent psychiatry fellows was 44.44%. This level also has increased over the past year, presumably in part related to COVID-19 stressors. Conclusions: Physician burnout is a growing problem among physicians nationwide. Self-care and wellness are ethical issues and part of professionalism. It is a physicianâ€™s responsibility to take care of themselves so that one can care well for patients. It is an incredible loss for the community when a physician gets burned out and leaves medicine or retires early. Additionally, suicide rates among physicians are troublingly high. It is difficult for psychiatrists to provide a high level of care to patients when they are experiencing burnout. Healthcare organizations need to try to implement wellness strategies, and these also need to be part of the training curricula. ETH, REST, STRESS","Bukelis, I.; Lockwood, L. E.; Myint, M.

"SUICIDALITY IN MUSLIM YOUTH","Objectives: Participants will review the DSM-5 Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI) and CFI Supplementary Modules to obtain a culturally informed history, including religious identification. Participants will consider the intersectional cultural identity of these youth. Participants will learn techniques to navigate culturally informed conversations about suicidality with Muslim youth and their families. Methods: A literature review was conducted to examine suicidality in Muslim youth. In addition, Sarah Arshad, MD, will share specific cases of Muslim youth from different cultural backgrounds with acute suicidality. Results: American Muslim youth come from different cultural backgrounds. Understanding their intersectional cultural identities is critical in specifically navigating their religious identity. This can then be used to understand their presentation to mental health care and how their religious identity affects their symptoms such as suicidality. For many American Muslim youth, their religious identity may be different from their families, in part due to differences in other cultural factors, such as a desire to assimilate into American cultural norms, or result in barriers to communication with families. Therefore, culturally conceptualizing the youthâ€™s identity and navigating familial expectations can help providers consider the unique circumstances that Muslim youth face and can help providers guide culturally sensitive conversations between Muslim youth and their families. In addition, some youth can find resilience in their Muslim identity, and providers can build upon these in safety planning. Conclusions: Suicide is a leading cause of mortality in teenagers, and there have been increased rates of suicidal youth during the COVID-19 pandemic. And although religious identity in general is thought to be a protective factor, this may be more nuanced in Muslim youth. As healthcare providers, it is imperative to be able to obtain and critically use culturally informed information in evaluation and treatment planning with these youth and families.

"PERCEIVED CHALLENGES AND BENEFITS OF DEVELOPING VIRTUAL INTENSIVE TREATMENT PROGRAMS FOR ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS WITH EATING DISORDERS","Objectives: Shortly following the World Health Organizationâ€™s declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic in March 2020, leadership within our academic medical center requested that we convert our in-person partial hospitalization programs for children, adolescents, and young adults with eating disorders (EDs) to a virtual format. This presentation describes our experiences with developing 2 virtual intensive treatment programs for EDs, with a focus on perceived challenges and benefits. Methods: Clinical staff provided their perspectives working within our institutionâ€™s 2 virtual intensive treatment programs for EDs, one of which treats children and adolescents (ages 10-16 years) and the other of which treats young adults (ages 17-25 years). Feedback was obtained from an interdisciplinary team of providers, including psychologists, psychiatrists, adolescent medicine physicians, therapists, and dietitians. Results: Providers identified a number of challenges and benefits related to offering an intensive treatment program for EDs using a virtual format. Challenges included decreased supervision of patientsâ€™ eating behaviors during and after meals, complications obtaining accurate weight information, patient fatigue and reduced attention following multiple hours of virtual sessions, patient hesitancy speaking in virtual groups, fewer opportunities for in-session exposure therapy, and difficulties with technology. Benefits included greater access to services for patients with geographical limitations, easier involvement of family members in treatment, greater emphasis on between-session exposure exercises, increased generalizability to patientsâ€™ natural environment, reduced disruption of prosocial activities and responsibilities, and more seamless transitions to outpatient treatment. Conclusions: COVID-19 has rapidly accelerated the mental health fieldâ€™s adoption of telehealth services and forced providers to modify intensive treatment programs in novel ways. Our team experience suggests that there are a number of challenges and benefits to offering virtual treatment, which has implications for the future of telehealth for children, adolescents, and young adults with EDs.

"ADOLESCENT IDENTITY AND RACISM","Objectives: A focus on identity and an increasing capacity for abstract and moral reasoning are hallmarks of adolescent development. Following the deaths of George Floyd and others, along with the structural inequities noted in the infection rate and deaths of minorities secondary to COVID-19, there has been a societal reckoning on the effect of racism. This has attracted constant media attention to which adolescents have been inundated, leading to increasing anxiety, depression, and vicarious trauma. This is on top of the chronic stress those of marginalized communities might have experienced from direct exposures to racism. This presentation will explore the concept of race from the developmental perspective of the adolescent. We will discuss the different levels of racism, the unique lens that the pandemic has given on its influence on the social determinants of mental health in adolescents, and the role that child and adolescent psychiatrists can play. Methods: Brandon Newsome, MD, will ground the session with clarifying terminology such as racism, antiracism, prejudice, and social determinants of health, to ensure a common language. We will highlight key issues in the current syndemic of racism and COVID-19 and the way in which it has influenced outcomes of physical, mental, and social determinants of health in adolescents. We will then showcase how these issues might present in clinical encounters with adolescents. Finally, we will discuss how child and adolescent psychiatrists converse with teens on racism, social determinants of health, and antiracism. The audience will be engaged with questions, polls, and cases. Results: Participants will be able to: 1) meaningfully discuss the different forms of racism and understand the social determinants of health;2) recognize stressors of the current syndemic on behavioral and social determinants of health, in particular as it relates to adolescent development;and 3) discuss unique opportunities of psychiatrists in engaging and advocating for antiracist practices when working with adolescents and their families. Conclusions: This presentation will highlight specific challenges that 2020 and 2021 has brought regarding concerns of racism as experienced by adolescents, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, and unique opportunities to address this with our adolescent patients.

"HOW MUCH SCREEN TIME IS TOO MUCH?","Objectives: Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, screens and social media were ubiquitous in the lives of US adolescents. In 2019, teenagers were already consuming more than 7 hours of screen time daily. By March 2020, the digital world became many teenagersâ€™ primary connection to the outside world. Families and mental health clinicians suddenly found themselves immersed in new predicaments surrounding youth digital media use. Youth were forced to face personal stressors, a viral pandemic, and repeated racial injustice through the lens of screens. By the end of this talk, participants will: 1) understand the multitude of ways teenagers use digital media as a part of normal adolescent growth and development;2) identify ways in which youth screen time changed over the course of 2020;and 3) be able to reflect on the potential risks of excessive digital media use when relying upon it as a primary source of interpersonal connectedness. Methods: We will briefly review the existing data regarding how social media use and screen time have been tied to normative adolescent identity formation. This presentation will review early research findings surrounding youth mental health during the pandemic, and the presenter will share preliminary data from her own research that used novel digital phenotyping technology to examine adolescent digital media use in youth before and after the start of the pandemic. We will then discuss specific situations over the last year that have challenged our reliance on screen media, as well as engage the audience through case examples. Results: Online communication plays a significant role in the way many adolescents strengthen interpersonal relationships, establish personal values, and consolidate identity. However, 2020 saw both a significant rise in screen time as well as adolescent mental health crises. Unfortunately for youth under duress, digital media use can become a maladaptive coping skill that can exacerbate racial trauma or place an unsupervised adolescent at imminent risk. Conclusions: The past year has allowed mental health experts to witness firsthand the varied risks and benefits of youth reliance on digital media use. Thus, the need for standardized, preemptive guidance for youth and parents surrounding healthy digital media use has become imperative for clinical practice.

"OPENING PANDEMIC'S BOX: SUPPORTING DEVELOPING ADOLESCENTS","Objectives: Developmental tasks of adolescence involve identity formation, building relationships, and achieving independence. This session will highlight some important aspects of adolescent development: sports/athletics, racial identity and racism, school and learning, and digital media. Special focus will be given to challenges with COVID-19, including activity cancellation, school changes/virtual schooling, increased awareness of racial and social disparities, and the role of media in social connections. Effects on mental health and well-being and the role of child and adolescent psychiatrists will also be discussed. Methods: Presentations will review the relevant literature and data with didactics, videos, case examples, polling, and interactive discussion. Raymond Pan, MD, child and adolescent psychiatrist, will discuss the role of athletics in adolescence, stressors involved with athletics, and issues related to concussions. Brandon Newsome, MD, psychiatry resident, will approach racial identity and racism in adolescence and how COVID-19 has influenced social determinants of mental health. Desiree Shapiro, MD, early-career child and adolescent psychiatrist, will discuss school- and learning-related mental health and explore disparities and injustices. Meredith Gansner, MD, early-career child and adolescent psychiatrist, will discuss media use and screen time in adolescence, effects of the pandemic, and potential risks of excessive digital media while maintaining interpersonal connectedness. Discussants Eugene Beresin, MD, and Liwei Hua, MD, PhD, both of whom are child and adolescent psychiatrists, will synthesize the material presented and facilitate discussion. Results: Participants will: 1) recognize the role of sports, racial identity and racism, school and learning, and digital media in the context of normal adolescent development as they relate to identity and relationship formation, as well as independence;2) learn about risks to these areas of development in the context of the pandemic;and 3) identify the role of child and adolescent psychiatrists in addressing the effects on mental health associated with the pandemicâ€™s disruption of expected adolescent developmental milestones. Conclusions: The session focuses on topics relevant to adolescent life (sports/athletics, racial identity and racism, school and learning, and digital media) from a developmental perspective and seeks to educate clinicians on issues related to the topics.

"PANDEMIC IMPACT ON DEMAND FOR PEDIATRIC HEALTH CARE: OPPORTUNITIES FOR CHILD PSYCHIATRY/PEDIATRICIAN ENGAGEMENT","Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the demand for pediatric health care across all domains. Mental health providers have struggled to keep up with demand, while some pediatric practices face insolvency due to reduced demand for pediatric sick visits. We quantify these changes in a pediatric hospital system and describe opportunities for child and adolescent psychiatrists to engage with pediatrician colleagues in the new pediatric healthcare landscape. Methods: Visit data from a large metropolitan childrenâ€™s hospital for the periods March 2020 to February 2021 and March 2019 to February 2020 were compared, and key stakeholders were interviewed. Results: Pediatric outpatient visits declined by 28.3% (p &lt; 0.001), and emergency department visits decreased by 45.6% (p &lt; 0.001). Outpatient child and adolescent psychiatry visits increased by 23% (p = 0.002). Decreased demand for pediatric care resulted in underemployment of general pediatricians. We describe strategies for general pediatricians to meet increasing mental healthcare demand in partnership with child and adolescent psychiatrists. These strategies range from the expansion of skill sets to temporary or even permanent redeployment into mental healthâ€“focused pediatric care. Conclusions: Pediatric mental health care is a growing proportion of all pediatric health care. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated awareness of the need for more pediatric clinicians to participate in mental health care. Child and adolescent psychiatrists can assist pediatric practices and hospital systems to meet mental healthcare demand and shift resources to maintain financial viability through this time of change.

"MENTAL HEALTH INTEGRATION WITH PRIMARY CARE: UNIQUE OPPORTUNITIES AND RESPONSES IN THE FACE OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC","Objectives: This Clinical Perspectives is designed to inform about the global pediatric mental health (MH) crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic and discuss how different institutions combined collaborative care with the telehealth platforms for child and adolescent psychiatrists to support primary care providers (PCPs) in addressing the increasing MH needs of their patients. Methods: This talk includes 4 presentations. The first is a discussion about changes in the demand in pediatric health care across all domains. The second presentation will help the audience become familiar with a model to train PCPs to identify and treat pediatric anxiety during COVID-19 utilizing telehealth. The third presentation will demonstrate how a telepsychiatry access program provided virtual learning sessions with the child and adolescent psychiatrist as a peer consultant for the PCPs. The final presentation will focus on the development of a crisis counseling service to meet the MH demands of the underserved population. We will encourage active participation throughout the presentation with smaller groups for discussion and sharing of best practices. Results: The use of telehealth technology during the COVID-19 crisis has created unique opportunities for collaborative care between child and adolescent psychiatrists and PCPs. The pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented rise in MH disorders with increases in levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. The youth population may be particularly at risk due to the disruption of their education, lack of social activities, and decreased physical activities. Healthcare workers are also particularly vulnerable to emotional distress from their exposure to the virus. Prevention efforts, such as screening for MH issues, psychoeducation, and psychosocial support, should focus on these at-risk groups. Programs that include virtual training, consultation, and delivering care to the underserved population will all be discussed. Conclusions: Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for PCPs to provide MH care has been increasing at an alarming rate. Child and adolescent psychiatrists can address these needs and support PCPs by practicing in a collaborative care model. The advantages of the collaborative care model include empowering PCPs, reducing burnout, and improving access to MH care for the pediatric population. CON, TVM, PRE","Chen, J.; Walkup, J.

Material and Methods: During the COVID-19 pandemic, an online questionnaire gathered data from 55,589 participants from 40 countries (64.85% females aged 35.80 Â±13.61;34.05% males aged 34.90Â±13.29 and 1.10% other aged 31.64Â±13.15). Distress and probable depression were identified with the use of a previously developed cut-off and algorithm respectively. Statistical Analysis: Descriptive statistics were calculated. Chi-square tests, multiple forward stepwise linear regression analyses and Factorial Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tested relations among variables. Results: Probable depression was detected in 17.80% and distress in 16.71%. A significant percentage reported a deterioration in mental state, family dynamics and everyday lifestyle. Persons with a history of mental disorders had higher rates of current depression (31.82% vs. 13.07%). At least half of participants were accepting (at least to a moderate degree) a non-bizarre conspiracy. The highest Relative Risk (RR) to develop depression was associated with history of Bipolar disorder and self-harm/attempts (RR=5.88). Suicidality was not increased in persons without a history of any mental disorder. Based on these results a model was developed. Conclusions: The final model revealed multiple vulnerabilities and an interplay leading from simple anxiety to probable depression and suicidality through distress. This could be of practical utility since many of these factors are modifiable. Future research and interventions should specifically focus on them.","Fountoulakis, Konstantinos N.; Karakatsoulis, Grigorios, Abraham, Seri, Adorjan, Kristina, Ahmed, Helal Uddin, AlarcÃ³n, Renato D.; Arai, Kiyomi, Auwal, Sani Salihu, Berk, Michael, Bjedov, Sarah, Bobes, Julio, Bobes-Bascaran, Teresa, Bourgin-Duchesnay, Julie, Bredicean, Cristina Ana, Bukelskis, Laurynas, Burkadze, Akaki, Abud, Indira Indiana Cabrera, Castilla-Puentes, Ruby, Cetkovich, Marcelo, Colon-Rivera, Hector, Corral, Ricardo, Cortez-Vergara, Carla, Crepin, Piirika, De Berardis, Domenico, Zamora Delgado, Sergio, De Lucena, David, De Sousa, Avinash, Stefano, Ramona Di, Dodd, Seetal, Elek, Livia Priyanka, Elissa, Anna, Erdelyi-Hamza, Berta, Erzin, Gamze, Etchevers, Martin J.; Falkai, Peter, Farcas, Adriana, Fedotov, Ilya, Filatova, Viktoriia, Fountoulakis, Nikolaos K.; Frankova, Iryna, Franza, Francesco, Frias, Pedro, Galako, Tatiana, Garay, Cristian J.; Garcia-Ãlvarez, Leticia, GarcÃ­a-Portilla, Maria Paz, Gonda, Xenia, Gondek, Tomasz M.; GonzÃ¡lez, Daniela Morera, Gould, Hilary, Grandinetti, Paolo, Grau, Arturo, Groudeva, Violeta, Hagin, Michal, Harada, Takayuki, Hasan, Tasdik M.; Hashim, Nurul Azreen, Hilbig, Jan, Hossain, Sahadat, Iakimova, Rossitza, Ibrahim, Mona, Iftene, Felicia, Ignatenko, Yulia, Irarrazaval, Matias, Ismail, Zaliha, Ismayilova, Jamila, Jakobs, Asaf, Jakovljevic, Miro, JakÅ¡ic, Nenad, Javed, Afzal, Kafali, Helin Yilmaz, Karia, Sagar, Kazakova, Olga, Khalifa, Doaa, Khaustova, Olena, Koh, Steve, Kopishinskaia, Svetlana, Kosenko, Korneliia, Koupidis, Sotirios A.; Kovacs, Illes, Kulig, Barbara, Lalljee, Alisha, Liewig, Justine, Majid, Abdul, Malashonkova, Evgeniia, Malik, Khamelia, Malik, Najma Iqbal, Mammadzada, Gulay, Mandalia, Bilvesh, Marazziti, Donatella, Marcinko, Darko, Martinez, Stephanie, Matiekus, Eimantas, Mejia, Gabriela, Memon, Roha Saeed, MartÃ­nez, Xarah Elenne Meza, Mickeviciute, Dalia, Milev, Roumen, Mohammed, Muftau, Molina-LÃ³pez, Alejandro, Morozov, Petr, Muhammad, Nuru Suleiman, Mustac, Filip, Naor, Mika S.; Nassieb, Amira, Navickas, Alvydas, Okasha, Tarek, Pandova, Milena, Panfil, Anca-Livia, Panteleeva, Liliya, Papava, Ion, Patsali, Mikaella E.; Pavlichenko, Alexey, Pejuskovic, Bojana, Da Costa, Mariana Pinto, Popkov, Mikhail, Popovic, Dina, Raduan, Nor Jannah Nasution, RamÃ­rez, Francisca Vargas, Rancans, Elmars, Razali, Salmi, Rebok, Federico, Rewekant, Anna, Flores, Elena Ninoska Reyes, Rivera-Encinas, MarÃ­a Teresa, Saiz, Pilar, de Carmona, Manuel SÃ¡nchez, MartÃ­nez, David Saucedo, Saw, Jo Anne, Saygili, GÃ¶rkem, Schneidereit, Patricia, Shah, Bhumika, Shirasaka, Tomohiro, Silagadze, Ketevan, Sitanggang, Satti, Skugarevsky, Oleg, Spikina, Anna, Mahalingappa, Sridevi Sira, Stoyanova, Maria, Szczegielniak, Anna, Tamasan, Simona Claudia, Tavormina, Giuseppe, Tavormina, Maurilio Giuseppe Maria, Theodorakis, Pavlos N.; Tohen, Mauricio, Tsapakis, Eva Maria, Tukhvatullina, Dina, Ullah, Irfan, Vaidya, Ratnaraj, Vega-Dienstmaier, Johann M.; Vrublevska, Jelena, Vukovic, Olivera, Vysotska, Olga, Widiasih, Natalia, Yashikhina, Anna, Prezerakos, Panagiotis E.; Smirnova, Daria","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroneuro.2021.10.004","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: European Neuropsychopharmacology;2021.; Publication details: European Neuropsychopharmacology;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19690,""

"Mental Health Outcome and Resilience Among Aiding Wuhan Nurses: One Year After the COVID-19 Outbreak in China","This study aimed to explore whether aiding Wuhan experience of nurses was associated with adverse mental health outcome one year after the COVID-19 outbreak in China. In this study, 100 nurses with and 100 nurses without aiding Wuhan experience a year ago were enrolled from February 1, 2021 to March 31, 2021 in Zhejiang Province, China. Depression, anxiety, insomnia, distress and psychological resilience of participants was assessed and analyzed. A total of 100 participants from 112 aiding Wuhan nurses completed the survey, with a response rate of 89.3%. Another 100 nurses from the same hospitals without aiding Wuhan experience were enrolled as controls. In both groups, a considerable proportion of participants reported symptoms of depression (46.0% for the aiding Wuhan group vs. 49.0% for the controls, similarly hereinafter), anxiety (40.0% vs. 38.0%), and PTSD (61.0% vs. 56.0%). Aiding Wuhan nurses were more likely to suffer from insomnia (41.0% vs. 29.0%, PÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.041). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that aiding Wuhan experience was not associated with depression (adjusted OR (AOR) 0.22; 95%CI, 0.05-1.01), anxiety (AOR 0.53; 95%CI, 0.12-2.43), insomnia (AOR 1.52; 95%CI, 0.76-3.02), PTSD (AOR 0.50; 95%CI, 0.19-1.34), or resilience (AOR 1.59; 95%CI, 0.78-3.26). Resilience was negatively correlated with depression, anxiety, insomnia, and PTSD. This survey indicated that aiding Wuhan experience a year ago did not cause additional adverse mental health outcomes in nurses, expect for insomnia. The psychological status of nurses in general calls for more attention.","Zhang, Lai, Wang, Huang, Hu, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.10.050","20211028","COVID-19; aiding Wuhan; mental health; nurse; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19692,""
"Fentanyl-induced acute and conditioned behaviors in two inbred mouse lines: potential role for Glyoxalase","An increase in opioid-overdose deaths was evident before the COVID-19 pandemic, and has escalated since its onset. Fentanyl, a highly potent synthetic opioid, is the primary driver of these recent trends. The current study used two inbred mouse strains, C57BL/6J and A/J, to investigate the genetics of behavioral responses to fentanyl. Mice were tested for conditioned place preference and fentanyl-induced locomotor activity. C57BL/6J mice formed a conditioned place preference to fentanyl injections and fentanyl increased their activity. Neither effect was noted in A/J mice. We conducted RNA-sequencing on the nucleus accumbens of mice used for fentanyl-induced locomotor activity. Surprisingly, we noted few differentially expressed genes using treatment as the main factor. However many genes differed between strains. We validated differences in two genes: suppressor APC domain containing 1 (Sapcd1) and Glyoxalase 1 (Glo1), with quantitative PCR on RNA from the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex (PFC). In both regions A/J mice had significantly higher expression of both genes than did C57BL/6J. In prefrontal cortex, fentanyl treatment decreased Glo1 mRNA. Glyoxalase 1 catalyzes the detoxification of reactive alpha-oxoaldehydes such as glyoxal and methylglyoxal, is associated with anxiety and activity levels, and its inhibition reduces alcohol intake. We suggest that future studies assess the ability of Glo1 and related metabolites to modify opioid intake.","Harp, Martini, Rosenow, Mesner, Johnson, Farber, Rissman","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2021.113630","20211028","RNA-sequencing; acute activity; conditioned activity; conditioned place preference; fentanyl; metabolism; opioids","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19693,""
"Perceived e-learning stress as an independent predictor of e-learning readiness: Results from a nationwide survey in Bangladesh","E-learning is a relatively trending system of education that has been placed over conventional campus-based learning worldwide, especially since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to assess e-learning readiness among university students of a developing country like Bangladesh and identify the independent predictors of e-learning readiness. From 26 December 2020 to 11 January 2021, a total of 1162 university students who had enrolled for e-learning completed a semi-structured questionnaire. Data were collected online via ""Google Form"" following the principles of snowball sampling through available social media platforms in Bangladesh. A multivariable linear regression model was fitted to investigate the association of e-learning readiness with perceived e-learning stress and other independent predictor variables. A total of 1162 university students participated in this study. The results indicated that with the increase of students' perceived e-learning stress score, the average e-learning readiness score was significantly decreased (ÃŽÂ² = -0.43, 95% CI: -0.66, -0.20). The students did not seem ready, and none of the e-learning readiness scale items reached the highest mean score (5.0). The age, gender, divisional residence, preference of students and their parents, devices used, and having any eye problems were significantly associated with the students' e-learning readiness. During the prolonged period of the COVID-19 pandemic, e-learning implication strategies are needed to be assessed systematically with the level of readiness and its' impacts among students for the continuation of sound e-learning systems. The study findings recommend evaluating the e-learning readiness of university students and the mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 catastrophe in Bangladesh.","Kabir, Nasrullah, Hasan, Ahmed, Hawlader, Mitra","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0259281","20211028","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19694,""
"Public perceptions of non-adherence to pandemic protection measures by self and others: A study of COVID-19 in the United Kingdom","Novel viral pandemics present significant challenges to global public health. Non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g. social distancing) are an important means through which to control the transmission of such viruses. One of the key factors determining the effectiveness of such measures is the level of public adherence to them. Research to date has focused on quantitative exploration of adherence and non-adherence, with a relative lack of qualitative exploration of the reasons for non-adherence. To explore participants' perceptions of non-adherence to COVID-19 policy measures by self and others in the UK, focusing on perceived reasons for non-adherence. Qualitative study comprising 12 focus groups conducted via video-conferencing between 25th September and 13th November 2020. Participants were 51 UK residents aged 18 and above, reflecting a range of ages, genders and race/ethnicities. Data were analysed using a thematic approach. Participants reported seeing an increase in non-adherence in others over the course of the pandemic. Reports of non-adherence in self were lower than reports of non-adherence in others. Analysis revealed six main themes related to participants' reported reasons for non-adherence in self and others: (1) 'Alert fatigue' (where people find it difficult to follow, or switch off from, information about frequently changing rules or advice) (2) Inconsistent rules (3) Lack of trust in government (4) Learned Helplessness (5) Resistance and rebelliousness (6)The impact of vaccines on risk perception. Participants perceived a number of systemic failures (e.g. unclear policy, untrustworthy policymakers) to strongly contribute to two forms non-adherence-violations and errors. Findings suggest that latent and systemic failures-in the form of policy decisions that are commonly experienced as too changeable, inconsistent and confusing, and policy makers that are commonly perceived as untrustworthy-may play a significant role in creating the conditions that enable or encourage non-adherence.","Williams, Armitage, Tampe, Dienes","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0258781","20211028","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19695,""
"Emotion networks across self-reported depression levels during the COVID-19 pandemic","<b>ABSTRACT</b>During stressful circumstances, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, disturbances in emotional experiences can occur. These emotional disturbances, if not relieved or regulated, can be associated with feelings of depression. Currently, little is known about which emotional experiences (positive and negative) are associated with feelings of depression during COVID-19. This study aimed to estimate and compare mixed, positive and negative valence emotion networks during COVID-19 for low, moderate and high levels of self-reported depression. Across 26,034 participants, central emotional experiences included <i>gratitude</i>, <i>sadness, fear, anxiety, compassion, and being moved</i> for all self-reported depression levels; <i>love</i> for low levels of depression, and <i>confusion</i> for high levels of depression. The strongest edges included <i>fear-anxiety</i>, <i>loneliness-boredom</i>, <i>anger-disgust, determination-hope</i>, and <i>compassion-being moved</i> for all self-reported depression levels; <i>calm-relief</i>, and <i>sadness-frustration</i> for high levels of self-reported depression; and <i>admiration-being moved</i> for low and moderate self-reported depression levels. Network comparison tests showed mixed, positive and negative emotion networks significantly differed in structure across all self-reported depression levels. Network connectivity was also significantly stronger for low self-reported depression within positive and negative emotion networks. These networks provide key information on emotional experiences associated with depression during COVID-19.","Whiston, Igou, Fortune","https://doi.org/10.1080/02699931.2021.1993147","20211028","COVID-19; Emotions; depression; network analysis; sustained stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19696,""
"Unemployment, Bankruptcies, and Deaths From Multiple Causes in the COVID-19 Recession Compared With the 2000Ã¢â‚¬â€™2018 Great Recession Impact","<b>Objectives.</b> To determine whether unemployment and bankruptcy rates are related to increased excess deaths during the COVID-19 recession and to examine whether the current recession-based mortality rate not only is dependent on COVID-19 but also continues the pattern of recessions, especially the Great Recession, in relation to chronic disease mortality rates and mental health disturbances (e.g., including suicide) from 2000 to 2018. <b>Methods.</b> This study used pooled cross-sectional time series analysis to determine the impact of unemployment and bankruptcy rates on excess deaths from February to November 2020 for US states. The study used a second pooled cross-sectional time series analysis to determine whether the COVID-19Ã¢â‚¬â€™ era recessional mortality continues the impact of prepandemic recessions (2000-2018) on multiple causes of mortality. <b>Results.</b> When unemployment was at ten percent in January 2021, it was associated with approximately 48 149 excess deaths. At the same time, if bankruptcies are also accounted for at a similar recessional level, the combined effect of both produces 35Ã¢â‚¬â€°700 and 144Ã¢â‚¬â€°483 excess deaths, for unemployment and bankruptcies, respectively. These health-damaging COVID-19Ã¢â‚¬â€™recessional findings suggest a reiteration of the significantly increased major causeÃ¢â‚¬â€™specific mortality during 2000 to 2018, mitigated by the size of the health care workforce. <b>Conclusions.</b> Minimization of deaths attributable to the COVID-19 recession requires ample funding for the unemployed and underemployed, especially Black and Hispanic communities, along with significant investments in the health workforce.

"Meta-analysis of prevalence: the psychological sequelae among COVID-19 survivors","This meta-analysis aims to estimate the pooled prevalence of mental disorders among COVID-19 survivors. The databases Pubmed, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, and medRxiv have been searched up to 1 August 2021 using COVID-19, survivors, mental disorders, and their related MeSH terms. The included studies were either cross-sectional, cohort, or case-control in design. Those studies included COVID-19 survivors after 14 or more days from their COVID-19 recovery and used validated questionnaires to assess their mental health outcomes. The random-effects model was used to pool the data from the incorporated studies. The heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's <i>Q</i> heterogeneity test and <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> statistic. Twenty-seven studies were included in the data synthesis with a total sample size of 9605 COVID-19 survivors. The prevalence rates for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), anxiety, psychological distress, depression, and sleeping disorders were 20% (95% CI = 16-24%), 22% (95% CI = 18-27%), 36% (95% CI = 22-51%), 21% (95% CI = 16-28%), and 35% (95% CI = 29-41%), respectively.

"Long-term complications of COVID-19 in ICU survivors: what do we know?","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused more than 175 million persons infected and 3.8 million deaths so far and is having a devastating impact on both low and high-income countries, in particular on hospitals and intensive care units (ICU). The ICU mortality during the first pandemic wave ranged from 40% to 85% during the busiest ICU period for admissions around the peak of the surge, and those surviving are frequently faced with impairments affecting physical, cognitive, and mental health status, complicating the post-acute phase of COVID-19, which in the pre-COVID period, were defined collectively as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). Long COVID is defined as four weeks of persisting symptoms after the acute illness, and post-COVID syndrome and chronic COVID-19 are the proposed terms to describe continued symptomatology for more than 12 weeks. Overall, 50% of ICU survivors suffer from new physical, mental, and/or cognitive problems at 1 year after ICU discharge. The prevalence, severity, and duration of the various impairments in ICU survivors are poorly defined, with substantial variations among published series, and may reflect differences in the timing of assessment, the outcome measured, the instruments utilized, and thresholds adopted to establish the diagnosis, the qualification of personnel delivering the tests, the resource availability as well diversity in patients' case-mix. Future longitudinal studies of adequate sample size with repeated assessments of validated outcomes and comparison with non-COVID-19 ICU patients are needed to fully explore the long-term outcome of ICU patients with COVID-19.

"Health-Related Quality of Life in Survivors of Severe COVID-19 of a University Hospital in Northern Portugal","Long-term health impairments are often experienced among survivors of critical illness, which may have a negative impact on their quality of life. The aim of this study was to characterize COVID-19 survivors of critical illness and to evaluate health-related quality of life and disability following hospital discharge. This is a retrospective case-series study that included COVID-19 survivors admitted to the Intensive Care Medicine Department of a University Hospital. Follow-up evaluation was performed between the 30th and the 90th day after discharge. Quality of life was explored using the five-level version of the EQ-5D instrument (EQ-5D-5L) and functionality using the 12-question World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0). Forty-five survivors were enrolled, 28 (62.2%) men, median age 63.0 years. The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire showed moderate to extreme problems in some dimension in 29 patients (64.4%): mobility in six (13.3%), self-care in seven (13.3%), usual activities in 23 (51.1%), pain/discomfort in 14 (31.1%) and anxiety/depression in 17 (37.8%). When using the 12-question WHODAS 2.0 questionnaire, moderate to extreme disability was reported in some question in 37 patients (82.2%): 19 (42.2%) in standing for long periods, 18 (40.0%) in long-distance walking; 14 (31.1%) on taking care of household responsibilities and 17 (37.8%) in their day-to-day work; 23 (51.1%) felt emotionally affected by their health problems. Based on COVID-19 survivors-reported outcomes after critical illness, mobility, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression were the main problems that persisted one to three months after hospital discharge. An organized follow-up structure is crucial to improve health-related quality of life in critical COVID-19 survivors.

Retrospective electronic medical record review of all emergency department patients with mental health discharge codes at a large tertiary children's hospital in Australia during the period of stay at home restrictions from 1<sup>st</sup> April to 30<sup>th</sup> September 2020 compared with the same dates in 2019. We found a 40% decrease in ED presentations (18,935 to 11,235) with a concurrent 47% increase in MH presentations (809 to 1190) to ED during the study periods between 2019 and 2020. This resulted in an increase of 100 MH admissions from ED. Diagnoses with greatest percentage increases were eating disorders, social issues and suicidality. We found suicidality presentation numbers were highest in June to September 2020 compared with 2019. Patients with a diagnosis of suicidality had a higher rate of re-presentation in 2020 (1.83 presentations per patient) compared to 2019 (1.38 presentations per patient). Despite an overall decrease in ED presentations, the absolute increase in mental health presentations for children and adolescents during the stay at home restriction period was pronounced. It is unclear how sustained this change and the impact on mental health resource use will be post pandemic.","Carison, Babl, O'Donnell","https://doi.org/10.1111/1742-6723.13901","20211028","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19701,""
"Influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on executive skills in Canadians experiencing social vulnerability: A descriptive study","The objective of this study was to describe executive skills in clients experiencing social vulnerability in the context of COVID-19 from the perspective of social service agency staff. COVID-19 has required transformational changes to livelihood and day-to-day living. Socially vulnerable individuals are likely to be disproportionally impacted because many have experienced serious early childhood adversity, which may compromise their executive skills in adulthood. Using a cross-sectional survey, we collected data between 05 May 2020 and 03 July 2020, for this mixed methods study of 53 staff in two agencies in western Canada serving clients experiencing social vulnerability. The first case of COVID-19 in this jurisdiction was identified 05 March 2020. Using investigator-designed survey items, we captured executive skills in five areas: (a) planning tasks of daily living, (b) managing time, (c) keeping track of information and appointments, (d) managing emotions, and (e) managing self-control. Staff reported their clients struggled with executive skills and these struggles increased during COVID-19, particularly in the areas of managing daily tasks and emotional regulation. COVID-19 restrictions overwhelmed clients with the decisions required to maintain health, employment, and childcare. With the loss of structure and routine, clients lost track of time and delayed completion of tasks, which further increased stress. Disrupted goals and uncertainty about the future contributed to hopelessness for clients who were trying to regain control over their lives, which made it difficult to manage emotions. Some clients acted more impulsively because of the added stressors, lack of routine and access to friends and extended family. A better understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on socially vulnerable clients will inform social service agencies about areas to focus programming to support their socially vulnerable clients.","Benzies, Perry, Cope Williams","https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.13615","20211028","COVID-19; behaviour and behaviour mechanisms; executive skills; mental illness; social welfare; therapeutic alliance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19702,""
"Changes in psychosocial factors among community-dwelling older adults before and after Japan's declaration of a state of emergency over coronavirus disease 2019","Social distancing measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 may cause changes in psychosocial factors. This study aimed to clarify changes in psychosocial factors among older adults before and after Japan's declaration of a state of emergency over coronavirus disease 2019. This was a longitudinal cohort questionnaire study. A baseline survey was conducted in March 2020, and a follow-up survey was conducted in August 2020. The subjects were 1103 community-dwelling older adults not certified as having long-term care needs who responded to both the baseline and follow-up surveys. Changes in psychosocial factors before and after the state of emergency declaration were analysed by gender using the McNemar-Bowker test. Data for 397 men (mean ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°standard deviation: 80.6Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.7Ã¢â‚¬â€°years) and 486 women (80.3Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.3Ã¢â‚¬â€°years) were analysed in this study. The frequency of meeting friends increased over the study period for men (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.04). An increasing number of women lived alone (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.01). However, many people's financial status improved (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01), and the number of friends met in the previous month increased (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). None of the examined psychosocial factors worsened, except for the increase in the number of women living alone. However, many of the study subjects refrained from engaging in certain activities. If the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic persists, changes in psychosocial factors may occur. Therefore, a long-term investigation of the secondary psychosocial effects of coronavirus disease 2019 is necessary.","Kubo, Noguchi, Hayashi, Tomiyama, Ochi, Hayashi","https://doi.org/10.1111/psyg.12772","20211028","COVID-19; cohort study; depression; questionnaire; social interaction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19703,""
"Loneliness among adolescents and young adults with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional survey","Adolescents and young adults (AYAs) diagnosed with cancer are at an increased risk of experiencing social isolation and loneliness secondary to their cancer and itsÃ‚Â treatment. The physical distancing measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic may have further increased loneliness among this group. This study examined the prevalence of loneliness and factors associated with loneliness among AYAs with cancer during this pandemic. We conducted a self-administered, online, cross-sectional survey of Canadian AYAs diagnosed with cancer between 15 and 39 between January and February 2021. Loneliness was measured using the 3-item UCLA Loneliness Scale. Factors associated with higher levels of loneliness were identified using multiple logistic regression. The analysis included 805 AYAs. The prevalence of loneliness was 52.2% [NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°419, 95% CI (confidence interval) 48.7 to 55.6%].

"Older Adults' Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) Engagement Following COVID-19 and Its Impact on Access to Community, Information, and Resource Exchange: A Longitudinal, Qualitative Study","Following COVID-19, the CDC asked individuals to social distance and state and local authorities nationwide began issuing curfews and recommendations to ""shelter-in-place."" Known to be more susceptible to the negative effects of COVID-19 and often coping with higher levels of social isolation, many worried that older adults' mental health would suffer. While computer-mediated communication (CMC) is on the rise among older adults, whether and how older adults leverage the social benefits of CMC remains underexplored. This study assesses older adults' CMC use after COVID and the impact of CMC engagement on access to connection, information, and resources. We follow 22 older adults over 6Ã‚Â weeks, using longitudinal qualitative surveys to study CMC use patterns and mental health outcomes. Results revealed that while older adults exhibited purpose-driven CMC engagement, limited integration into larger online communities restricted access to up-to-the-minute information, notably early in the pandemic. Longitudinal findings show progressively less engagement with online news and information, withdrawal from online social engagement, and a progressive relaxing of social distancing. This study sheds light on how best to reach older adults following disaster, and where older adults may be disadvantaged as social media becomes a modern ""emergency broadcast system.""","Mikal, Wurtz, Grande","https://doi.org/10.1177/23337214211052201","20211028","Technology; aging; communication; community; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19705,""
"Experiment <i>in vivo</i>: How COVID-19 Lifestyle Modifications Affect Migraine","<b>Introduction:</b> The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic represents a unified lifestyle modification model, which was developed by the globally applied measures. The lockdowns designed the perfect study settings for observing the interaction between migraine and the adopted changes in lifestyle. An experiment <i>in vivo</i> took place unexpectedly to determine how the lockdown lifestyle modifications can influence migraine. <b>Subsection 1: Overall lifestyle modifications during the pandemic:</b> People stay home, and outdoor activities and public contacts are restricted. Sleep is disturbed. Media exposure and prolonged screen use are increased. Working conditions change. In-person consultations and therapies are canceled. The beneficial effects of short-term stress, together with the harmful effects of chronic stress, were observed during the pandemic. <b>Subsection 2: Short-term effects:</b> Substantial lifestyle changes happened, and knowing how vulnerable migraine patients are, one could hypothesize that this would have resulted in severe worsening of headache. Surprisingly, even though the impacts of changing social conditions were significant, some patients (including children) experienced a reduction in their migraine during the first lockdown. <b>Subsection 3: Long-term effects:</b> Unfortunately, headache frequency returned to the basal state during the second pandemic wave. The risk factors that could have led to this worsening are the long-term disruption of sleep and dietary habits, stress, anxiety, depression, non-compliance to treatment, and working during the pandemic. <b>Discussion:</b> Sudden short-term lifestyle changes taking migraine patients out of their usual routine may be beneficial for headache management. It is not necessary to have a natural disaster in place for a drastic lifestyle modification with 6-8-week duration, if we know that this will improve migraine.","Grozeva, MÃƒÂ­nguez-Olaondo, Vila-Pueyo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.744796","20211028","COVID-19; lifestyle; migraine; modifications; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19706,""

We begin by introducing key psychological consequences of the pandemic, with particular emphasis on university students, according to Pandemic Management Theory (PMT). Next, we highlight the most significant challenges reported to us by the students in response to the support initiative and applied psychological interventions (including psychoeducation, relaxation, arranging day plans, taking care of relationships, and ""just"" talking). We conclude by reflecting on the challenges for mental health posed by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the outcome of our initiative - the creation of the Academic Psychological Support Centre at the University of GdaÃ…â€žsk.

"Romance Scams: Romantic Imagery and Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation","Love has an enormous effect on mental health. One does not need an actual romantic relationship to be in love. Indeed, romantic love can be built upon without frequent or real-life encounters, such as with a stranger from a matching website. With the advancement of the Internet and the influence of coronavirus disease, it is believed that these distant romantic relationships and related romance scams are burgeoning. Often, the victims of scams keep emotionally attached to the scammer even after the lie is revealed, which is hypothesized to be attributed to the aberrantly exaggerated romantic imagery of the victims. It is observed that many victims suffer from symptoms similar to a post-traumatic stress disorder, and some even consider suicide. However, there is scant literature on this topic. In this article, it is further postulated that the aberrant romantic imagery might be associated with impulsive acts such as suicide once the ideal but fake romantic relationship is dissolved. Thereafter, it is further speculated that manipulation of the visual network, possibly by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), might be a promising treatment.","Chuang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.738874","20211028","imagery; romance scam; romantic relationship; suicide; tDCS; visual network","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19708,""
"Clinical Heterogeneity in ME/CFS A Way to Understand Long-COVID19 Fatigue","The aim of present paper is to identify clinical phenotypes in a cohort of patients affected of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Ninety-one patients and 22 healthy controls were studied with the following questionnaires, in addition to medical history: visual analogical scale for fatigue and pain, DePaul questionnaire (post-exertional malaise, immune, neuroendocrine), Pittsburgh sleep quality index, COMPASS-31 (dysautonomia), Montreal cognitive assessment, Toulouse-PiÃƒÂ©ron test (attention), Hospital Anxiety and Depression test and Karnofsky scale. Co-morbidities and drugs-intake were also recorded. A hierarchical clustering with clinical results was performed. Final study group was made up of 84 patients, mean age 44.41 Ã‚Â± 9.37 years (66 female/18 male) and 22 controls, mean age 45 Ã‚Â± 13.15 years (14 female/8 male). Patients meet diagnostic criteria of Fukuda-1994 and Carruthers-2011. Clustering analysis identify five phenotypes. Two groups without fibromyalgia were differentiated by various levels of anxiety and depression (13 and 20 patients). The other three groups present fibromyalgia plus a patient without it, but with high scores in pain scale, they were segregated by prevalence of dysautonomia (17), neuroendocrine (15), and immunological affectation (19). Regarding gender, women showed higher scores than men in cognition, pain level and depressive syndrome. Mathematical tools are a suitable approach to objectify some elusive features in order to understand the syndrome. Clustering unveils phenotypes combining fibromyalgia with varying degrees of dysautonomia, neuroendocrine or immune features and absence of fibromyalgia with high or low levels of anxiety-depression.

"Associations between accessibility to health care service, social support, and Korean Americans' mental health status amid the COVID-19 pandemic","While previous studies have examined the relationships between social support and health care accessibility among ethnic minority populations, studies on Korean Americans remain scarce. Therefore, this study aims to assess the relationship between Korean Americans' mental health, accessibility to health care, and how they perceive the level of social support during the COVID-19 pandemic. We distributed online surveys to Korean Americans from May 24, 2020, to June 14, 2020, generating 790 responses from participants residing in 42 states. Binary Logistic and Ordinary Least Square regression analyses revealed that poor mental health was associated with language barriers inhibiting Korean Americans' access to COVID-19-related information. Their perceived social support from family members and close friends was positively associated with mental health. Our findings recommend that equipping community health care services with translators or interpreters is necessary. Additionally, health practitioners and staff should be trained to utilize telehealth tools to effectively treat individuals with mental health problems. American policymakers and health care professionals need to understand and address the unique hardships Korean Americans experience amid COVID-19.","Min, Choi, Park","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11820-7","20211028","Accessibility to health care service; COVID-19; Family social support; Korean Americans; Language barrier; Mental health; Psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19711,""
"The impacts of coping style and perceived social support on the mental health of undergraduate students during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic in China: a multicenter survey","An increasing number of undergraduate students in China have been reported to have psychological problems. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a series of preventive and control measures were implemented, which undoubtedly worsened their psychological health. Coping style and social support were probably important factors that affected the psychological well-being of undergraduate students during the pandemic. This study aimed to explore the effects of coping style and perceived social support on the psychological well-being of college students and relevant risk factors. This cross-sectional study was performed in February and March of 2020 by distributing an online questionnaire among undergraduate students from seven geographical regions across China. The questionnaire included sociodemographic information; the 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21); the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS); and the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ). For the analyses, t-tests, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), the Kruskal-Wallis test and multiple linear regression were utilized. The level of significance was set at PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05. Among 3113 college students, the rates of anxiety, depression and stress symptoms were 13.3, 15.4 and 6.8%, respectively. Increased rates of current smoking and drinking (5.5 and 25.2%, respectively) among undergraduates were identified. The results indicated that the PSSS subscales and SCSQ subscales were significantly associated with DASS-21 scores (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that active coping style and family support were protective factors while passive coping style could aggravate psychological problems among participants (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). A remarkable number of college students adopted passive coping strategies to cope with negative feelings, such as smoking and drinking, which were detrimental to their mental health. In contrast, active coping strategies helped improve their psychological well-being. Moreover, family support was particularly important for maintaining their mental health and ameliorating mental health challenges in this major health crisis. Consequently, suitable psychointervention, routine screening for risk behaviors, and provision of further social support are needed for undergraduate students in the COVID-19 pandemic or other emergency public health events.","Huang, Su, Si, Xiao, Wang, Wang, Gu, Ma, Li, Zhang, Ren, Qiao","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03546-y","20211028","COVID-19; Coping style; Mental health; Social support; Undergraduate students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19712,""
"Measuring COVID-19 related anxiety and obsession: Validation of the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale and the Obsession with COVID-19 Scale in a probability Chinese sample","With concern over the rise in mental health symptoms associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the present study set out to address the absence of pandemic-specific screening tools for detecting those in Chinese societies who are at-risk for experiencing mental distress due to the pandemic; thus, its aim was to validate the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) and Obsession with COVID-19 Scale (OCS) in Chinese adults. With a two-stage cluster random sampling method, we surveyed 1011 Chinese community-dwelling adults (38.8% men; 41.2 years old on average with an SD of 15.8) in June and July of 2020. Our psychometric evaluation results showed that the Chinese version of CAS and OCS retained their original one-dimensional structure and demonstrated measurement invariance across genders. In line with validation studies of the CAS and OCS in other languages, subsequent analyses also provided support to our Chinese version with respect to their satisfactory internal consistency (ÃŽÂ±Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â .87 and .73, respectively), and good concurrent validity (i.e., positive associations with negative feelings, excessive time-consumption, subjective distress, and functioning impairment). Due to constraints of time and cross-sectional design, we only validated CAS and OCS among Chinese adults and did not evaluate their test-retest reliability nor predictive validity. Considering the practical benefits of understanding the source of mental symptoms during the pandemic, we recommend the use of CAS and OCS in Chinese communities to facilitate early identification and intervention for those who require clinical attention due to their COVID-19 related anxiety and obsessive thoughts.","Chen, Tong, Su, Yu, Wu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.08.104","20211028","Anxiety; Assessment; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Mental health; Obsession; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","",19713,""
"[Transgender health and healthcare during the COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜19 pandemic: aÃ‚Â cross-sectional online survey in German-speaking countries]","Since spring of 2020, the COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜19 pandemic has disrupted our day-to-day lives and led to negative consequences in various areas of life, including mental and physical wellbeing. In this article, we take aÃ‚Â closer look at the situation of trans people, who - due to experiences with discrimination and marginalization as well as their specific health-related interests - could be characterized by aÃ‚Â particular vulnerability. Using an online cross-sectional survey, which we designed collaboratively with experts from the trans community, we investigated the mental and physical health of trans people from German-speaking countries and their access to trans-related healthcare during the COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜19 pandemic in the period from 1 May 2020 to 31 JanuaryÃ‚Â 2021. Since the beginning of the COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜19 pandemic, trans people have experienced barriers in access to gender-affirming treatments, mental health services, and COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜19-related medical care. At the same time, trans people reported being affected by chronic diseases disproportionately more often than the general population, including those leading to aÃ‚Â higher risk for poorer outcomes of aÃ‚Â COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜19 infection. Moreover, the participants reported being exposed to many risk factors associated with higher mental distress (e.g., having aÃ‚Â chronic illness, belonging to aÃ‚Â minority based on aÃ‚Â non-heterosexual orientation, or having aÃ‚Â low income). The results of this survey indicate that prior vulnerabilities with regards to health problems and the restricted access to an informed and qualified transgender healthcare were exacerbated by the COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜19 pandemic. EINLEITUNG UND ZIEL: Seit dem FrÃƒÂ¼hjahr 2020 hat die COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜19-Pandemie nahezu alle Bereiche des gesellschaftlichen Lebens erheblich eingeschrÃƒÂ¤nkt, was bei vielen Menschen sowohl zu psychischen als auch zu kÃƒÂ¶rperlichen Belastungen gefÃƒÂ¼hrt hat. In diesem Artikel nehmen wir die Situation von trans Personen in den Blick, die infolge ihrer gesellschaftlichen Diskriminierung und Marginalisierung sowie spezifischer, gesundheitsbezogener Anliegen durch eine besondere VulnerabilitÃƒÂ¤t gekennzeichnet sein kÃƒÂ¶nnen. Unter Beachtung partizipativer Elemente haben wir mit einer Online-Querschnitterhebung im Zeitraum vom 01.05.2020 bis zum 31.01.2021 die psychische und physische Gesundheit von trans Personen im deutschsprachigen Raum sowie deren Zugang zur Trans-Gesundheitsversorgung wÃƒÂ¤hrend der COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜19-Pandemie untersucht. Trans Personen erleben seit Beginn der COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜19-Pandemie vermehrt Barrieren sowohl bei geschlechtsangleichenden Behandlungen und psychosozialen UnterstÃƒÂ¼tzungsangeboten als auch im Bereich der COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜19-bezogenen medizinischen Versorgung.
