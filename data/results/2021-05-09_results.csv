"Use of virtual reality in the inpatient rehabilitation of COVID-19 patients","Use of virtual reality (VR) in healthcare has expanded in recent years. The challenges faced by patients with prolonged COVID-19-related hospitalizations - social isolation, disability, neurologic sequelae, adjustment-related anxiety, depression, and stress - may be mitigated by the novel use of VR as one modality of a comprehensive rehabilitation plan. This descriptive study aimed to understand patient satisfaction and perceived benefit of virtual reality on a COVID-19 recovery unit, as well as the logistical and operational feasibility of providing VR content for patients and staff. During the COVID-19 surge in New York City in 2020, the COVID-19 Recovery Unit (CRU) of a large academic hospital invited patients and staff to participate in VR sessions with three categories of experience: (1) Guided meditation, (2) Exploration of natural environments, (3) Cognitive stimulation games. Patients and staff were surveyed about satisfaction and perceived benefit. 13 patients and 11 staff were surveyed, with median patient satisfaction scores of 9 out of 10, with ten representing &quot;extremely satisfied,&quot; and median staff satisfaction scores of 10. 13/13 patients answered &quot;yes&quot; to recommending the therapy to others, and 12/13 answered &quot;yes&quot; to perceived enhancement of their treatment. 11/11 staff answered &quot;yes&quot; to recommending the therapy to others, and 11/11 answered &quot;yes&quot; to perceived enhancement of their wellbeing. A VR program implemented on a COVID-19 rehabilitation unit for patients and healthcare providers was rated as highly satisfactory with perceived benefit by survey respondents. Participants commented that the use of VR was useful in coping with isolation and loneliness, and could be implemented within the context of clinical care for COVID-19 patients as part of a comprehensive rehabilitation model. The use of VR was also logistically and operationally feasible on the CRU. Future work to compare benefits of VR to standard neuropsychological rehabilitation is needed.","Kolbe, Jaywant, Gupta, Vanderlind, Jabbour","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2021.04.008","20210508","COVID-19; Inpatient rehabilitation; Mindfulness; Virtual reality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-09","",13579,""
"COVID-19 Related Symptoms of Anxiety, Depression, and PTSD among US Adults","During the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing measures often result in individual isolation, which can lead to adverse mental outcomes. We collected online questionnaires from 3,952 US adults to examine the impact of &quot;shelter-in-place&quot; guidelines on mental health, and to explore potential disparities and modifiable factors. Self-reported anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms were associated with more restrictive quarantine. Younger adults, women, those with lower income, more insecurity, more media exposure, reduced physical activity, or worsened family relationships were particularly affected. Targeted prevention on susceptible subpopulations, including young adults and lower SES groups, might help mitigate disparities in COVID-19-related mental health problems.","Zhu, Niu, Freudenheim, Zhang, Lei, Homish, Cao, Zorich, Yue, Liu, Mu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113959","20210508","COVID-19; Mental health; Social distancing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-09","",13580,""

"Impact of Media-based Negative and Positive Age Stereotypes on Older Individuals' Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic","During the COVID-19 pandemic, stigmatization of older persons has increased in traditional and social media. It was unknown whether this negative messaging could be detrimental to the mental health of older individuals, and whether the relatively uncommon positive messaging about older individuals could benefit their mental health. To address these gaps, we designed age-stereotype interventions based on actual news stories that appeared during the pandemic, and divided them into negative and positive versions of what we term personified (i.e., person-based) and enumerative (i.e., number-based) age-stereotype messaging. The negative versions of the two types of messaging reflected the age stereotype of decline whereas the positive versions of the two types of messaging reflected the age stereotype of resilience. As expected, the exposure of older individuals to the negative-age-stereotype-messaging interventions led to significantly worse mental health (more anxiety and less peacefulness), compared to a neutral condition; in contrast, the positive-age-stereotype-messaging interventions led to significantly better mental health (less anxiety and more peacefulness), compared to a neutral condition. The findings were equally strong for the personified and enumerative conditions. Also as expected, the interventions, which were self-irrelevant to the younger participants, did not significantly impact their mental health. This is the first-known study to experimentally demonstrate that institutional ageism, and statistics that reflect stereotypes about older individuals, can impact mental health. The results demonstrate the need for media messaging aimed at empowering older individuals during the pandemic and beyond.","Levy, Chang, Lowe, Provolo, Slade","https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbab085","20210508","COVID-19; age stereotypes; ageism; anxiety, media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-09","",13582,""
"The Toll of Feeling Older: Subjective Age Moderates the Associations between Anxiety Sensitivity and Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression during COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing stressor that may have detrimental effects on mental health. Theoretical and empirical literature implies that individuals who are characterized by catastrophic appraisals of somatic cues, a tendency known as anxiety sensitivity, as well as by older subjective age, might be particularly vulnerable to depression and anxiety during the pandemic. Furthermore, subjective age might moderate the relations between anxiety sensitivity with depression and anxiety symptoms. Yet, research to date has not explored the contribution of both anxiety sensitivity and subjective age in explaining distress following stress in general, nor in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Filling this gap, a convenience sample of 828 participants, (Mage = 43.98, SD = 14.06), filled questionnaires measuring background variables, COVID-19 related stressors, anxiety sensitivity, subjective age, and anxiety and depression symptoms during the pandemic. Positive associations were found between anxiety sensitivity and subjective age, on the one hand, and anxiety and depression symptoms, on the other. Furthermore, subjective age moderated the associations between anxiety sensitivity with depression and anxiety symptoms. Although higher levels of anxiety sensitivity were related to depression and anxiety during the pandemic, these associations were stronger among participants with an older subjective age. The findings are consistent with theories that view subjective age as an intra-individual construct involved in modulating important mental health outcomes in the context of coping with stress.","Avidor, Abu Hamam, Lahav","https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbab082","20210508","Anxiety; Anxiety sensitivity; Depression; Subjective age","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-09","",13583,""
"Indicators of poor mental health and stressors during the COVID-19 pandemic, by disability status: A cross-sectional analysis","Evidence from previous public health emergencies indicates that adults with disabilities have higher risk for morbidity (physical and mental) and mortality than adults without disabilities. To provide estimates of mental health indicators and stressors for US adults by disability status during April and May 2020, shortly following the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed data from Porter Novelli View 360 opt-in Internet panel survey conducted during the weeks of April 20th and May 18th<sup>,</sup> 2020 among 1004 English-speaking adults aged Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years without and with disabilities (serious difficulty with hearing, vision, cognition, or mobility; any difficulty with self-care or independent living). Weighted logistic regression was used to test for significant differences between calculated prevalence estimates at the PÃ‚Â Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã‚Â .05 level. One in four adults reported any disability. Adults with any disability were significantly more likely than adults without disability to report current depressive symptoms, frequent mental distress, suicidal ideation, and COVID-19-related initiated or increased substance use (all p valuesÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .0001). Adults with disabilities also reported significantly higher levels of stressors, such as access to health care services (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .0001), difficulty caring for their own (or another's) chronic condition (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .0001), emotional or physical abuse from others (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001), and not having enough food (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .01). The disproportionately high levels of poor mental health indicators among adults with disabilities as compared to those without highlight the importance of delivering timely mental health screening and treatment/intervention during and after the COVID-19 pandemic to persons with disabilities.","Okoro, Strine, McKnight-Eily, Verlenden, Hollis","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dhjo.2021.101110","20210508","Coronavirus; Disabilities; Health disparities; Mental health; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-09","",13584,""
"Clinician burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic before vaccine administration","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has disrupted pharmacy practice. Little research has been done to assess how COVID-19 has affected pharmacists' employment, workload, and feelings of burnout. The objectives of this study were to characterize the impact of COVID-19 on pharmacists' employment status, workload, and feelings of burnout, as well as to examine emotional health concerns related to COVID-19. Wisconsin pharmacists were surveyed using an online instrument between August 25, 2020, and September 22, 2020. The data analysis, performed in December 2020, examined employment status, 3 common burnout risk factors (workload, rewards, and social depersonalization), and emotional health concerns related to COVID-19. Of the 1300 pharmacists, 439 completed the survey (33.8%). The study analysis included pharmacists in community (n = 127) and hospital or health system (n = 107) settings. With regard to employment changes and workload, hospital pharmacists (36%) were more likely to have their hours reduced than community pharmacists (13%) (P &lt; 0.01), and, conversely, community pharmacists (19%) were more likely to have their hours increased than hospital pharmacists (8%) (PÃ‚Â = 0.01). For the burnout domain of workload, 45% of the pharmacists reported increased feelings of physical exhaustion at work, and 53% reported increased feelings of emotional exhaustion at work, with no difference between settings. Regarding the burnout domain of rewards, 6% of the hospital pharmacists and 1% of the community pharmacists experienced a reduction in hourly wages or salaries as a result of COVID-19. For the burnout domain of depersonalization, 25% of the pharmacists reported that their ability to connect with colleagues and patients decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional emotional health concerns reported by the pharmacists included 40% experiencing more anxiety and 25% experiencing more sadness or depression during the COVID-19 pandemic, with no difference between settings. This study found that the burnout domains related to workload, rewards, and depersonalization were negatively affected by COVID-19. Pharmacy managers need to proactively combat burnout as well as be reactive when employees show signs of burnout to maintain their workforce and meet the COVID-19-associated challenges.","Bakken, Winn","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.japh.2021.04.009","20210508","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-09","",13585,""
"Deciphering the role of physical activity in stress management during a global pandemic in older adult populations: a systematic review protocol","The world has changed dramatically since the beginning of 2020 due to COVID-19. As a result of the pandemic, many older adults are now experiencing an increased and unprecedented amount of psychological stress. Physical activity has been found to be an evidence-based means of combating stress among older adults to promote their quality of life. Studies have demonstrated that those who are physically active experience fewer issues in regard to their mental health, specifically depression and anxiety disorders. Engagement in physical activity may exert a protective influence over stress inducing events and future mental health outcomes. Due to exercise being inexpensive, non-invasive, and effective even via incremental increases in activity level, physical activity interventions should be investigated as a therapy for reducing stress for older adults during the current pandemic. Four electronic databases (PubMed, PsycInfo, Web of Science, and SportDiscus) will be searched to identify randomized controlled trials that evaluate the effectiveness of physical activity or exercise programs as a psychological stress management tool in adults 50 years of age or older. Only peer-reviewed and published journal articles will be reviewed. Post-intervention psychological stress measures in comparison to baseline stress will be the primary outcome of interest. All studies will be assessed for bias using Cochrane's risk of bias tool. A random effects meta-analysis will be investigated if sufficient evidence of homogenous research exists and the heterogeneity of effect sizes will be tabulated. This review will determine the effectiveness of various physical activity interventions for the treatment of psychological stress among the older adult population. This knowledge will help inform care aides, clinicians, family members, and older adults themselves of the most effective physical activity interventions in dealing with stress which is relevant to the ongoing pandemic.

"COVID-19-related stigma and its sociodemographic correlates: a comparative study","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is closely associated with physical and mental health problems; however, little is known about the severity of stigma caused by COVID-19 among its survivors. Thus, the aim of this study was to compare differences in stigma experiences of COVID-19 survivors versus healthy controls after the COVID-19 outbreak peak in China. This cross-sectional study comprised 154 COVID-19 survivors and 194 healthy controls recruited through consecutive and convenience sampling methods, respectively. COVID-19 related stigma was measured by the Social Impact Scale (SIS). Stigma differences between the two groups were compared with analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and a generalized linear model (GLM) was used to identify independent correlates of COVID-19-related stigma in this study. Compared with healthy controls, COVID-19 survivors reported more overall stigma (F<sub>(1,347)</sub>Ã‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°60.82, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), and stigma in domains of social rejection (F<sub>(1,347)</sub>Ã‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°56.54, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), financial insecurity (F<sub>(1,347)</sub>Ã‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°19.96, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), internalized shame (F<sub>(1,347)</sub>Ã‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°71.40, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and social isolation (F<sub>(1,347)</sub>Ã‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°34.73, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Status as a COVID-19 survivor, having family members infected with COVID-19, being married, economic loss during the COVID-19 pandemic, and depressive symptoms were positively associated with higher overall stigma levels (all p values &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). COVID-19-related stigma is commonly experienced among COVID-19 survivors even though the outbreak has been well-contained in China. Routine assessment of stigma experiences should be conducted on COVID-19 survivors and appropriate psychological assistance, public education, and anti-stigma campaigns and policies should be enforced to reduce stigma within this vulnerable subpopulation.","Yuan, Zhao, Zhang, Zhang, Cheung, Jackson, Jiang, Xiang","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-021-00705-4","20210508","COVID-19 survivors; Stigma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-09","",13587,""
"Suicide mortality data from the Italian police during the COVID-19 pandemic","Suicide is a major public health issue worldwide, with about 880,000 dying annually for such a cause. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to severe social disruption both from health and economic standpoints. Law enforcement personnel have been significantly involved in helping to face the many difficulties due to the pandemic. Police officers have been subjected to further stress from managing social restrictions imposed by governments to contain the pandemic. The Italian State Police steadily approximate 100,000 people aged 25-65Ã‚Â years: 14 subjects (mean age 43.64Ã‚Â years) died by suicide in 2015, 7 (mean age 47.5Ã‚Â years) in 2016, 13 (mean age 45.62Ã‚Â years) in 2017, 10 (mean age 48.1Ã‚Â years) in 2018, 18 (mean age 46.78Ã‚Â years) in 2019, and 12 (mean age 52Ã‚Â years) in 2020. Our records excluded significant changes in suicide incidence rate within 2015-2020 (till December 2020). However, the COVID-19 pandemic spread faster in Italy than in other regions, meaning that the Italian State Police possibly faced prolonged, intense stress. Suicide prevention, therefore, remains a priority, especially during this difficult time.","Garbarino, Fornaro, Messina, Pompili, Ciprani","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12991-021-00350-6","20210508","COVID-19; Police officers; Prevention; Suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-09","",13588,""
"Development and evaluation of a new measure of children's play: the Children's Play Scale (CPS)","There is increasing recognition of the importance of children's play from a public health perspective, given the links between play and children's physical and mental health. The present research aimed to develop and evaluate a new parent-report questionnaire that measures the time children spend playing across a range of places and includes a supplement to evaluate how adventurously children play. The questionnaire was developed with input from a diverse group of parents and experts in children's play. It was designed to yield a range of metrics including time spent playing per year, time spent playing outside, time spent playing in nature and level of adventurous play. The reliability of the questionnaire was then evaluated with 245 parents (149 mothers, 96 fathers) of 154 children aged 5-11Ã¢â‚¬â€°years. All participants completed the measure at time 1. At time 2, an average of 20Ã¢â‚¬â€°days later, 184 parents (111 mothers and 73 fathers) of 99 children completed the measure again. Cross-informant agreement, evaluated using Concordance Correlation Coefficients (CCCs), ranged from 0.36 to 0.51. These fall in the poor to moderate range and are largely comparable to cross-informant agreement on other measures. Test-retest reliability for mothers was good (range 0.67-0.76) for time spent playing metrics. For fathers, test-retest reliability was lower (range 0.39-0.63). For both parents the average level of adventurous play variable had relatively poor test retest reliability (mothersÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.49, fathersÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.42). This variable also showed a significant increase from time 1 to time 2. This instability over time may be due to the timing of the research in relation to the Covid-19 lockdown and associated shifts in risk perception. The measure will be of value in future research focusing on the public health benefits and correlates of children's play as well as researchers interested in children's outdoor play and play in nature specifically. The development of the measure in collaboration with parents and experts in children's play is a significant strength. It will be of value for future research to further validate the measure against play diaries or activity monitors.","Dodd, Nesbit, Maratchi","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10812-x","20210508","Adventurous play; Child health; Children; Measure; Play; Questionnaire; Risky play; Survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-09","",13589,""
