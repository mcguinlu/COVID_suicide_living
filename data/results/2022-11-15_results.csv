"State mental health infrastructure, personality, and politics of shelter-in-place","Guided by the conservation of resources (COR) theory, this study investigated how regional variation in mental health needs and resources may have impacted early efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19. Publicly available data were analyzed to evaluate states' initial responses (i.e., February 2020-March 2020) to the COVID-19 pandemic. Each of the 50 U.S. states, as well as the District of Columbia, were included in the analyses, providing a total sample size of N = 51. U.S. states with greater mental health needs and barriers to treatment tended to: be slower to implement shelter-in-place orders;have residents who showed less increase in time at their residences in response to the crisis;be more rural, economically disadvantaged, and more conventional;and have less access to the internet. Considering this cultural context provides insight for tailoring and implementing interventions in a culturally competent manner. Furthermore, mental health resource sharing across states and regions may be needed to address future mental health care gaps resulting from the pandemic. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement Rural and financially strained areas with fewer resources and greater mental health needs tended to spend less time under shelter-in-place orders and showed less increase in time spent at home during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Special attention is needed to strengthen community resources and health care infrastructure to support recovery from the pandemic. Access to finances and resources may facilitate more rapid and flexible change in routines required by future pandemics and large-scale threats.

"Undergraduate students and the COVID-19 pandemic: A look-back at first-year constructs of psychological adjustment, implications for clinicians and college administrators","The COVID-19 pandemic created significant challenges for college students and for the clinicians and college administrators who work with students. To better understand the challenges, we evaluated the impact of pandemic disruptions on the psychological adjustment of 1,062 undergraduate students during the first academic year of the pandemic (fall semester 2020, spring semester 2021). Adjustment (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013) and the theory of planned behavior (TPB;Ajzen, 1985, 1991) were used as conceptual references for the study. Students completed an online survey with items reflecting their concerns about the pandemic (The Healthy Minds Network [HMN], 2020);items comparing their prepandemic mental status to their current mental status (HMN, 2020);and standardized assessments of anxiety, depression, and personality (APA, n.d.). Comparisons were made between students living (a) on the college campus in a dormitory;(b) off campus within commuting distance to the college;and (c) away from the college in another city, state, or country. Consistent with other peer-reviewed studies, our students showed adjustment challenges and a decline in functional behavior (e.g., Chirikov et al., 2020). Two principal components reflecting adjustment and the TPB were identified: internalized concerns about the pandemic, and externalized responses to the pandemic. Students, regardless of living situation, reported higher levels of internalized psychological distress. Students living on campus showed more externalized adjustment challenges including an increase in alcohol and substance use, and a decline in academic performance. Recommendations focused on reducing risk factors and increasing protective and healthy lifestyle practices at college administration and clinical levels.","Bisconer, Sarah W.; McGill, Makenna B.","https://doi.org/10.1037/pro0000490","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Professional Psychology: Research and Practice;JOUR","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",40957,""
"In Defense of Public Debt, Barry Eichengreen, Asmaa El-Ganainy, Rui Esteves, and Kris James Mitchener, Oxford University Press, 2021, vii + 305 pages","Stressing both commonalities and changes of the uses to which sovereign debt was put over time, the authors explain how sovereign debt developed into a safe asset and how it contributed to the development of financial markets, and the economy more generally, serving as an important tool for counter-cyclical spending which limited the incidence of economic depressions. Writing about the most recent spike in indebtedness, they acknowledge that running the sort of large, persistent primary surpluses required to bring down the level of indebtedness generated by Covid are rare, that attempting to raise taxes is challenging when the wealthy and their financial assets can move, and that a burst of inflation that liquidates debt burdens seems unlikely in the current context. Despite the difficulties created by unleashing â€˜a tsunami of debtâ€™ (199), the authors are adamant that a failure to act in the face of a national emergency â€“ such as a war, a systemic financial crisis or a pandemic â€“would rob a government of its legitimacy. Collective Action Clauses (CACs) â€“ provisions specifying that a supermajority of bondholders can change the terms of a bond â€“ are also discussed by the authors.","WiedenbrÃ¼g, AnahÃ­","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0266267122000104","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Economics and Philosophy; JOUR(3):507-513, 38.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",40958,""
"Mental Health Implications for Aviators from COVID-19","Mental Health Implications for Aviators from COVID-19 Objective The authors present aeromedical implications from COVID-19 disruptions on the civil aviation sector, consider mental health impacts on pilots, and discuss possible helpful responses to support pilot mental health. Methods A multiple database review investigated articles from January 2002 to May 2021 on severe commercial aviation disruptions impacting pilot mental health and on pilot mental health coping or treatment. Fifteen papers were identified. Results During the COVID-19 pandemic, airline flights were severely reduced. By January 2021, airlines shed thousands of jobs and 24 airlines no longer existed. General population surveys found 13% of individuals had â€œserious distressâ€ from the pandemic. In two aviation focused surveys, 40-66% of pilots agreed or strongly agreed that their mental health worsened since the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to past Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) patients, more COVID-19 patients have mental health symptoms in the acute phase of illness;while about 10% of COVID-19 patients appear to have chronic or â€œlong haulâ€ symptoms. Mental Health treatment and coping strategies found helpful to pilots are discussed. Conclusions Pilots remain at risk for mental health symptoms and illness due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For those who develop severe distress or mental illness from the effects of the pandemic (or COVID-19 infection), early treatment with psychotherapy and/or approved medications may be warranted. This may decrease the likelihood of persistent physical or cognitive or mental health symptoms that would delay a return to flying status.","Flynn, Christopher F.; King, Raymond E.; Bor, Robert, Tvaryanas, Anthony","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.reach.2022.100050","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: REACH;JOUR: 100050,","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",40959,""
"Effect of COVID-19 lockdown on the characterization and mixing state of carbonaceous particles in the urban atmosphere of Liaocheng, the North China Plain","To investigate the effect of COVID-19 control measures on aerosol chemistry, the chemical compositions, mixing states, and formation mechanisms of carbonaceous particles in the urban atmosphere of Liaocheng in the North China Plain (NCP) were compared before and during the pandemic using a single particle aerosol mass spectrometry (SPAMS). The results showed that the concentrations of five air pollutants including PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and CO decreased by 41.2%â€“71.5% during the pandemic compared to those before the pandemic, whereas O3 increased by 1.3 times during the pandemic because of the depressed titration of O3 and more favorable meteorological conditions. The count and percentage contribution of carbonaceous particles in the total detected particles were lower during the pandemic than those before the pandemic. The carbonaceous particles were dominated by elemental and organic carbon (ECOC, 35.9%), followed by elemental carbon-aged (EC-aged, 19.6%) and organic carbon-fresh (OC-fresh, 13.5%) before the pandemic, while EC-aged (25.3%), ECOC (17.9%), and secondary ions-rich (SEC, 17.8%) became the predominant species during the pandemic. The carbonaceous particle sizes during the pandemic showed a broader distribution than that before the pandemic, due to the condensation and coagulation of carbonaceous particles in the aging processes. The relative aerosol acidity (Rra) was smaller before the pandemic than that during the pandemic, indicating the more acidic particle aerosol during the pandemic closely related to the secondary species and relative humidity (RH). More than 95.0% and 86.0% of carbonaceous particles in the whole period were internally mixed with nitrate and sulfate, implying that most of the carbonaceous particles were associated with secondary oxidation during their formation processes. The diurnal variations of oxalate particles and correlation analyses suggested that oxalate particles before the pandemic were derived from aqueous oxidation driven by RH and liquid water content (LWC), while oxalate particles during the pandemic were originated from O3-dominated photochemical oxidation.","Chen, Min, Meng, Jingjing, Li, Yuanyuan, Wang, Yachen, Huang, Tonglin, Li, Zheng, Song, Xiaohan, Wu, Can, Hou, Zhanfang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.partic.2022.10.007","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Particuology;JOUR","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",40960,""
"Are Depression, Resilience and Fear of COVID related to Eating Behaviour and Nutrition Status of University Students?","Objective : This study was designed to examine eating behaviours and their association with fear, depression states concerning COVID-19 among students in Turkey. Methods : A total number of 499 students, 336 (67.3%) female and 163 (32.7%) males, participated in an online-based cross sectional study. The survey collected data on the Dutch eating behaviour questionnaire (DEBQ), along with measuring psychological impact by using Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S), Beck depression inventory (BDI), and Brief resilience scale (BRS). In addition, 24-hour dietary records were used to calculate the daily energy and macronutrient intakes in the study. Results : Correlation between brief resilience and fear of COVID was found negatively. Total and subdomains DEBQ scores were positively correlated with fear of COVID;conversely, there was a negative correlation with brief resilience (p&lt;0.05). More than half (58.9%) of students were in depression, and students who had moderate and severe depression had higher total DEBQ and emotional eating scores. Students with severe depression had the highest levels of fear of COVID. Students having higher daily energy intake had greater fear concerning COVID-19, and the daily energy intake was negatively correlated with restrained and external eating. Conclusion : During the pandemic, negative psychological effects result in unfavorable dietary behavioural consequences depending on the increasing levels of stress.","Tengilimoglu-Metin, M.

"Protein structure-based in-silico approaches to drug discovery: Guide to COVID-19 therapeutics","With more than 5 million fatalities and close to 300 million reported cases, COVID-19 is the first documented pandemic due to a coronavirus that continues to be a major health challenge. Despite being rapid, uncontrollable, and highly infectious in its spread, it also created incentives for technology development and redefined public health needs and research agendas to fast-track innovations to be translated. Breakthroughs in computational biology peaked during the pandemic with renewed attention to making all cutting-edge technology deliver agents to combat the disease. The demand to develop effective treatments yielded surprising collaborations from previously segregated fields of science and technology. The long-standing pharmaceutical industry's aversion to repurposing existing drugs due to a lack of exponential financial gain was overrun by the health crisis and pressures created by front-line researchers and providers. Effective vaccine development even at an unprecedented pace took more than a year to develop and commence trials. Now the emergence of variants and waning protections during the booster shots is resulting in breakthrough infections that continue to strain health care systems. As of now, every protein of SARS-CoV-2 has been structurally characterized and related host pathways have been extensively mapped out. The research community has addressed the druggability of a multitude of possible targets. This has been made possible due to existing technology for virtual computer-assisted drug development as well as new tools and technologies such as artificial intelligence to deliver new leads. Here in this article, we are discussing advances in the drug discovery field related to target-based drug discovery and exploring the implications of known target-specific agents on COVID-19 therapeutic management. The current scenario calls for more personalized medicine efforts and stratifying patient populations early on for their need for different combinations of prognosis-specific therapeutics. We intend to highlight target hotspots and their potential agents, with the ultimate goal of using rational design of new therapeutics to not only end this pandemic but also uncover a generalizable platform for use in future pandemics.","Gupta, Yash, Savytskyi, Oleksandr V.; Coban, Matt, Venugopal, Amoghavarsha, Pleqi, Vasili, Weber, Caleb A.; Chitale, Rohit, Durvasula, Ravi, Hopkins, Christopher, Kempaiah, Prakasha, Caulfield, Thomas R.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mam.2022.101151","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Molecular Aspects of Medicine;JOUR: 101151,","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",40962,""
"Living alone and depressive symptoms among older adults in the COVID-19 pandemic: Role of non-face-to-face social interactions","Objective This study examined the association of living alone with changes in depressive symptom status and the moderating effect of non-face-to-face social interactions among older adults during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Design A longitudinal study Setting and Participants This study recruited individuals aged = 65 years without long-term care in one semi-urban city in Japan, who completed mailed questionnaires in March (baseline) and October 2020 (follow-up). Methods Based on depressive symptoms assessed by the Two-Question Screening at baseline and follow-up, participants were classified as: â€œnon-case,â€ â€œonset,â€ â€œremission,â€ and â€œpersistence.â€ Non-face-to-face social interactions during the pandemic, including phone calls or emails with separated families or friends, were dichotomized as â€œless than weekly interactionsâ€ and â€œweekly interactions.â€ A multinomial logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the association of living arrangement (living alone or together) with changes in depressive symptoms status. Results Data of 1,001 participants were analyzed (mean age = 79.9 years). Of them, 13.8% lived alone. Overall, 40.6% participants were grouped as â€œnon-case,â€ 11.7% as â€œonset,â€ 11.0% as â€œremission,â€ and 27.1% as â€œpersistence.â€ Living alone was significantly associated with depressive symptom onset (odds ratio = 1.92, 95% confidence interval = 1.03â€“3.56, p = 0.039), and a negative interaction (protective effect) was found between living alone and weekly non-face-to-face social interactions for depressive symptom onset. Conclusion and Implications During the pandemic, older adults living alone had a higher depressive symptom risk, but non-face-to-face social interactions may have buffered this risk. Our findings suggest the importance of supporting older adults living alone in times of social restrictions such as the pandemic, and furthermore, maintaining social connections, including non-face-to-face relationships, is necessary to protect their mental health.","Noguchi, Taiji, Hayashi, Takahiro, Kubo, Yuta, Tomiyama, Naoki, Ochi, Akira, Hayashi, Hiroyuki","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2022.10.014","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of the American Medical Directors Association;JOUR","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",40963,""

"Religion and Sexual Identities","Religion and sexuality have a complex, deep-rooted relationship. Religions often teach how aspects of sexuality should be conducted, typically promoting heterosexuality. Such discourse is at odds with a growing population using sexual minority identities. The tension between oneâ€™s homonegative faith or religious environment and their sexual minority orientation can lead to poor health outcomes like psychological distress and suicidal ideation. Attempts to change sexual orientation to match religious expectations are futile and frequently harmful. However, sexual minority individuals can find health benefits if they are able to reconcile their religious and sexual identities or find accepting religious/spiritual communities. The COVID-19 pandemic and religious influence on US politics have also shaped the safety of environments for disclosing a sexual minority identity.","Wolf, Julia Kay, Platt, Lisa","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.copsyc.2022.101495","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Current Opinion in Psychology;JOUR: 101495,","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",40965,""

"The Impact of SARS-CoV-2 on Mental Health Focus on depression, Antidepressants Consumption and ADRs Signal Detection","Introduction: The SARS-CoV-2 public health emergency is leading to challenges for healthcare professionals, students, patients with COVID-19 and vulnerable persons, blocking the economic development and mental wellbeing. The pandemic containment measures and the fear of infection have caused psychological distress and inflamed underlying diseases Objective: To analyse the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 on the Mental Health in Friuli-Venezia Giulia Region, Italy, focusing on depression disorder and Antidepressants consumption. Furthermore, to assess the state of adverse event reports, from spontaneous signalling method, in patients taking Antidepressants Methods: For consumption data extraction I utilized the Regional Social and Health Information System. About reports of ADRs based on the National Pharmacovigilance Network I used the VigiSegn app. I accessed on INTERCheck System to balancing the risks and benefits of therapies. I compared two periods from 11.03.2019 to 10.03.2020 and from 11.03.2020 to 11.03.2021 separated by 11 March 2020, when the Director General of the WHO described the situation as a pandemic [1]. Antidepressants were classified using the ATC code system. Anonymous drug utilization was expressed in DDDs Results: Since 11 March 2020 I observed a marginal increase in consumption of sertraline, trazodone and vortioxetine. Regarding pharmaceutical spending there has been an increase of sertraline, trazodone, vortioxetine, bupropion, mirtazapine and venlafaxine. In the feminine gender, I observed an increase in AD consumption in the age ranges&lt;15 yrs, 16-19, 30-34, 55-59, 60-64, 70-74, 80-84, over 85;in the male gender in the ranges&lt;15 yrs, 20-24, 30-34, 55-59, 70-74, 80-84, over 85 (Picture 1). Concerning ADRs I analysed one tab about AD out of a total of 2146 medicines and vaccines reports in which the ''hyponatremia'' is reported on the warning label and caused by significant drug interactions Conclusion(s): Although the SARS-CoV-2 public health emergency is a rapidly evolving situation, the knowledge about the impact on the Mental Health is still limited. It is likely that the psychosocial demand will increase in the coming months. In the regional context, the thesis has highlighted a very slight rise in AD consumptions and a significant decrease of spontaneous signalling method compared to the previous year. These scenarios also depend on the new balance of health services and the lack of access to care (10% of citizens has given up on care) [13, 14]. The healthcare systems will have to face important challenges and the success of the creation of high-quality healthcare reality will depend on the alliance between healthcare specialists.","Zerial, G.","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40264-022-01219-7","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Drug Safety; JOUR:1176-1177, 45(10).","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",40967,""
"Expanding interventional oncology services with the use of remote proctorship","Learning Objectives: Demonstrate the use of tele-medicine in remote proctorship when performing procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Background(s): Tumour ablation is a growing field within Interventional Radiology, providing a minimally invasive option in the treatment of renal, hepatic, lung and bone lesions. While the practice of tumour ablation is rapidly gaining acceptance, the expertise is still largely concentrated within specialist centres. Until recently, the few experienced practitioners could travel to support other clinicians in performing these procedures but the recent pandemic has halted this practice. We present our experience of remote proctorship in the expansion of our oncology services, offering our patients minimally invasive therapeutic options as part of their oncology care. Procedure Details: Seven ablation cases were performed over four days with virtual assistance via the Proximie platform. Cameras were used to relay the live operating field to the proctor. The intra-procedural CT images displayed in theatre were also directly linked and the addition of a tablet with an encrypted video link allowed the proctor to be seen by the operators. The proctor used integrated augmented reality tools to point, annotate and demonstrate on the screen in theatre in real time and a closed 2- way communication system was used between the operators and proctor to facilitate a dialogue throughout the procedure. Conclusion(s): The use of novel remote proctorship technology enables physicians to continue to be to able offer patients cutting edge technological advancements safely, at a time when on site presence is limited by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Patel, S.; Nouzaie, R.; Karunanithy, N.; Ilyas, S.; Gangi, A.; Diamantopoulos, A.","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-022-03246-4","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: CardioVascular and Interventional Radiology; JOUR:S460, 45(Supplement 4).","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",40968,""

COVID-19 has created an adverse effect on the economy, education, mental health, and physical health of humans. It has been witnessed that despite lockdown, the death rate has increased. From several statistics, it can be observed that populations with less immunity have a higher mortality rate. This study has been performed to make a checkpoint on the factors which may be responsible for determining immunity level and based on that a prediction model may be prepared using a machine learning algorithm. This proposed work employs an IoT application to collect real-time symptom data from users to identify suspected coronavirus symptoms. IoT's sensor-based mechanism adopts for enhance capability of risk minimization specially in surgery cases compilation for COVID-19 type pandemic.","Sharma, K.

"The Effect of Family-Centered Pediatric Advance Care Planning for Teens with Cancer (Face-Tc) on Adolescents' Decisional Support, Preparedness, and Symptoms at 3 and 12-Months Post-Intervention","Background and Aims: Background and Aims Pediatric advance care planning (pACP) is a process of preparation and skill development to facilitate discussions about future medical care choices. We evaluated the efficacy of FACE-TC on adolescents' decisional support, preparedness, and quality of life (QoL) and other patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures. Method(s): Single blinded, intent-to-treat randomized clinical trial. Adolescent/family dyads were randomized at a 2:1 ratio to either FACE- TC or Treatment as Usual (TAU) at four pediatric hospitals. FACE-TC dyads received 3 weekly 60-minute sessions: pACP Survey;Next Steps: Respecting Choices interview;and Five Wishes. All received pACP information. Outcome measures were: Decisional Support and Preparedness;FACIT-Spirituality;and PROMIS measures. Result(s): 126 dyads underwent randomization (83 FACE-TC and 43 TAU). Compared to TAU, FACE-TC adolescents were significantly more likely to agree or strongly agree to I feel prepared for the future (76%vs.94%, p=0.025) and to I feel we are now on the same page (76%vs.94%, p=0.044) at 3 months post-intervention (N=107). There was no intervention effect at 12-months (N=104). Compared to TAU, FACE-TC had no significant effect on meaning/purpose or peace at 3-months, and significantly decreased meaning/peace at 12-months [Mean, SD=28(4) vs.26(5), p=0.029]. Compared to TAU, FACE-TC had no effect on the PROMIS [BJ1] measures at 3 months, and significantly increased Pain Interference [Mean, SD=40(80 vs.4 (10), p=0.030];Anxiety [42(12) vs.52(10), p=0.001];and Depressive symptoms [43(8) vs.49(11), p=0.007] at 12-months. Conclusion(s): FACE-TC increased adolescents' feelings of being prepared and supported. By 12-months FACE-TC adolescents had more pain interference and anxiety and depressive symptoms. The outbreak of COVID during the 12-month follow-up visits may have impacted these outcomes given these effects were not observed at 3-months post-intervention. Justin N.

"Burnout and depression among anesthesiology trainees in the United States: An updated National Survey","A high prevalence of burnout, depression and suicidal ideation has been reported among anesthesiology trainees. Over the last decade, there has been a significant emphasis on the development of wellness programs in academic departments to mitigate the prevalence and effects of burnout during anesthesiology training. Therefore, we aimed to reevaluate the prevalence of burnout and depression in anesthesiology trainees in the United States. Cross-sectional survey. Anesthesiology Department. A nationally representative sample of 1000 anesthesiology trainees in the United States. A 33-item questionnaire consisting of 1) burnout, 2) depression, 3) job satisfaction, 4) family support, 5) work characteristics, 6) demographic factors, 7) self-reported errors, and 8) impact of COVID-19 pandemic. We received 384 responses. Twenty-four percent (91/384) of the respondents met the criteria for high burnout risk and 58/384 (15%) of the respondents screened positive for depression. Multivariable analysis revealed that: (1) hours per week &gt; 70, (odds ratio [OR; 95% confidence interval {CI}] = 3.1 [1.4-6.8], P=0.005 and (2) overnight calls per month &gt; 7 (OR [95% CI] = 2.5 [1.0- 6.0], P=0.03 were independent factors for increased odds of burnout whereas the presence of (3) married/domestic partnership (OR [95% CI} = 0.52 [0.32-0.85], P=0.01 was associated with lower odds of burnout and/or depression. Ten percent (4/40) of high burnout/depression residents reported that they often times fall short in the quality of care provided to patients compared to 0.36% (1/275) residents with low burnout/depression scores, PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001. Similarly, 22% (9/40) of high burnout/depression residents reported that they often times did not have enough attention to their patients compared to 4% (11/275) residents with low burnout/depression scores, PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001. We report a still concerning but significantly lower rate of burnout and depression in anesthesiology trainees than previously reported a decade ago.

"Effects of a multilayered crisis on psychiatric hospitalizations in a university hospital in Lebanon; a retrospective study","Lebanon is struggling with a multilayered crisis following the COVID-19 breakout, the economic crisis, and the Beirut port explosion. The aim of this article is to assess the effect of these crisis on the characteristics of patients hospitalized in psychiatry. This is a retrospective study conducted at the psychiatric ward of Hotel Dieu de France in Beirut between January 2017 and march 2022. The population was divided into three groups according to specific time events indicating the start of a certain crisis. Data regarding patients' demographics, psychiatric history and their present hospitalization was collected. A total of 1655 patient files were included in the study. Overall, the rate of hospitalized women increased following the Beirut port explosion, together with the rate of patients younger than 18 years old. Moreover, during the COVID-19 breakout and the start of the economic crisis, alcohol use decreased, as well as the length of stay in the hospital. In conclusion, in the event of a multilayered crisis children and adolescents, as well as women are the most at risk of being affected in terms of mental health.","Kassab, Hachem, Raad, Cordahi, Richa","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114940","20221114","Beirut Blast; COVID-19 pandemic; Economic crisis; Fears; Fears-COVID 19 related; Mental health consequences","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",40973,""

"Impact of COVID-19 on a Community Health Coalition and Its Residents in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania: Insights Into Adaptation From Focus Groups and Evaluation Reports","Live Well Allegheny: Lifting Wellness for African Americans (LWA<sup>2</sup>) is a coalition in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH) initiative. LWA<sup>2</sup> consists of partner organizations addressing chronic disease prevention in six Black communities through nutrition, physical activity, and community-clinical linkage strategies. This analysis focuses on qualitative data exploring the influence of COVID-19 on coalition functioning and communities. We conducted focus groups with residents in REACH communities and collected evaluation reports from partner organizations. Three focus groups assessed awareness of and participation in the REACH initiative, feedback, and the impact of COVID-19 when applicable. An additional focus group included questions related to flu vaccine messaging and the COVID-19 vaccine. These data sources provided insight regarding how COVID-19 affected planned tasks. Evaluation team members analyzed focus groups and collated summaries as part of a larger comprehensive evaluation. Partner organizations experienced an increase in food stamp applications, delays in opening farmers' markets, a shift to virtual preventive health programs, canceled in-person events, and programmatic interruptions that shifted long-term goals. Community resident concerns included difficulty accessing public transportation, decreased physical activity, fear of in-person interactions, and increased wait times for mental health services. Coalition members developed methods to continue functioning and sustaining program activities. Residents were able to engage differently with chronic illness prevention techniques.

"Characteristics of ivermectin toxicity in patients taking veterinary and human formulations for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19","US poison control centers reported increased cases of ivermectin toxicity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous descriptions of ivermectin toxicity have evaluated heterogeneous groups with a variety of ivermectin sources and dosage patterns. We sought to compare the clinical effects of ivermectin toxicity in patients taking human- vs. veterinary-formulations and acute- vs. chronic-ingestion patterns. We performed a retrospective analysis of cases from the Oregon Poison Center of ivermectin exposures for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 that resulted in a healthcare visit over a 24-week period (14 August 2021Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°31 January 2022). We identified 37 cases of ivermectin toxicity. The median age of patients was 64Ã¢â‚¬â€°years, and most patients were male. The majority of patients were hospitalized (21) or treated in an emergency department (13). A minority were treated in an outpatient setting (3) and one patient died. Seventeen ingested veterinary formulations and fifteen ingested prescription tablets. Patients reported taking ivermectin for treatment (23) and prevention (14) of COVID-19. Clinical effects included neurotoxicity (30), gastrointestinal symptoms (14), and musculoskeletal complaints (7). Patients taking veterinary products took higher doses of ivermectin and had higher rates of altered mental status than those taking prescription tablets. Patients taking ivermectin chronically took smaller doses (daily dose of 13.5Ã¢â‚¬â€°mg) over a prolonged period (median 3.8Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks) and developed toxicity that was milder than those with acute ingestions. Ivermectin toxicity developed in predominantly male patients &gt;60Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old who ingested higher than recommended doses and developed neurologic symptoms. Patients who took a veterinary formulation of ivermectin ingested large single doses or large daily doses for several days and developed rapid onset of neurotoxicity. Patients with chronic toxicity developed milder symptoms and tended to take typical therapeutic doses, but continued therapy for weeks rather than days.","Hoang, Temple, Correia, Clemons, Hendrickson","https://doi.org/10.1080/15563650.2022.2134788","20221114","COVID; Ivermectin; overdose; toxicity; veterinary","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",40977,""
"Changes in household debt due to COVID-19 and mental health concerns among adults in Ontario, Canada","Canadian households experienced unexpected changes in their economic well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent of the impact of the pandemic on household debt and its effect on health and mental health remains unknown. The aim of the study was to examine the associations of change in household debt due to COVID-19 with serious psychological distress (SPD) and general health measures. Data were from the 2020 Monitor study, a repeated cross-sectional survey of adults 18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years and older in Ontario, Canada. The 2020 cycle employed a web-based panel survey of 3,033 adults. The survey included measures of change in household debt due to the COVID-19 pandemic, mental and general health. Odds ratios (OR) were estimated from logistic regression models accounting for sociodemographic factors. Overall, 17.5% of respondents reported that their household debt increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Such an increase in household debt was significantly associated with SPD (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.92, 95% CI, 2.05-4.16), fair/poor mental health (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.02, 95% CI, 1.59-2.56), frequent mental distress days (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.80, 95% CI, 1.31-2.48), fair/poor general health (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.93, 95% CI, 1.47-2.52), and suicidal ideation (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.71, 95% CI, 2.41-5.70) after adjusting for potential confounders including education, income and employment. Household debt during the COVID-19 pandemic is an important determinant of health. Individuals who reported an increase in household debt due to COVID-19 were more likely to report serious mental health concerns including suicidal ideation. This suggests that debt-related interventions may be needed to alleviate the adverse effects of indebtedness on health.","Nigatu, Elton-Marshall, Hamilton","https://doi.org/10.1177/00207640221136795","20221114","COVID-19; debt; distress; indebtedness; pandemic; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",40978,""
"Developmental safety of nirmatrelvir in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos","Nirmatrelvir, in combination with ritonavir, is one of the first orally available antiviral treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Symptomatic pregnant women are at increased risk for severe illness and complications that can affect the developing baby. No malformations or lower embryo-fetal survival have been observed when nirmatrelvir were administered to pregnant rats and rabbits. Safety evaluation of drugs used for treating COVID-19 also in pregnancy is urgent for public health, then in this study we further investigated nirmatrelvir developmental toxicity using zebrafish as in vivo model. Using the standardized Fish Embryo Toxicity (FET) test, we first determined the lethal concentration 50 (LC50), exposing embryos from gastrula stage up to 120Ã¢â‚¬â€°hr post fertilization (hpf) and daily recording lethality. Then, we exposed embryos to five doses comprising the human therapeutic one and up to the LC50 (25Ã¢â‚¬â€°ÃŽÂ¼M). Morphology was evaluated at 72 and 120 hpf. Nirmatrelvir did not affect survival rate and did not induce morphological defects up to the human therapeutic dose. Exposure at higher doses (2.4Ãƒâ€” and 3Ãƒâ€” the human C<sub>max</sub> ) however resulted in decreased hatching rate, reduced growth, slower heartbeat with pericardial edema, reduction of eye dimension, absence of the swim bladder and disruption of the anterior-posterior axis, with lack of tail detachment, spinal curvature and straight and smaller head. Our findings in zebrafish embryos add further information about developmental nirmatrelvir safety. Further studies are needed for pharmacological safety assessment of nirmatrelvir exposure during pregnancy.","Zizioli, Ferretti, Mignani, Castelli, Tiecco, Zanella, Quiros-Roldan","https://doi.org/10.1002/bdr2.2128","20221114","COVID-19; PF-07321332; Paxlovid; Sars-CoV-2; developmental toxicity; nirmatrelvir; zebrafish","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",40979,""
"Low-Power Negative-Differential-Resistance Device for Sensing the Selective Protein via Supporter Molecule Engineering","Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures composed of atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) materials have more potential than conventional metal-oxide semiconductors because of their tunable bandgaps, and sensitivities. The remarkable features of these amazing vdW heterostructures are leading to multi-functional logic devices, atomically thin photodetectors, and negative differential resistance (NDR) Esaki diodes. Here, an atomically thin vdW stacking composed of p-type black arsenic (b-As) and n-type tin disulfide (n-SnS<sub>2</sub> ) to build a type-III (broken gap) heterojunction is introduced, leading to a negative differential resistance device. Charge transport through the NDR device is investigated under electrostatic gating to achieve a high peak-to-valley current ratio (PVCR), which improved from 2.8 to 4.6 when the temperature is lowered from 300 to 100Ã‚Â K. At various applied-biasing voltages, all conceivable tunneling mechanisms that regulate charge transport are elucidated. Furthermore, the real-time response of the NDR device is investigated at various streptavidin concentrations down to 1Ã‚Â pm, operating at a low biasing voltage. Such applications of NDR devices may lead to the development of cutting-edge electrical devices operating at low power that may be employed as biosensors to detect a variety of target DNA (e.g., ct-DNA) and protein (e.g., the spike protein associated with COVID-19).","Dastgeer, Nisar, Shahzad, Rasheed, Kim, Jaffery, Wang, Usman, Eom","https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202204779","20221114","broken bandgap; negative differential resistance; selective protein detection; van der Waals heterostructure","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",40980,""
"New horizons in group psychotherapy research and practice from third wave positive psychology: a practice-friendly review","Group psychotherapy has been shown to be equivalent to individual therapy for many disorders, including anxiety, depression, grief, eating disorders, and schizophrenia (Burlingame &amp; Strauss, 2021). In addition to effectiveness in reducing symptoms, group offers members a sense of belonging, purpose, hope, altruism, and meaning throughout treatment (Yalom &amp; Leszcz, 2020). These additional outcomes are especially important considering the COVID-19 pandemic and national/international conflicts, given the trauma, disruptions, and losses people have experienced. Applying recent developments in positive psychology to group therapy can enhance treatment. A practice-friendly review examined recent advances in the positive psychology literature, demonstrating how group therapy offers members unique growth opportunities in addition to reducing symptoms. Key findings from studies applying positive psychological constructs to group therapy outcomes are synthesized. Our review sheds light on the relevance of third wave positive psychology to enrich group therapy (Lomas et al., 2021). Specifically, group therapy can facilitate the development of vitalizing psychological virtues, and these can be used to assess treatment outcome: humanity, wisdom, transcendence, courage, temperance, and justice. Interrelatedly, we present support for including attachment theory and mentalization within a positive psychological group framework. Implications are explored for group therapy research, clinical work, and training.","Marmarosh, Sandage, Wade, Captari, Crabtree","https://doi.org/10.4081/ripppo.2022.643","20221114","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",40981,""

"Trends in Suicidal Ideation-Related Emergency Department Visits for Youth in Illinois: 2016-2021","Increasing suicide rates and emergency department (ED) mental health visits reflect deteriorating mental health among American youth. This population-based study analyzes trends in ED visits for suicidal ideation (SI) before and during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We analyzed Illinois hospital administrative data for ED visits coded for SI from January 2016 to June 2021 for youth aged 5 to 19 years. We characterized trends in patient sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, comparing three equal 22 month periods and analyzed patient and hospital characteristics associated with the likelihood of hospitalization. There were 81Ã¢â‚¬â€°051 ED visits coded for SI at 205 Illinois hospitals; 24.6% resulted in hospitalization. SI visits accounted for $785 million in charges and 145Ã¢â‚¬â€°160 hospital days over 66 months. ED SI visits increased 59% from 2016 through 2017 to 2019 through 2021, with a corresponding increase from 34.6% to 44.3% of SI principal diagnosis visits (both P &lt; .001). Hospitalizations increased 57% between prepandemic fall 2019 and fall 2020 (P = .003). After controlling for demographic and clinical characteristics, youth were 84% less likely to be hospitalized if SI was their principal diagnosis and were more likely hospitalized if coded for severe mental illness, substance use, anxiety, or depression, or had ED visits to children's or behavioral health hospitals. This study documents child ED SI visits in Illinois spiked in 2019, with an additional surge in hospitalizations during the pandemic. Rapidly rising hospital use may reflect worsening mental illness and continued difficulty in accessing low cost, high-quality outpatient mental health services.","Brewer, Doss, Sheehan, Davis, Feinglass","https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2022-056793","20221114","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",40983,""
"Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and of government responses to the pandemic, on people who are homeless in Australia: Mapping perceptions of a national sample of homelessness service workers","People who are homeless are disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and by government responses to the pandemic. This study maps the perceptions of homelessness service workers in Australia, about the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and government responses to it on people who are homeless. An electronic survey was distributed to homelessness service across Australia in June/July 2020, following Australia's 'first wave' of COVID-19. Fifty-nine homelessness services from all eight states/territories responded. Perceptions of impacts on people who are homeless were mapped in six themes: (1) changes in the types of people presenting, (2) overall impacts on peoples' lives, (3) impacts on mental health, (4) impacts of changes in service delivery, (5) impacts of government support and (6) ongoing impacts. The COVID-19 pandemic, and government responses to the pandemic, have affected every aspect of the lives of people who are homeless in Australia. There is a continuing need to support people who are homeless as the world transitions to the 'new normal' of COVID-19, particularly as rates of homelessness increase.

"Adolescent psychological well-being during the COVID-19 lockdown: the role of leisure activities and online peer communication","The present study investigated the effects of leisure activities and online peer relationships on the development of psychological difficulties in adolescents during the COVID-19 lockdown in Italy. Data were collected in April and May 2020. The parents of 1,020 Italian adolescents aged 14-18 (51.9% girls) completed questionnaires about the experiences and behaviors of their children before and during the lockdown. A moderation regression analysis was applied to test the research hypotheses. The findings indicated that adolescents who were more active in sports and social activities prior to the COVID-19 pandemic showed greater psychological distress during the lockdown. Moreover, increased reading, game playing, and exercise during the lockdown effectively compensated for the interruption of pre-pandemic sports and social activities, and represented a protective factor for adolescents' mental health. Finally, increased online contact with peers during the lockdown protected against the development of psychological difficulties, regardless of adolescents' engagement in sports and social activities prior to the pandemic. The findings provide new and useful information about the role of leisure activities and online contact with peers in protecting against psychological difficulties in adolescents, especially during situations of isolation and social distancing, as in the COVID-19 national lockdown.","Norcia, Mascaro, Bianchi, Szpunar, Cannoni","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-03679-7","20221114","Adolescence; COVID-19; Free-time; Online communication; Well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",40986,""

"Intimate Partner Violence Victimization During the COVID-19 Pandemic Among a Global Online Sample of Sexual Minority Men","We aimed to describe the prevalence of IPV victimization, changes of experiencing IPV victimization, and examined factors associated with more severe or frequent IPV victimization since the COVID-19 crisis among a global sample of sexual minority men (SMM). Data were collected between October and November 2020 through a gay social networking (GSN) application. We used multinominal logistic regression to examine correlates of experiencing any IPV during the pandemic and experiencing more severe or frequent IPV since the pandemic began. Of all participants (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°9420), IPV victimization prevalence in the past 6 months was 17.0%, 19.5% of whom reported experiencing more severe or frequent IPV and 55.7% reported experiencing IPV that stayed the same since the COVID-19 started. Experiencing more severe or frequent IPV victimization since the pandemic began was associated with having engaged in sex work, having an income reduction by more than 20% and cutting meals since the COVID-19 crisis began. Increased tobacco use and psychological distress were also associated with increased IPV victimization. Lastly, SMM who reported having met a sexual partner through GSN apps were more likely to say that their experience of IPV had been more severe or frequently. Our results demonstrate relatively high levels of reporting IPV victimization during the COVID-19 pandemic among a global sample of SMM. The findings illustrate an increasing need for IPV resources and programs as the pandemic continues to evolve. New technologies such as GSN apps have the potential to deliver confidential and safe IPV screening, services, and resources.","Hong, Stephenson, Santos, Garner, Howell, Holloway","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10896-022-00461-y","20221114","COVID-19; Gay social networking app; Intimate partner violence (IPV); Sexual minority men (SMM); Victimization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",40988,""
"Loss, Adaptation and Growth: The Experiences of Creative Arts Therapists during the Covid-19 Pandemic","Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, mental health professionals have been called upon to cope with various challenges, including the shift to telehealth without prior training, overload in the workplace, increased risk of infection, and personal stressors relating to the pandemic. This article presents the qualitative findings of a larger international mixed-method study that explored the experiences of creative arts therapists around the globe during the first year of the pandemic (Feniger-Schaal et al., 2022). Twenty creative arts therapists were interviewed between July 2020 and March 2021. Transcriptions of the interviews were qualitatively analyzed through reflexive thematic analysis. Three main themes were identified: an experience of processing the losses caused by the pandemic, a restorative orientation that focused on adaptations the therapists made, and innovations that lead to personal and professional growth. Artistic engagement and creativity were found to be a resource when coping with losses and helped therapists adapt to the shift to tele-creative arts therapies (tele-CAT). Although this shift can lead to advances in the field of creative arts therapies, it requires further consideration, including the need for ethical guidelines, specific training, the development of digital methods that support the creative process, and dedicated supervision for therapists. The findings also point to the importance of psychological support to mitigate the burden therapists experience during stressful events.","Keisari, Feniger-Schaal, Butler, Sajnani, Golan, Orkibi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aip.2022.101983","20221114","COVID-19; Creative arts therapies; creativity; online; telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",40989,""
"Identity-based social support predicts mental and physical health outcomes during COVID-19","During the COVID-19 pandemic, the United Kingdom implemented physical distancing measures to minimize viral transmission, which may have adversely impacted health and wellbeing. Evidence suggests that social support may be key to mitigating against adverse health impacts of such measures, particularly when such social support is identity-based. In this longitudinal study, we examined the role of social identity and perceived social support in mental and physical health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants completed a survey at 4 time points during the first year of the pandemic: May/June 2020 (T1; NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 443); September/October 2020 (T2; NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 235); December 2020/January 2021 (T3; NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 243); and April 2021 (T4; NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 206). Results showed that at each time point, social support was predicted by identification with multiple groups before COVID-19, identity continuity, and identification with communities. Higher identity continuity and identification with communities both predicted greater mental and physical health at the same time point, mediated by perceived social support. Interestingly, higher identity continuity and identification with communities predicted higher social support at the same time point, which in turn predicted worse mental and physical health outcomes at the subsequent time point. Findings are discussed in relation to the context of the first year of the pandemic and the changing nature of societal restrictions across the four survey time points.","Carter, Dennis, Williams, Weston","https://doi.org/10.1111/bjso.12600","20221114","COVID-19; mental health; physical health; social identity; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",40990,""
"Use of social network as a coping strategy for depression among young people during the COVID-19 lockdown: findings from the COMET collaborative study","Use of social media (SM) has exponentially grown particularly among youths in the past two years, due to COVID-19-related changing lifestyles. Based on the Italian COvid Mental hEalth Trial (COMET), we investigated the association between SM use and depressive symptoms among Italian young adults (aged 18-24). The COMET is a nationwide multi-center cross-sectional study that investigated socio-demographic data, social networking addiction (BSNAS), depression, anxiety, and stress (DASS-21), as well as impulsiveness (BIS-15) and aggressiveness (AQ) in a large sample of youngsters, in order to assess the association between BSNAS and DASS-21 indices. Mediation analyses were performed to evaluate the role of impulsiveness and aggressive personality traits in the association between SM use (SMU) and depression. 75.8% of the sample (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°491) had a problematic SMU. SMU was reduced by high AQ and high DASS-21 scores (FÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°42.338, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001, R<sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.207). Mediation analyses showed that SMU negatively predicted depressive symptomatology with the interaction mediated by AQ total (ÃƒÅ¸Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã‚Â 0.1075), physical (ÃƒÅ¸Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã‚Â 0.207) and anger (ÃƒÅ¸Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã‚Â 0.0582), BIS-15 total (ÃƒÅ¸Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã‚Â 0.0272) and attentional (ÃƒÅ¸Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã‚Â 0.0302). High depressive levels were predicted by high AQ scores, low SMU levels, low verbal and physical AQ, and low attentional BIS-15 (FÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°30.322, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001, R<sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.273). Depressive symptomatology negatively predicted SMU with their interaction mediated by AQ total (ÃƒÅ¸Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã‚Â 0.1640), verbal (ÃƒÅ¸Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0436) and anger (ÃƒÅ¸Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã‚Â 0.0807), BIS-15 total (ÃƒÅ¸Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã‚Â 0.0448) and attentional (ÃƒÅ¸Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã‚Â 0.0409). SMU during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic could have a beneficial role in buffering negative consequences linked to social isolation due to quarantine measures, despite this association being mediated by specific personality traits.","Orsolini, Volpe, Albert, Carmassi, CarrÃƒÂ , Cirulli, Dell'Osso, Del Vecchio, Di Nicola, Giallonardo, Luciano, Menculini, Nanni, Pompili, Sani, Sampogna, Tortorella, Fiorillo","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12991-022-00419-w","20221114","Aggressiveness; COVID-19; Impulsiveness; Problematic social media use; Social networking","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",40991,""
"Acute and postacute sequelae associated with SARS-CoV-2 reinfection","First infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is associated with increased risk of acute and postacute death and sequelae in various organ systems. Whether reinfection adds to risks incurred after first infection is unclear. Here we used the US Department of Veterans Affairs' national healthcare database to build a cohort of individuals with one SARS-CoV-2 infection (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°443,588), reinfection (two or more infections, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°40,947) and a noninfected control (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5,334,729). We used inverse probability-weighted survival models to estimate risks and 6-month burdens of death, hospitalization and incident sequelae. Compared to no reinfection, reinfection contributed additional risks of death (hazard ratio (HR)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.17, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.93-2.45), hospitalization (HRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.32, 95% CI 3.13-3.51) and sequelae including pulmonary, cardiovascular, hematological, diabetes, gastrointestinal, kidney, mental health, musculoskeletal and neurological disorders. The risks were evident regardless of vaccination status. The risks were most pronounced in the acute phase but persisted in the postacute phase at 6 months. Compared to noninfected controls, cumulative risks and burdens of repeat infection increased according to the number of infections. Limitations included a cohort of mostly white males. The evidence shows that reinfection further increases risks of death, hospitalization and sequelae in multiple organ systems in the acute and postacute phase. Reducing overall burden of death and disease due to SARS-CoV-2 will require strategies for reinfection prevention.","Bowe, Xie, Al-Aly","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-022-02051-3","20221110","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",40992,""
"Near Hanging: evaluation and management","Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the incidence of self-harm was already on the rise. Hanging/suffocation accounted for 50% of the increase in suicide attempts and remains the second leading cause of death from self-harm in the United States. Studies on the management of near hanging patients are lacking and most published literature is retrospective. Following airway and circulation assessment, clinical examination and imaging, namely CT angiography, remain the standard to identify the injuries associated with near hanging - cervical spine fracture, blunt cerebrovascular injury, laryngeal injury, injury to the trachea and oropharynx. These injuries, however, are uncommon, and each occur in less than 5% of patients in most series. In a large series of critically ill near hanging patients, over 50% survived to hospital discharge, however cardiac arrest predicted a poor outcome. The management of asphyxia related arrest remains controversial. Targeted Temperature Management (TTM) has only been studied in a single large multicenter trial which was retrospective. Given the significant selection bias of TTM treatment for the most ill patients, no firm recommendations can be made. Finally, for survivors, the underlaying mental health issues must be addressed to avoid recurrent suicide attempts. Thirty percent of patients in a large near hanging series were admitted for their second suicide attempt.","Dorfman","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2022.11.004","20221113","Blunt cerebrovascular injury; HangmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fracture; Laryngeal fracture; Near hanging; Suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",40993,""
"Insomnia is a key risk factor for persistent anxiety and depressive symptoms: A 12-month longitudinal cohort study during the COVID-19 pandemic","Insomnia is a risk factor for affective disorders. This study examined whether individuals with insomnia symptoms early in the pandemic, either pre-existing or new-onset, were more vulnerable to anxiety and depressive symptoms over time than those who maintained normal sleep. Additionally, sleep-related factors such as pre-sleep arousal were assessed for their influence on clinically significant anxiety and depression risk. Using a global online survey with 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups between April 2020 and May 2021, data from 2069 participants (MÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯46.16Ã¢â‚¬Â¯Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬Â¯13.42Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years; 75.3Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% female) with pre-existing, new-onset, or no insomnia symptoms was examined using mixed-effects and logistic regression models. New-onset and pre-existing insomnia predicted persistent anxiety and depressive symptoms longitudinally (p'sÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001), over other known risk factors, including age, sex, and previous psychiatric diagnoses. Despite decreasing from acutely elevated baseline levels, depressive symptoms in both insomnia groups remained above clinically significant thresholds at most time points, whereas normal sleepers remained subclinical. Pre-sleep arousal was found to increase the risk of clinically significant anxiety (ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.05) and depressive symptoms (ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.09) at 12-months. Sleep effort contributed to anxiety (ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.06), whereas dysfunctional sleep-related beliefs and attitudes predicted clinically significant depression (ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.22). Insomnia group categorization was based on self-report at baseline supported by a validated measure. High participant attrition was observed at 3-months (53Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%; nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯971), but retention remained steady till 12-months (63Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%, nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯779). Insomnia is a modifiable risk factor for persistent anxiety and depressive symptoms. Additionally, pre-sleep arousal may be an important transdiagnostic process linking insomnia with affective disorders.","Meaklim, Saunders, Byrne, Junge, Varma, Finck, Jackson","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.11.021","20221113","Acute insomnia; Mental health; Pre-sleep arousal; Sleep effort; Sleep reactivity; Trajectories","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",40994,""
"Pre-pandemic Social Integration: Protection or Risk for Older Adults in the Time of COVID-19?","To examine the association between pre-pandemic social integration and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic and test whether the association is mediated by social support received and social events missed during the pandemic. We also explored age, race, gender, and socioeconomic differences in the association. We adopted a prospective design. Path analysis was conducted using data from the COVID-19 supplement (2020) and the 2019 wave of the National Health and Aging Trends Study. The sample represents Medicare beneficiaries age 70+ (N = 2,694). Social integration was measured using a 6-item index. A 6-item standardized scale assessed PTSD symptoms. Both social support received and social events missed were single-item measures. The analysis controlled for sociodemographic characteristics, pre-pandemic physical and mental health, and coronavirus exposure during the pandemic. Pre-pandemic social integration was positively associated with PTSD symptoms during the pandemic. The association was primarily mediated by social events missed- high levels of social integration were associated with missing more social events during the pandemic resulting in more PTSD symptoms. Social support received was also a mediator-social integration was positively associated with social support received during the pandemic, with more received support associated with greater PTSD symptoms. Pre-pandemic social integration had no significant direct effect on PTSD symptoms. The direct, indirect, and total effects of social integration on PTSD symptoms did not significantly differ by age, race, gender, education or poverty status.

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on families of patients with congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis","Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreaks have dramatically changed lifestyles, with various effects on the physical and mental health of families and children with various childhood-onset neurological diseases. A questionnaire survey was conducted to identify family-specific issues and needs of patients with congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA) during major changes in their daily lives due to the COVID-19 outbreaks. An anonymous questionnaire was sent to 56 families that were members of the Association of Patients and Families of CIPA in Japan between October and November 2020, the first 2 months of the third outbreak. Thirty-eight families (67.2% response rate) responded to the questionnaire. The current concerns of the parents were (1) difficulty in predicting the future (19 parents, 50%), (2) household and work concerns (8 parents, 21.1%), and (3) whether they would become infected (25 parents, 65.8%). Fifteen families indicated stress due to increased time together (stress+ group), and 10 families had a better understanding of each other due to increased time together. New sleep disturbances and behavioral changes were observed in approximately 20% and 50% of patients with CIPA, respectively. No single factor could explain family stress.

We surveyed adult women who had a regular sexual life (including regular masturbation) and had been isolated at home for at least one month during the COVID-19 outbreak using online questionnaires. This survey recovered 678 complete questionnaires after screening. According to the findings, the overall score of the Female Sexual Function Inventory (FSFI) during the pandemic was 21.98Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.38, the frequency of FSD was 61.9%, and the frequencies of FSD in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Ningxia were 60.6%, 75.2%, and 52.2%, respectively. The frequency of FSFI scores and other specific items (Desire, Arousal, Lubrication, Orgasm, Satisfaction, and Pain) varied significantly across the three regions (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). The overall frequency of FSD in the masturbation population was 34.4%, which was lower than the frequency of FSD in women having paired sexual intercourse (60.1%) (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Further analysis revealed that the occurrence of FSD during the pandemic was related to different age stages, menopause, mode of delivery, level of anxiety and depression, and sexual lifestyles.

"Developing an app-based self-management program for people living with HIV: a randomized controlled pilot study during the COVID-19 pandemic","People living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLWH) in Korea demonstrate insufficient self-management behaviors. Especially during pandemics such as COVID-19, technology-based self-management programs are needed to overcome time and space limitations. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a self-management program using a mobile app (Health Manager) on self-management outcomes among PLWH in Korea. A randomized controlled pilot trial was performed and participants were enrolled in the infectious outpatient clinic of a single hospital. The intervention group used the mobile app for 4Ã‚Â weeks, while the control group received self-management education materials in a portable document format. The online self-report questionnaire assessed primary outcomes including self-efficacy for self-management, self-management behaviors, and medication adherence, and secondary outcomes including perceived health status, depression, and perceived stigma. Thirty-three participants were randomly assigned to the intervention (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°17) or the control group (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°16). In the intention-to-treat analysis, self-efficacy for self-management and self-management behaviors increased, while perceived stigma decreased.

"Spontaneous pneumomediastinum: a surrogate of P-SILI in critically ill COVID-19 patients","Spontaneous pneumomediastinum (SP) has been described early during the COVID-19 pandemic in large series of patients with severe pneumonia, but most patients were receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) at the time of SP diagnosis. In this retrospective multicenter observational study, we aimed at describing the prevalence and outcomes of SP during severe COVID-19 with pneumonia before any IMV, to rule out mechanisms induced by IMV in the development of pneumomediastinum.Among 549 patients, 21 patients (4%) developed a SP while receiving non-invasive respiratory support, after a median of 6Ã‚Â days [4-12] from ICU admission. The proportion of patients requiring IMV was similar. However, the time to tracheal intubation was longer in patients with SP (6Ã‚Â days [5-13] vs. 2Ã‚Â days [1-4]; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.00002), with a higher first-line use of non-invasive ventilation (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°11; 52% vs. nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°150; 28%; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.02). The 21 patients who developed a SP had persisting signs of severe lung disease and respiratory failure with lower ROX index between ICU admission and occurrence of SP (3.94 [3.15-5.55] at admission vs. 3.25 [2.73-4.02] the day preceding SP; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.1), which may underline potential indirect signals of Patient-self inflicted lung injury (P-SILI).In this series of critically ill COVID-19 patients, the prevalence of SP without IMV was not uncommon, affecting 4% of patients. They received more often vasopressors and had a longer ICU length of stay, as compared with their counterparts. One pathophysiological mechanism may potentially be carried out by P-SILI related to a prolonged respiratory failure, as underlined by a delayed use of IMV and the evolution of the ROX index between ICU admission and the day preceding SP.","Elabbadi, Urbina, Berti, Contou, PlantefÃƒÂ¨ve, Soulier, Milon, Carteaux, Voiriot, Fartoukh, Gibelin","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13054-022-04228-1","20221115","Coronavirus disease 2019; Intensive care unit; Pneumomediastinum; Pneumonia; Humans; COVID-19; Pandemics; Critical Illness; SARS-CoV-2; Mediastinal Emphysema; Respiration, Artificial; Respiratory Insufficiency; Retrospective Studies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41000,""
"Continued disruptions in health care services and mental health among health care providers during the COVID-19 pandemic in five sub-Saharan African countries","Continuous monitoring of the pandemic's impact on health service provision and mental health, COVID-19 perceptions, and compliance with prevention measures among health care providers (HCPs) can help with mitigating the pandemic's negative effects. A computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) survey was conducted among 1499 HCPs in Burkina Faso (Ouagadougou), Ethiopia (Addis Ababa), Nigeria (Lagos and Ibadan), Tanzania (Dar es Salaam), and Ghana (Kintampo). Self-reported mental health, perceptions of the COVID-19 pandemic, and prevention measures available in the workplace were assessed. HCPs' responses to questions regarding the impact of COVID-19 on nine essential health services were summed into a score; high service disruption was defined as a score higher than the total average score across all sites. Modified Poisson regression was used to identify potential factors related to high service disruption. Overall, 26.9% of HCPs reported high service disruption, with considerable differences across sites (from 1.6% in Dar es Salaam to 45.0% in Addis Ababa). A considerable proportion of HCPs reported experiencing mild psychological distress (9.4%), anxiety (8.0%), and social avoidance or rejection (13.9%) due to their profession. Participants in Addis Ababa (absolute risk ratio (ARR)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.10; 95% confidence interval (CI)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.59-2.74), Lagos (ARRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.65; 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.24-2.17), and Kintampo (ARRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.61; 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.94-3.52) had a higher likelihood of reporting high service disruption compared to those in Ouagadougou. Reporting ever-testing for COVID-19 (ARRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.82; 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.69-0.97) and the presence of COVID-19 guidelines in the workplace (ARRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.63; 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.53-0.77) were both associated with lower reported health service disruption among HCPs.

"Frugal innovation in wound care: a critical discussion of what we can learn from low-resource settings","Frugal innovation is a common philosophy in low-income settings due to limited access to resources. However, with both the increasing prevalence and clinical acuity of patients with wounds in the UK, it is essential that alongside innovation such as harnessing cutting-edge new technologies, frugal innovation is also pursued. This may improve both economic efficiency and patient outcomes. Frugal innovations were adopted throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and included opportunistic solutions such as video-conferencing services to run clinics. However, there are many more opportunities for frugal innovation in wound care, including the use of smartphone technology, which is already accessible to 99.5% of UK clinicians caring for wounds, or the simplification of wound-assessment processes using pulse oximeters as an alternative to dopplers, as in the Lanarkshire Oximetry Index. This article explores what frugal innovation is and how it could improve UK wound services. The authors invite clinicians working in wound care to consider their access to existing resources that may not be considered useful for wound-care processes and explore how these could be used to improve clinical outcomes.","Stephens, Wynn, Pradeep, Bowshall","https://doi.org/10.12968/bjon.2022.31.20.S16","20221115","Frugal innovation; Low to medium income countries; Technology; Wound care; Humans; Pandemics; COVID-19; Poverty","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41003,""
"Social support against depression in young adults' group during COVID-19 pandemic","The present study aimed at analyzing the prevalence of depressive symptoms in a group of learning young adults, as well as the social support as a predictor of depression in late adolescence during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online national survey of young adults attending schools was conducted. The semi-structured questionnaire, including a section on sociodemographic data, stressors, needs and sources of support, as well as brief version of the Kutcher Adolescent Depression Scale, was distributed to young Poles. The final sample consisted of 1,500 students aged 18-23. Multivariable logistic regression assessed the relationships between support needs and sources and depressive symptoms. The support needs that are most commonly reported by young adults are support from loved ones (family, friends) (n = 843; 56.2%) and teachers (e.g., care, appreciation) (n = 603; 40.2%). Fifty-six per cent of Polish young adults are experiencing significant depressive symptoms (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.82-13.96). Young adults with no social support had higher KADS score than participants reporting some form of support (b = 1.794; 95% BCa CI = 0.659, 2.947). Participants receiving support from mother, both parents and siblings had a lower severity of depressive symptoms, while young people receiving support from father had more severe symptoms. This study provides initial findings in terms of depressive symptoms and support needs of young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is imperative for mental health services, communities and schools to provide the necessary support to young adults.","Gawrych, CichoÃ…â€ž, Kiejna","https://doi.org/10.12740/PP/OnlineFirst/147433","20221112","COVID-19; depression; young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41004,""
"Evaluation of the rapid implementation of telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study among adolescents and their parents","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic catalysed an abrupt explosion in the use telepsychiatry for the delivery of mental health services. We aimed to explore the experience of telemedicine use during this period among adolescent outpatients and inpatients and their parents. This qualitative study took place in a French adolescent medicine and psychiatry department during the first lockdown. Data collection by purposive sampling continued until we reached theoretical sufficiency. The interviews were analysed by applying Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis which is based on an iterative, inductive process. It included 20 participants: 10 adolescents and 10 parents. The analysis showed three themes: (1) facilitators of a switch from face-to-face to tele-consultation: (a) the context of health emergency, (b) the integration of parents in the treatment, (c) the choice between telephone or video consultation; (2) distance from the therapist's gaze and its consequences: (a) an obstacle to decrypting clinical nonverbal communication, (b) effectiveness depends on the severity of the adolescent's symptoms, (c) and on the previous quality of the therapeutic relationship; (3) awareness of the value of the face-to-face therapeutic space. In the post-COVID era, practitioners would benefit from combining both approaches, face-to-face and remote, based on the quality of the therapeutic alliance, the pathology, the parents' availability for in-person participation, and the patient's age. Future quantitative research will also be necessary to establish the extent to which the experiences described by the participants in this study reflect those of a broader population.","Carretier, Bastide, Lachal, Moro","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-022-02108-1","20221112","Adolescent; COVID-19; Qualitative methods; Telemedicine; Telepsychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41005,""
"Obesity, lifestyle behaviours and psychological effects of the COVID-19 lockdown: A survey of patients attending a tertiary weight loss clinic","Lockdown measures due to coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) have impacted lifestyle factors. This study aimed to explore whether health and lifestyle behaviours changed during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown among patients with obesity. A specifically designed online survey and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) were administered to patients scheduled to attend a tertiary weight management service between 6 June-12 August 2020. A total of 210 participants completed the survey; mean age (SD) was 52.1 (12.5) years, 69% female and 67% Caucasian. Only 1.4% had tested positive to COVID-19. There was a statistically significant increase in weight pre- and post-COVID-19 lockdown, with no sex differences. Most (61.3%) gained weight, 30.4% lost weight and 8.3% maintained. The majority changed their overall purchasing (88.4%) and eating behaviours (91.6%). Two-thirds (64%) reported they did some form of exercise during the lockdown. Of those, exercise declined in 56.8% and increased in 18%. DASS-21 scores were positively correlated to worry about COVID-19, eating fewer core foods and eating more convenient/treat foods and negatively correlated with exercise. The results provide insights into how and why behaviour change occurs during stressful periods like the COVID-19 pandemic. Although there was variability in individual weight trajectories, on average people with obesity gained weight and changed lifestyle behaviours during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Strategies and support for people with obesity are required at these times.","Franklin, Sim, Swinbourne, Maston, Manson, Nelthorpe, Markovic, Hocking","https://doi.org/10.1111/cob.12567","20221112","COVID-19; behaviour; obesity; psychosocial","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41006,""
"Public Perceptions on Twitter of Nurses during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The use of social media platforms to convey public opinions and attitudes has exponentially increased over the last decade on topics related to health. In all these social media postings related to the pandemic, specific attention has been focused on healthcare professionals, specifically nurses. This study aimed to explore how the keyword 'nurse' is located in COVID-19 pandemic related tweets during a selected period of the pandemic in order to assess public perception. Tweets related to COVID-19 were downloaded from Twitter for the period January 1<sup>st</sup>, 2020, to November 11<sup>th</sup>, 2021. Sentiment analysis was used to identify opinions, emotions, and approaches expressed in tweet which included 'nurse', 'COVID-19' and 'pandemic' as either keyword or hashtags. A total of 2,440,696 most used unique words in the downloaded 582,399 tweets were included and the sentiment analysis indicated that 24.4% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°595,530) of the tweets demonstrated positive sentiment while 14.1% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°343,433) of the tweets demonstrated negative sentiment during COVID-19. Within these results, 17% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°416366) of the tweets included positive basic emotion words of trust and 4.9% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°120654) of joy.

"Feasibility Study of Caregiver-Provided Life Review: Implementation, Adaptation, and Effects on Care Recipients' Depressive Symptoms","This study aimed to examine the feasibility of unpaid, family/friend caregivers conducting life reviews with people with dementia in long-term care and community settings and reported on how we adapted the intervention modality under the COVID-19 pandemic. Twenty-one caregiver-care recipient dyads completed 6 weekly life review sessions. The intervention format was modified to accommodate COVID-19 restrictions. Primary and secondary outcome measures were analyzed based on repeated measures at baseline and post-intervention. Due to the changing nature of the pandemic, we iterated the caregiver training intervention four times to accommodate caregivers' needs while having faced multiple recruitment challenges with care facility residents. Care recipients' depression appeared to have improved (<i>p</i> =Ã‚Â .001). Although the COVID-19 pandemic created unique recruitment challenges, all the care recipients seemed to enjoy the life review activities supported by the positive outcomes in gaining socialization opportunities. It may be beneficial to offer a more self-paced intervention modality to ease the burden on caregivers. It appears that unpaid family/friend caregivers can provide life reviews to their loved ones with dementia. Training the caregivers on how to provide life reviews can be an easy, low-risk activity that might ameliorate depressive symptoms in the care recipients.","Miyawaki, Tahija, McClellan, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1080/07317115.2022.2144578","20221112","Caregiver; care recipient; community dwellers; dementia; depression; feasibility study; gerontology; life review; older adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41008,""
"Supporting Weight Management during COVID-19 (SWiM-C): twelve-month follow-up of a randomised controlled trial of a web-based, ACT-based, guided self-help intervention","We developed a guided self-help intervention (Supporting Weight Management during COVID-19, ""SWiM-C"") to support adults with overweight or obesity in their weight management during the COVID-19 pandemic. This parallel, two-group trial (ISRCTN12107048) evaluated the effect of SWiM-C on weight and determinants of weight management over twelve months. Participants (Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years, body-mass-index Ã¢â€°Â¥25Ã¢â‚¬â€°kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were randomised to the SWiM-C intervention or to a standard advice group (unblinded). Participants completed online questionnaires at baseline, four months, and twelve months. The primary outcome was change in self-reported weight from baseline to twelve months; secondary outcomes were eating behaviour (uncontrolled eating, emotional eating, cognitive restraint of food intake), experiential avoidance, depression, anxiety, stress, wellbeing and physical activity. SWiM-C is based on acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). Participants had access to an online web platform with 12 weekly modules and email and telephone contact with a trained, non-specialist coach. Standard advice was a leaflet on managing weight and mood during the COVID-19 pandemic. 388 participants were randomised (SWiM-C: nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°192, standard advice: nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°196). The baseline-adjusted difference in weight change between SWiM-C (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°119) and standard advice (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°147) was -0.81Ã¢â‚¬â€°kg (95% CI: -2.24 to 0.61Ã¢â‚¬â€°kg). SWiM-C participants reported a reduction in experiential avoidance (-2.45 [scale:10-70], 95% CI: -4.75 to -0.15), uncontrolled eating (-3.36 [scale: 0-100], 95% CI: -5.66 to -1.06), and emotional eating (-4.14 [scale:0-100], 95% CI: -7.25 to -1.02) and an increase in physical activity (8.96 [MET-min/week], 95% CI: 0.29 to 17.62) compared to standard advice participants. We found no evidence of an effect on remaining outcomes. No adverse events/side effects were reported. Whilst we were unable to conclude that the intervention had an effect on weight, SWiM-C improved eating behaviours, experiential avoidance and physical activity.

We investigate this issue with data on monthly purchases of psychotropic drugs from the universe of Italian pharmacies during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and find that purchases of mental health-related drugs have increased with respect to 2019. However, the excess volumes do not match the massive increase in anxiety and depressive disorders found in survey-based studies. We also study the interplay between mobility, measured with anonymized mobile phone data, and mental health and report no significant effect of mobility restrictions on antidepressants and anxiolytics purchases during 2020. We provide three potential mechanisms that could drive the discrepancy between self-reported mental health surveys and psychotropic drugs prescription registries: (1) stockpiling practices in the early phases of the pandemic; (2) the adoption of compensatory behavior and (3) unexpressed and unmet needs due to both demand- and supply-side shortages in healthcare services.","Marazzi, Piano Mortari, Belotti, CarrÃƒÂ , Cattuto, Kopinska, Paolotti, Atella","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-22085-4","20221115","Humans; COVID-19; Pandemics; Communicable Disease Control; Psychotropic Drugs; Antidepressive Agents; Italy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41011,""
"COVID-19 Recession: Young Adult Food Insecurity, Racial Disparities, and Correlates","The COVID-19 pandemic has inflicted devastating health, social, and economic effects globally. This study examines the experiences of young adults in the United States with respect to food insecurity during the pandemic and factors associated with higher and lower risk for young adult food insecurity. Using the U.S. Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey, a nationally representative survey collecting information on people's experiences throughout the pandemic, we analyzed prevalence of, and factors associated with young adult food insecurity during the pandemic. Overall, 13% of young adults aged 18-25 years reported often or sometimes not having enough to eat in the last 7Ã‚Â days at a given time during pandemic, on average, with Black and Hispanic young people facing higher rates of food insecurity (22% and 15%, respectively) than White non-Hispanic peers (11%). Over the observed pandemic period, we find a decline in food insecurity among young adults corresponding with economic policy actions. Factors associated with a higher risk of food insecurity include lower household income, expected job loss, renting as opposed to owning housing, behind on rent or mortgage payment, lack of confidence in an ability to pay next month's rent or mortgage, delayed medical care, and feeling worried or depressed. Our analyses reveal alarming levels of food insecurity among young adults, especially Black and Hispanic young people. Policy actions should include multifaceted and sustained interventions with a focus on supporting historically disenfranchised youth and their communities. These should prevent and address food and housing insecurity and mental health needs holistically.","Daniels, Morton","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2022.09.008","20221111","Cash transfers; Equity; Food insufficiency; Material hardship; Nutrition; Race; Safety nets; Youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41012,""

There was a significant inverse correlation between total depression score with vegetables, depression, anxiety, and stress score and dietary intake of nuts, legumes, and whole grains (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). There was a significant positive correlation between stress scores and the intake of red and processed meat (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). In multivariate-adjusted regression model, a significant association was found between adherence to DASH diet and depression and stress only in case group (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.7863, 95% CI 0.746-0.997, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.046 and ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.876, 95% CI 0.771-0.995, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.042, respectively).

"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with generalized anxiety disorder: assessing COVID-19 media source exposure and behaviour changes","The COVID-19 pandemic that has resulted in social distancing, lockdowns, and increase in media posts has taken a toll on the mental health of many people especially those living with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). The main objective of this study is to understand whether the source of information people use to receive information about COVID-19 and increase or decrease in personal weekly habits during the pandemic were associated with severity of GAD.Ã‚ METHODS: This study was a cross sectional design and was based on data from Canada. The Canadian Perspective Survey Series (CPSS) 4, 2020: Information Sourced Consulted During the Pandemic was used for the study. The outcome variable was severity of GAD. Multivariate logistic regression was carried out using STATA IC 13. Severity of GAD was significantly associated with being a female, the type of information source used to find out about COVID-19 and change in weekly habits (consuming alcohol, consuming cannabis spending time on the internet and eating junk foods or sweets). The results indicate that getting information from credible sources about the pandemic, staying connected with family and friends, seeking virtual mental health services, and learning positive coping strategies can help reduce the severity of GAD.","Alphonsus, Abayateye","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-14510-0","20221115","COVID-19; Canada; Coping strategies; Generalized anxiety disorder; Media; Mental health; Female; Humans; COVID-19; Pandemics; Cross-Sectional Studies; Canada; Communicable Disease Control; Anxiety Disorders; Anxiety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41014,""
"Associations between psychological responses and quality of life at early and late time of quarantine among residents of a collective quarantine facility in central Taiwan","Few countries required people living in collective facilities to undergo quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic, which could lead to more psychological effects than quarantine at home or hotels. This study assessed the changes in depression, anxiety, and quality of life (QOL) among residents of a collective quarantine facility in central Taiwan. Between April and November 2020, 660 collective quarantine facility residents participated in the survey conducted on the first and last days of the 14-day quarantine period. Questionnaires of Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), and WHO quality of life (WHOQOL)-BREF were used to measure depression and anxiety symptoms, and QOL, respectively. Linear regression model with generalization estimation equation method was for estimating the differences in depression, anxiety, and QOL between two surveys and to test the changes of associations between them over time. PHQ-9 and WHOQOL-BREF scores showed no significant changes, but GAD-7 score decreased during quarantine (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.011, Cohen's dÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.11). Both PHQ-9 and GAD-7 were negatively associated with overall and domain-specific WHOQOL-BREF scores on both the first and last days of quarantine. Such associations did not significantly vary with time, except for the association between PHQ-9 and environmental domain WHOQOL-BREF score, being stronger on the first day than on the last day of quarantine (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.041, ÃŽÂ·2Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.0021). A significant decrease in anxiety among quarantined individuals over a 14-day quarantine period was found. While depression was negatively associated with overall QOL, the strength of association between depression and environmental domain QOL decreased over the period.","Cheng, Liao, Huang, Li","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2022.111076","20221115","Anxiety; Depression; Infectious disease; Quality of life; Quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41015,""
"Opinion leaders and Structural Hole Spanners Influencing Echo Chambers in Discussion about COVID-19 Vaccines on Social Media in China: Network Analysis","Social media provide an ideal medium for breeding and reinforcing vaccine hesitancy, especially during public health emergencies. Algorithmic recommendation technology and users' selective exposure and group pressure leads to online echo chambers, causing vaccination promotion inefficiently. Avoiding or breaking echo chambers largely relies on key users' behavior. To eliminate the impact of echo chambers on vaccine hesitancy during public health emergencies on social media, this research aimed to develop a framework to quantify echo chamber effect in users' topic-selection and attitude-contagion about COVID-19 vaccines or vaccinations, detect online opinion leaders and structural hole spanners based on network-attributes, and explore the relationship of their behavior patterns and network locations, as well as the relationship of network locations and impact on topic-based and attitude-based echo chambers. We called Sina Weibo API to crawl tweets related to COVID-19 vaccine or vaccination and user information on Weibo, a Chinese social media. Adapting social network analysis, we examined low echo chamber effect based on topic in representational networks of information, based on attitude in communication flow networks of users, under different interactive mechanisms (retweeting, commenting). Statistical and visual analysis were used to characterize behavior patterns of key users (opinion leaders, structural hole spanners), and explore their function in avoiding or breaking topic-based and attitude-based echo chambers. Users showed low echo chamber effect in vaccine-related topic selection and attitude interaction. For the former, the homophily was more obvious in retweeting than in commenting, while for latter, it's opposite. Speakers, replicators, and monologists tended to be opinion leaders, while common users, retweeters, networkers tended to be structural hole spanners. Both leaders and spanners tended to be bridgers to disseminate diverse topics and communicate with users holding cross-cutting attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines. Besides, users who tended to echo single topic might bridge multiple attitudes, while users who focused on diverse topics also tended to be bridgers for different attitudes. This research not only revealed low echo chamber effect in vaccine hesitancy, but also dug out reasons behind it from the perspective of users, offering insights for research about echo chamber's form, degree, formation, and depolarization, social capital, stakeholder theory, user portraits, dissemination pattern of topic and sentiment, providing strategies for public health and public opinion managers to cooperate to avoid or correct echo chamber chaos, and promote online vaccine campaign.","Wang, Zhou, Ma","https://doi.org/10.2196/40701","20221111","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41016,""
"The Effects of Tinnitus in Probabilistic Learning Tasks: Protocol for an Ecological Momentary Assessment Study","Chronic tinnitus is an increasing worldwide health concern, causing a significant burden to the health care system each year. The COVID-19 pandemic has seen a further increase in reported cases. For people with tinnitus, symptoms are exacerbated because of social isolation and the elevated levels of anxiety and depression caused by quarantines and lockdowns. Although it has been reported that patients with tinnitus can experience changes in cognitive capabilities, changes in adaptive learning via decision-making tasks for people with tinnitus have not yet been investigated. In this study, we aim to assess state- and trait-related impairments in adaptive learning ability on probabilistic learning tasks among people with tinnitus. Given that performance in such tasks can be quantified through computational modeling methods using a small set of neural-informed model parameters, such approaches are promising in terms of the assessment of tinnitus severity. We will first examine baseline differences in the characterization of decision-making under uncertainty between healthy individuals and people with tinnitus in terms of differences in the parameters of computational models in a cross-sectional experiment. We will also investigate whether these computational markers, which capture characteristics of decision-making, can be used to understand the cognitive impact of tinnitus symptom fluctuations through a longitudinal experimental design. We have developed a mobile app, AthenaCX, to deliver e-consent and baseline tinnitus and psychological assessments as well as regular ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) of perceived tinnitus loudness and a web-based aversive version of a probabilistic decision-making task, which can be triggered based on the participants' responses to the EMA surveys. Computational models will be developed to fit participants' choice data in the task, and cognitive parameters will be estimated to characterize participants' current ability to adapt learning to the change of the simulated environment at each session when the task is triggered. Linear regression analysis will be conducted to evaluate the impacts of baseline tinnitus severity on adapting decision-making performance. Repeated measures linear regression analysis will be used to examine model-derived parameters of decision-making in measuring real-time perceived tinnitus loudness fluctuations. Ethics approval was received in December 2020 from Dublin City University (DCUREC/2021/070). The implementation of the experiments, including both the surveys and the web-based decision-making task, has been prepared. Recruitment flyers have been shared with audiologists, and a video instruction has been created to illustrate to the participants how to participate in the experiment. We expect to finish data collection over 12 months and complete data analysis 6 months after this. The results are expected to be published in December 2023. We believe that EMA with context-aware triggering can facilitate a deeper understanding of the effects of tinnitus symptom severity upon decision-making processes as measured outside of the laboratory.

"Impact of COVID-19 &amp; Response Measures on HIV-HCV Prevention Services and Social Determinants in People Who Inject Drugs in 13 Sites with Recent HIV Outbreaks in Europe, North America and Israel","HIV/HCV prevention among people who inject drugs (PWID) is of key public health importance. We aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 and associated response measures on HIV/HCV prevention services and socio-economic status of PWID in high-HIV-risk sites. Sites with recent (2011-2019) HIV outbreaks among PWID in Europe North America and Israel, that had been previously identified, were contacted early May 2020. Out of 17 sites invited to participate, 13 accepted. Semi-structured qualitative site reports were prepared covering data from March to May 2020, analyzed/coded and confirmed with a structured questionnaire, in which all sites explicitly responded to all 103 issues reported in the qualitative reports. Opioid maintenance treatment, needle/syringe programs and antiretroviral treatment /hepatitis C treatment continued, but with important reductions and operational changes. Increases in overdoses, widespread difficulties with food and hygiene needs, disruptions in drug supply, and increased homelessness were reported. Service programs rapidly reformed long established, and politically entrenched, restrictive service delivery policies. Future epidemic control measures should include mitigation of negative side-effects on service provision and socio-economic determinants in PWID. La prevenciÃƒÂ³n del VIH/VHC entre las personas que se inyectan drogas (PWID) es de vital importancia para la salud pÃƒÂºblica.

"Predicted and observed impacts of COVID-19 lockdowns: two Health Impact Assessments in Scotland and Wales","Health Impact Assessment is a key approach used internationally to identify positive or negative impacts of policies, plans and proposals on health and well-being. In 2020, HIAs were undertaken in Scotland and Wales to identify the potential health and well-being impacts of the 'stay at home' and physical distancing measures implemented at the start of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. There is sparse evidence evaluating whether the impacts predicted in HIAs occur following policy implementation. This paper evaluates the impacts anticipated in the COVID-19 HIAs against actual observed trends. The processes undertaken were compared and predicted impacts were tabulated by population groups and main determinants of health. Routine data and literature evidence were collated to compare predicted and observed impacts. Nearly all health impacts anticipated in both HIAs have occurred in the direction predicted. There have been significant adverse impacts through multiple direct and indirect pathways including loss of income, social isolation, disruption to education and services, and psychosocial effects. This research demonstrates the value of prediction in impact assessment and fills a gap in the literature by comparing the predicted impacts identified within the HIAs with observed trends. Post-COVID-19 recovery should centre health and well-being within future policies and decisions. Processes like HIA can support this as part of a 'health in all policies' approach to improve the health and well-being of populations. Health Impact Assessment (HIA) is an approach used to identify positive or negative impacts of policies, plans and proposals on health and well-being. In 2020, HIAs were undertaken in Scotland and Wales to identify the potential health and well-being impacts of the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœstay at homeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and physical distancing measures (commonly called Ã¢â‚¬ËœlockdownÃ¢â‚¬â„¢) which were put in place at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper evaluates whether these assessments were correct in their predictions. It finds that most of the health impacts anticipated in both assessments have occurred. These include significant impacts on income, employment and mental health. Using HIAs can help policymakers to take full account of these wider impacts on health and develop policies that benefit health and health equity.","Green, Ashton, Bellis, Clements, Douglas","https://doi.org/10.1093/heapro/daac134","20221115","COVID-19; Health Impact Assessments; evaluation; social determinants of health; Humans; Health Impact Assessment; Wales; COVID-19; Communicable Disease Control; Policy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41019,""
"Effects of long-haul transmeridian travel on physiological, sleep, perceptual and mood markers in Olympic team support staff","The objective of this study was to holistically examine the impact of long-haul transmeridian travel (LHTT) on perceptual, mood, sleep and physiological markers in Olympic team support staff travelling to Japan for the 2020 Summer Olympic Games. An observational descriptive study design was used. Nine support staff members of the Irish Olympic team (2Ã‚Â M/7Ã‚Â F; age 34.3Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 8.3 y (mean Ã‚Â±SD)) embarked on a long-haul (LH) eastward flight across eight time-zones from Ireland to Japan (approx. 24Ã‚Â h total travel time), to work at the Irish Team's 2020 Summer pre-Olympic Games camp, postponed to July 2021 due to Covid-19 pandemic. Perceived jet lag and travel fatigue symptoms, mood states and salivary markers for circadian rhythm and stress were assessed in the morning and evening during the week prior to travel as baseline (BL) measures and on days 1 to 8 (C1-C8) and day 15 (C15) post-travel. Night-time sleep (duration and quality) was monitored via actigraphy monitors and self-report sleep diaries. Participants perceived themselves to be significantly jet lagged for six days post-travel (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .05). Morning sCort decreased by 66% on C1 and remained significantly lower than BL until C6 (pÃ‚Â Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã‚Â .03). On arrival participants perceived sleep to be worse than BL on arrival (C1, C2, C4, C5; p Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã‚Â .04), with significantly shorter sleep duration (C2, C3, C6; p Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã‚Â .01) and lower sleep efficiency (C2, C6; p Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã‚Â .04) recorded by actigraphy, all normalizing by C7. Negative changes in mood states were evident in the evening time following LHTT, with significant elevations in confusion (C2, C3, p Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã‚Â .02), fatigue (C2, C3; p Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã‚Â .03) and depression (C3, C7; p &lt;Ã‚Â .05) and reduction in vigour (C2, C6, C7; p &lt;Ã‚Â .05). Following LHTT in an eastward direction across eight time-zones, it took seven days for perceived jet lag, physiological markers for circadian rhythm and sleep to normalize in Olympic team support staff. Despite alleviation of jet lag and fatigue and return of sleep to normal by C15, vigor remained low, indicating a ""submerged"" mood profile in these Olympic team support staff. These findings highlight the need to put strategies in place before and after LHTT for the Olympic Games to assist Olympic team support staff to maximize sleep, minimize stress and assist with expediating recovery from jet lag and travel fatigue, allowing them to perform optimally in supporting Olympic athletes in their final preparations for the Games.","Rossiter, Comyns, Sherwin, Nevill, Campbell, Warrington","https://doi.org/10.1080/07420528.2022.2139186","20221111","Brunel Mood Scales; Cortisol; Olympic Games; immunoglobin A; jet lag; sleep; travel fatigue","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41020,""
"Stakeholder perceptions of the efficacy, barriers, and facilitators of telemental health clinical experiences during COVID for nurse practitioner students","Telemental health services grew during the COVID pandemic, resulting in psychiatric-mental health nurse practitioner students obtaining clinical hours through this modality.

To explore perceptions of learning through telehealth clinical experiences by students, preceptors, and faculty and to identify perceived barriers and facilitators to facilitating telehealth clinical experiences. Mixed-methods exploratory study using web-based, researcher-designed, cross-sectional surveys eliciting perceptions of learning and perceived barriers and facilitators to telemental health clinical experiences sent to current and former PMHNP students and their preceptors of a state university in the southwest along with PMHNP faculty in the National Organization of Nurse Practitioner Faculties. Students and preceptors were offered the option to participate in a semistructured interview. Twenty students (35.7%), 22 preceptors (24.7%), and 19 faculty (25.3%) participated in the surveys. Three preceptors and three students volunteered for interviews. Telemental health clinicals were perceived by students as equivalent to or superior to in-person learning. Preceptors rated the teaching/learning environment through telemental health as equivalent or better as compared with in-person clinicals with two exceptions. Faculty-rated greatest barrier to telemental health clinicals was telephone visits because of technology issues.

"Functional Disorders as a Common Motor Manifestation of COVID-19 Infection or Vaccination","There have been over 500 million confirmed cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), across the globe. To date, a broad spectrum of neurological manifestations following acute infections as well as COVID-19 vaccines have been reported. This study aims to describe the spectrum of neurological manifestations seen in the 'COVID-19 clinic' established in a tertiary Movement Disorders clinic. In this consecutive case-series study over the period March 2020-January 2022, clinical information regarding demographic data, clinical history and examination findings, investigation results and video recordings of outpatients with motor manifestations associated with COVID-19 infection or vaccination were reviewed. Twenty-one adult patients were reviewed in this ad-hoc clinic at Toronto Western Hospital. The majority of the patients were female (76%) and the average age was 50.7Ã‚Â±17.2Ã¢â‚¬â€°years (range: 21-80Ã¢â‚¬â€°years). Nine patients (43%) presented with motor manifestations following COVID-19 infection. Twelve patients (57%) developed neurological symptoms following at least one dose of the mRNA or viral vector-based COVID-19 vaccine. The most common manifestation observed was a functional movement disorder (43%). The vaccine group demonstrated a higher number of functional disorders compared to the infection group (58% vs 22%, p=0.08). Functional motor manifestations can be associated with COVID-19 and are likely to be under reported. In view of the co-existence of functional symptoms, movement disorders and mental health conditions observed in this study, we would advocate the use of dedicated COVID-19 Neurology clinics with full access to an experienced multidisciplinary team.","Fung, Sa'di, Katzberg, Chen, Lang, Cheung, Fasano","https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.15630","20221111","COVID-19; Functional; Movement Disorders; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41022,""
"Metacognition vulnerabilities in time of crisis: Who to protect from suicidal risk?","During stressful events, we are all trying to cope. We may not be equal depending on our emotional, psychological, and mental states. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we could try to avoid negative information processing and anxiogenics content to prevent unhealthy thinking processes. One of the processes we can observe regarding our way of thinking and its impact on our psychological well-being is Metacognition. We recruited 104 outpatients in 2018. In 2020, during the pandemic, we recruited 216 outpatients and 176 healthy controls. We assessed their level of metacognition with the MCQ30 scale together with Suicidal risk and Hopelessness. All three groups showed significant differences, with the nonclinical sample having higher scores in MCQ30. Regression revealed the different profiles where Hopelessness was the only predictor for the clinical sample, whereas metacognition was an adjunctive predictor of suicidal risk for the nonclinical sample. Our results showed that the COVID-19 crisis influenced metacognitive levels for the nonclinical sample but not for the clinical population. Moreover, Hopelessness predicted suicide risk for both populations, but Metacognition was also a predictive factor for the nonclinical sample. We conclude with the possible impact of preventive measures based on Metacognitive work that can be created out of these results.","Martin, Oltra, Del Monte","https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.2794","20221111","COVID-19; Metacognition; general population; hopelessness; suicide risk","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41023,""
"SARS-CoV-2 at the Human-Animal Interface: Implication for Global Public Health from an African Perspective","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become the most far-reaching public health crisis of modern times. Several efforts are underway to unravel its root cause as well as to proffer adequate preventive or inhibitive measures. Zoonotic spillover of the causative virus from an animal reservoir to the human population is being studied as the most likely event leading to the pandemic. Consequently, it is important to consider viral evolution and the process of spread within zoonotic anthropogenic transmission cycles as a global public health impact. The diverse routes of interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 offer great potential for a future reservoir of pandemic viruses evolving from the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic circulation. To mitigate possible future infectious disease outbreaks in Africa and elsewhere, there is an urgent need for adequate global surveillance, prevention, and control measures that must include a focus on known and novel emerging zoonotic pathogens through a one health approach. Human immunization efforts should be approached equally through the transfer of cutting-edge technology for vaccine manufacturing throughout the world to ensure global public health and one health.","Agusi, Allendorf, Eze, Asala, Shittu, Dietze, Busch, Globig, Meseko","https://doi.org/10.3390/v14112473","20221114","Africa; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; emerging infectious disease; one health; zoonosis; Animals; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; Public Health; Pandemics; Zoonoses","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41024,""
"In Silico Genome Analysis Reveals the Evolution and Potential Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron Structural Changes on Host Immune Evasion and Antiviral Therapeutics","New variants of SARS-CoV-2 continue to evolve. The novel SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC) B.1.1.529 (Omicron) was particularly menacing due to the presence of numerous consequential mutations. In this study, we reviewed about 12 million SARS-CoV-2 genomic and associated metadata using extensive bioinformatic approaches to understand how evolutionary and mutational changes affect Omicron variant properties. Subsampled global data based analysis of molecular clock in the phylogenetic tree showed 29.56 substitutions per year as the evolutionary rate of five VOCs. We observed extensive mutational changes in the spike structural protein of the Omicron variant. A total of 20% of 7230 amino acid and structural changes exclusive to Omicron's spike protein were detected in the receptor binding domain (RBD), suggesting differential selection pressures exerted during evolution. Analyzing key drug targets revealed mutation-derived differential binding affinities between Delta and Omicron variants. Nine single-RBD substitutions were detected within the binding site of approved therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. T-cell epitope prediction revealed eight immunologically important functional hotspots in three conserved non-structural proteins. A universal vaccine based on these regions may likely protect against all these SARS-CoV-2 variants. We observed key structural changes in the spike protein, which decreased binding affinities, indicating that these changes may help the virus escape host cellular immunity.

"Investigation of Adverse Events Experienced by Healthcare Workers following Immunization with Homologous orHeterologous COVID-19 Booster Vaccinations","A comparative analysis was performed to investigate the potential risk factors of Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) after receiving different booster vaccines. From 18 January 2021 to 21 January 2022, the Health Care Workers (HCWs) of Guizhou Provincial Staff Hospital (Guizhou Province, China) who received a third Booster vaccine, that was either homologous (i.e., (i) a total of three doses of Vero cell <b>vaccine or (ii) three doses of</b> CHO cell vaccine) or (iii) heterologous with two first doses of Vero cell vaccine, being either CHO cell vaccine or adenovirus type-5 (Ad5) vectored COVID-19 vaccine, were asked to complete a self-report questionnaire form to provide information on any AEFI that may have occurred in the first 3 days after vaccination with the booster. The frequency of AEFI corresponding to the three different booster vaccines was compared, and the risk factors for predicting AEFI were determined by multivariate logistic regression analysis. Of the 904 HCWs who completed the survey, 792 met the inclusion criteria. The rates of AEFI were 9.8% (62/635) in the homologous Vero cell booster group, 17.3% (13/75) in the homologous CHO cell booster group, and 20.7% (17/82) in the heterologous mixed vaccines booster group, and the rates were significantly different (c<sup>2</sup> = 11.5, <i>p</i> = 0.004) between the three groups of vaccines. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that: (1) compared to the homologous Vero cell booster group, the risk of AEFI was about 2.1 times higher (OR = 2.095, 95% CI: 1.056-4.157, <i>p</i> = 0.034) in the CHO cell booster group and 2.5 times higher (OR = 2.476, 95% CI: 1.352-4.533, <i>p</i> = 0.003) in the mixed vaccines group; (2) the odds for women experiencing AEFI were about 2.8 times higher (OR = 2.792, 95% CI: 1.407-5.543, <i>p</i> = 0.003) than men; and (3) compared to the non-frontline HCWs, the risk of AEFI was about 2.6 times higher (OR = 2.648, 95% CI: 1.473-4.760, <i>p</i> = 0.001) in the doctors. The AEFI in all three booster groups are acceptable, and serious adverse events are rare. The risk of AEFI was higher in doctors, which may be related to the high stress during the COVID-19 epidemic.

"Differential Kinetics of Effector and Memory Responses Induced by Three Doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA Vaccine in a Cohort of Healthcare Workers","We reported the long-term kinetics of immune response after vaccination and evaluated the immunogenicity after a third dose of mRNA vaccine in 86 healthcare workers. Humoral response was analyzed by measuring anti-spike IgG and SARS-CoV-2 NTAbs titer; cell-mediated response was measured as frequency of IFN-ÃŽÂ³ producing T-cells and cell proliferation. Memory B cells secreting SARS-CoV-2 RBD-IgG were measured by B-spot assay. At three weeks after the third dose (T4), the frequency of subjects showing NT-Abs titer at the upper detection limit (Ã¢â€°Â¥640) was significantly higher than that observed at three weeks after the second dose (26/77; 33.7% vs. 9/77; 11.6%; <i>p</i> = 0.0018). Additionally, at T4, all the subjects reached positive levels of T-cell mediated response (median 110 SFU/10<sup>6</sup> PBMC, IQR 73-231). While the number of IFNÃŽÂ³-producing T-cells decreased between second and third dose administration, the T-cell proliferative response did not decrease but was sustained during the follow-up. Among T-cell subsets, a higher proliferative response was observed in CD4+ than in CD8+ population. Moreover, even if a decline in antibody response was observed between the second and third dose, a sustained persistence of memory B cells was observed. Subsequently, the third dose did not affect the frequency of memory B cells, while it restored or increased the peak antibody levels detected after the second dose.","Bergami, Arena, Sammartino, Ferrari, Zavaglio, Zelini, Paolucci, Comolli, Percivalle, Lilleri, Cassaniti, Baldanti","https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10111809","20221111","SARS-CoV-2 vaccination; healthcare workers; immune response","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41027,""
"On the Evolution of Additive Manufacturing (3D/4D Printing) Technologies: Materials, Applications, and Challenges","The scientific community is and has constantly been working to innovate and improve the available technologies in our use. In that effort, three-dimensional (3D) printing was developed that can construct 3D objects from a digital file. Three-dimensional printing, also known as additive manufacturing (AM), has seen tremendous growth over the last three decades, and in the last five years, its application has widened significantly. Three-dimensional printing technology has the potential to fill the gaps left by the limitations of the current manufacturing technologies, and it has further become exciting with the addition of a time dimension giving rise to the concept of four-dimensional (4D) printing, which essentially means that the structures created by 4D printing undergo a transformation over time under the influence of internal or external stimuli. The created objects are able to adapt to changing environmental variables such as moisture, temperature, light, pH value, etc. Since their introduction, 3D and 4D printing technologies have extensively been used in the healthcare, aerospace, construction, and fashion industries. Although 3D printing has a highly promising future, there are still a number of challenges that must be solved before the technology can advance. In this paper, we reviewed the recent advances in 3D and 4D printing technologies, the available and potential materials for use, and their current and potential future applications. The current and potential role of 3D printing in the imperative fight against COVID-19 is also discussed. Moreover, the major challenges and developments in overcoming those challenges are addressed. This document provides a cutting-edge review of the materials, applications, and challenges in 3D and 4D printing technologies.","Mahmood, Akram, Chen, Chen","https://doi.org/10.3390/polym14214698","20221111","3D printing; 4D printing; COVID-19; additive manufacturing; aerospace; biomedical; polymers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41028,""
"The Influence of Maternal Psychological Manifestations on the Mother-Child Couple during the Early COVID-19 Pandemic in Two Hospitals in Timisoara, Romania","The postpartum maternal physical and psychological state played a fundamental role in the mother-child relationship at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of the study is to analyze the influence of maternal psychological manifestations on the mother-child couple through three objectives (briefly expressed): (I) Determination of the main acute and chronic conditions of newborns/infants. (II) Verification of the hypothesis of the existence of a link between the following neonatal variables: gestational age, birth weight, number of days of hospitalization, and specific neonatal therapies (oxygen, surfactant, and blood products' transfusion). (III) Verification of the influence of postpartum maternal psychological status on the mother-child couple through three hypotheses. This cross-sectional study was conducted in two hospitals in TimiÃˆâ„¢oara, Romania, between 1 March and 1 September 2020, and included 165 mothers and their 175 newborns. Mothers answered the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, Spielberger's Inventory of State-Trait Anxiety, and the Collins and Read Revised Adult Attachment Scale. (I) The acute and chronic pathology of the infants in the study group was polymorphic. (II) Large correlations were identified between the following infant variables: gestational age with birth weight, and number of hospitalization days with birth weight, gestational age, and use of blood product transfusion (all <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). (III) (1) State anxiety was the only significant predictor of number of hospitalization days (<i>p</i> = 0.037), number of acute disorders (<i>p</i> = 0.028), and number of infant chronic diseases (<i>p</i> = 0.037). (2) Maternal depressive symptoms were the only predictor of postpartum maternal attachment (<i>p</i> = 0.018).

"Prediction Value of KREBS Von Den Lungen-6 (KL-6) Biomarker in COVID-19 Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic is a major issue that necessitates the use of cutting-edge disease prediction models. The aim of the study was to assess the existing evidence regarding association between Krebs von den Lungen-6 levels and COVID-19 severity. A literature search was performed on Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases from 1 January 2020 up to 2 August 2022. The electronic database search was supplemented by searching Google Scholar. In addition, reference lists of relative articles were also reviewed. KL-6 levels among COVID-19 positive vs. negative patients varied and amounted to 443.37 Ã‚Â± 249.33 vs. 205.73 Ã‚Â± 86.8 U/mL (MD = 275.33; 95%CI: 144.57 to 406.09; <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001).

"Psychological and Cognitive Effects of Long COVID: A Narrative Review Focusing on the Assessment and Rehabilitative Approach","Long COVID is a clinical syndrome characterized by profound fatigue, neurocognitive difficulties, muscle pain, weakness, and depression, lasting beyond the 3-12 weeks following infection with SARS-CoV-2. Among the symptoms, neurocognitive and psychiatric sequelae, including attention and memory alterations, as well as anxiety and depression symptoms, have become major targets of current healthcare providers given the significant public health impact. In this context, assessment tools play a crucial role in the early screening of cognitive alterations due to Long COVID. Among others, the general cognitive assessment tools, such as the Montreal Cognitive assessment, and more specific ones, including the State Trait Inventory of Cognitive Fatigue and the Digit Span, may be of help in investigating the main neurocognitive alterations. Moreover, appropriate neurorehabilitative programs using specific methods and techniques (conventional and/or advanced) through a multidisciplinary team are required to treat COVID-19-related cognitive and behavioral abnormalities. In this narrative review, we sought to describe the main neurocognitive and psychiatric symptoms as well as to provide some clinical advice for the assessment and treatment of Long COVID.","De Luca, Bonanno, CalabrÃƒÂ²","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11216554","20221111","Long COVID syndrome; behavioral alterations; cognitive rehabilitation; conventional and advanced approaches; psychometric assessment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41031,""
"Does the COVID-19 Pandemic Affect Labor-Related Anxiety and Prevalence of Depressive Symptoms in Pregnant Women?","The COVID-19 pandemic undoubtedly had significant effects on women's health and the course of pregnancy. The aim of this single-center study was to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adult pregnant and postpartum women's mental health, as well as to identify factors associated with depressive symptoms, anxiety and fear of delivery. The 465 women included in this questionnaire-based cohort study were divided into two groups: one (controls) of women who gave birth before (<i>n</i> = 190), and the second who were pregnant and delivered during the pandemic (<i>n</i> = 275).

"Antiviral and Anti-Inflammatory Activities of Fluoxetine in a SARS-CoV-2 Infection Mouse Model","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Since a large portion of the world's population is currently unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated and has limited access to approved treatments against COVID-19, there is an urgent need to continue research on treatment options, especially those at low cost and which are immediately available to patients, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Prior in vitro and observational studies have shown that fluoxetine, possibly through its inhibitory effect on the acid sphingomyelinase/ceramide system, could be a promising antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatment against COVID-19. In this report, we evaluated the potential antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities of fluoxetine in a K18-hACE2 mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and against variants of concern in vitro, i.e., SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain, Alpha B.1.1.7, Gamma P1, Delta B1.617 and Omicron BA.5. Fluoxetine, administrated after SARS-CoV-2 infection, significantly reduced lung tissue viral titres and expression of several inflammatory markers (i.e., IL-6, TNFÃŽÂ±, CCL2 and CXCL10). It also inhibited the replication of all variants of concern in vitro. A modulation of the ceramide system in the lung tissues, as reflected by the increase in the ratio HexCer 16:0/Cer 16:0 in fluoxetine-treated mice, may contribute to explain these effects. Our findings demonstrate the antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties of fluoxetine in a K18-hACE2 mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and its in vitro antiviral activity against variants of concern, establishing fluoxetine as a very promising candidate for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease pathogenesis.","PÃƒÂ©ricat, Leon-Icaza, Sanchez Rico, MÃƒÂ¼hle, Zoicas, Schumacher, PlanÃƒÂ¨s, Mazars, Gros, Carpinteiro, Becker, Izopet, Strub-Wourgaft, SjÃƒÂ¶, Neyrolles, Kleuser, Limosin, Gulbins, Kornhuber, Meunier, Hoertel, Cougoule","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms232113623","20221114","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; anti-depressant; fluoxetine; inflammation; mouse model; Mice; Humans; Animals; SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; Antiviral Agents; Fluoxetine; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Disease Models, Animal; Ceramides","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41034,""

"Loneliness and Social Support among the Middle-Aged and Elderly People with Visual Impairment","Loneliness is associated with depression, sleep disturbance, and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and it is a global public health problem. Since physical and mental health have a great impact on loneliness, middle-aged and elderly people who are blind or visually impaired may be more affected by loneliness. Previous research has confirmed that effective social support can enhance physical and mental health and alleviate the negative effects of life stress. Therefore, in this study, we applied a cross-sectional design where data were collected using questionnaires completed in person, by phone, or online for a total of 456 middle-aged and elderly people with visual impairment. We found that the enrolled participants who were unemployed, lacked a stable source of income, lived alone, or were unable to move independently were prone to experiencing high levels of loneliness and low social support, which highlights the necessity of interventions such as counseling to alleviate the sense of loneliness in such groups. During the COVID-19 pandemic, social support measures to reduce the sense of loneliness should be highly encouraged to ensure that middle-aged and elderly people with visual impairment can continue to live independently, and social support seems to be an important factor.","Chu, Chan","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192114600","20221114","loneliness; middle-aged and elderly people with visual impairment; social support; Aged; Middle Aged; Humans; Loneliness; Pandemics; Cross-Sectional Studies; COVID-19; Social Support; Vision, Low; Depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41036,""
"Factors Associated with Anxiety, Depression, and Stress in Peruvian University Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic","During the COVID-19 pandemic, university students have adopted measures that completely transformed their educational environment, and this has generated an increase in psychological stress.

We included studies published in English concerning adults or adolescents. Included articles dealt simultaneously with the COVID-19 pandemic, PTSSs, and alcohol, tobacco, or nicotine use. The reports included were cross-sectional, longitudinal, or cohort studies. We categorized the reports according to the population explored. Our main outcomes are the impacts of PTSSs on (1) alcohol use and (2) tobacco and nicotine use and their relation to COVID-19-related stressors (worries, exposure, lockdown, and infection, either of self or relatives). Of the 503 reports identified, 44 were assessed for eligibility, and 16 were included in our review, encompassing 34,408 participants. The populations explored were the general population, healthcare workers, war veterans, patients with substance use disorders, and other vulnerable populations. Most studies were online surveys (14) with cross-sectional designs (11). Every study explored alcohol use, while only two assessed tobacco use. In most populations explored, a high level of PTSSs was associated with alcohol use increase. COVID-19-related stress was frequently correlated with either high PTSSs or alcohol use. In healthcare workers, PTSSs and alcohol use were not associated, while COVID-19 worries were related to both PTSSs and alcohol use. 1. PTSSs and increased alcohol use are frequently associated, while COVID-19 worries might trigger both conditions and worsen their association. Alcohol use increase may represent either an inadequate way of coping with PTSSs or a vulnerability amid the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to PTSSs. As most studies were cross-sectional online surveys, longitudinal prospective studies are needed to ascertain the direction of the associations between these conditions. These studies need to be sufficiently powered and control for potential bias and confounders. 2. Our review highlighted that research about PTSSs and tobacco or nicotine use is scarce.","Mengin, Rolling, Porche, Durpoix, Lalanne","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192114546","20221114","COVID-19; alcohol; nicotine; pandemic; posttraumatic stress disorder; posttraumatic stress symptoms; tobacco; Adult; Adolescent; Humans; COVID-19; Pandemics; Tobacco; Nicotine; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Communicable Disease Control; Tobacco Use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41039,""
"Are Attitudes towards COVID-19 Pandemic Related to Subjective Physical and Mental Health?","In this paper, we investigate the relationship between a person's psychological distress, subjective physical health and their attitudes towards the COVID-19 pandemic. The evaluation was performed on the basis of data from two waves of the Saxon Longitudinal Study, carried out in 2019 (pre-pandemic) and 2021. The number of study participants in both waves was 291. We tested in autoregressive cross-lagged models the stability of the respondents' health status before and during the pandemic and reviewed their influence on attitudes towards COVID-19. Our results show that COVID-19-related concerns are controlled by subjective physical health, while pandemic denial is linked to psychological distress. In an unknown and critical situation, with limited control over the situation, the strategy of avoidance or suppression may be used by individuals for protection by psychologically downplaying the stressor and danger.","Khachatryan, Beutel, StÃƒÂ¶bel-Richter, Zenger, Berth, BrÃƒÂ¤hler, Schmidt","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192114538","20221114","COVID-19 anxiety; COVID-19 pandemic; Germany; longitudinal data; pandemic denial; Humans; COVID-19; Pandemics; Mental Health; Longitudinal Studies; Attitude; Anxiety; Depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41040,""
"The First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic Strengthened the ""Strong"" and Weakened the ""Weak"" Ones","The aim of this study was to explore how the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which contact communication was severely restricted, changed psychological health indicators, such as subjective assessment of health and depression, impulsivity, stress and emotional intelligence (EI) and how that depended on age, gender, physical activity (PA), sports specificity and body mass index (BMI).We surveyed 6369 before and 2392 people during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The participants were aged 18-74 years. Participants completed the Danish Physical Activity Questionnaire (DPAQ), the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), the Schutte Self-Report Emotional Intelligence Test (SSREIT), Barratt Impulsiveness Scale Version 11 (BIS-11), subjective depression and health self-assessments. One-way and two-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) were performed to assess the effect of independent variables on the dependent variables of MVPA (METs). Statistical analysis showed that restrictions during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic did not alter moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), except for a significant decrease in MVPA in women aged 18-25 years, or body mass index in women and men of different ages. An increase in depression and impulsivity was observed, especially an increase in unplanned or spontaneous activity. The restrictions during the first wave increased stress in women of all ages and, rather unexpectedly, improved health self-assessment in men.The study showed that the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic affected people's subjective assessment of health, depression, stress and impulsivity in two ways: it ""weakened the weak ones"" and ""strengthened the strong ones"".","Skurvydas, Lisinskiene, Majauskiene, Valanciene, Dadeliene, Istomina, Jamontaite, Sarkauskiene","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192114523","20221114","BMI; MVPA; adults; depression; health; impulsivity; physical activity; stress; Male; Humans; Female; Adolescent; Young Adult; Adult; COVID-19; Pandemics; Emotions; Impulsive Behavior; Body Mass Index","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41041,""
"Remote Learning in Higher Education: Evidence from Poland","The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about a sudden transformation at universities. The previous mode of teaching has been replaced by remote education, the effectiveness of which depends, among other things, on the technological infrastructure of universities and the digital competence of lecturers and students. The main objective of this study is to evaluate remote learning in higher education from the students' point of view. The uniqueness of the present research approach lies in the identification of four dimensions (socio-emotional, developmental, time-financial, and negative attitude) of students' evaluation of remote learning in higher education. The survey was conducted on 999 students studying remotely, including 518 women and 481 men. Most of the students surveyed had been studying remotely for 1-2 years and were studying full-time for their first degree. The research tool consisted of 16 mixed survey questions. Six of them were related to sociodemographic factors (including those related to the respondents' education), and eight were related to their experiences with and opinions about remote education, respectively. The remaining two questions were used to collect respondents' evaluations of the degree of importance to them of various advantages and disadvantages of remote education. The research showed that among the advantages of remote learning for students, the most important are saving time, the possibility of studying at a university far from home (another city, another country), the possibility of combining work and study, and reduced commuting costs. On the other hand, the disadvantages of remote learning of greatest importance to students include the loss of social ties due to lack of contact with peers, feelings of fatigue resulting from excessive use of information and communication tools, and greater susceptibility to various forms of distraction. In addition, the shape of students' education was relevant to the different dimensions of their evaluation of remote learning in higher education. The social-emotional size of remote learning is more important for students who study remotely in a blended mode (compared to uniform). The developmental dimension is essential for students who participate in remote learning activities for longer during the day. In addition, a more extended period of remote learning promotes the greater importance of the time-financial dimension when evaluating remote knowledge.","Ober, KochmaÃ…â€žska","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192114479","20221114","COVID-19 pandemic; higher education; level of knowledge; quality of education; remote learning; Male; Female; Humans; Poland; Pandemics; COVID-19; Learning; Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41042,""
"Sense of Control and Depression during Public Health Restrictions and the COVID-19 Pandemic","Depression rates have increased significantly since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a number of factors implicated in this increase, including stress, fear, social isolation and the psychological impact of public health restrictions. The main purpose of the current cross-sectional survey study was to examine the relationship between the experience of public health restrictions, the sense of control and depression, both during and after restrictions were lifted. A survey methodology was chosen, with data collected in the Republic of Ireland at two time points (January 2022 and May 2022). Time 1 participants (<i>n</i> = 314) were invited to repeat the measures 5 months later, with 172 agreeing to be recontacted, and 47 participants completing all measures at two time points. Findings showed that both the sense of control, in relation to perceived constraints, <i>w</i> = 0.43, and the experience of restrictions, <i>w</i> = 0.14, predicted depression at Time 1. Participants were less likely to be depressed at Time 2 and had a stronger sense of control. The Time 1 sense of control through perceived constraints predicted depression at Time 2, <i>w</i> = 0.45. Overall, these data show that public health restrictions and the sense of control are linked and that the sense of control has a powerful and long-lasting effect on depression status in restricted conditions, even once these have been lifted.","Msetfi, Kornbrot, Halbrook, Senan","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192114429","20221114","COVID; depression; pandemic; public health restrictions; sense of control; Humans; COVID-19; Pandemics; Depression; Public Health; Cross-Sectional Studies; Internal-External Control","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41043,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Crisis on the Practices and Mental Health of Psychologists in Belgium: Between Exhaustion and Resilience","While the COVID-19 pandemic has created psychological distress in the general population and increased the need for psychological care, little research has been done on how mental health practitioners (MHP) have been affected by the pandemic, and these health professionals have received little attention from public authorities. In this article, we focus on psychologists and the impact that the pandemic has had on their mental health and practices by exploring the adaptive and innovative responses generated. This study is based on an online survey (including multiple choice questions, several validated scales, and eight free text items) completed by 187 psychologists (86% female) one year after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in Belgium (February-April 2021). Most participants considered that the crisis had an impact on their well-being and mental health. However, the prevalence of symptoms of depression and anxiety was relatively low (17%; 12%). On the other hand, the majority of psychologists (72%) suffered from a medium level of burnout (BO), 7% suffered from a high level of BO, and only 21% had low levels of BO. Psychologists working in face-to-face settings had the highest scores on the ""exhaustion"" subscale of the BO, and those working primarily with patients in precarious situations had significantly higher scores of BO and exhaustion. Qualitative analysis of free text items showed that MHP were resilience and developed new frameworks and modes for proactive interventions in order to reach their patients, meet the psychological and social population's needs, and maintain their relationships with the network. In a crisis or pandemic context, public policies should take into account the psychological and social needs of the most socially precarious populations in reinforcing and supporting mental health professionals working in this sector.","Glowacz, Schmits, Kinard","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192114410","20221114","COVID-19 pandemic; burnout; innovative practices; mental health; psychologists; Humans; Female; Male; COVID-19; Pandemics; Mental Health; SARS-CoV-2; Belgium; Burnout, Professional; Anxiety; Depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41044,""
"Moderating Effects of Religious Tourism Activities on Environmental Risk, Leisure Satisfaction, Physical and Mental Health and Well-Being among the Elderly in the Context of COVID-19","The purpose of this study is to explore whether religious tourism activities can create a safe leisure environment and improve the well-being of the elderly during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the participants in the Baishatun Mazu pilgrimage in Taiwan as the subjects of this study. A mixed research method was used. First, statistical software and the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient were used to analyze the data. Then the respondents' opinions were collected. Finally, a multivariate analysis method was used to discuss the results of analysis. The findings showed that the elderly respondents thought that the epidemic prevention information and leisure space planning for the pilgrimage made them feel secure. The elderly believed the scenery, religious atmosphere, and commodities en route could reduce the perception of environmental risks to tourists, relieve pressure on the brain, and increase social opportunities. Therefore, the friendlier the leisure environment around the pilgrimage, the greater the leisure satisfaction among the elderly respondents. The happier the elderly felt, the less they considered the concentration of airborne contaminants, including viruses. The better their physical and mental health was, the less likely they were to want to ask for religious goods.","Lin, Lin, Hsu, Chen, Li, Wu","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192114419","20221114","Baishatun; Mazu; religious and cultural tourism; risks in tourism; the elderly; well-being; Humans; Aged; Personal Satisfaction; Mental Health; COVID-19; Tourism; Pandemics; Leisure Activities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41045,""
"Literacy and Mental Health of Portuguese Higher Education Students and Their Use of Health Promotion Strategies during Confinement in the COVID-19 Pandemic","The pandemic of COVID-19 caused significant changes in economies and societies with a major impact on the entire education process. However, these changes did not invalidate a constant effort of adaptation. This cross-sectional, descriptive, and correlational study used an online questionnaire administered to students from various study cycles at higher education institutions in Portugal, with the aim of exploring the influence of literacy and mental health on the use of mental health promotion strategies during COVID-19 confinement. A total of 329 students from higher education institutions participated in this study, mostly from the age group 18-24 years (<i>n</i> = 272; 82.7%) and female (<i>n</i> = 265, 80.5%). The most mentioned health promotion strategies during this period included studying (<i>n</i> = 170; 51.7%); physical activities (<i>n</i> = 151, 45.9%); social networking (<i>n</i> = 124, 37.7%); cooking activities (<i>n</i> = 120, 36.5%); and listening to music (<i>n</i> = 118, 35.9%). Academic success is self-reported, and it is weakly correlated with the MHI5 (r = 0.103, <i>p</i> = 0.063). Students in the pre-graduate programs studied more during the times of the pandemic and used this activity as a mental-health-promoting strategy with a statistically significant difference (<i>p</i> = 0.033). Although it was difficult to improve health literacy related to COVID-19 in such a short period of time, there was a very strong motivation to access, understand, evaluate, communicate, synthesize, and apply information and knowledge to maintain mental health through self-care using health promotion strategies.","Oliveira, Nobre, Luis, Luis, Albacar-RiobÃƒÂ³o, Pinho, Sequeira","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192114393","20221114","confinement; health promotion strategies; higher education students; literacy; mental health; Female; Humans; Adolescent; Young Adult; Adult; COVID-19; Pandemics; Mental Health; Portugal; Cross-Sectional Studies; Students; Health Literacy; Health Promotion","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41046,""
"Socioeconomic Deprivation, Sleep Duration, and Mental Health during the First Year of the COVID-19 Pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a rapid and sustained negative impact on sleep and mental health in the United States with disproportionate morbidity and mortality among socioeconomically deprived populations. We used multivariable and logistic regression to evaluate the associations among sleep duration, mental health, and socioeconomic deprivation (social deprivation index) in 14,676 Ohio residents from 1101 zip code tabulation areas from the 2020 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey. Higher socioeconomic deprivation was associated with shorter sleep and poorer mental health after adjusting for covariates (age, sex, race, education, income, and body mass index) in the multivariable linear regression models. Those in the highest socioeconomically deprived areas had 1.6 and 1.5 times higher odds of short sleep (duration &amp;lt; 6 h) and poor mental health (&amp;gt;14 poor mental health days), respectively, in the logistic regression models. Previous researchers have focused on limited socio-environmental factors such as crowding and income. We examined the role of a composite area based measure of socioeconomic deprivation in sleep duration and mental health during the first year of COVID-19. Our results suggest the need for a broader framework to understand the associations among socioeconomic deprivation, sleep duration, and mental health during a catastrophic event.","Griggs, Horvat Davey, Howard, Pignatiello, Duwadi","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192114367","20221114","COVID-19; health outcomes; mental health; sleep duration; social deprivation index; socioeconomic deprivation; United States; Humans; COVID-19; Pandemics; Mental Health; Income; Sleep; Socioeconomic Factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41047,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Incidence of Suicidal Behaviors: A Retrospective Analysis of Integrated Electronic Health Records in a Population of 75 Million","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused remarkable psychological overwhelming and an increase in stressors that may trigger suicidal behaviors. However, its impact on the rate of suicidal behaviors has been poorly reported. We conducted a population-based retrospective analysis of all suicidal behaviors attended in healthcare centers of Catalonia (northeast Spain; 7.5 million inhabitants) between January 2017 and June 2022 (secondary use of data routinely reported to central suicide and diagnosis registries). We retrieved data from this period, including an assessment of suicide risk and individuals' socioeconomic as well as clinical characteristics. Data were summarized yearly and for the periods before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain in March 2020. The analysis included 26,458 episodes of suicidal behavior (21,920 individuals); of these, 16,414 (62.0%) were suicide attempts. The monthly moving average ranged between 300 and 400 episodes until July 2020, and progressively increased to over 600 episodes monthly. In the postpandemic period, suicidal ideation increased at the expense of suicidal attempts. Cases showed a lower suicide risk; the percentage of females and younger individuals increased, whereas the prevalence of classical risk factors, such as living alone, lacking a family network, and a history of psychiatric diagnosis, decreased. In summary, suicidal behaviors have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, with more episodes of suicidal ideation without attempts in addition to younger and lower risk profiles.","Valero-Bover, Fradera, Carot-Sans, Parra, Piera-JimÃƒÂ©nez, Pontes, Palao","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192114364","20221114","COVID-19 pandemic; mental health; suicide; Female; Humans; Suicidal Ideation; Incidence; COVID-19; Retrospective Studies; Electronic Health Records; Pandemics; Risk Factors; Prevalence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41048,""
"The Mental Health Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Older Adults in China: A Systematic Review","Considered at a high risk during the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults in China not only face the disadvantages caused by their relatively low immune systems, but also the challenges brought about by the complex psychological environment in which they spend this special period of their life. However, a thorough study on the impact of the pandemic on older adults' mental health in China remains scant. Hence, this research aimed to investigate the question: What are the mental health outcomes and associated risk factors of the COVID-19 pandemic on older adults in China? Two Chinese academic databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure and WANFANG DATA) as well as six English academic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, MEDLINE, Social Science, and Google Scholar) were searched while following PRISMA guidelines. Studies were selected according to the predetermined inclusion criteria. Further, relatively high detective rates of mental health disorders, including anxiety symptoms (4.9% to 48.6%), depression symptoms (13.8% to 58.7%), hypochondria (11.9%), suicidal ideation (4.1%), along with worries and fear (55.7%) were all reported. The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a threat to not only the physical, but also the psychological health of Chinese older adults. The most common risk factors of psychological distress among Chinese older adults were found in female gender, living in rural areas, coexisting chronic diseases, and insufficient knowledge about the COVID pandemic. As a result, government policy and psychological guidelines that are created in order to alleviate the adverse effects of COVID-19 on older adults' mental health, need to be further developed.","Liu, Kwan, Deng, Hu","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192114362","20221114","COVID-19 pandemic; China; mental health; older adults; systematic review; Female; Humans; Aged; COVID-19; Pandemics; Mental Health; Depression; Anxiety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41049,""
"Factors Associated with Discrepancy of Child-Adolescent/Parent Reported Quality of Life in the Era of COVID-19","Billions of children/adolescents experienced unprecedented changes in their daily lives that impacted their health-related quality of life (HRQoL) during the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019. The purpose of this study was to describe child-parent discrepancies in reporting on HRQoL and explore factors associated with such discrepancies at the end of the first lockdown in France. A cross-sectional study was conducted among French school-aged children from 8 to 18 years and their parents living in the Grand Est region in France during the first wave of the epidemic. The impact of individual, self-reported health status and environmental data on discrepant parent-child reports of HRQoL was assessed by multinomial multivariable logistic regression models. A total of 471 parent-child pairs were included. Among 50% of the discordant pairs, parents underestimated HRQoL more frequently than they overestimated it. Home location, social support score, children's education level, parents' education level, tensions and conflicts with neighbors reported by children, whether they had access to a garden, and parents' professional activity were significantly associated with parental overestimation (<sub>adjusted</sub>OR from 2.08 to 11.61; <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05). Factors associated with parental underestimation were children's education level, SF12 score, home location, the child's gender, parent's level of education, the presence of noise in the residence reported by children, whether a household member was infected with COVID-19, whether they had access to a garden, and family structure (<sub>adjusted</sub>OR from 1.60 to 4.0; <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05). This study revealed differences between child-reported and parent-reported HRQoL. The COVID-19 pandemic accentuated the discrepancies in observable dimensions and attenuated them in unobservable dimensions of HRQoL but did not impact the directional discrepancy; parents underestimated their child's HRQoL more. These discrepancies appear to be explained by parent and child sociodemographic factors.","Jeanbert, Baumann, TodoroviÃ„â€¡, Tarquinio, Rousseau, Bourion-BÃƒÂ©dÃƒÂ¨s","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192114359","20221114","KIDSCREEN-27; child self-report; discrepancy; mental health; parent proxy report; quality of life; well-being; Humans; Adolescent; Child; Quality of Life; COVID-19; Surveys and Questionnaires; Pandemics; Cross-Sectional Studies; Communicable Disease Control","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41050,""
"The Impact of the Pandemic on Mental Health in Ethnically Diverse Mothers: Findings from the Born in Bradford, Tower Hamlets and Newham COVID-19 Research Programmes","Restrictions implemented by the UK Government during the COVID-19 pandemic have served to worsen mental health outcomes, particularly amongst younger adults, women, those living with chronic health conditions, and parents of young children. Studies looking at the impact for ethnic minorities have reported inconsistent findings. This paper describes the mental health experiences of mothers from a large and highly ethnically diverse population during the pandemic, using secondary analysis of existing data from three COVID-19 research studies completed in Bradford and London (Tower Hamlets and Newham). A total of 2807 mothers participated in this study with 44% White British, 23% Asian/Asian British Pakistani, 8% Other White and 7% Asian/Asian British Bangladeshi backgrounds. We found that 28% of mothers experienced clinically important depressive symptoms and 21% anxiety symptoms during the pandemic. In unadjusted analyses, mothers from White Other, and Asian/Asian British Bangladeshi backgrounds had higher odds of experiencing symptoms, whilst mothers from Asian/Asian British Indian backgrounds were the least likely to experience symptoms. Once loneliness, social support and financial insecurity were controlled for, there were no statistically significant differences in depression and anxiety by ethnicity. Mental health problems experienced during the pandemic may have longer term consequences for public health. Policy and decision makers must have an understanding of the high risk of financial insecurity, loneliness and a lack of social support on mother's mental health, and also recognise that some ethnic groups are far more likely to experience these issues and are, therefore, more vulnerable to poor mental health as a consequence.","McIvor, Vafai, Kelly, O'Toole, Heys, Badrick, Iqbal, Pickett, Cameron, Dickerson","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192114316","20221114","COVID-19; deprivation; ethnic minorities; ethnicity; health inequalities; mental health; Adult; Child; Female; Humans; Child, Preschool; Mothers; Pandemics; COVID-19; Mental Health; Whites","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41051,""
"Personality, Defenses, Mentalization, and Epistemic Trust Related to Pandemic Containment Strategies and the COVID-19 Vaccine: A Sequential Mediation Model","The COVID-19 pandemic has considerably influenced all domains of people's lives worldwide, determining a high increase in overall psychological distress and several clinical conditions. The study attempted to shed light on the relationship between the strategies adopted to manage the pandemic, vaccine hesitancy, and distinct features of personality and mental functioning. The sample consisted of 367 Italian individuals (68.1% women, 31.9% men; M age = 37, SD = 12.79) who completed an online survey, including an instrument assessing four response styles to the pandemic and lockdown(s), the Personality Inventory for DSM-5-Brief Form, the Defense Mechanisms Rating Scales-Self-Report-30, the Reflective Functioning Questionnaire, and the Epistemic Trust, Mistrust, Credulity Questionnaire. Maladaptive response patterns to pandemic restrictions were related to dysfunctional personality traits, immature defense mechanisms, poor mentalization, and epistemic mistrust or credulity. Moreover, more severe levels of personality pathology were predictive of an extraverted-maladaptive response style to health emergency through the full mediation of low overall defensive functioning, poor certainty of others' mental states, and high epistemic credulity. Recognizing and understanding dysfunctional psychological pathways associated with individuals' difficulties in dealing with the pandemic are crucial for developing tailored mental-health interventions and promoting best practices in healthcare services.","Tanzilli, Cibelli, Liotti, Fiorentino, Williams, Lingiardi","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192114290","20221114","COVID-19 pandemic; defense mechanisms; epistemic trust; mentalization; personality; reflective functioning; vaccine hesitancy; Male; Female; Humans; Adult; Pandemics; Mentalization; COVID-19 Vaccines; Trust; COVID-19; Communicable Disease Control; Personality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41052,""
"Estimation of Psychological Impairment and Coping Strategies during COVID-19 Pandemic among University Students in Saudi Arabia: A Large Regional Analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictive measures have substantially affected educational processes around the globe, resulting in psychological distress among students. The mental health of students in higher education is of paramount importance, and the COVID-19 pandemic has brought this vulnerable population into renewed focus. In this context, the evaluation of students' mental health at educational institutes has gained invaluable popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to ascertain the psychological health and coping strategies among students from a higher education institute in Saudi Arabia. An online study instrument was used to assess anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, GAD-7), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9, PHQ-9), post-traumatic stress disorder-PTSD (Impact of Event Scale-Revised, IES-R) and coping strategies (Brief-COPE). The severity of the psychological distress was classified as per the scoring criteria and correlated with demographics using appropriate statistical methods. Of 1074 students (age 21.1 Ã‚Â± 2.1 years), 12.9% and 9.7% had severe anxiety and depression, respectively. The mean anxiety and depression scores were 7.50 Ã‚Â± 5.51 and 9.31 Ã‚Â± 6.72, respectively. About one-third (32%) of students reported suicidal ideation, with 8.4% students having such thoughts nearly every day. The average PTSD score was 21.64 Ã‚Â± 17.63, where avoidance scored higher (8.10 Ã‚Â± 6.94) than intrusion and hyperarousal. There was no association of anxiety, depression and PTSD score with the demographics of the study participants. Religious/spiritual coping (5.43 Ã‚Â± 2.15) was the most adoptive coping mechanism, followed by acceptance (5.15 Ã‚Â± 2.10). Male students were significantly (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05) associated with active copings, instrumental support, planning, humor, acceptance and religious coping. Substance use was the least adopted coping strategy but practiced by a considerable number of students. The long-lasting pandemic situation, onerous protective measures and uncertainties in educational procedures have resulted in a high prevalence of psychological ailments among university students, as indicated in this study. These findings accentuate the urgent need for telepsychiatry and appropriate population-specific mental health services to assess the extent of psychological impairment and to leverage positive coping behaviors among students.","Mallhi, Ahmad, Salman, Tanveer, Shah, Butt, Alatawi, Alotaibi, Rahman, Alzarea, Alanazi, Alzahrani, Alshehri, Aljabri, Khan","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192114282","20221114","anxiety; coping strategies; depression; mental health; psychological; psychological health; stress; students; universities; Humans; Male; Young Adult; Adult; COVID-19; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Universities; Saudi Arabia; Psychiatry; Telemedicine; Adaptation, Psychological; Anxiety; Students; Depression; Stress, Psychological","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41053,""
"Can Afro-Communitarianism Be Useful in Combating the Challenge of Human Interaction Posed by the COVID-19 Pandemic?","Can Afro-communitarianism serve as a viable ideology for addressing the human interaction challenge posed by the COVID-19 pandemic? The ongoing pandemic poses many challenges to the normal functioning of societies around the world. For example, it has caused problems ranging from social, economic, and political disruption to various forms of hardship, including pain, suffering, and millions of deaths. One problem that is not attracting sufficient attention is a disruption to human interaction that leads to isolation, depression, mental health, and emotional crises. This paper will investigate whether Afro-communitarianism can function as an ideological option for addressing this challenge. This ideology, in our opinion, can foster social integration and the type of informal solidarity that engenders emotionally helpful interactions among humans. We will also argue that Afro-communitarian orientation can overturn the individualistic tendencies that hamper efforts aimed at curtailing the spread of the coronavirus.","Chimakonam, Ogbonnaya","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192114255","20221114","Afro-communitarianism; COVID-19; human interaction; pandemic; Humans; COVID-19; Pandemics; Social Responsibility; Mental Health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41054,""
"Traumatic Childbirth and Birth-Related Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder in the Time of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Prospective Cohort Study","Birth-related post-traumatic stress disorder occurs in 4.7% of mothers. No previous study focusing precisely on the stress factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic regarding this important public mental health issue has been conducted. However, the stress load brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic could have influenced this risk. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of traumatic childbirth and birth-related PTSD and to analyze the risk and protective factors involved, including the risk factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a prospective cohort study of women who delivered at the University Hospitals of Geneva between 25 January 2021 and 10 March 2022 with an assessment within 3 days of delivery and a clinical interview at one month post-partum. Among the 254 participants included, 35 (21.1%, 95% CI: 15.1-28.1%) experienced a traumatic childbirth and 15 (9.1%, 95% CI: 5.2-14.6%) developed a birth-related PTSD at one month post-partum according to DSM-5. Known risk factors of birth-related PTSD such as antenatal depression, previous traumatic events, neonatal complications, peritraumatic distress and peritraumatic dissociation were confirmed. Among the factors related to COVID-19, only limited access to prenatal care increased the risk of birth-related PTSD. This study highlights the challenges of early mental health screening during the maternity stay when seeking to provide an early intervention and reduce the risk of developing birth-related PTSD. We found a modest influence of stress factors directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic on this risk.","Benzakour, Gayet-Ageron, Jubin, Suardi, Pallud, Lombard, Quagliarini, Epiney","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192114246","20221114","COVID-19; birth-related PTSD; traumatic childbirth; Infant, Newborn; Female; Pregnancy; Humans; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; COVID-19; Pandemics; Prospective Studies; Parturition","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41055,""
"A Cross-Sectional Study on the Prevalence of Depressive Symptoms and Its Associated Sociodemographic Factors in Peru during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The present study aims to analyze the prevalence of depressive symptoms and its sociodemographic-associated factors in Peruvian adults. Data was extracted from a nation-wide representative survey in which depression symptoms were measured with the PHQ-9 and sociodemographic information was extracted from household data. Depression severity rates were estimated for each symptom, and responses were modeled through the Rating Scale Model to obtain a depression measure used as dependent variable on a Generalized Mixed Linear Model. The most frequent depression symptoms were emotional, such as discouragement, sad mood, hopelessness, and lack of pleasure when doing activities. Our model showed that, after controlling the effects of all the variables considered, the most relevant predictors were gender, education level, physiographic region, age, marital status, and number of coresidents. Higher depression levels were found in women, people who did not complete higher education, participants living in the Highlands, older adults, single participants, and people living alone. Thus, interventions to promote or prevent depression severity during similar situations as the pandemic should focus on specific sociodemographic groups and their particular needs.","Zegarra-LÃƒÂ³pez, Florentino-Santisteban, Flores-Romero, Delgado-Tenorio, Cernades-Ames","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192114240","20221114","COVID-19; Peru; depression; mental health; sociodemographic factors; Female; Humans; Aged; COVID-19; Pandemics; Cross-Sectional Studies; Prevalence; Depression; Peru; Sociodemographic Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; Anxiety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41056,""
"Workplace Wellbeing and Quality of Life Perceived by Portuguese Nurses during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Protective Factors and Stressors","During the COVID-19 pandemic, nurses were exposed to many stressors, which may have been associated with some mental health problems. However, most of the studies carried out on nurses' quality of life and workplace wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic took a pathogenic approach. Given that current scientific knowledge in this field presented too many gaps to properly inform preventive and therapeutic action, the aim of this study was to explore whether protective factors (resilience, perceived social support, and professional identification) and stressors (perceived stress and psychosocial risks in the workplace) influenced the quality of life and workplace wellbeing perceived by Portuguese nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data for this cross-sectional study was collected through online self-administered questionnaires. Linear regression models were used to analyze the relationships between variables. Results showed that perceived stress, resilience and job satisfaction were associated with quality of life and workplace wellbeing among Portuguese nurses. The study's findings could serve to inform health policy and should draw the attention of nursing managers to the needs and difficulties reported by nurses, to the importance of providing them with emotional support, and to the relevance of promoting a good work environment.","Sampaio, Salgado, Antonini, Delmas, Oulevey Bachmann, Gilles, Ortoleva Bucher","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192114231","20221114","COVID-19; health; nurses; pandemics; protective factors; quality of life; salutogenesis; stressors; workplace; Humans; COVID-19; Workplace; Pandemics; Quality of Life; Cross-Sectional Studies; Protective Factors; Portugal; Job Satisfaction; Surveys and Questionnaires; Nurses","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41057,""
"Effect of Home-Based Training with a Daily Calendar on Preventing Frailty in Community-Dwelling Older People during the COVID-19 Pandemic","It has been reported that marked decreases in physical activity including social activities, deterioration in eating habits and mental health, and an increase in frailty have occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to devise a method to prevent the onset and progression of frailty during the COVID-19 pandemic and to verify its effect. The subjects were 111 community-dwelling older people who answered questionnaires before and after the intervention. A calendar incorporating 31 different tasks, one for each day, was created as an intervention tool with the aim of improving motor, oral, and cognitive functions. The intervention group (<i>n</i> = 49) participants performed these tasks every day for 3 months. The primary outcome was the Kihon checklist (KCL) score. When the amount of change in the KCL score before and after 3 months was compared between the two groups, no difference in the total score was observed between the two groups; however, the intervention group showed significantly improved cognitive function in the KCL sub-domain. In the intervention group, the number of pre-frailty and frailty patients decreased significantly after the intervention compared to before the intervention. These results suggest that the use of the calendar created in this study during the COVID-19 pandemic could prevent decreased cognitive function in the KCL sub-domain and could help prevent the onset and progression of pre-frailty and frailty.","Nakamura, Ohki, Mizukoshi, Takeno, Tsujita, Imai, Imaoka, Takeda","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192114205","20221114","COVID-19; calendar; community-dwelling; frailty; older people; Humans; Aged; Frailty; Independent Living; Frail Elderly; Geriatric Assessment; COVID-19; Pandemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41058,""

"Help Needs among Parents and Families in Times of the COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown in Germany","The COVID-19 pandemic was accompanied by multiple disruptions in the everyday lives of families. Previous research has underlined the negative impact of the pandemic on stress among parents and identified factors related to heightened levels of stress. Yet, several potential stressors have not been taken into account. Moreover, little is known about how general and pandemic-related stressors impacted help-seeking intentions for personal or family problems. We recruited N = 602 parents and their children (<i>n</i> = 101) for a cross-sectional online survey on parent, child and family well-being, stress and help need after the first wave of COVID-19 infections in Germany. Data were analysed using multinomial regression analyses to predict family help need, taking into account pre-pandemic help-seeking. Parents showed high levels of stress, which were associated with pre-pandemic mental health, family functioning, pandemic related worries about finances, household workload and health worries. While 76.2% of families reported no during-pandemic help need, 11.3% reported a help need before and during the pandemic and 12.5% of families without prior help needs reported a new help need during the pandemic. The results of the present study underline the need for help service providers to adapt their offers.","Baldus, Franz, Thomasius","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192114159","20221114","COVID-19; child health-related quality of life; family functioning; family help need; pandemic; pandemic-related stress; parent mental health; Child; Humans; COVID-19; Pandemics; Cross-Sectional Studies; Communicable Disease Control; Germany","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41060,""
"Pregnancy-Specific Stress during the First Lockdown of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Assessing Face-to-Face versus Online Recruitment","The study aims to assess pregnancy-specific stress among pregnant women in Spain during the first lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic. Two samples of pregnant women from the south of Spain (Andalusia) were assessed using the Prenatal Distress Questionnaire (PDQ) and a sociodemographic and obstetric questionnaire. Group 1 (N = 155) was recruited face-to-face, whereas Group 2 (N = 78) was recruited online. Pregnancy-specific stress levels were significantly different in both groups. The face-to-face group (Group 1) had higher pregnancy-specific stress levels than the online group (Group 2). The online sample over-represents young adult pregnant women with high education levels and a high number of previous miscarriages. The face-to-face study seems more accessible to racially and ethnically diverse groups. The main concern among both groups was the risk of having a sick neonate. Research during the COVID-19 pandemic can benefit from using online resources to collect data to screen and identify perinatal mental health problems in a crisis environment. Nevertheless, researchers should be aware of the potential limitations this strategy can have, for example, certain groups of people may have limited access to the internet.","SimÃƒÂ³, Cajiao-Nieto, Awad-Sirhan, Caparros-Gonzalez","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192114102","20221114","COVID-19; maternal mental health; online survey; perinatal mental health; pregnancy-specific stress; prenatal health; Infant, Newborn; Young Adult; Female; Pregnancy; Humans; COVID-19; Pandemics; Communicable Disease Control; Pregnant Women; Parturition; Stress, Psychological; Anxiety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41061,""
"Higher Prevalence of Food Insecurity and Psychological Distress among International University Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Australian Perspective","The COVID-19 pandemic and related disruptions have not only affected university students' learning and academic outcomes, but also other issues, such as food security status, mental health and employment. In Australia, international students faced additional pressures due to sudden border closures and lack of eligibility for government-provided financial support. This study explored the experiences of domestic and international university students residing in Australia during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic across a range of outcomes. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted between July and September 2020 at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia. The online survey included food insecurity status, mental health (psychological distress), disruptions to study, employment and sleep. A total of 105 students (<i>n</i> = 66 domestic and <i>n</i> = 39 international) completed the survey. Respondents reported having food insecurity (41.9%) and psychological distress (52.2%, with high and very high levels), with international students reporting significantly higher food insecurity (OR = 9.86 (95% CI 3.9-24.8), <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) and psychological distress scores (<i>t</i>(90) = 2.68, 95% CI: 1.30 to 8.81, <i>p</i> = 0.009) than domestic students. About one quarter of all respondents reported disruptions to study and employment status around the time of the survey. When asked what government support should be provided for international students, 'financial aid' was the most frequently suggested form of support. This research may help governments and educational institutions design appropriate support, particularly financial and psychological, for both international and domestic university students.","Mihrshahi, Dharmayani, Amin, Bhatti, Chau, Ronto, Turnip, Taylor","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192114101","20221114","COVID-19; food insecurity; international students; psychological distress; university students; Humans; Universities; COVID-19; Pandemics; Prevalence; Cross-Sectional Studies; Food Supply; Australia; Students; Psychological Distress; Food Insecurity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41062,""
"Mental Health and Quality of Life among Dental Students during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study","Students are particularly vulnerable from the mental health aspect, which was especially recognized during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to reveal the impact of COVID-19 on quality of life (QoL) and mental health among dental students. The study was conducted on a sample of 797 students (207 male and 592 female) with an average age of 21.7 Ã‚Â± 2.4, from the School of Dental Medicine, University of Belgrade. The measurements used in the study were the Demographic and Academic Questionnaire, Questionnaire about exposure to COVID-19, COVID-19-Impact on QoL Questionnaire (COV19-QoL), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale, and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The mean total score for COV19-QoL was 2.9 Ã‚Â± 0.9, while the diagnostic criteria of GAD-7 and depression met 19.9% and 31.4% of students, respectively. There was a positive and strong correlation between QoL, anxiety, and depression. During COVID-19, predictors for lower perceptions of QoL were female gender and death of close relatives (<i>p</i> = 0.049, <i>p</i> = 0.005, respectively). At the same time, predictors for GAD were female gender, living in dormitories, and death of close relatives (<i>p</i> = 0.019, <i>p</i> = 0.011, <i>p</i> = 0.028, respectively), while for depression they were year of study, living with parents, and death of close relatives due to COVID-19 (<i>p</i> = 0.012, <i>p</i> = 0.008, <i>p</i> = 0.029, respectively).

The objective was to evaluate effects of an online exercise training program and physical fitness and health-related variables on Brazilian older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic and secondarily to assess the feasibility and application of an online program. A study was developed with twenty older adults who participated in a 9-month online exercise program. The physical fitness, depressive symptoms, concern about falling, and quality of life were assessed pre- and post-intervention. One-way repeated measures ANOVA and effect size was used. The feasibility was proven by the adherence to the program, in addition to the absence of identification of adverse effects. The results showed that physical fitness was improved (upper limb strength) or maintained (lower limb strength, lower and upper limb flexibility, cardiorespiratory fitness), as well as for most of the health-related variables (depressive symptoms, concern about falling, and quality of life domains).

"Development of an Auxiliary Platform (Mentali) for the Primary Screening of Anxiety and Depression in Young Adults","The current COVID-19 pandemic has completely changed people's daily routines. This has had a big impact on mental health. In Mexico, medical school authorities are interested in understanding the mental health status of the student population to be able to provide support to students who may need help from a mental health specialist. The aim of this study was to develop a platform comprised of a mobile and web application called Mentali, to be used as an auxiliary tool for the detection of conditions such as anxiety and depression, as well as variations in mood, by analysis of the results of validated inventories. Following the Scrum software development methodology, Python, Dart and PHP programming languages were used for development of the application. This platform was used prospectively with 155 first year students taking part in the human medicine program. After 22 weeks, Mentali enabled the identification of 40 users with positive primary screening for anxiety and/or depression (45% for anxiety, 32.5% for both anxiety and depression, and 22.5% for altered mood). These students were contacted and referred to a psychologist; however, only 26 (65%) accepted psychological support. For all of these students a mental health disorder was confirmed. The results support the use of Mentali for the primary screening of anxiety and depression in young adults, including medical students.","Solis-Galvan, Vazquez-Reyes, Garza-Veloz, Velasco-Elizondo, Mauricio-Gonzalez, de la Luz Martinez-Fierro","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192114033","20221114","anxiety; app; depression; mental health; mobile; mobile application; web application; Young Adult; Humans; Pandemics; Depression; COVID-19; Anxiety; Students, Medical","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41066,""
"Physical Activity and Mental Health of Medical Students from Poland and Belarus-Countries with Different Restrictive Approaches during the COVID-19 Pandemic","COVID-19 pandemic has struck all of us suddenly and unexpectedly; it deprived the society of a sense of control over their lives on different levels. In a short period of time, it led to a number of changes in everyday life of people all over the world. In particular, these changes affected medical staff, who, all of a sudden, were burdened with new work-related responsibilities and duties. This situation may have had a detrimental effect on their mental health. Due to the unpredictability of the COVID-19 pandemic, we attempted to assess its consequences in terms of mental health and physical fitness of university students from countries in which different approaches to these issues were adopted. A total of 779 medical students (374 students from John Paul II University of Applied Sciences (ABNS) in Biala Podlaska, Poland, and 405 students from Yanka Kupala State University of Grodno (YKSUG), Belarus) took part in the survey. Three standardised psychometric tools were used in the study: The Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS), The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) and Stress Coping Inventory (Mini-COPE). In addition, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) was applied. The vast majority of students both from Poland and Belarus demonstrated high levels of physical activity. However, students from ABNS manifested significantly higher levels of physical activity compared to their counterparts from YKSUG. Students from Biala Podlaska had greater satisfaction with life during the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas their peers from Grodno exhibited higher levels of mental distress. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant exacerbation of mental health issues among medical students. In order to alleviate negative effects of the pandemic, it seems necessary for universities to monitor the physical and mental health state of students and to implement prevention programmes.","Baj-Korpak, Zaworski, Szymczuk, Shpakou","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192113994","20221114","COVID-19; medical students; mental health; physical activity; well-being; Humans; COVID-19; Pandemics; Mental Health; Students, Medical; Poland; Republic of Belarus; Population Health; Exercise","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41067,""
"Synergistic Interaction between Job Stressors and Psychological Distress during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study","Psychosocial job stressors increase the risk of mental health problems for the workers in health and social services (HSS). Although previous studies suggest that the accumulation of two or more stressors is detrimental to mental health, few studies have examined the synergistic interaction of accumulating job stressors. We examined survey responses from 9855 Finnish HSS workers in a cross-sectional study design from 2021. We conducted an interaction analysis of high job demands, low rewards and low workplace social capital on psychological distress, focusing on the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI). Additionally, we analysed the interaction of job demands, low rewards and COVID-19 burden (extra workload and emotional load). Our analysis showed that the total RERI for the job stressors on psychological distress was considerable (6.27, 95% CI 3.14, 9.39). The total excess risk was caused by two-way interactions, especially between high demands and low rewards and by the three-way interaction of all stressors. The total RERI for job demands, low reward and COVID-19 burden (3.93, 95% CI 1.15, 6.72), however, was caused entirely by two-way interaction between high demands and low rewards. Mental health interventions tackling high demands, low rewards and low social capital are jointly needed.","Nikunlaakso, Reuna, Selander, Oksanen, Laitinen","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192113991","20221114","COVID-19; interaction; mental health; social capital; work stress; Humans; Cross-Sectional Studies; COVID-19; Stress, Psychological; Pandemics; Workplace; Workload; Psychological Distress; Surveys and Questionnaires; Job Satisfaction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41068,""
"Impact on Public Health Nutrition Services Due to COVID-19 Pandemic in India: A Scoping Review of Primary Studies on Health and Social Security Determinants Affecting the First 1000 Days of Life","COVID-19 was declared 'a global pandemic' by the World Health Organization in March 2020. India's lockdown, one of the harshest in the world, came with additional challenges for women. This paper aims to assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic-related pathways on the first thousand days of life in the Integrated Child Development Scheme and the public distribution ecosystem in India. Using Cochrane guidelines, electronic databases, namely Google Scholar and PubMed-NCBI, were searched for evidence between 1 March 2020 and 1 May 2022. A total of 73 studies were identified in initial search; 20 met the inclusion criteria and, thus, were included in the research analysis. Primary studies were conducted throughout pan-India in rural, urban, and semi-urban areas to study the impact of COVID-19 pandemic-related pathways on the first 1000 days of life. The impact of social security, food insecurity, service delivery, nutrition of pregnant and nursing mothers (P&amp;NMs), and infant and young child feeding (IYCF) varied between geographies and within geographies. Most of the primary studies were conducted at small scale, while only three studies were pan-Indian. The majority of studies were conducted on the mental health of P&amp;NMs and pre-natal and post-natal service delivery disruption. The paucity of the available literature highlights the need to undertake research on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic-related pathways on 1000 days of life in India and worldwide. The best implementation practices were observed where cross-sectional programs were carried out in relation to health services and social security for P&amp;NMs and children.","Khandelwal, Mehra, Singh","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192113973","20221114","1000 days; COVID-19; India; children under two years; pregnant and nursing mothers; Infant; Child; Pregnancy; Female; Humans; COVID-19; Pandemics; Public Health; Cross-Sectional Studies; Social Security; Ecosystem; Communicable Disease Control; India","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41069,""
"Are Children Harmed by Being Locked up at Home? The Impact of Isolation during the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Phenomenon of Domestic Violence","The phenomenon of violence against children is a very complex one. There are many types of child abuse, and they are culturally dependent to a significant degree. Although studies show that children generally only suffer from mild COVID-19 infection, some social restrictions introduced during the pandemic, such as home isolation, may have many severe consequences on the population's mental health. Studies on this topic suggest that violence against children increased during lockdown due to the COVID-10 pandemic. This narrative review summarizes this available literature on the subject and discusses the different forms of violence against children, their cultural aspects, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the phenomenon of violence, the long-term consequences of the above, and forms of assistance for abused minors.","Grzejszczak, Gabryelska, Gmitrowicz, Kotlicka-Antczak, Strzelecki","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192113958","20221114","COVID-19; abuse; domestic violence; neglect; violence against children and adolescents; Child; Humans; COVID-19; Pandemics; Communicable Disease Control; Domestic Violence; Child Abuse","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41070,""
"Group Differences: The Relationship between Social Media Use and Depression during the Outbreak of COVID-19 in China","The outbreak of COVID-19 at the end of 2019 triggered more psychological problems than usual among the public. During this epidemic, the use of social media was very high, and several studies confirmed a positive correlation between social media use and people's psychological problems. The Chinese government has subsequently implemented a series of policies concerning the social media environment to tackle this ""infodemic"". After the containment of the first COVID-19 outbreak, China saw a new wave of COVID-19 cases in Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province in January 2021. How the optimized social media could have impacted public mental health remained to be revealed. Our research data come from an online survey of Chinese residents during the regional epidemic in Shijiazhuang, with a total of 904 valid samples from 18 different provinces in China. The results showed that this new round of outbreaks caused a high incidence of depression (38.9%) among the public. Compared with relatively advantaged groups, disadvantaged groups have a higher depression. Attributed to the optimization of the social media environment, the prevalence of social media use during the epidemic helped to markedly mitigate anxieties from depression. This is particularly demonstrated in vulnerable groups. We found, for the first time, a change in the relationship between social media use and resident depression, and more importantly, a stronger correlation between social media use and depression in relatively disadvantaged groups. Therefore, during the epidemic, actively optimizing the social media environment has a significant and positive effect on the mental health of residents, especially vulnerable groups.","Zheng, Liu, Yang, Sun, Lu, Chen","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192113941","20221114","age differences; elderly health; interpersonal environment; physical environment; social participation; Humans; COVID-19; Social Media; Depression; SARS-CoV-2; Disease Outbreaks; China","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41071,""
"Adulthood Employment Trajectories and Later Life Mental Health before and after the Onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic","This life course study has two aims. First, to explore how diverse employment trajectories across adulthood are related to older people's mental health in Chile, a country with no research in this field, and second, to analyze these associations before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We use data from the nationally-representative and longitudinal 'Chilean Social Protection Survey' sequence analysis to reconstruct employment trajectory types, and bivariate and multivariate analyses to measure their association with depressive symptoms. Our findings indicate that formal labor force patterns in adulthood show the lowest burden of depressive symptomology before and after the onset of the overwhelming COVID-19 pandemic when controlling for traditional risk factors. We emphasize that policymakers in both the labor market and public health domains must consider the relationship between informal employment pathways in adulthood and poorer mental health in old age. Public policies should improve the conditions and quality of jobs during adulthood and promote more formalization in the labor market to address the high uncertainty involving low social protection, which is strongly associated with severe mental health problems in later life.","Cabib, Budnevich-Portales, Azar","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192113936","20221114","COVID-19; Chile; employment trajectory; later life mental health; longitudinal analysis; Humans; Aged; Adult; Mental Health; COVID-19; Pandemics; Employment; Longitudinal Studies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41072,""

"How Has COVID-19 Impacted Our Language Use?","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to severe consequences for people's mental health. The pandemic has also influenced our language use, shaping our word formation habits. The overuse of new metaphorical meanings has received particular attention from the media. Here, we wanted to investigate whether these metaphors have led to the formation of new semantic associations in memory. A sample of 120 university students was asked to decide whether a target word was or was not related to a prime stimulus. Responses for pandemic pairs in which the target referred to the newly acquired metaphorical meaning of the prime (i.e., ""trench""-""hospital"") were compared to pre-existing semantically related pairs (i.e., ""trench""-""soldier"") and neutral pairs (i.e., ""trench""-""response""). Results revealed greater accuracy and faster response times for pandemic pairs than for semantic pairs and for semantic pairs compared to neutral ones. These findings suggest that the newly learned pandemic associations have created stronger semantic links in our memory compared to the pre-existing ones. Thus, this work confirms the adaptive nature of human language, and it underlines how the overuse of metaphors evoking dramatic images has been, in part, responsible for many psychological disorders still reported among people nowadays.","Pisano, Manfredini, Brachi, Landi, Sorrentino, Bottone, Incoccia, Marangolo","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192113836","20221114","COVID-19 emergency; metaphors; misinformation; psychological disorders; public health; semantic priming; social communication; social media; Humans; Language; COVID-19; Pandemics; Semantics; Reaction Time","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41074,""
"Public Discourse Surrounding Suicide during the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Unsupervised Machine Learning Analysis of Twitter Posts over a One-Year Period","Many studies have forewarned the profound emotional and psychosocial impact of the protracted COVID-19 pandemic. This study thus aimed to examine how individuals relate to suicide amid the COVID-19 pandemic from a global perspective via the public Twitter discourse around suicide and COVID-19. Original Twitter tweets from 1 February 2020 to 10 February 2021 were searched, with terms related to ""COVID-19"", ""suicide"", or ""self-harm"". An unsupervised machine learning approach and topic modelling were used to identify topics from unique tweets, with each topic further grouped into themes using manually conducted thematic analysis by the study investigators. A total of 35,904 tweets related to suicide and COVID-19 were processed into 42 topics and six themes. The main themes were: (1) mixed reactions to COVID-19 public health policies and their presumed impact on suicide; (2) biopsychosocial impact of COVID-19 pandemic on suicide and self-harm; (3) comparing mortality rates of COVID-19, suicide, and other leading causes of death; (4) mental health support for individuals at risk of suicide; (5) reported cases and public reactions to news related to COVID-19, suicide, and homicide; and (6) figurative usage of the word suicide. The general public was generally concerned about governments' responses as well as the perturbing effects on mental health, suicide, the economy, and at-risk populations.","Lim, Ng, Xin, Lim, Boon, Liew","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192113834","20221114","COVID-19; machine learning; social media; strain theory; suicide; topic modelling; Humans; COVID-19; Pandemics; Social Media; Unsupervised Machine Learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41075,""
"Equity Analysis of Repeated Cross-Sectional Survey Data on Mental Health Outcomes in Saskatchewan, Canada during COVID-19 Pandemic","This paper aims to understand the impact of COVID-19 on three mental health outcomes-anxiety, depression, and mental health service use. Specifically, whether the associations between social and economic variables and these outcomes are exacerbated or buffered among equity-seeking groups in Saskatchewan. We analyzed secondary datasets of Saskatchewan adults from population-based national surveys conducted by Mental Health Research Canada (MHRC) on three occasions: cycle 2 (August 2020), cycle 5 (February 2021), and cycle 7 (June 2021). We examined temporal changes in the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and service utilization. Using the responses from 577 respondents in cycle 5 dataset (as it coincides with the peak of 2nd wave), we performed multinomial logistic regression. The policy implications of the findings were explored empirically through a World CafÃƒÂ© approach with 30 service providers, service users and policy makers in the province. The prevalence of anxiety and depression remained steady but high. Mental health services were not accessed by many who need it. Participants reporting moderate or severe anxiety were more likely to be 30-49 years old, women, and immigrants who earned less than $20,000 annually. Immigrants with either college or technical education presented with a lesser risk of severe anxiety. Factors associated with moderate or severe depression were younger age (&amp;lt;50 years), low household income, as well as immigrants with lower levels of education. Racialized groups had a lower risk of severe depression if they were under 30 years. Students and retirees also had a lower risk of severe depression. Canadian-born residents were more likely to require mental health supports but were not accessing them, compared to immigrants. Our analysis suggests mental health outcomes and service utilization remain a problem in Saskatchewan, especially among equity-seeking groups. This study should help drive mental health service redesign towards a client-centred, integrated, and equity-driven system in Saskatchewan.","Muhajarine, Adeyinka, Pisolkar, Ahmed, Kallio, Coomaran, McIntosh, Novik, Jeffery","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192113808","20221114","COVID-19; Saskatchewan; anxiety; depression; equity-seeking; mental health care; Adult; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; COVID-19; Pandemics; Cross-Sectional Studies; Saskatchewan; Anxiety; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41076,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 on Opioid-Related Overdose Deaths in Texas","Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States was facing an epidemic of opioid overdose deaths, clouding accurate inferences about the impact of the pandemic at the population level. We sought to determine the existence of increases in the trends of opioid-related overdose (ORO) deaths in the Greater Houston metropolitan area from January 2015 through December 2021, and to describe the social vulnerability present in the geographic location of these deaths. We merged records from the county medical examiner's office with social vulnerability indexes (SVIs) for the region and present geospatial locations of the aggregated ORO deaths. Time series analyses were conducted to determine trends in the deaths, with a specific focus on the years 2019 to 2021. A total of 2660 deaths were included in the study and the mean (standard deviation, SD) age at death was 41.04 (13.60) years. Heroin and fentanyl were the most frequent opioids detected, present in 1153 (43.35%) and 1023 (38.46%) ORO deaths. We found that ORO deaths increased during the years 2019 to 2021 (<i>p</i>-value Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.001) when compared with 2015. Compared to the year 2019, ORO deaths increased for the years 2020 and 2021 (<i>p</i>-value Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.001). The geographic locations of ORO deaths were not associated with differences in the SVI. The COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on increasing ORO deaths in the metropolitan Houston area; however, identifying the determinants to guide targeted interventions in the areas of greatest need may require other factors, in addition to community-level social vulnerability parameters.","Lalani, Bakos-Block, Cardenas-Turanzas, Cohen, Gopal, Champagne-Langabeer","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192113796","20221114","COVID-19; public health; research; substance use disorder; United States; Humans; Adult; Analgesics, Opioid; Drug Overdose; Opiate Overdose; COVID-19; Texas; Pandemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41077,""
"Fear of Death during COVID-19 Does Not Explain Post-Infection Depression Symptoms beyond Reported Symptoms during the Infection in COVID-19 Survivors","The COVID-19 pandemic poses an unprecedented global burden to the general population and, in particular, to individuals who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2. In the context of the discussion about ""post COVID-19"", the aim of the study was to advance research on mental health and long-term consequences after COVID-19. In total, 214 COVID-19 survivors (female: 54.2%; hospitalized: 36.7%) participated in the repeated cross-sectional assessment. In addition to demographic data, mental and somatic symptoms, fear of death at the time of infection, and depressive (PHQ-8) and generalized anxiety symptoms (GAD-7) were assessed. Results showed an increased prevalence of depressive symptoms and symptoms of generalized anxiety compared to observations in the general population prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychological symptoms of depression and reported levels of fear of death during the SARS-CoV-2 infection showed a negative association with the time interval since COVID-19 diagnosis. Furthermore, although fear of death during the acute COVID-19 was related to depression and generalized anxiety, this association was predominantly explained by the presence of mental and somatic symptoms. In conclusion, initial fear of death does not impact mental health beyond the overall symptom burden. Furthermore, depressive symptoms appear to vanish across time since infection.","Speichert, Schweda, Witzke, Konik, Rohn, Stettner, Musche, Herchert, Fink, Geiger, BÃƒÂ¤uerle, Skoda, Teufel, Dinse","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192113773","20221114","COVID-19 survivors; corona; depression; fear of death; generalized anxiety; long COVID; mental health; post-COVID-19; psychological burden; psychosomatic; Humans; Female; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Pandemics; Depression; Cross-Sectional Studies; Medically Unexplained Symptoms; COVID-19 Testing; Anxiety; Survivors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41078,""
"Emotion-Focused Mobile App for Promoting Self-Compassion, Self-Protection, and Self-Criticism","The COVID-19 pandemic has changed our daily lives and restricted access to traditional psychological interventions. Hence there is an immediate and growing demand for accessible and scalable mental health solutions. Emotion-focused training for self-compassion and self-protection was developed and distributed using mobile phone technologies, and its effectiveness was tested. The available research sample consisted of 97 participants with a mean age of 26.06 years and a standard deviation of 10.53. Participants using the mobile app underwent a 14-day program aimed at reducing self-criticism while increasing self-compassion and self-protection. Pre- and post-measurements were collected. The results showed a statistically significant medium effect on self-compassion, self-criticism, and self-protection performance and a significant small effect on self-protection distress. The finding that a 14-day mobile app was able to foster well-being in the form of self-compassion, self-protection, and self-criticism is promising. It indicates the potential for individuals to obtain help through the use of remote tools such as MHapps for a fraction of the usual cost, at their own pace, and without other restrictions.","HalamovÃƒÂ¡, MihaÃ„Â¾o, BakoÃ…Â¡","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192113759","20221114","MHapps; Mhealth; emotion-focused therapy; mobile app; self-compassion; self-criticism; self-protection; Humans; Adult; Self-Assessment; Empathy; Mobile Applications; Self-Compassion; Pandemics; COVID-19; Emotions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41079,""
"Difficulties in Managing Children's Learning among Caregivers of Children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Taiwan: Association with Worsened Behavioral and Emotional Symptoms","School closures during the COVID-19 pandemic have interfered with children's learning. The aim of this study was to investigate the difficulties in managing children's learning at home and attending afterschool learning programs and their related factors among caregivers of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) during the COVID-19 pandemic. In total, 252 caregivers of children with ADHD completed a questionnaire collecting difficulties in managing children's learning, parenting styles, children's worsened symptoms of ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and emotion, and increased Internet use. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine the factors related to caregiver difficulties in managing children's learning and children's worsened ADHD, ODD, and emotional symptoms. In total, 85.3% of the caregivers had difficulty in asking their children to learn at home; 28.2% had difficulty in taking children to afterschool learning programs. Children's worsened anger was significantly associated with higher caregiver difficulty in asking children to learn at home, whereas parental overprotection was significantly associated with lower caregiver difficulty in asking children to learn at home. Worsened hyperactivity and opposition were significantly associated with higher caregiver difficulty in taking children to attend afterschool learning programs. Interventions for enhancing caregivers' skills to manage children's learning and children's behavioral and emotional symptoms should take the related factors found in this study into consideration.","Chen, Chen, Lin, Hsiao, Tsai, Yen","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192113722","20221114","COVID-19; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; caregiver; learning; mental health; Child; Humans; Caregivers; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; COVID-19; Pandemics; Taiwan; Emotions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41080,""
"Differences in the Perceived Likelihood of Receiving COVID-19 Vaccine","There are limited studies on the perceived likelihood of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine among the general US population and its subpopulations. We examined the association between the perceived likelihood of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine with the self-reported likelihood of contracting COVID-19, social-distancing stress, COVID-19 diagnosis status, mental health disorders, and sociodemographic characteristics. The data were collected using a national cross-sectional survey (N = 5404) between 13 May 2021 and 9 January 2022. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed. Setting: United States. Participants: Adults aged Ã¢â€°Â¥ 18 years. The majority of US adults (67.34%) indicated they intended to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. There was a decreased perceived likelihood of getting vaccinated associated with those aged 18-49 years (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 0.29-59; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 0.20-0.85); with a less than college education (AOR = 0.37-58; 95% CI = 0.28-0.68); with no health insurance (AOR = 0.48; 95% CI = 0.40, 0.58); with no perceived likelihood of contracting COVID-19 (AOR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.68, 0.89); and with anxiety/depression (AOR = 0.67; 95% CI = 0.59, 0.76). Black/African Americans had a lower perceived likelihood of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine (AOR = 0.84; 95% CI = 0.71, 0.98), while Asians (AOR = 1.92; 95% CI = 1.35, 2.74) and Hispanics/Latinos (AOR = 1.34; 95% CI = 1.03, 1.74) had a higher perceived likelihood compared with Whites. Individuals reporting social distancing as stressful (AOR = 1.21; 95% CI = 1.01, 1.45) were associated with an increased perceive likelihood of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. Our study showed that younger adults, Black/African Americans, and those with a less than college education, no health insurance, or anxiety/depression may be less likely to receive vaccination. Future research should examine the explanatory mechanisms contributing to the lower perceived likelihood of vaccination among these groups, such as barriers to vaccine education or vaccine access. Public health interventions should prioritize these populations to improve vaccination rates.","Adzrago, Sulley, Ormiston, Mamudu, Williams","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192113723","20221114","COVID-19 pandemic; COVID-19 vaccine; prevention; public health; vaccine hesitancy; Adult; United States; Humans; COVID-19 Vaccines; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; COVID-19 Testing; Vaccination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41081,""

"Perceived Barriers and Facilitators to Psychotherapy Utilisation and How They Relate to Patient's Psychotherapeutic Goals","Access to psychotherapy is still limited by various barriers, and little is known about the facilitating circumstances. This study aims to assess self-reported barriers and facilitators to psychotherapy utilisation in private practice and how these access factors relate to psychotherapy goals as formulated by patients. The dataset consists of 21 face-to-face semi-structured interviews with patients treated by psychotherapists in private practice in Austria. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis, including a frequency count of the number of codings to analyse relations between categories. A critical external barrier theme was unaffordable psychotherapy and confusion about how the Austrian funding system works. A negative experience with psychotherapy prior to the current one, such as not being understood and answered well enough by one's therapist, was a frequently reported internal barrier. Individuals who faced more internal barriers and more external facilitators in seeking therapy, such as moral support from significant others and professionals, formulated less elaborate treatment goals. Although the study was carried out amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the pandemic played a minor role in patients' self-reported barrier and facilitator themes.","Schaffler, Probst, Jesser, Humer, Pieh, Stippl, Haid, Schigl","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10112228","20221111","Austria; barriers; facilitators; mental health services research; psychotherapy; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41083,""
"Burdens of Apprentices Caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic and How They Deal with Them: A Qualitative Study Using Content Analysis One-Year Post-Breakout","The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a variety of burdens for apprentices and, as a result, in a need for resources to deal with them. The present study examined answers to two open-ended questions, which were part of a larger online survey about the burdens and resources during the pandemic from 1442 Austrian apprentices. Data collection took place from 29 March to 18 May 2021. The answers were analyzed with qualitative content analysis and revealed that most apprentices were burdened by pandemic-related restrictions and rules, the impairment of their social life, and in their mental health. In terms of resources, they mostly fell back on their social contacts, especially their friends. Besides their social life, many apprentices also used personal attitudes, leisure activities, and distractions to deal with their stresses. The study sheds light on some of the background reasons for the high psychological distress among apprentices. In order to better support young people in coping with stress, it is recommended to expand preventive and educational mental health measures targeted at apprentices, to facilitate access to low-threshold psychosocial services for young people, and improve financial support for the receipt of these.","Haider, Humer, Pieh, Plener, Jesser","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10112206","20221111","COVID-19; adolescents; apprentices; burdens; mental health; qualitative research; resources","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41084,""
"Psychological Health in Intensive Care Unit Health Care Workers after the COVID-19 Pandemic","Although the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on the general population, health care workers (HCWs) constituted one of the groups that were most adversely affected by the associated risks, owing to the significant consequences on their mental health. This study examined these psychological effects on HCWs who cared for COVID-19 patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit in an Italian hospital. Subjects were administered several self-reported questionnaires: Kessler 10 Psychological Distress Scale (K10), Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS), Impact of Event Scale Revised (IES-R), and Post-traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI), as well as two open-ended questions oriented toward understanding their positive and negative emotional experience and differentiating between two phases of the emergency. Overall, 45% of HCWs showed medium-to-high anxiety/depressive symptoms, whereas 60% presented with medium-to-high levels of perceived stress. In addition, 37% of subjects developed symptoms of PTSD and 50% showed post-traumatic growth in the ""appreciation of life"" and ""new possibilities"" dimensions. With regard to the open-ended questions, three themes were identified: quality of workplace relationships, sense of emotional-relational competence, and sense of clinical-technical competence. In addition, two macrocategories of responses were identified in the answers: growth and block. The mental health of HCWs who are involved in the front line of COVID-19 was significantly impacted by this experience, showing high levels of post-traumatic stress and anxiety and depressive symptoms more than 1 year after the emergency began. A qualitative analysis of staff experiences can be a useful guide for structuring interventions and prevention.","Carola, Vincenzo, Morale, Cecchi, Rocco, Nicolais","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10112201","20221111","COVID-19; K10; SARS-CoV-2; clinical psychology; health care workers; intensive care unit; perceived stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41085,""
"Somatic, Emotional and Behavioral Symptomatology in Children during COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Children's and Parents' Alexithymia","The COVID-19 pandemic has deeply affected the psychophysical wellbeing of children worldwide. Alexithymia, a personality trait involving difficulties in identifying and expressing feelings represents a vulnerability factor for stress-related disorders. Under pandemic stress exposure, we aimed to investigate the role of parents' and children's alexithymia in the psychophysical symptomatology shown by children and to evaluate possible differences according to age, gender and history of COVID-19 infections. The perception of parents and children about the impact of the pandemic on children's emotional, social and physiological wellbeing was also explored. Sixty-five familial triads were surveyed in the period from March to May 2022: children (<i>n</i> = 33 males; mean age = 9.53, sd = 1.55), mothers (mean age = 44.12; sd = 6.10) and fathers (mean age = 47.10; sd = 7.8). Both parental and children's alexithymia scores were significantly associated with somatic and externalizing symptomatology in children. Self-reported anger and externally oriented thinking scores were higher in younger children (age 8-9.9 years) than in older ones (10-12 years). Girls scored higher than boys in somatic complaints, as reported by parents. No difference emerged between children affected/not affected by COVID-19. Notably, children reported a greater negative impact of the pandemic on their emotional and psychosocial well-being than their parents. The findings emphasize the role of alexithymia in the occurrence of psychophysical symptoms in children during the COVID-19 pandemic. The reduced parental awareness of the emotional burden imposed by the pandemic on children indicates the need to better consider how epidemics affect children's mental health and to develop adequate preventive strategies to support them in these exceptional times.","Renzi, Conte, Tambelli","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10112171","20221111","COVID-19 pandemic; alexithymia; children; internalizing/externalizing symptoms; parents; somatic symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41086,""
"Older Adults and Positive Mental Health during the Second and Sixth COVID-19 Waves in Spain","The spread of the COVID-19 virus was a worldwide phenomenon, which was unprecedented in modern times. The restriction measures can be perceived as a heavy burden for mental health during this period, particularly for some groups. The aim of this study is to examine a positive mental health model across ages, where a moderated mediation model is proposed involving sex differences and confidence in coping with COVID-19. Two independent samples were studied during the second and sixth waves in Spain: <i>n</i> = 2861 and <i>n</i> = 2462, respectively. The main conclusions can be described as follows: (i) while age was not related to mental health during the second wave, a positive relationship was found between it and the sixth one; (ii) age was positively related to the confidence in coping with COVID-19 during both of the waves; (iii) women showed worse scores for the variables in the study than the men did during the second wave, but this pattern was reversed in the sixth one; (iv) after a moderated mediation model on the relationship between age and positive mental health in terms of confidence in coping with COVID-19 and sex, an interaction was found for the second wave but not for the sixth one. These results suggest that older adults and women would develop more strategies and resources for a positive mental health across time.","Moret-Tatay, Cloquell-Lozano, PÃƒÂ©rez-Bermejo, Arteaga-Moreno","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10112159","20221111","COVID-19; ageing; coping; positive mental health; sex differences","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41087,""
"""Freedom and Dignity Are Worth More than Life"": The Dramatic Suicide of an Anti-Vax Man","Since the beginning of the COVID-19 public health emergency, we have witnessed an increase in psychiatric problems and pathologies, such as depression, anxiety, isolation, posttraumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, and burnout. The world's collective sentiment finally turned toward optimism after authorization was granted for the COVID-19 vaccines' emergency use by the FDA in December 2020. With the increase in vaccine coverage in Western countries, case counts and deaths gradually plummeted while activity restrictions were progressively lifted. At the same time, however, a new COVID-19-related public health issue has arisen, as a substantial number of eligible individuals refused vaccination. Behaviors assumed by the so-called anti-vax people in manifesting their own opposition towards COVID-19 vaccination are various, and sometimes assume the forms of dramatic gestures with symbolic value, such as suicide. Here, we present the case of a healthy, convinced anti-vax, 58-year-old man, who allowed himself to be run over by a moving train in the presence of eyewitnesses, bringing with him a demonstrative note of his reasons. The present article aims to raise awareness against the social and psychological impact of COVID-19 vaccination refusal and to point out the need of a specific support net to avoid the spread of psychological impairment, social isolation and suicidal behaviors among the ""anti-vax community"".","Sablone, Spagnolo, Macorano, Ciavarella, Pascale, Strisciullo, Introna, Di Fazio","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10112141","20221111","anti-vax; forensic pathology; forensic psychiatry; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41088,""
"The Trap of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Italian Adolescents Fare Well at First, Maybe Thanks to Protective Trait Expression","Abundant research indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic has been negatively affecting mental health in adolescence. Few works, however, benefit from data from the same sample before and after the onset of the pandemic. The present longitudinal study involved a non-clinical group of 136 Italian adolescents (M<sub>age</sub> = 16.3 years Ã‚Â± 1.08, 67% girls) to investigate their psychological response to the first lockdown and explore the role of a protective trait (i.e., Positivity) in moderating the effect of Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU) on internalizing symptoms before and during the COVID-19 outbreak. Participants completed self-report questionnaires assessing psychopathological symptoms, psychological well-being, IU, and Positivity on three separate occasions: October 2019 (T1), January 2020 (T2), and April 2020 (T3). The results showed that internalizing and externalizing symptoms as well as psychological well-being did not vary significantly over time. Positivity was found to significantly moderate the relationship between IU and internalizing symptoms at T3 (i.e., during the COVID-19 lockdown) only. Overall, our findings suggest that the teenagers' good adjustment to the initial phase of the pandemic might have been associated with the enhanced weight of the Positivity trait, which may have encouraged a positive attitude towards self, life, and the future.","Malerba, Iannattone, Casano, Lauriola, Bottesi","https://doi.org/10.3390/children9111631","20221111","COVID-19; adolescence; intolerance of uncertainty; longitudinal study; positivity; psychological adjustment; psychopathological symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41089,""
"Phenotypical and Functional Alteration of ÃŽÂ³ÃŽÂ´ T Lymphocytes in COVID-19 Patients: Reversal by Statins","(1) Background: statins have been considered an attractive class of drugs in the pharmacological setting of COVID-19 due to their pleiotropic properties and their use correlates with decreased mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, it is well known that statins, which block the mevalonate pathway, affect ÃŽÂ³ÃŽÂ´ T lymphocyte activation. As ÃŽÂ³ÃŽÂ´ T cells participate in the inflammatory process of COVID-19, we have investigated the therapeutical potential of statins as a tool to inhibit ÃŽÂ³ÃŽÂ´ T cell pro-inflammatory activities; (2) Methods: we harvested peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from COVID-19 patients with mild clinical manifestations, COVID-19 recovered patients, and healthy controls. We performed ex vivo flow cytometry analysis to study ÃŽÂ³ÃŽÂ´ T cell frequency, phenotype, and exhaustion status. PBMCs were treated with Atorvastatin followed by non-specific and specific stimulation, to evaluate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines; (3) Results: COVID-19 patients had a lower frequency of circulating VÃŽÂ´2+ T lymphocytes but showed a pronounced pro-inflammatory profile, which was inhibited by in vitro treatment with statins; (4) Conclusions: the in vitro capacity of statins to inhibit VÃŽÂ´2+ T lymphocytes in COVID-19 patients highlights a new potential biological function of these drugs and supports their therapeutical use in these patients.","Di Simone, Corsale, Lo Presti, Scichilone, Picone, Giannitrapani, Dieli, Meraviglia","https://doi.org/10.3390/cells11213449","20221114","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2 infection; mevalonate pathway; statin; ÃŽÂ³ÃŽÂ´ T cells; Humans; Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta; T-Lymphocyte Subsets; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Leukocytes, Mononuclear; COVID-19","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41090,""
"Content of Essential Trace Elements in the Hair of Residents of the Caspian Region of the Republic of Kazakhstan Who Recovered from COVID-19","This study aimed to investigate the content of essential elements in the hair of unvaccinated residents of the Caspian region who recovered from COVID-19. This cross-sectional study involved 260 unvaccinated permanent residents of Mangistau oblast aged 18-60. The diagnosis and severity of COVID-19 were based on clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory data, R-graph results, and oxygen saturation by the Clinical Protocol of the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry determined the content of trace elements cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), iodine (I), manganese (Mn), selenium (Se), and zinc (Zn). The content of Cr (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05), Cu (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05), Fe (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001), I (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05), Mn (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001), and Zn (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05) in the hair of individuals who had a coronavirus infection was lower than those who did not have this infection.

"Understanding the role of stress, personality and coping on learning motivation and mental health in university students during a pandemic","The aims explored the associations between stress, personality and coping on student mental health and compared defensive-pessimism and optimism as influences on learning motivation. Most research construes 'stress' as 'distress', with little attempt to measure the stress that enhances motivation and wellbeing. Undergraduate psychology students (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°162) were surveyed on student and pandemic-related stressors, personality, support, control, mental health and learning motivation. Overall, adverse mental health was high and the lack of motivation acute. While positive ratings of teaching and optimistic thinking were associated with good mental health, context control was key. Adverse ratings of teaching quality lowered learning motivation. Support and conscientiousness bolstered learning motivation and conscientiousness buffered against the adverse impact of stress on motivation. Openness was associated with the stress involved in learning. For those anxious-prone, defensive-pessimism was as effective as optimism was in stimulating learning motivation. Developing context control, support and strategies linked to personality could bolster student resilience during and post Covid-19.","Gibbons","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-022-00971-w","20221114","Control; Eustress; Learning motivation; Mental health; Pandemic-related stress; Personality; Stress; Support; Humans; Motivation; Universities; Mental Health; Pandemics; COVID-19; Personality; Adaptation, Psychological; Students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41092,""
"Assessing relational coordination and its impact on perceived mental health of students, teachers and staff in a clinical skills program during the COVID-19 pandemic","The global spread of the COVID-19 virus caused unprecedented interruptions in medical education. This paper evaluates Relational Coordination (RC): communicating and relating for task integration; between the distinct stakeholders responsible for scheduling,delivering and receiving clinical teaching in the wake of the pandemic. Using a cross-sectional design, the level of Relational Coordination was assessed between twelve groups within a Clinical Skills Program at a Medical School in the United Arab Emirates. It also measures three relevant mental health factors: namely, Job satisfaction, Work Engagement, and Burnout. Overall, RC scores were moderate (3.65 out of 5.00). Controlling for participants' position, RC was found to positively and significantly increase both job satisfaction (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.10, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and work engagement (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.78, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01)., Additionally, RC was significantly associated with lower burnout (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.56, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Fifty percent of participants experienced high job satisfaction, with a mean score of 5.0 out of 7.0, while 73% reported being enthusiastic about their job, with a mean score of 6.0 out of 7.0. About a third of participants (27%) reported feeling burnout. During times of disruption and crisis, medical education can benefit from higher levels of relational coordination. Our study shows the significant impact of relational coordination on mental health measures like job satisfaction and work engagement. To achieve the full potential and benefits of excellent levels of relational coordination in this program, we recommend six interventions focusing on improving communication, work processes, regular meetings, education innovations, capacity building, and the establishment of coaching and counseling programs for students and faculty.","Alfazari, Naim Ali, Alessa, Magzoub","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-022-03828-3","20221114","Burnout; COVID-19; Clinical skills; Job satisfaction; Medical education; Mental health; Relational coordination; Work engagement; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; COVID-19; Clinical Competence; Cross-Sectional Studies; Job Satisfaction; Burnout, Professional; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41093,""
"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-Related Stress and Menstrual Changes","To evaluate how stress related to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected women's menstrual cycles. We hypothesized that women with high levels of COVID-19-related stress would have more menstrual changes compared with those with lower levels of stress. Using a cross-sectional study design, we recruited a representative sample of U.S. adult women of reproductive age (18-45 years) using nonhormonal birth control to participate in an online REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture, Vanderbilt University) survey. COVID-19-related stress was assessed with the PSS-10-C (COVID-19 Pandemic-related Perceived Stress Scale) and dichotomized as low stress (scores lower than 25) and high stress (scores 25 or higher). Self-reported menstrual outcomes were identified as changes in cycle length, duration, or flow and increased frequency of spotting between cycles. We used Ãâ€¡2 and Fisher exact tests to compare differences in outcome between the two stress groups and logistic regression models for effect estimates. A total of 354 women of reproductive age across the United States completed both the menstrual and COVID-19-related stress components of our survey. More than half of these women reported at least one change in their menstrual cycles since the start of the pandemic (n=191), and 10.5% reported high COVID-19-related stress (n=37). Compared with those with low COVID-19-related stress, a greater proportion of women with high COVID-19-related stress reported changes in cycle length (shorter or longer; P=.008), changes in period duration (shorter or longer; P&lt;.001), heavier menstrual flow (P=.035), and increased frequency of spotting between cycles (P=.006) compared with prepandemic times. After adjusting for age, smoking history, obesity, education, and mental health history, high COVID-19-related stress was associated with increased odds of changes in menstrual cycle length (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.32; 95% CI 1.12-4.85), duration (aOR 2.38; 95% CI 1.14-4.98), and spotting (aOR 2.32; 95% CI 1.03-5.22). Our data also demonstrated a nonsignificant trend of heavier menstrual flow among women with high COVID-19-related stress (aOR 1.61; 95% CI 0.77-3.34). High COVID-19-related stress is associated with significant changes in menstrual cycle length, alterations in period duration, and increased intermenstrual spotting as compared with before the pandemic. Given that menstrual health is frequently an indicator of women's overall well-being, clinicians, researchers, and public health officials must consider the association between COVID-19-related stress and menstrual disturbances.","Anto-Ocrah, Valachovic, Chen, Tiffany, DeSplinter, Kaukeinen, Glantz, Hollenbach","https://doi.org/10.1097/AOG.0000000000005010","20221111","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41094,""
"Effectiveness and implementation of an online intervention (MINDxYOU) for reducing stress and promote mental health among healthcare workers in Spain: a study protocol for a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial","The World Health Organization has formally recognized that healthcare professionals are at risk of developing mental health problems; finding ways to reduce their stress is mandatory to improve both their quality of life and, indirectly, their job performance. In recent years, particularly since the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, there has been a proliferation of online interventions with promising results. The purpose of the present study is twofold: to test the effectiveness of an online, self-guided intervention, MINDxYOU, to reduce the stress levels of healthcare workers; and to conduct an implementation study of this intervention. Additionally, an economic evaluation of the intervention will be conducted. The current study has a hybrid effectiveness-implementation type 2 design. A stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design will be used, with a cohort of 180 healthcare workers recruited in two Spanish provinces (Malaga and Zaragoza). The recruitment stage will commence in October 2022. Frontline health workers who provide direct care to people in a hospital, primary care center, or nursing home setting in both regions will participate. The effectiveness of the intervention will be studied, with perceived stress as the main outcome (Perceived Stress Scale), while other psychopathological symptoms and process variables (e.g., mindfulness, compassion, resilience, and psychological flexibility) will be also assessed as secondary outcomes. The implementation study will include analysis of feasibility, acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, fidelity, penetration, and sustainability. The incremental costs and benefits, in terms of quality-adjusted life years, will be examined by means of cost-utility and cost-effectiveness analyses. MINDxYOU is designed to reduce healthcare workers' stress levels through the practice of mindfulness, acceptance, and compassion, with a special focus on how to apply these skills to healthy habits and considering the particular stressors that these professionals face on a daily basis. The present study will show how implementation studies are useful for establishing the framework in which to address barriers to and promote facilitators for acceptability, appropriateness, adoption, feasibility, fidelity, penetration, and sustainability of online interventions. The ultimate goal is to reduce the research-to-practice gap.

"Is self-reported depression, HIV status, COVID-19 health risk profile and SARS-CoV-2 exposure associated with difficulty in adhering to COVID-19 prevention measures among residents in West Africa?","The aim of this study was to determine whether self-reported depression, coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) health risk profile, HIV status, and SARS-CoV-2 exposure were associated with the use of COVID-19 prevention measures. This survey collected data electronically between June 29 and December 31, 2020 from a convenient sample of 5050 adults 18Ã‚Â years and above living in 12 West African countries. The dependent variables were: social distancing, working remotely, difficulty obtaining face masks and difficulty washing hands often. The independent variables were self-reported depression, having a health risk for COVID-19 (high, moderate and little/no risk), living with HIV and COVID-19 status (SARS-CoV-2 positive tests, having COVID-19 symptoms but not getting tested, having a close friend who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and knowing someone who died from COVID-19). Four binary logistic regression models were developed to model the associations between the dependent and independent variables, adjusting for socio-demographic variables (age, gender, educational status, employment status and living status). There were 2412 (47.8%) male participants and the mean (standard deviation) age was 36.94 (11.47) years. Respondents who reported depression had higher odds of working remotely (AOR: 1.341), and having difficulty obtaining face masks (AOR: 1.923;) and washing hands often (AOR: 1.263). People living with HIV had significantly lower odds of having difficulty washing hands often (AOR: 0.483). Respondents with moderate health risk for COVID-19 had significantly higher odds of social distancing (AOR: 1.144) and those with high health risk had difficulty obtaining face masks (AOR: 1.910). Respondents who had a close friend who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (AOR: 1.132) and knew someone who died of COVID-19 (AOR: 1.094) had significantly higher odds of social distancing. Those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 had significantly lower odds of social distancing (AOR: 0.629) and working remotely (AOR: 0.713).

"Association between change in suicidal ideation, and distinct symptoms of depression and sleep changes during COVID-19","COVID-19 has created a situation that has never been experienced before, challenging the mobilization of adaptive coping strategies. There has been a marked increase in suicides and suicidal ideation following the onset of COVID-19 likely reflecting the toll of the pandemic on mental health. The aim of our study to investigate the associations between depressive symptoms and distinct symptom clusters and lifestyle changes related to sleep, eating and physical activity and change in suicidal thoughts and thinking about death during the pandemic. Analyses involved data from the Hungarian part of the COMET-G (COVID-19 Mental health in Ternational for the General population) study, including 763 Hungarian adults, who completed a detailed questionnaire focusing on changes in behavior, lifestyle, activity and mental health during the pandemic. The dataset was analyzed using ordinal regression models adjusted for age and sex. Depression, as well as its symptom clusters, including anhedonia and depressed mood and somatic complaints had a significant, but small effect increasing suicidal ideation, while the effect of irritability and social relationship problems was more marked. In case of lifestyle factors no associations was found between change in eating habits or physical activity and change in suicidal ideations, however, sleeprelated changes were associated with a significant increase in suicidal thoughts during the pandemic. Our findings show that not all symptoms related to mood disturbance have an equally marked effect on suicidal ideating and thus suicide risk, emphasizing the role of detailed screening and evaluation even in subclinical populations in times of such crises, and also highlight the importance of considering sleep problems when evaluating suicide risk. Thus, our findings help identify relevant targets for screening and intervention in decreasing suicide risk during crises.

"Sex and Gender Impact Mental and Emotional Well-Being During COVID-19 Pandemic: A European Countries Experience","<b><i>Objective:</i></b> The COVID-19 pandemic influences mental health drastically. Therefore, our aim was to investigate whether biological sex and gender-related factors are associated with mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> The International COVID-19 Awareness and Responses Evaluation Study is an international multiwave cross-sectional observational cohort study of public awareness, attitudes, and responses to public health policies (www.mbmc- cmcm.ca/covid19). The study is led by the Montreal Behavioural Medicine Centre in collaboration with 200 international collaborators from 42 countries. It has received research ethics board approval from the ComitÃƒÂ© d'ÃƒÂ©thique de recherche du CIUSSS-NIM (Centre intÃƒÂ©grÃƒÂ© universitaire de santÃƒÂ© et de services sociaux du Nord- de-l'ÃƒÂ®le-de-MontrÃƒÂ©al), approval no.: 2020-2099/25-03-2020. Recruitment began on March 27, 2020, and the survey is available in 34 languages. The associations between biological sex, sociocultural gender, and mental health were assessed in multivariate logistic regression models only for the European population (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°12,300). <b><i>Results:</i></b> Positive correlations were found between female sex and ""feeling nervous, anxious or worried"" (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.2, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001, 95% CI 1.87-5.63) and ""feeling sad, depressed or hopeless"" (OR 1.8, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.031, CI 1.05-3.05).

"The effect of COVID-19 vaccination on the menstrual pattern and mental health of the medical students: A mixed-methods study from a low and middle-income country","To assess the effect of COVID-19 vaccination on menstrual patterns and mental health of medical students and to explore the students' perspective regarding this effect. This mixed-method study was conducted on the medical and dental students of the private and public sector institutions of Peshawar from September 2021 to March 2022. A Menstrual symptom questionnaire (MSQ) and hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) were used. This was followed by qualitative interviews with the students who faced problems in their menstruation after the COVID-19 vaccination. A total of 953 students were included, with a mean age of 20.67Ã‚Â±1. 56 years. More than half (n = 512, 53.7%) experienced menstrual cycle abnormalities post-vaccination. The majority having disturbances in their menstrual cycle had significantly higher levels of anxiety (p = 0.000). Results on the menstrual symptom questionnaire, anxiety, and depression subtype of HADS showed a negative and statistically significant relationship with changes after COVID-19 vaccination (p&amp;lt;0.05). In the qualitative interviews, 10 (58.8%) students each had problems with frequency and flow, followed by 7 (41.2%) students, who had dysmenorrhea. Seven (41.2%) consulted a gynecologist for management. The majority (n = 14, 82.4%) stated that these issues had an adverse impact on their mental health and almost half (n = 8, 47.1%) suggested consulting a gynecologist while facing such situations. This study showed the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine on women`s menstrual patterns and subsequent mental health status. Although the majority of the students experienced menstrual cycle abnormalities and subsequent mental health adversities post COVID-19 vaccination but these were temporary and self-limiting and were attributed to the psychological impact of the vaccination. Therefore, it is imperative to alert health care professionals about possible side effects and prior counseling is expected to play an important role in this context.","Kareem, Sethi, Inayat, Irfan","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0277288","20221114","Female; Humans; Young Adult; Adult; Menstruation; Mental Health; COVID-19 Vaccines; Students, Medical; COVID-19; Developing Countries; Cross-Sectional Studies; Vaccination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41100,""
"Psychological and quality of life effects of vaccination against COVID-19 in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases","To verify the psychological and quality of life benefits of vaccination against COVID-19 in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases. In this study, levels of psychological stress, psychopathological symptoms, quality of life, and satisfaction with life were compared in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases vaccinated against COVID-19 (<i>n</i> = 132) versus unvaccinated patients (<i>n</i> = 254). To this end, we used the <i>Perceived Stress Scale</i> (PSS), <i>Symptom Checklist-90-Revised</i> (SCL-90-R), <i>EUROQoL-5Q health questionnaire</i>, and <i>Satisfaction with Life Scale</i> (SWLS), respectively. Statistically significant differences were found with better scores in the vaccinated group in the following quality of life dimensions: mobility (<i>p</i> Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.010), domestic activities (<i>p</i> Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.004), pain/discomfort (<i>p</i> Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.001), and anxiety/depression (<i>p</i>Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.005). The scores were also significantly higher in the vaccinated group for the total values of quality of life (<i>p</i> Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.001), health status self-assessment on the EUROQoL-5Q (<i>p</i> Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.043), and satisfaction with life (<i>p</i> Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.015). In addition, the unvaccinated group presented higher scores with clinically pathological levels in depression and psychoticism for somatizations (<i>p</i> Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.006), depression (<i>p</i> Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.015), anxiety (<i>p</i> Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.003), and phobic anxiety (<i>p</i> Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.001). Finally, participants vaccinated with the complete regimen showed better levels of psychological well-being than those who were not vaccinated or those that had not completed the vaccination regimen. Our results reflect and confirm the positive effects reported elsewhere of the COVID-19 vaccine in autoimmune patients with systemic diseases, both in terms of quality and satisfaction with life as well as psychopathological symptoms and perceived stress. These benefits increased as the patients completed their vaccination schedule.","Montero-LÃƒÂ³pez, Peralta-RamÃƒÂ­rez, Ortego-Centeno, Callejas-Rubio, RÃƒÂ­os-FernÃƒÂ¡ndez, Santos-Ruiz","https://doi.org/10.1177/09612033221134203","20221110","Autoimmune diseases; covid-19; psychological status; quality of life; vaccine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41101,""
"Where there are challenges, there are opportunities: An undergraduate medical students' teaching concept for mental health in times of COVID-19","COVID-19 had a tremendous effect on medical education. Most teaching sessions had to be shifted online, posing additional stress and potential isolation on medical students. However, it also offered the promotion of innovative digital teaching concepts. In this article, an approach to undergraduate mental health training is presented and evaluated. The curriculum was designed according to Kern's six-step approach and consisted of asynchronous online material as well synchronous digital teaching and was accompanied by a plethora of newly developed teaching material (videos, fact sheets, etc.). Content covered the whole spectrum of diseases seen in a service of psychosomatic medicine and psychotherapy (i.e. anxiety, depression, trauma, somatoform and eating disorders, as well as motivational interviewing). Feedback from participants was collected, and exam results (written and practical) were compared to pre-COVID-19 times using t-tests for dependent and independent samples. Students were highly satisfied with the teaching (rating of 1.3 Ã‚Â± 0.6, n = 139 students). There was no significant difference from course evaluations before COVID-19 (1.5 Ã‚Â± 0.5, p &amp;gt; .05). The teaching also received an award in the students' competition ""best digital teaching concept in summer term 2020"". In the written exams, there was no significant difference between before COVID-19 (2.4 Ã‚Â± 0.45) and during COVID-19 times (1.6 Ã‚Â± 0.39; p &amp;gt; .05). In the practical objective structured clinical examination (OSCE), there was also no significant difference between students' judgement of the difficulty of the station (1.9 Ã‚Â± 0.22 vs 1.9 Ã‚Â± 0.31; p &amp;gt; .05) or how well-prepared they felt for the exam (2.0 Ã‚Â± 0.24 vs 2.0 Ã‚Â± 0.31; p &amp;gt; .05). However, there was a significant difference in terms of grades, with the pre-COVID-19 grades being significantly better (2.7 Ã‚Â± 0.37 vs 2.0 Ã‚Â± 0.44; p &amp;lt; .05), which reflects the difficulty of transferring practical skills training to an online setting. Students particularly valued the possibility of self-directed learning combined with personal guidance by departmental experts, reflecting the importance of wellbeing-centred medical education. The pandemic triggered overnight challenges for teaching mental health that may also offer the opportunity to think about worldwide teaching standards with easily accessible material and courses online. This may offer the opportunity to enthral medical students to become mental health specialists themselves.","Herrmann-Werner, Erschens, Zipfel, Festl-Wietek","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0277525","20221114","Humans; Students, Medical; COVID-19; Mental Health; Clinical Competence; Education, Medical, Undergraduate","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41102,""
"The psychological distress and suicide-related ideation in hospital workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: Second results from repeated cross-sectional surveys","The COVID-19 pandemic has been affecting the mental health of hospital workers. During the prolonged pandemic, hospital workers may experience much more severe psychological distress, leading to an increased risk of suicide. This study aimed to investigate changes in psychological effects on hospital workers over 12 months from the beginning of the pandemic and clarify factors associated with psychological distress and suicide-related ideation 1-year after the pandemic's beginning. These repeated, cross-sectional surveys collected demographic, mental health, and stress-related data from workers in 2 hospitals in Yokohama, Japan. The first survey, conducted in March-April 2020, contained the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) assessing general distress and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) assessing event-related distress. In the second survey in March 2021, hospital workers at the same two hospitals were reassessed using the same questionnaire, and Item 9 of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was added to assess their suicide-related ideation. The findings of the first and second surveys revealed that the average score of GHQ-12 (3.08 and 3.73, respectively), the IES-R total score (6.8 and 12.12, respectively), and the prevalence rates of severe general distress (35.0% and 44.0%, respectively) and severe event-related distress (7.0% and 17.1%, respectively) deteriorated. The second survey showed that 8.6% of the hospital workers were experiencing suicide-related ideation. Both the general and event-related distress were associated with suicide-related ideation. In these surveys, mental health outcomes among the hospital workers deteriorated over one year from the pandemic's beginning, and their severe psychological distress was the risk factor for the suicide-related ideation. Further studies are needed to compare the psychological effects on hospital workers during and after the prolonged pandemic and to explore appropriate measures to support hospital workers' mental health.","Ide, Asami, Suda, Yoshimi, Fujita, Shiraishi, Nomoto, Miyauchi, Roppongi, Furuno, Watanabe, Shimada, Kaneko, Saigusa, Kubota, Kato, Odawara, Hishimoto","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0277174","20221114","Humans; COVID-19; Pandemics; Cross-Sectional Studies; Stress, Psychological; Psychological Distress; Surveys and Questionnaires; Suicide; Hospitals","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41103,""
"Post-COVID-19-associated morbidity in children, adolescents, and adults: A matched cohort study including more than 157,000 individuals with COVID-19 in Germany","Long-term health sequelae of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) are a major public health concern. However, evidence on post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (post-COVID-19) is still limited, particularly for children and adolescents. Utilizing comprehensive healthcare data on approximately 46% of the German population, we investigated post-COVID-19-associated morbidity in children/adolescents and adults. We used routine data from German statutory health insurance organizations covering the period between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2020. The base population included all individuals insured for at least 1 day in 2020. Based on documented diagnoses, we identified individuals with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 through June 30, 2020. A control cohort was assigned using 1:5 exact matching on age and sex, and propensity score matching on preexisting medical conditions. The date of COVID-19 diagnosis was used as index date for both cohorts, which were followed for incident morbidity outcomes documented in the second quarter after index date or later.Overall, 96 prespecified outcomes were aggregated into 13 diagnosis/symptom complexes and 3 domains (physical health, mental health, and physical/mental overlap domain). We used Poisson regression to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). The study population included 11,950 children/adolescents (48.1% female, 67.2% aged between 0 and 11 years) and 145,184 adults (60.2% female, 51.1% aged between 18 and 49 years). The mean follow-up time was 236 days (standard deviation (SD) = 44 days, range = 121 to 339 days) in children/adolescents and 254 days (SD = 36 days, range = 93 to 340 days) in adults. COVID-19 and control cohort were well balanced regarding covariates. The specific outcomes with the highest IRR and an incidence rate (IR) of at least 1/100 person-years in the COVID-19 cohort in children and adolescents were malaise/fatigue/exhaustion (IRR: 2.28, 95% CI: 1.71 to 3.06, p &lt; 0.01, IR COVID-19: 12.58, IR Control: 5.51), cough (IRR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.48 to 2.04, p &lt; 0.01, IR COVID-19: 36.56, IR Control: 21.06), and throat/chest pain (IRR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.39 to 2.12, p &lt; 0.01, IR COVID-19: 20.01, IR Control: 11.66). In adults, these included disturbances of smell and taste (IRR: 6.69, 95% CI: 5.88 to 7.60, p &lt; 0.01, IR COVID-19: 12.42, IR Control: 1.86), fever (IRR: 3.33, 95% CI: 3.01 to 3.68, p &lt; 0.01, IR COVID-19: 11.53, IR Control: 3.46), and dyspnea (IRR: 2.88, 95% CI: 2.74 to 3.02, p &lt; 0.01, IR COVID-19: 43.91, IR Control: 15.27). For all health outcomes combined, IRs per 1,000 person-years in the COVID-19 cohort were significantly higher than those in the control cohort in both children/adolescents (IRR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.25 to 1.35, p &lt; 0.01, IR COVID-19: 436.91, IR Control: 335.98) and adults (IRR: 1.33, 95% CI: 1.31 to 1.34, p &lt; 0.01, IR COVID-19: 615.82, IR Control: 464.15). The relative magnitude of increased documented morbidity was similar for the physical, mental, and physical/mental overlap domain. In the COVID-19 cohort, IRs were significantly higher in all 13 diagnosis/symptom complexes in adults and in 10 diagnosis/symptom complexes in children/adolescents. IRR estimates were similar for age groups 0 to 11 and 12 to 17. IRs in children/adolescents were consistently lower than those in adults. Limitations of our study include potentially unmeasured confounding and detection bias. In this retrospective matched cohort study, we observed significant new onset morbidity in children, adolescents, and adults across 13 prespecified diagnosis/symptom complexes, following COVID-19 infection. These findings expand the existing available evidence on post-COVID-19 conditions in younger age groups and confirm previous findings in adults.

"Who develops pandemic fatigue? Insights from Latent Class Analysis","According to the World Health Organization, pandemic fatigue poses a serious threat for managing COVID-19. Pandemic fatigue is characterized by progressive decline in adherence to social distancing (SDIS) guidelines, and is thought to be associated with pandemic-related emotional burnout. Little is known about the nature of pandemic fatigue; for example, it is unclear who is most likely to develop pandemic fatigue. We sought to evaluate this issue based on data from 5,812 American and Canadian adults recruited during the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Past-year decline in adherence to SDIS had a categorical latent structure according to Latent Class Analysis, consisting of a group adherent to SDIS (Class 1: 92% of the sample) and a group reporting a progressive decline in adherence to SDIS (i.e., pandemic fatigue; Class 2: 8% of the sample). Class 2, compared to Class 1, was associated with greater pandemic-related burnout, pessimism, and apathy about the COVID-19 pandemic. They also tended to be younger, perceived themselves to be more affluent, tended to have greater levels of narcissism, entitlement, and gregariousness, and were more likely to report having been previously infected with SARSCOV2, which they regarded as an exaggerated threat. People in Class 2 also self-reported higher levels of pandemic-related stress, anxiety, and depression, and described making active efforts at coping with SDIS restrictions, which they perceived as unnecessary and stressful. People in Class 1 generally reported that they engaged in SDIS for the benefit of themselves and their community, although 35% of this class also feared they would be publicly shamed if they did not comply with SDIS guidelines. The findings suggest that pandemic fatigue affects a substantial minority of people and even many SDIS-adherent people experience emotionally adverse effects (i.e., fear of being shamed). Implications for the future of SDIS are discussed.","Taylor, Rachor, Asmundson","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0276791","20221114","Adult; Humans; United States; Pandemics; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Latent Class Analysis; RNA, Viral; Canada; Fatigue; Burnout, Professional","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41105,""
"Impact of COVID-19 discrimination fear on psychological distress among East Asian college students: The moderating role of emotion regulation","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to heightened discrimination and xenophobia against Asian Americans in the United States. Mainstream media have reported that East Asian individuals are increasingly fearful of becoming victims of anti-Asian discrimination. However, few studies have examined the fear of experiencing discrimination, especially among youths and young adults. This study examined the extent to which East Asian first-year college students in the United States have experienced the fear of anti-Asian discrimination during the pandemic, its impact on anxiety and depressive symptoms, and whether emotion regulation strategies moderated the relationship between the fear of discrimination and psychological distress. Participants completed a cross-sectional online survey (<i>n</i> = 139; <i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 17.90; <i>SD</i> = 0.62; 64% female) and reported high levels of fears, with 40.3% and 29.5% of the participants endorsing ""quite a bit"" or ""extremely"" on worries about being harassed or not feeling physically safe due to COVID-19, respectively. Female students endorsed higher levels of fear than male students. We found that cognitive reappraisal moderated the relations between the fear of discrimination and depressive symptoms, such that higher levels of cognitive reappraisal buffered the detrimental effects of this fear on depressive symptoms. Similarly, emotion suppression moderated the relations between the fear of discrimination and distress, such that higher levels of emotion suppression were associated with lower levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms. These results highlight the need for university administrators and faculty to address East Asian first-year college students' high levels of fears related to experiencing anti-Asian discrimination during the pandemic.

"Psychological outcomes and culturally relevant moderators associated with events of discrimination among Asian American adults","Incidents of discrimination against Asian Americans have increased in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aims of this study are to (a) examine the overall psychological impact of incidents of discrimination on Asian Americans adults, (b) identify whether East Asians experience worse psychological outcomes following experiences of discrimination compared to other Asian Americans, and (c) identify culturally relevant factors that moderate the relationship between incidents of discrimination and psychological outcomes. Two hundred eighty-nine participants who identified racially as Asian American (<i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 33.1 years, Ã‚Â±10.5 <i>SD</i>, 57.1% male, and 54.3% East Asian) completed an online survey including measures of demographics, psychological outcomes, culturally relevant factors (e.g., acculturative stress, collective self-esteem), and racial discrimination. We found that, overall, experiencing increased frequency of discrimination related to more depressive symptoms and alcohol use (<i>p</i>s &lt; .05). When comparing Asian subgroups (East Asian vs. other Asian), there were no significantly different relationships between discrimination frequency and attribution to race on psychological outcomes (<i>p</i>s &gt; .098). Collective self-esteem (<i>p</i> = .041) weakened, while acculturative stress strengthened (<i>p</i> &lt; .001) the relationship between discrimination frequency and alcohol use; collective self-esteem weakened the relationship between attribution to race and social anxiety (<i>p</i> = .021); and internalized racism weakened the relationship between discrimination frequency and depression (<i>p</i> = .038). We identified moderators of the relationship between experiences of discrimination and psychological outcomes in Asian Americans. Because the moderators held for all Asian groups under study, they are strong candidates for points of intervention to mitigate the harmful effects of discrimination for Asian Americans.

"Parents' emotion suppression exacerbates the effect of COVID-19 stress on youth internalizing symptomatology","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in heightened stress for families in the United States, and exposure to pandemic-related stress has been found to confer risk for mental health problems among both children and parents. To isolate risk and protective factors for children living through the ongoing pandemic, several studies have begun to examine family-level factors that may exacerbate or buffer the impact of exposure to COVID-19-related stress on children's symptomatology. Building upon the extant literature documenting associations between parents' emotion regulation and children's mental health, especially during times of stress, the present study aimed to examine parents' regulation of their own emotions as a potential moderator of the association between children's exposure to family-level COVID-19-related stress and internalizing and externalizing problems. Results suggest that parents' regulation of their own emotions using expressive suppression, specifically, may exacerbate the effect of exposure to pandemic-related stress on children's internalizing problems, but not externalizing problems. Results highlight the importance of prioritizing parents' mental health and self-regulation in prevention and intervention efforts aimed at improving family-wide mental health outcomes during public health crises that place family systems under significant stress.

"Anxiety and depressive symptoms, and positive and negative couple interactions among postpartum mothers and fathers before and during the COVID-19 pandemic","The negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and couples' relationships may be particularly higher in vulnerable groups, including mothers and fathers during the transition to parenthood. This study compared mental health symptoms and couples' relationship quality among parents who were at 6 months postpartum before or during the COVID-19 pandemic. A sample of 109 primiparous mothers and fathers recruited before the COVID-19 pandemic were assessed at 6 months postpartum, before (<i>n</i> = 69) or during the COVID-19 pandemic (<i>n</i> = 40). Participants completed self-reported measures of anxiety and depressive symptoms, and couples' positive and negative interactions. Mothers and fathers assessed at 6 months postpartum during the COVID-19 pandemic reported more depressive symptoms and more couples' negative interactions than mothers and fathers assessed at 6 months postpartum before the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings suggested the COVID-19 pandemic may have negatively impacted the adjustment of postpartum parents, but causality cannot be determined from these cross-sectional analyses. The COVID-19 pandemic may be an adverse condition for parents' postnatal mental health and couples' relationships. Findings contribute to the literature on the transition to parenthood by providing evidence on the burden that the COVID-19 pandemic can add to the already stressful experiences associated with the postpartum period.

"Mental health chatbot for young adults with depressive symptoms: a single-blind, three-arm, randomized controlled trial","Depression has a high prevalence among young adults, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, mental health services remain scarce and underutilized worldwide. Mental health chatbots are a novel digital technology to provide fully automated intervention for depressive symptoms. The purpose of this study is to test the clinical effectiveness and nonclinical performance of the cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based mental health chatbot (XiaoE) for young adults with depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. In a single-blind, three-arm, randomized controlled trial, participants manifesting depressive symptoms recruited from a Chinese university were randomly assigned to a mental health chatbot (XiaoE; n = 49), an e-book (n = 49), or a general chatbot (Xiaoai; n = 50) in a ratio of 1:1:1. Participants received a one-week intervention. The primary outcome was the reduction of depressive symptoms according to the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) at 1 week later (T1) and 1 month later (T2). Both intention-to-treat analyses and per-protocol analyses were conducted under analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models adjusting for baseline data. Controlled multiple imputation and ÃŽÂ´-based sensitivity analysis were performed for missing data. The secondary outcomes were the level of working alliance measured using the Working Alliance Questionnaire (WAQ), usability measured using the Usability Metric for User Experience-LITE (UMUX-LITE), and acceptability measured using the Acceptability Scale (AS). Participants were on average 18.78 years old, 37% female. The mean score of baseline PHQ-9 was 10.02 (SD 3.18; range: 2-19). Intent-to-treat analysis revealed a lower PHQ-9 scores in participants in XiaoE condition compared with participants in ebook condition and Xiaoai condition at both T1 (F2, 136 = 17.011, P &lt; .001, d = 0.51) and T2 (F2, 136 = 5.477, P= .005, d = 0.31). Better working alliance (WAQ, F2, 145 = 3.407, P = .036) and acceptability (AS, F2, 145 = 4.322, P = .015) was discovered with XiaoE, while no significant difference among arms was found on usability (UMUX-LITE, F2, 145 = 0.968, P = .382). A CBT-based chatbot provides a feasible and engaging digital therapeutic that allows easy accessibility and self-guided mental health assistance for young adults with depressive symptoms. A systematic evaluation of nonclinical metrics for mental health chatbot is established in this study. In the future, concern with both clinical outcomes and nonclinical metrics is necessary to explore the mechanism by which the mental health chatbots work on patients. Further evidence is required to confirm the long-term effectiveness via trails replicated with a longer dose as well as exploration on its stronger efficacy in comparison with other active controls.

"Transition to Inpatient Telepsychiatry Services and Impact on Quality of Care","Demands for telepsychiatry have increased due to the challenges of COVID-19. The global pandemic caused a significant increase in anxiety and depression and a worsening of eating disorder symptoms, while the implementation of social distancing both exacerbated these mental health issues and disrupted the in-person delivery of mental health services. Rapid adaptation of telepsychiatry in the acute inpatient setting has been reported with favorable outcomes in patient experiences. This article reports our experience with a transition to telepsychiatry services on an acute eating disorder unit and the impact on quality of care. Forty-two inpatients on an eating disorders unit completed 410 surveys evaluating their experience with telepsychiatry. Simultaneously, surveys were distributed to physicians to identify technical and connectivity issues. Our experience showed that patients on an eating disorder unit, who had an average length of stay of 22 days, were very satisfied with telepsychiatry, with few technical or safety issues.","Khurana, Pertschuk, Newton, Klein, Du","https://doi.org/10.1097/PRA.0000000000000675","20221114","Humans; Inpatients; Telemedicine; COVID-19; Psychiatry; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41111,""
"Mental Health Outcomes for Youths With Public Versus Private Health Insurance Attending a Telehealth Intensive Outpatient Program: Quality Improvement Analysis","COVID-19 exacerbated a growing mental health crisis among youths and young adults, worsened by a lack of existing in-person options for high-acuity care. The emergence and growth of remote intensive outpatient programs (IOPs) is a solution to overcome geographic limitations to care. However, it remains unclear whether remote IOPs engender equivalent clinical outcomes among youths with public insurance (eg, Medicaid) versus private insurance (eg, commercial) given the disparities found in previous research on place-based treatment in both clinical and engagement outcomes. This analysis sought to establish, as part of ongoing quality improvement efforts, whether engagement and clinical outcomes among adolescents and young adults attending remote IOP treatment differed between youths with public and those with private insurance. The identification of disparities by payer type was used to inform programmatic decisions within the remote IOP system for which this quality improvement analysis was conducted. Pearson chi-square analyses and independent 2-tailed t tests were used to establish that the 2 groups defined by insurance type were equivalent on clinical outcomes (depression, suicidal ideation, and nonsuicidal self-injury [NSSI]) at intake and compare changes in clinical outcomes. McNemar chi-square analyses and repeated-measure 2-tailed t tests were used to assess changes in clinical outcomes between intake and discharge in the sample overall. In total, 495 clients who attended the remote IOP for youths and young adults in 14 states participated in Ã¢â€°Â¥7 treatment sessions, and completed intake and discharge surveys between July 2021 and April 2022 were included in the analysis. Overall, the youths and young adults in the remote IOP attended a median of 91% of their scheduled group sessions (mean 85.9%, SD 16.48%) and reported significantly fewer depressive symptoms at discharge (t<sub>447</sub>=12.51; P&lt;.001). McNemar chi-square tests of change indicated significant reductions from intake to discharge in suicidal ideation (N=470, Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub>=104.4; P&lt;.001), with nearly three-quarters of youths who reported active suicidal ideation at intake (200/468, 42.7%) no longer reporting it at discharge (142/200, 71%), and in NSSI (N=430, Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub>=40.7; P&lt;.001), with more than half of youths who reported NSSI at intake (205/428, 47.9%) reporting lower self-harm at discharge (119/205, 58%). No significant differences emerged by insurance type in attendance (median public 89%, median private 92%; P=.10), length of stay (t<sub>416</sub>=-0.35; P=.73), or reductions in clinical outcomes (depressive symptom severity: t<sub>444</sub>=-0.87 and P=.38; active suicidal ideation: N=200, Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub>=0.6 and P=.49; NSSI frequency: t<sub>426</sub>=-0.98 and P=.33). Our findings suggest that youths and young adults who participated in remote IOP had significant reductions in depression, suicidal ideation, and NSSI. Given access to the same remote high-acuity care, youths and young adults on both public and private insurance engaged in programming at comparable rates and achieved similar improvements in clinical outcomes.","Gliske, Berry, Ballard, Evans-Chase, Solomon, Fenkel","https://doi.org/10.2196/41721","20221111","depression; health outcome; intensive outpatient; mental health; mental health treatment; outcome monitoring; outpatient program; patient outcome; quality improvement; remote outpatient; routine outcome monitoring; suicidal ideation; telehealth; telemedicine; telepsychiatry; young adult; youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41112,""
"Digital Technology in Psychiatry: Survey Study of Clinicians","Digital technology has the potentialÃ‚Â to transform psychiatry, but its adoption has beenÃ‚Â limited. The proliferation of telepsychiatry during the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the urgency of optimizing technology for clinical practice. Understanding clinician attitudes and preferences is crucial toÃ‚Â effective implementation and patient benefit. Our objective was to elicit clinician perspectives on emerging digital technology. Clinicians in a large psychiatry department (inpatient and outpatient) were invited to complete a web-based survey about their attitudes toward digital technology in practice, focusing on implementation, clinical benefits, and expectations about patients' attitudes. The survey consisted of 23 questions that could be answered on either a 3-point or 5-point Likert scale. We report the frequencies and percentages of responses. In total, 139 clinicians completed the survey-they represent a variety of years of experience, credentials, and diagnostic subspecialties (response rate 69.5%). Overall, 83.4% (n=116) of them stated that digital data could improve their practice, and 23.0% (n=32) of responders reported that they had viewed patients' profiles on social media. Among anticipated benefits, clinicians rated symptom self-tracking (n=101, 72.7%) as well as clinical intervention support (n=90, 64.7%) as most promising. Among anticipated challenges, clinicians mostly expressed concerns over greater time demand (n=123, 88.5%) and whether digital data would be actionable (n=107, 77%). Furthermore, 95.0% (n=132) of clinicians expected their patients to share digital data. Overall, clinicians reported a positive attitude toward the use of digital data to not only improve patient outcomes but also highlight significant barriers that implementation would need to overcome. Although clinicians' self-reported attitudes about digital technology may not necessarily translate into behavior, our results suggest that technologies that reduce clinician burden and are easily interpretable have the greatest likelihood of uptake.","Sterling, Sobolev, Van Meter, Guinart, Birnbaum, Rubio, Kane","https://doi.org/10.2196/33676","20221111","clinician perspectives; clinicians; digital health; digital phenotype; digital psychiatry; mental health; passive monitoring technology; physicians; psychiatrists; psychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41113,""

Older age and Medicare coverage were associated with having any telemedicine use. Older and White patients were more likely to have high telemedicine use. Uninsured patients were less likely to have high telemedicine use. Patients with increased health care utilization in the pre-COVID-19 period and those with hypertension, diabetes, substance use disorders, and depression were more likely to have high telemedicine engagement. <b><i>Discussion:</i></b> Chronic conditions, older patients, and White patients compared with Latinx patients, were associated with high telemedicine engagement after adjusting for prior health care utilization. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Equity-focused approaches to telemedicine clinical strategies are needed for safety-net populations.

"Increased Levels of Autoantibodies against ROS-Modified Proteins in Depressed Individuals with Decrease in Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 Antigen (S1-RBD)","Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease management is highly dependent on the immune status of the infected individual. An increase in the incidence of depression has been observed during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Autoantibodies against in vitro reactive oxygen species (ROS) modified BSA and Lys as well as antibodies against receptor binding domain subunit S1 (S1-RBD) (S1-RBD-Abs) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were estimated using direct binding and competition ELISA. Serum samples were also tested for fasting blood glucose (FBG), malondialdehyde (MDA), carbonyl content (CC), interferon-gamma (IFN-ÃŽÂ³) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-ÃŽÂ±). Significant structural changes were observed in ROS modified BSA and Lys. Female depressed subjects who were also smokers (F-D-S) showed the highest levels of oxidative stress (MDA and CC levels). Similarly, increased levels of autoantibodies against ROS modified proteins were detected in F-D-S subjects, in males who were depressed and in smokers (M-D-S) compared to the other subjects from the rest of the groups. However, contrary to this observation, levels of S1-RBD-Abs were found to be lowest in the F-D-S and M-D-S groups. During the pandemic, large numbers of individuals have experienced depression, which may induce excessive oxidative stress, causing modifications in circulatory proteins. Thus, the formation of neo-antigens is induced, which lead to the generation of autoantibodies. The concomitant effect of increased autoantibodies with elevated levels of IFN-ÃŽÂ³ and TNF-ÃŽÂ± possibly tilt the immune balance toward autoantibody generation rather than the formation of S1-RBD-Abs. Thus, it is important to identify individuals who are at risk of depression to determine immune status and facilitate the better management of COVID-19.","Sherwani, Raafat, Rajendrasozhan, Khan, Saleem, Husain, Khan, Alam, Khan","https://doi.org/10.3390/cimb44110358","20221111","COVID-19; ELISA; ROS; S1-RBD; S1-RBD-Abs; SARS-CoV-2; autoantibody; depression; oxidative stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41115,""
"Emotional State of Teachers and University Administrative Staff in the Return to Face-to-Face Mode","Social distancing and security measures have contained the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this, the return to face-to-face activities is necessary for specific companies, and some higher education institutions have already done so. The various disorders that this new reality could generate have motivated the present study, which aims to analyze the emotional state of teachers and administrative staff. The instrument used was the abbreviated depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS-21), with an internal consistency index of 0.87. The methodology was based on applying a survey to 202 participants from Quito, Ecuador. The sample consisted of 97 men and 105 women aged between 23 and 59 years. A quantitative and cross-sectional design was used in this research. The results show that 40.1% of the respondents presented anxiety, 36.63% depression, and 38.61% stress between mild and highly severe categories. Additionally, when analyzing the depression, anxiety, and stress levels compared to productivity variables, we found that five disorders, i.e., fear, anxiety, over reactivity, skeletal muscle effects, and dysphoria, directly affect productivity variables, such as performing simple tasks, performing difficult tasks, the number of products made, and the number of products rejected. Thus, returning to face-to-face mode has affected the emotional state of many people, showing differences according to the job position, with anxiety being the highest self-identified incidence rate.","Arias-Flores, Guadalupe-Lanas, PÃƒÂ©rez-Vega, Artola-JarrÃƒÂ­n, Cruz-CÃƒÂ¡rdenas","https://doi.org/10.3390/bs12110420","20221111","COVID-19; DASS-21; administrative staff; face-to-face education; teachers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41116,""
"Role of neuroinflammation mediated potential alterations in adult neurogenesis as a factor for neuropsychiatric symptoms in Post-Acute COVID-19 syndrome-A narrative review","Persistence of symptoms beyond the initial 3 to 4 weeks after infection is defined as post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS). A wide range of neuropsychiatric symptoms like anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, sleep disorders and cognitive disturbances have been observed in PACS. The review was conducted based on PRISMA-S guidelines for literature search strategy for systematic reviews. A cytokine storm in COVID-19 may cause a breach in the blood brain barrier leading to cytokine and SARS-CoV-2 entry into the brain. This triggers an immune response in the brain by activating microglia, astrocytes, and other immune cells leading to neuroinflammation. Various inflammatory biomarkers like inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, acute phase proteins and adhesion molecules have been implicated in psychiatric disorders and play a major role in the precipitation of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Impaired adult neurogenesis has been linked with a variety of disorders like depression, anxiety, cognitive decline, and dementia. Persistence of neuroinflammation was observed in COVID-19 survivors 3 months after recovery. Chronic neuroinflammation alters adult neurogenesis with pro-inflammatory cytokines supressing anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines favouring adult neurogenesis. Based on the prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms/disorders in PACS, there is more possibility for a potential impairment in adult neurogenesis in COVID-19 survivors. This narrative review aims to discuss the various neuroinflammatory processes during PACS and its effect on adult neurogenesis.","Saikarthik, Saraswathi, Alarifi, Al-Atram, Mickeymaray, Paramasivam, Shaikh, Jeraud, Alothaim","https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.14227","20221111","Astrocyte; COVID-19; Cytokine storm; Microglia; Neurogenesis; Neuroinflammation; Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41117,""
"Longitudinal development of depression and anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic in Germany: Findings from a population-based probability sample survey","The stress response to the COVID-19 pandemic might differ between early and later stages. Longitudinal data on the development of population mental health during COVID-19 pandemic is scarce. We have investigated mental health trajectories and predictors for change in a probability sample of the general population in Germany at the beginning and after 6 months of the pandemic. We conducted a longitudinal survey in a population-based probability sample of German adults. The current study analyzed data from a first assessment in May 2020 (T1; <i>N</i> = 1,412) and a second in November 2020 (T2; <i>N</i> = 743). Mental health was assessed in terms of anxiety and depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4). Mental health outcomes at T1 were compared with PHQ-4 norm data. Trajectories over time were investigated based on outcome classifications of PHQ-4 scores. Predictors of mental health outcomes and change were identified using multiple regression analysis. In spring 2020, participants showed significantly higher PHQ-4 scores as compared to the norm data, however, overall anxiety and depression remained low also 6 months later. 6.6% of respondents showed a mental health deterioration in autumn 2020, entering subclinical and clinical ranges, outweighing the proportion of people with improved outcomes. Sociodemographic variables associated with mental distress at T1 were mainly not predictive for change at T2. Even under prolonged pandemic-related stress, mental health remained mainly stable in the general population.

"COVID-19-related distress is associated with analogue PTSD symptoms after exposure to an analogue stressor","<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 outbreak in early 2020 was associated with an immediate increase in mental health problems in a significant percentage of the general population. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate how the COVID-19 pandemic - as a psychosocial stressor - affected the aetiological processes of mental disorders. Previous research has shown that stress potentiates associative (fear) learning and analogue symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and that analogue PTSD symptoms can emerge in response to associative learning. <b>Objective:</b> We investigated whether distress in response to the COVID-19 outbreak support the development of intrusions and rumination after exposure to a non-COVID-19-related analogue trauma. Moreover, we examined if these effects are mediated by the strength of associative learning during analogue trauma. <b>Method:</b> 122 undergraduate university students participated in an online experiment between March and July 2020. They completed questionnaires measuring distress and rumination related to the COVID-19 outbreak. On a subsequent day, they went through an associative learning task, in which neutral stimuli were paired with the appearance of a highly aversive film clip. Subjective ratings were assessed as indicators of associative learning. On the next day, participants documented film-related intrusions and rumination. <b>Results:</b> COVID-19-related distress but not rumination was associated with post-film intrusion and rumination load. These effects were mediated by associative learning. <b>Conclusions:</b> The current findings are in line with the assumptions that stress enhanced both associative learning and PTSD symptoms. Specifically, they indicate that prolonged psychosocial stress - like during the COVID-19 outbreak - is linked to individual differences in memory processing of aversive events. Further confirmatory research is needed to replicate these results. <b>Antecedentes:</b> El brote de COVID-19 a principios de 2020 se asociÃƒÂ³ con un aumento inmediato de problemas de salud mental en un porcentaje significativo de la poblaciÃƒÂ³n general.

Al dÃƒÂ­a siguiente, realizaron una tarea de aprendizaje asociativo, en la que se emparejaron estÃƒÂ­mulos neutrales con la exposiciÃƒÂ³n a un clip de pelÃƒÂ­cula altamente aversivo. Las calificaciones subjetivas se evaluaron como indicadores de aprendizaje asociativo. Al dÃƒÂ­a siguiente, los participantes documentaron intrusiones y rumiaciones relacionadas con la pelÃƒÂ­cula.<b>Resultados:</b> El malestar psicolÃƒÂ³gico relacionado con COVID-19, pero no la rumiaciÃƒÂ³n, se asociÃƒÂ³ con la intrusiÃƒÂ³n posterior a la pelÃƒÂ­cula y la carga de rumiaciÃƒÂ³n. Estos efectos fueron mediados por el aprendizaje asociativo.<b>Conclusiones:</b> Los hallazgos actuales estÃƒÂ¡n en lÃƒÂ­nea con las suposiciones de que el estrÃƒÂ©s potenciÃƒÂ³ tanto el aprendizaje asociativo como los sÃƒÂ­ntomas del TEPT. EspecÃƒÂ­ficamente, indican que el estrÃƒÂ©s psicosocial prolongado, como el ocurrido durante el brote de COVID-19, estÃƒÂ¡ relacionado con diferencias individuales en el procesamiento de la memoria de eventos aversivos. Se necesita mÃƒÂ¡s investigaciÃƒÂ³n confirmatoria para replicar estos resultados. <b>Ã¨Æ’Å’Ã¦â„¢Â¯Ã¯Â¼Å¡</b>2020 Ã¥Â¹Â´Ã¥Ë†ÂÃ§Å¡â€ž COVID-19 Ã§Ë†â€ Ã¥Ââ€˜Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã¥Â¾Ë†Ã¥Â¤Â§Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã©Æ’Â¨Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¨Ë†Â¬Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ§Â¾Â¤Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã©â€”Â®Ã©Â¢ËœÃ§Å¡â€žÃ§Â«â€¹Ã¥ÂÂ³Ã¥Â¢Å¾Ã¥Å Â Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥â€ºÂ Ã¦Â­Â¤Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¨â‚¬Æ’Ã¦Å¸Â¥ COVID-19 Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¤Â½Å“Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ¤Â¸â‚¬Ã§Â§ÂÃ§Â¤Â¾Ã¤Â¼Å¡Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¦Â¿â‚¬Ã¦ÂºÂÃ¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¥Â¦â€šÃ¤Â½â€¢Ã¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ§Â²Â¾Ã§Â¥Å¾Ã©Å¡Å“Ã§Â¢ÂÃ§Å¡â€žÃ§â€”â€¦Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã¨Â¿â€¡Ã§Â¨â€¹Ã¨â€¡Â³Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¦ÂÃ£â‚¬â€šÃ¥â€¦Ë†Ã¥â€°ÂÃ§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¨Â¡Â¨Ã¦ËœÅ½Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¦Â¿â‚¬Ã¤Â¼Å¡Ã¥Â¢Å¾Ã¥Â¼ÂºÃ¨Ââ€Ã¦Æ’Â³Ã¯Â¼Ë†Ã¦ÂÂÃ¦Æ’Â§Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã¤Â¹Â Ã¥â€™Å’Ã§Â±Â»Ã¤Â¼Â¼Ã¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¦Â¿â‚¬Ã©Å¡Å“Ã§Â¢Â (PTSD)Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã¤Â¸â€Ã§Â±Â»Ã¤Â¼Â¼ PTSD Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã¥ÂÂ¯Ã¨Æ’Â½Ã¤Â¼Å¡Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¨Ââ€Ã¦Æ’Â³Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã¤Â¹Â Ã¥ÂÅ¡Ã¥â€¡ÂºÃ¥ÂÂÃ¥Âºâ€Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§â€ºÂ®Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¯Â¼Å¡</b>Ã¦Ë†â€˜Ã¤Â»Â¬Ã¨â‚¬Æ’Ã¦Å¸Â¥Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¥Â¯Â¹ COVID-19 Ã§Ë†â€ Ã¥Ââ€˜Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Â²Â¾Ã§Â¥Å¾Ã§â€”â€ºÃ¨â€¹Â¦Ã¦ËœÂ¯Ã¥ÂÂ¦Ã¦â€Â¯Ã¦Å’ÂÃ©ÂÅ¾ COVID-19 Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã§Â±Â»Ã¤Â¼Â¼Ã¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã¦Å¡Â´Ã©Å“Â²Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã©â€”Â¯Ã¥â€¦Â¥Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥ÂÂÃ¥Ë†ÂÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¥Ââ€˜Ã¥Â±â€¢Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Â­Â¤Ã¥Â¤â€“Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¦Ë†â€˜Ã¤Â»Â¬Ã¨â‚¬Æ’Ã¦Å¸Â¥Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¨Â¿â„¢Ã¤Âºâ€ºÃ¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ¦ËœÂ¯Ã¥ÂÂ¦Ã§â€Â±Ã§Â±Â»Ã¤Â¼Â¼Ã¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¨Ââ€Ã¦Æ’Â³Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã¤Â¹Â Ã¥Â¼ÂºÃ¥ÂºÂ¦Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¤Â»â€¹Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â³â€¢Ã¯Â¼Å¡</b>122 Ã¥ÂÂÃ¦Å“Â¬Ã§Â§â€˜Ã§â€Å¸Ã¥Å“Â¨ 2020 Ã¥Â¹Â´ 3 Ã¦Å“Ë†Ã¨â€¡Â³ 7 Ã¦Å“Ë†Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¥Ââ€šÃ¥Å Â Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã©Â¡Â¹Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã§ÂºÂ¿Ã¥Â®Å¾Ã©ÂªÅ’Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¤Â»â€“Ã¤Â»Â¬Ã¥Â®Å’Ã¦Ë†ÂÃ¤Âºâ€ COVID-19 Ã§Ë†â€ Ã¥Ââ€˜Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã§Â²Â¾Ã§Â¥Å¾Ã§â€”â€ºÃ¨â€¹Â¦Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥ÂÂÃ¥Ë†ÂÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¦Âµâ€¹Ã©â€¡ÂÃ©â€”Â®Ã¥ÂÂ·Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ©Å¡ÂÃ¥ÂÅ½Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¥Â¤Â©Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â»â€“Ã¤Â»Â¬Ã¥Â®Å’Ã¦Ë†ÂÃ¤Âºâ€ Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã©Â¡Â¹Ã¨Ââ€Ã¦Æ’Â³Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã¤Â¹Â Ã¤Â»Â»Ã¥Å Â¡Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¥Ë†ÂºÃ¦Â¿â‚¬Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã©Â«ËœÃ¥ÂºÂ¦Ã¤Â»Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥Å½Å’Ã¦ÂÂ¶Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§â€ÂµÃ¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€°ÂªÃ¨Â¾â€˜Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥â€¡ÂºÃ§Å½Â°Ã©â€¦ÂÃ¥Â¯Â¹Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¤Â¸Â»Ã¨Â§â€šÃ¨Â¯â€žÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã¨Â¢Â«Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¤Â¼Â°Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ¨Ââ€Ã¦Æ’Â³Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã¤Â¹Â Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦Å’â€¡Ã¦Â â€¡Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ§Â¬Â¬Ã¤ÂºÅ’Ã¥Â¤Â©Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Ââ€šÃ¤Â¸Å½Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¨Â®Â°Ã¥Â½â€¢Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã§â€ÂµÃ¥Â½Â±Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥â€¦Â¥Ã¤Â¾ÂµÃ¥â€™Å’Ã¥ÂÂÃ¥Ë†ÂÃ£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã¯Â¼Å¡</b> COVID-19 Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã§Â²Â¾Ã§Â¥Å¾Ã§â€”â€ºÃ¨â€¹Â¦Ã¤Â½â€ Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã©ÂÅ¾Ã¥ÂÂÃ¥Ë†ÂÃ¤Â¸Å½Ã§â€ÂµÃ¥Â½Â±Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã©â€”Â¯Ã¥â€¦Â¥Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥ÂÂÃ¥Ë†ÂÃ¨Â½Â½Ã¨ÂÂ·Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¨Â¿â„¢Ã¤Âºâ€ºÃ¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ§â€Â±Ã¨Ââ€Ã¦Æ’Â³Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã¤Â¹Â Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¤Â»â€¹Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¨Â®ÂºÃ¯Â¼Å¡</b>Ã¥Â½â€œÃ¥â€°ÂÃ§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¦Â¿â‚¬Ã¥Â¢Å¾Ã¥Â¼ÂºÃ¨Ââ€Ã¦Æ’Â³Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã¤Â¹Â Ã¥â€™Å’ PTSD Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Ââ€¡Ã¨Â®Â¾Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¨â€¡Â´Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥â€¦Â·Ã¤Â½â€œÃ¦ÂÂ¥Ã¨Â¯Â´Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â»â€“Ã¤Â»Â¬Ã¨Â¡Â¨Ã¦ËœÅ½Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã©â€¢Â¿Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Â¤Â¾Ã¤Â¼Å¡Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¦Â¿â‚¬Ã¯Â¼Ë†Ã¥Æ’ÂÃ¥Å“Â¨ COVID-19 Ã§Ë†â€ Ã¥Ââ€˜Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã¤Â¸ÂÃ¨â€°Â¯Ã¤Âºâ€¹Ã¤Â»Â¶Ã¨Â®Â°Ã¥Â¿â€ Ã¥Å Â Ã¥Â·Â¥Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸ÂªÃ¤Â½â€œÃ¥Â·Â®Ã¥Â¼â€šÃ¦Å“â€°Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ©Å“â‚¬Ã¨Â¦ÂÃ¨Â¿â€ºÃ¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¦Â­Â¥Ã§Å¡â€žÃ©ÂªÅ’Ã¨Â¯ÂÃ¦â‚¬Â§Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¦ÂÂ¥Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¥Â¤ÂÃ¨Â¿â„¢Ã¤Âºâ€ºÃ§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã£â‚¬â€š.","Friesen, Michael, SchÃƒÂ¤fer, Sopp","https://doi.org/10.1080/20008066.2022.2127185","20221111","COVID-19; associative fear learning; fear conditioning; intrusions; rumination; stress; trauma; Humans; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; COVID-19; Pandemics; Memory; Fear","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41120,""
"Longitudinal association between informal unpaid caregiving and mental health amongst working age adults in high-income OECD countries: A systematic review","Informal unpaid caregivers provide most of the world's care needs, experiencing numerous health and wealth penalties as a result. As the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted, informal care is highly gendered. Longitudinal evidence is needed to assess the causal effect of caregiving on mental health. This review addresses a gap by summarising and appraising the longitudinal evidence examining the association between unpaid caregiving and mental health among working age adults in high-income Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries and examining gender differences. Six databases were searched (Medline, PsycInfo, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, Econlit) from Jan 1, 2000 to April 1, 2022. Population-based, peer-reviewed quantitative studies using any observational design were included. Population of interest was working age adults. Exposure was any unpaid caregiving, and studies must have had a non-caregiving comparator for inclusion. Mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety, psychological distress/wellbeing) were measurable by validated self-report tools or professional diagnosis. Screening, data extraction and quality assessment (ROBINS-E) were conducted by two reviewers. The study was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022312401). Of the 4536 records screened; 13 eligible studies (133,426 participants) were included. Overall quality of evidence was moderate. Significant between-study heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis, so albatross and effect-direction plots complement the narrative synthesis. Results indicate a negative association between informal unpaid care and mental health in adults of working age. Importantly, all included studies were longitudinal in design. Where studies were stratified by gender, caregiving had a consistently negative impact on the mental health of women. Few studies examined men but revealed a negative effect where an association was found. Our review highlights the need to mitigate the mental health risks of caregiving in working age adults. Whilst men need to be included in further scholarship, reducing the disproportionate caregiving load on women is a crucial requirement for policy development.

"Investigating Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic on the Mental Health of Nursing Students During Remote Learning: An Experience from Dong A University, Vietnam","There was a radically changed in nursing education during the nationwide lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreaks. The transition to remote learning stressed nursing students in many countries, particularly in Vietnam. However, there is still lacking a novel study to describe the mental characteristics of nursing students in detail. To assess the mental health of nursing students, including stress, anxiety, and depression, and to identify the related factors to their mental health during the online study period because of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 540 nursing students at Dong A university using a socio-demographic questionnaire, the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale - 21 Items (DASS-21). Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics and tests, including Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis, and Spearman's correlation to identify the related factors. In total 540 participants, nursing students reported stress (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°120, 22.2%), anxiety (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°195, 36.1%), and depression symptoms (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°135, 23.1%). There was a significant relationship between age, work status, married status, number of children, stress, anxiety, and depression (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). In addition, our study showed a negative correlation between frequency of physical activity, perceived health and stress (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.117; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01, rÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.127, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01), anxiety (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.133; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01, rÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.112, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01), depression (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.134; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01, rÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.135, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). A significant relationship was observed between e-learning space and Internet status with mental health (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Especially, there was no association between average online learning time, academic workload, stress, anxiety, and depression (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). However, the authors found a positive association between perceived level of stress related to evaluative activities and stress, anxiety, depression (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.120, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01; rÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.089, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05; rÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.088, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Nursing students suffered stress, anxiety, and depression during online learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the presence of some related factors. Therefore, this study may increase more attention of universities, families, and governments to reduce the stress of nursing students during distance education.","Hai, Thi, Tran Cong, Thi, Hua Thi, Vo Le, Thi, Do Thi, Nguyen Thi, Thi Quynh, Vinh Pham, My","https://doi.org/10.1177/23779608221135437","20221111","COVID-19; DASS-21; mental health; nursing students; remote learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41122,""
"Labor market participation and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic among young adults (18 to 30 years): A nationally representative study in France","To examine the relationship between young adults' labor force participation and depression in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data come from the nationally-representative EPICOV cohort study set up in France, and were collected in 2020 and 2021 (3 waves of online or telephone interviews: 02/05/2020-12/06/2020; 26/10/2020-14/12/2020; 24/06/2021-09/08/2021) among 2,217 participants aged 18-30 years. Participants with prior mental health disorder (<i>n</i> = 50) were excluded from the statistical analyses. Using Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) models controlled for participants' socio-demographic and health characteristics and weighted to be nationally-representative, we found that compared to young adults who were employed, those who were studying or unemployed were significantly more likely to experience depression assessed using the PHQ-9 (multivariable ORs, respectively: OR: 1.29, 95% CI 1.05-1.60 and OR: 1.50, 1.13-1.99). Stratifying the analyses by age, we observed that unemployment was more strongly associated with depression among participants 25-30 years than among those who were 18-24 years (multivariable ORs, respectively, 1.78, 95% CI 1.17-2.71 and 1.41, 95% CI 0.96-2.09). Being out of the labor force was, to the contrary, more significantly associated with depression among participants 18-24 years (multivariable OR: 1.71, 95% CI 1.04-2.82, vs. 1.00, 95% CI 0.53-1.87 among participants 25-30 years). Stratifying the analyses by sex, we found no significant differences in the relationships between labor market characteristics and depression (compared to participants who were employed, multivariable ORs associated with being a student: men: 1.33, 95% CI 1.01-1.76; women: 1.19, 95% CI 0.85-1.67, multivariable ORs associated with being unemployed: men: 1.60, 95% CI 1.04-2.45; women: 1.47, 95% CI 1.01-2.15). Our study shows that in addition to students, young adults who are unemployed also experience elevated levels of depression in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. These two groups should be the focus of specific attention in terms of prevention and mental health treatment. Supporting employment could also be a propitious way of reducing the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of young adults.","Melchior, Florence, Davisse-Paturet, Falissard, GalÃƒÂ©ra, Hazo, Vuillermoz, Warszawski, Dione, Rouquette","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.904665","20221111","COVID-19; depression; epidemiology; labor market participation; young adult; Male; Young Adult; Female; Humans; Adult; COVID-19; Pandemics; Depression; Cohort Studies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41123,""
"<i>Umunthu,</i> Covid-19 and mental health in Malawi","This paper investigates the centrality of <i>Umunthu</i> in mental health conception and treatment in Malawi. <i>Umunthu</i> is an African philosophical worldview which stresses that an individual is human as they relate to others, as in the saying <i>I am because we are.</i> Its communitarian approach contrasts with a predominantly western individualistic worldview; <i>I think therefore I am.</i> There are spelling variations of the word across Bantu languages, including <i>bomoto</i> (Congo), <i>gimuntu</i> (Angola); <i>umunthu</i> (Malawi); <i>vumutu</i> (Mozambique); <i>vumuntu, vhutu</i> (South Africa); <i>humhunu/ubuthosi</i> (Zimbabwe); <i>bumuntu</i> (Tanzania); and <i>umuntu</i> (Uganda). Literature shows that if embraced and advocated for, <i>Umunthu</i> plays a positive and influential role in mainstreaming and dealing with mental health issues in communitarian societies where the <i>Umunthu</i> ideals are part of the social fabric. However, in the case of Covid-19 and mental health in Malawi, the paper argues that Covid-19 preventive measures, particularly self-isolation when Covid-19 positive; maintaining social distance at all times; and reducing the number of people gathered at funerals, challenge <i>Umunthu</i> ideals, which have in the past been crucial in reducing stress, trauma and anxiety. This original paper bases its arguments on empirical data collected in a study conducted in Mangochi, Blantyre, Karonga and Lilongwe. Based on the study's findings, the paper highlights that although Covid-19 preventative measures have been globally embraced, it is also a limiting factor in the quest for mental health in societies with communitarian value systems.","Kainja, Ndasauka, Mchenga, Kondowe, M'manga, Maliwichi, Nyamali","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e11316","20221111","Communitarianism; Covid-19; Malawi; Mental health; Umunthu","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41124,""
"A survey study of Chinese adolescents' mental and interpersonal quality: Evidence from COVID-19 pandemic","Since 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic, as a global public health emergency, has led to stringency measures (such as lockdown) of various degrees worldwide. As these measures such as social distancing measures and mandatory lockdown are intended to minimize social mobility, they have exerted remarkable impact on individuals' mental health, particularly, adolescents and children. The mental health problems caused include fear, anxiety, sense of isolation and development of more maladaptive behaviors due to prolonged lockdown and restricted interpersonal contact. However, well adaption status and stable interpersonal relationships play an important role in maintaining and promoting the mental health of adolescents and children. This study aims to gain a new sight of understanding of the mental health quality of Chinese adolescents during the COVID-19 Pandemic in terms of adaptation and interpersonal quality. The study is based on a survey on a total of 7,318 junior and senior high school students aged 12-18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years in various regions of China, and intended to examine the differences in adolescent mental health quality by sociodemographic variables such as gender, grade, urban and rural areas, only child, and parental education level. Our study finds that Chinese adolescents show an overall good adaptation and interpersonal quality during the lockdown. However there exists disparity across different categories in developmental patterns of adaptation and interpersonal quality. In addition, good family environment, moderate financial and emotional support, higher parental education level, etc. contribute to the cultivation and improvement of adolescents' mental health quality. Finally, we suggest that the government and researchers should pay more attention to adolescents' mental health issues in terms of adaption status and interpersonal relationships during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for disadvantaged social groups such as girls, younger students, and low-income family students.","Huang, Zhu, Kang, Zhu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1049077","20221111","COVID-19; adaptation status; adolescents; grade differences; interpersonal quality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41125,""

To evaluate seriousness of peritraumatic problems among southern Indian inhabitants during the COVID-19 pandemic. A referral sampling technique was continued until a sufficient sample size was reached, while this self-administered survey catches insights about depression, fears, psychological change, evasion cognitive change, and collectively quantifies the stress on a scale of 0-60. Expressive factual examinations were utilized to sum up clear cut information and inferential measurable investigations included Chi-square tests and Pearson's correlations were done. The study included only those participants who understood English and had access to the internet. Inconsequential outcomes were found among gender in which both male and female members frequently showed apprehension and nervousness about COVID-19. 44.8% tried not to watch the news on COVID-19 as they were excessively frightened and make frenzy to family members. 90.9% of participants with lower education levels were more stressed over the thought of getting COVID-19 when showing manifestations related with the novel corona virus, which was statistically significant.

The lived experiences require urgent documentation to tailor-make psychiatric assessments and long-term follow-ups. To explore adolescents' self-reported perspectives and lived experiences during their COVID-19 illness which was voluntarily shared through media and social media platforms during the nationwide lockdown in India. Being a preliminary study, the sample size was calculated as 20 based on similar studies in the literature. Voluntarily shared data of COVID-19 survivors were extracted from media and social media. Based on the data, an assessment sheet was prepared, pre-tested and shared with three observers via convenient sampling. Male predominance was noted. The mean age was found to be 39.5 years. English was the most commonly uploaded language to communicate suffering. Instagram and YouTube were the most prevalent social media sites for self-reported experiences. The most prevalent physical symptom was fever and cough. Stress, anxiety and stigmatization were more commonly reported. Statistical significance was obtained between fear and end of life, depression and suicide, pain and isolation and worried with insomnia. COVID-19 not only affects physical health but also takes a toll on the mental health of the patients. There is a high prevalence rate of psychological distress among COVID-19 survivors, and we recommend a formal psychiatric assessment and long-term follow-up to understand the unique challenges faced by the COVID-19 survivors, with effective communication and empathy towards them.","Raman, Chidambaranathan","https://doi.org/10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_210_22","20221111","COVID survivorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢; COVID-19; COVID-19 perspective; emotional experiences; pandemic; psychological impact of COVID-19","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41127,""
"COVID-Related suicide during the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic in India: A tip of the iceberg of mental health problems","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has influenced the entire world. There has been great surge of mental health problems after the pandemic has started. The second wave has almost exhausted the Indian Health care system. There has also been cases of suicide due to COVID-19 infection. The objective of study was to highlight various factors involved in COVID-19 related suicide (CRS) during second wave of COVID-19 pandemic in India. CRS reports on the websites of 10 popular newspapers and television news channels in North India and official government websites such as the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare were searched between February 1, 2020, and May 31, 2021. We also searched the Medline and Google Scholar databases for CRS reports from India using the terms ""corona"", ""COVID-19"", ""SARS CoV 2"", ""India"", and ""suicide"" in various combinations. A total of 62 articles were included for the study. Most common mode of suicide was hanging and most common site was the deceased's home. Fear of infecting family members was the most common cause of CRS during second wave of the ongoing pandemic in India. Many individuals lost their lives to suicide due to COVID-19 pandemic. The media report does not provide the exact picture of community suicide. Proper physician counselling at the time of providing treatment can help in reducing few CRS.","Sheikh, Vasudeva, Tripathi","https://doi.org/10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_1517_21","20221111","COVID-19; fear; pandemic; reports; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41128,""
"Psychosocial implications of early COVID-19 restrictions on older adults in a small-town region in Southwestern, Pennsylvania (USA)","The restrictions put in place in 2020 to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 limited or eliminated social connections that are vital for psychosocial well-being. The objectives of this research were to examine the impact of early pandemic-related restrictions on feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety as well as social activity disruption and their concomitant associations in a sample of community-dwelling older adults residing in a small-town region in the USA. Cross-sectional data collected from an ongoing population-based cohort study in Southwestern, Pennsylvania. Analyses included 360 adults aged 65 years and older whose annual study assessment occurred during the first 120 days of pandemic-related restrictions. Self-reported feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety due to the pandemic-related restrictions were each measured using a single question. Depressive symptoms and anxiety were also assessed with the modified Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 item tools. Disruption in a variety of common social activities was also assessed. Feeling lonely affected 36% of participants who were more likely to be female, not currently married, and living alone. Giving up in-person visits with family was associated with significantly higher odds of feeling lonely, and feeling lonely was associated with significantly higher odds of feelings of anxiety and depression. Loneliness is a serious outcome of pandemic-related restrictions among older adults, potentially linked to loss of connection with family, and may be associated with increased feelings of depression and anxiety.","Hughes, Ran, Fang, Jacobsen, Snitz, Chang, Ganguli","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1041610222000977","20221110","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; loneliness; pandemic restrictions; social activity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41129,""

"Mental and Psychosocial Health: A Post-COVID Concern in India","India, with a total population of 1,309,053,980, has 0.29 psychiatrists, 0.00 child psychiatrists, and 0.80 mental health nurses per 100,000 population. The mental health expenditure per person is just 4 INR as per Mental Health ATLAS 2017 (World Health Organization). The treatment gap for mental disorders still remains very high. These raise issues to our mental health status post coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Higher levels of anxiety, stress, and depression after the stay-at-home order post COVID-19 could lead to further psychological trauma besides mental health. A younger age, the female gender, and the caregiver status have a greater degree of stressfulness because of the pandemic. To assess the mental health status of the general population post COVID-19 in India. An online survey was conducted using Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS) 21 in the month of July, 2020. The results of the online survey using DASS 21 conducted in the month of July, 2020, in India support the mental distress in the general population too.

"A mixed methods study: The grief experience of registered nurses working on the frontlines during the COVID-19 pandemic","The purpose of this study was to generate a conceptual definition and theory of grief for nurses working on the frontlines during the COVID-19 pandemic using grounded theory methodology. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on nurses working on the frontlines. The increasing flow of diagnosed COVID-19 cases, diverse unknowns and demands in the treatment of patients with COVID-19, and depression related to countless deaths can trigger grief experiences. A mixed methods approach, including the qualitative method of grounded theory and a quantitative 30-question survey, was used in this study. Eight focus group sessions were conducted with registered nurses working on the frontlines during the pandemic. Sessions were audio recorded and analysed using constant comparative data analysis. Following the interviews, a survey including demographics and self-report inventories was completed by participants. The COREQ checklist was used to assess study quality. Major concepts that emerged include 'facing a new reality', 'frustrations', 'stress' and 'coping'. Core concepts were combined into a conceptual definition of grief and a grounded theory of the experience of nurses working on the frontlines during the pandemic. Cross comparisons of qualitative and quantitative findings were made and compared with the literature. This study provides a better understanding of the grief experience of nurses working on the frontlines during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is necessary to recognise professional grief and develop intervention strategies that lead to grief reconciliation. Findings provide useful insights for healthcare administrators to provide support and develop interventions to reduce frustrations and stress of frontline registered nurses. This study design involved registered nurses participating in focus group sessions. Participants detailed their experience working on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic with patients, family and hospital administration.","Williams, Accardo, Dolgoff, Farrell, McClinton, Murray, Jacob","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.16579","20221110","COVID-19; RNs; coping; frustration; grief; midwives; nurses; nursing; stress; support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41132,""
"Mental health consequences of COVID-19 suppression strategies in Victoria, Australia: a narrative review","The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed significant mental health burdens upon the general population worldwide, either directly owing to the disease or indirectly through aggressive public health measures to control spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. In this narrative review, we used a systematic approach to summarize the impact of restrictive lockdown measures on the general mental health of people living in Victoria, Australia during 2020 and to identify the groups with an increased risk of adverse mental health outcomes. A systematic database search (Ovid Medline, PsycINFO, Embase) for articles examining the mental health of Victorians in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020 yielded 88 articles, of which 15 articles were finally included in this review. We found that the general mental health of Victorians was negatively affected by COVID-19 restrictions during 2020. Although studies reported heterogeneous mental health outcomes, we found that the general population consistently used coping strategies and demonstrated mental health help-seeking behaviors in response to the restrictions. Women, children, young people, carers, people who became unemployed owing to the pandemic, and those with pre-existing psychiatric conditions had a higher risk of adverse mental health consequences during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.","Jiang, Akhlaghi, Haywood, Morrissey, Parnis","https://doi.org/10.1177/03000605221134466","20221111","Australia; COVID-19; Mental health; Victoria; epidemic control; lockdown; public health; social measures; Child; Humans; Female; Adolescent; COVID-19; Pandemics; Mental Health; SARS-CoV-2; Victoria; Communicable Disease Control","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41133,""
"A scoping review of the literature on the impact of the COVID-19 quarantine on the psychological wellbeing of medical students","The goal of this study was to identify the nature and extent of the available published research on the impact of social isolation, on the psychological wellbeing of medical students, who had to quarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Design. Scoping review. The PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews), guideline, was used to structure this study. A search strategy was carried out across six bibliographic databases. PubMed, Embase, ERIC, Scopus, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Web of Science. The following search terms were used, ""medical student*"" AND ""impact"" AND ""quarantine"" AND ""COVID-19"". Searches were initially confined to articles published (excluding conference abstracts) between 1 January 2019- 21 August 2021 but updated in September 2022 with the original search terms expanded to include ""isolation"" or ""lockdown"" as well as ""quarantine"" and the period of search extended to 21 August 2022. A search of secondary references was conducted. Data from the selected studies were extracted, and the following variables recorded; first author and year of publication, country of study, study design, sample size, participants, mode of analysing impact of quarantine from COVID-19 on mental health and results of the studies. A total of 223 articles were identified in the original search in 2021 and 387 articles, in the updated search in 2022. Following the exclusion of duplicates and application of the agreed inclusion and exclusion criteria, 31 full-text articles were identified for the final review, most of which were cross sectional studies. Sample sizes ranged from 13 to 4193 students and most studies used a variety of self-administered questionnaires to measure psychological wellbeing. Overall, 26 of the 31 articles showed that quarantine had a negative impact on the psychological well-being of medical students. However, two studies showed no impact, and three studies showed an improvement. The evidence is growing. Quarantine because of the COVID-19 pandemic may have had a negative impact on the psychological wellbeing of medical students, but this is not certain. There is therefore a need for more studies to further evaluate this research question.","Vythilingam, Prakash, Nourianpour, Atiomo","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-022-03803-y","20221111","COVID-19; Impact; Medical; Pandemic; Psychological; Quarantine; Students; Wellbeing; Humans; COVID-19; Pandemics; Students, Medical; Quarantine; Social Isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41134,""
"Central hypersomnia and chronic insomnia: expanding the spectrum of sleep disorders in long COVID syndrome - a prospective cohort study","Long-onset COVID syndrome has been described in patients with COVID-19 infection with persistence of symptoms or development of sequelae beyond 4Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks after the onset of acute symptoms, a medium- and long-term consequence of COVID-19. This syndrome can affect up to 32% of affected individuals, with symptoms of fatigue, dyspnea, chest pain, cognitive disorders, insomnia, and psychiatric disorders. The present study aimed to characterize and evaluate the prevalence of sleep symptoms in patients with long COVID syndrome. A total of 207 patients with post-COVID symptoms were evaluated through clinical evaluation with a neurologist and specific exams in the subgroup complaining of excessive sleepiness. Among 189 patients included in the long COVID sample, 48 (25.3%) had sleep-related symptoms. Insomnia was reported by 42 patients (22.2%), and excessive sleepiness (ES) was reported by 6 patients (3.17%). Four patients with ES were evaluated with polysomnography and test, multiple sleep latencies test, and actigraphic data. Two patients had a diagnosis of central hypersomnia, and one had narcolepsy. A history of steroid use was related to sleep complaints (insomnia and excessive sleepiness), whereas depression was related to excessive sleepiness. We observed a high prevalence of cognitive complaints in these patients. Complaints related to sleep, such as insomnia and excessive sleepiness, seem to be part of the clinical post-acute syndrome (long COVID syndrome), composing part of its clinical spectrum, relating to some clinical data.","Moura, Oliveira, Torres, Tavares-JÃƒÂºnior, NÃƒÂ³brega, Braga-Neto, Sobreira-Neto","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12883-022-02940-7","20221111","Hypersomnia; Long-COVID; Narcolepsy; Sleep; Humans; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders; COVID-19; Prospective Studies; Sleepiness; Disorders of Excessive Somnolence; Sleep Wake Disorders; Syndrome","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41135,""
"Changes in agricultural context and mental health of farmers in different regions of Thailand during the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic","Thailand's agricultural sector is crucial to the country's development and economy. The COVID-19 pandemic caused negative effects on the agricultural context and the mental health of Thai farmers. This study aimed to compare changes in the agricultural context and mental health among farmers in different regions of Thailand during the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also investigated the determinants associated with the mental health of farmers. This cross-sectional study was carried out from December 2021 to January 2022 in Thailand, with 1,676 Thai farmers interviewed. The results found that the Central region found to be the highest impact of increased agrochemical costs (91.0%) and decreased crop yields (92.0%), while the highest in the North and the North-East was found in decreased crop product prices (84.0 and 66.4%). In the context of economic status, the greatest impact in the Central region was found to be in increased household expense (96.3%), while the highest impact in the North, the North-East, and the South was found in decreased household income (91.5, 80.0, and 69.8%, respectively). Regarding mental health, the Central region was found to be the highest prevalence of extremely high stress and severe depression symptoms (18.3 and 23.4%), whereas the South region was found to be the highest prevalence of severe anxiety symptoms (7.4%). Interestingly, the multivariate analysis also found that the agricultural factors associated with mental health were decreased working days, changes in agrochemical type and crop cultivation, decreased crop rotation, increased difficulty in accessing agrochemicals and markets, decreased crop yields, and increased household debt. The findings of this study are useful for government and relevant organizations to plan and implement supportive measures and improve mental health services to mitigate both short and long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic suit on the regions.

"Vaccine hesitancy, distress, and medical mistrust in women considering or undergoing fertility treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic","To evaluate perceptions of COVID-19 vaccination and psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in women considering or undergoing fertility treatment. Cross-sectional anonymous survey (n= 3558) from a single academic fertility center. A total of 1103 patients completed the survey (response rate = 31% of those emailed, 97.6% of those who opened the email). Participants were randomized 1:1 to a one-page educational graphic providing facts and benefits regarding COVID-19 vaccination. Assessment of vaccine hesitancy was conducted via the Medical Mistrust Index (MMI). Mental health was assessed via the Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale (PHQ-8) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). The majority of participants were married, nulliparous, white women with &gt; 1 year of infertility and moderate to severe distress. As compared to the non-intervention group, participants in the intervention group believed that COVID-19 vaccination does not cause genetic abnormalities in a fetus (98.0% v. 94.2%) and infertility (99% v. 96.2%) and that severe infection has been associated with pregnancy (81.3% v. 74.6%) (P &lt;0.05). Higher MMI scores were associated with vaccine hesitancy (P = 0.01), higher GAD-7 scores (P = 0.01), and greater concerns about side effects of the vaccine (P &lt; 0.05). GAD-7 and PHQ-8 scores were not associated with vaccine hesitancy. Nearly a quarter of participants initiated psychiatric treatment after March 2020. Vaccine hesitancy was associated with mistrust of the medical system. Psychological distress was highly prevalent in this study.

"Digital access constraints predict worse mental health among adolescents during COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing social restrictions disrupted young people's social interactions and resulted in several periods during which school closures necessitated online learning. We hypothesised that digitally excluded young people would demonstrate greater deterioration in their mental health than their digitally connected peers during this time. We analysed representative mental health data from a sample of UK 10-15-year-olds (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1387) who completed a mental health inventory in 2017-2019 and thrice during the pandemic (July 2020, November 2020 and March 2021). We employed longitudinal modelling to describe trajectories of adolescent mental health for participants with and without access to a computer or a good internet connection for schoolwork. Adolescent mental health symptoms rose early in the COVID-19 pandemic, with the highest mean Total Difficulties score around December 2020. The worsening and subsequent recovery of mental health during the pandemic was greatly pronounced among those without access to a computer, although we did not find evidence for a similar effect among those without a good internet connection. We conclude that lack of access to a computer is a tractable risk factor that likely compounds other adversities facing children and young people during periods of social isolation or educational disruption.","Metherell, Ghai, McCormick, Ford, Orben","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-23899-y","20221111","Child; Adolescent; Humans; COVID-19; Pandemics; Mental Health; Social Isolation; Mental Disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41139,""
"Stressors and Destressors in Working From Home Based on Context and Physiology From Self-Reports and Smartwatch Measurements: International Observational Study Trial","The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly boosted working from home as a way of working, which is likely to continue for most companies in the future, either in fully remote or in hybrid form. To manage stress levels in employees working from home, insights into the stressors and destressors in a home office first need to be studied. We present an international remote study with employees working from home by making use of state-of-the-art technology (ie, smartwatches and questionnaires through smartphones) first to determine stressors and destressors in people working from home and second to identify smartwatch measurements that could represent these stressors and destressors. Employees working from home from 3 regions of the world (the United States, the United Kingdom, and Hong Kong) were asked to wear a smartwatch continuously for 7 days and fill in 5 questionnaires each day and 2 additional questionnaires before and after the measurement week. The entire study was conducted remotely. Univariate statistical analyses comparing variable distributions between low and high stress levels were followed by multivariate analysis using logistic regression, considering multicollinearity by using variance inflation factor (VIF) filtering. A total of 202 people participated, with 198 (98%) participants finishing the experiment. Stressors found were other people and daily life getting in the way of work (P=.05), job intensity (P=.01), a history of burnout (P=.03), anxiety toward the pandemic (P=.04), and environmental noise (P=.01). Destressors found were access to sunlight (P=.02) and fresh air (P&lt;.001) during the workday and going outdoors (P&lt;.001), taking breaks (P&lt;.001), exercising (P&lt;.001), and having social interactions (P&lt;.001). The smartwatch measurements positively related to stress were the number of active intensity periods (P&lt;.001), the number of highly active intensity periods (P=.04), steps (P&lt;.001), and the SD in the heart rate (HR; P&lt;.001). In a multivariate setting, only a history of burnout (P&lt;.001) and family and daily life getting in the way of work (P&lt;.001) were positively associated with stress, while self-reports of social activities (P&lt;.001) and going outdoors (P=.03) were negatively associated with stress. Stress prediction models based on questionnaire data had a similar performance (F<sub>1</sub>=0.51) compared to models based on automatic measurable data alone (F<sub>1</sub>=0.47). The results show that there are stressors and destressors when working from home that should be considered when managing stress in employees. Some of these stressors and destressors are (in)directly measurable with unobtrusive sensors, and prediction models based on these data show promising results for the future of automatic stress detection and management.

"Longitudinal assessment of educational risk for K-12 students withÃ‚Â cysticÃ‚Â fibrosis","To assess the use of services provided by a cystic fibrosis (CF) center school specialist and evaluate relationships among student educational risk scores, family concerns for school engagement and performance, and disease severity. This was a retrospective review of medical records for 126 children with CF in grades K-12 who were screened for educational risk or used school intervention services during the 2017- 020 school years. Regression analyses were performed to identify and quantify predictors of educational risk, family concern for school performance and ability to advocate, and use of school specialist services. Most children with CF (62%-82%) were at moderate-to-high educational risk. Sixteen or more school absences, family concerns for their child's school performance or inability to advocate for their school needs, child mental health visits, and greater frequency of hospitalization predicted greater educational risk scores and more encounters with the school specialist. Better lung function and lower grade level were associated with lower educational risk. Number of encounters with the School Specialist remained high across three pre-coronavirus disease 2019 school years. Our experience illustrates a need to identify educational risk and support school experiences of children and youth with CF as a component of the care model. Tailored support, based on identification of risk predictors, has potential to improve educational outcomes.","Bowdy, Hente, Filigno, Strong, Hossain, Tadesse, Boat, Hjelm","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2022.09.049","20221112","cystic fibrosis; educational risk; school","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-15","",41141,""
