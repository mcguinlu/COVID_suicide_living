"Are psychiatric disorders risk factors for COVID-19 susceptibility and severity?a two-sample, bidirectional, univariable and multivariable Mendelian Randomization study","Importance: Observational studies have suggested bidirectional associations between psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 phenotypes, but results of such studies are inconsistent. Mendelian Randomization (MR) may overcome limitations of observational studies, e.g. unmeasured confounding and uncertainties about cause and effect. Objective: To elucidate associations between neuropsychiatric disorders and COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. Method: In November, 2020, we applied a two-sample, bidirectional, univariable and multivariable MR design to genetic data from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of neuropsychiatric disorders and COVID-19 phenotypes (released on 20 Oct. 2020). Our study population consisted of almost 2 million participants with either a (neuro)psychiatric disorder or data on COVID-19 status. Outcomes and exposures were anxiety, anxiety-and-stress related disorders, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia-bipolar disorder combined (BIP-SCZ), and Alzheimer dementia on the one hand; and self-reported, confirmed, hospitalized, and very severe COVID-19 on the other. Results: In single-variable MR analysis the most significant and only Bonferroni-corrected significant result was found for BIP-SCZ (a combined anxiety of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia as cases vs. controls): the effect estimate was consistent with increased risk of COVID-19. Nominally significant univariable results were in line with slightly elevated risks of COVID-19 for genetic liabilities to bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. No COVID-19 phenotype consistently increased risk of (neuro)psychiatric disorders. In multivariable MR, bipolar disorder was the only phenotype showing a Bonferroni-corrected significant effect on a COVID-19 phenotype, namely severe COVID-19. All sensitivity analyses confirmed the results. Conclusions: Genetic liability to bipolar disorder slightly increases COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. The contribution of bipolar disorder to these COVID-19 phenotypes was smaller than the odds ratios estimated by observational studies. Strength of association and direction of effect for genetic liability to schizophrenia were similar, albeit less significant. We found no consistent evidence of reverse effects, i.e. of genetic liability to COVID-19 on psychiatric disorders.","Jurjen Luykx; Bochao Lin","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.29.20240481","20201130","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-30","",7579,""
"I'm alone but not lonely U-shaped pattern of perceived loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK and Greece","Many countries have adopted lengthy lockdown measures to mitigate the spreading of the COVID-19 virus. In this study, we train a RandomForest model using 10 variables quantifying individuals' living environment, physical and mental health statuses to predict how long each of the UK participants (N=382) had been in lockdown. Self-perceived loneliness was found to be the most important variable predicting time in lockdown and, therefore, the aspect most influenced by the time the participant spent in lockdown. Subsequent statistical analysis showed a significant U-shaped curve for the levels of perceived loneliness (p<0.012), specifically decreasing during the 4th and 5th lockdown weeks. The same pattern was found on data from Greek citizens (N=129, p<0.041). These results suggest that lockdown measures may have affected how people evaluated their social support while in lockdown, leading to a decreased sense of loneliness. Implications of this study should be reflected on policies and countermeasures to current and future pandemics.","Alessandro Carollo; Andrea Bizzego; Giulio Gabrieli; Keri Ka-Yee Wong; Adrian Raine; Gianluca Esposito","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.26.20239103","20201130","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-30","",7580,""
"Risk exposures, risk perceptions, negative attitudes toward general vaccination, and COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among college students in South Carolina","Growing attention has been paid to vaccination in control of the COVID-19 pandemic and young adults is one of the key populations for vaccination. Advanced understanding of young adults' willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine and the potential factors influencing their vaccine intention will contribute to the development and implementation of effective strategies to promote COVID-19 vaccine uptake among this group. The current study investigated how risk exposures and risk perceptions of COVID-19 (e.g., perceived susceptibility, severity, and fear of COVID-19) as well as negative attitudes toward general vaccination were related to COVID vaccine acceptance among college students based on online survey data from 1062 college students in South Carolina . Hierarchical linear regression was used to examine the association of these factors with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance controlling for key demographics. Results suggested that perceived severity and fear of COVID-19 were positively associated with vaccine acceptance, while higher level of risk exposures (work/study place exposure) and negative attitude toward general vaccination were associated with low vaccine acceptance. Our findings suggested that we need tailored education messages for college students to emphasize the severity of COVID-19, particularly potential long-term negative consequences on health, address the concerns of side effects of general vaccines by dispelling the misconception, and target the most vulnerable subgroups who reported high level of risk exposures while showed low intention to take the vaccine. Efforts are warranted to increase college students' perceived susceptibility and severity and promote their self-efficacy in health management and encourage them to take protective behaviors including vaccine uptake.","Shan Qiao; Cheuk Chi Tam; Xiaoming Li","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.26.20239483","20201130","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-30","",7581,""
"Changes COVID-19 Post-Quarantine Behaviors, Hygiene and Expectations in Colombia: Population Survey from 1st to 13th September, 2020","This study by Profamilia Association focuses on the social response to COVID19 by reporting and analyzing the answers to two surveys carried out between April 16 and 25, and throughout September 2020. The study aims to identify changes in behaviors and immediate expectations after the quarantine was lifted. In general, results show that people have adopted behavioral changes such as wearing face masks, avoiding people with symptoms, and reducing mobility. However, it also shows that people's concerns have doubled for many reasons, ranging from mental health issues, neglected sexual and reproductive health needs, the burden of care for others, and working from home. Similarly, it was found that some people would accept significant long-term changes such as accepting most children continuing to be homeschooled or employees choosing whether to work or not, targeted quarantines in neighborhoods that show high number of cases; and making the use of face masks mandatory in case a vaccine or treatment for Covid-19 does not become available. This means that during the quarantine and compared to April, many people consider these options to be acceptable in the long term. The survey was filled out online via SurveyMonkey by 1,735 people in Colombia between 1st and 11th September, 2020. Overall, 17% mentioned that they had participated in the previous survey, Estudio Solidaridad I early stage of quarantine (April 2020). The following is a summary of the main findings based on the comparison of the two surveys in hopes to show evidence for changes in behavior, hygiene, levels of measure compliance, unmet needs, and to show people's immediate expectations after six months of strict quarantine. -The most common concerns among the findings were: a vaccine or treatment for COVID-19 not arriving Colombia soon enough (79%), a vaccine or treatment not being developed soon enough (79%) and also a concern that once the vaccine arrives in Colombia, it will not be accessible (74%). 50% of people think it is likely to get the COVID-19 vaccine once it becomes readily available. -62% get information about COVID-19 through social media, 55% through official websites, and 51% through television. -43% say that in their neighborhood, community, social group, or town, measures and campaigns have been carried out to prevent the spread of the COVID-19. -25% say they would like to support local communities respond to the outbreak. -82% agree with most children remaining home-schooled. -85% think parents should be able to choose whether or not to send their children to school. -95% agree that people should be forced to wear face masks outside the home. -90% agree with neighborhoods, districts, or municipalities which experience outbreaks adopting more restrictive measures compared to the country as a whole. -86% think employees should choose whether to work in their office or work from home. -44% think that people will be able to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in a year or a year and a half. -26% think life will return to ""normal"" in two years or more.","Sandra Marcela SÃ¡nchez; Danny Francis Rivera Montero; RocÃ­o Murad Rivera; Mariana CalderÃ³n Jaramillo; Daniela RoldÃ¡n Restrepo; Lina MarÃ­a CastaÃ±o Mesa; Juan Carlos Rivillas GarcÃ­a","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.26.20239442","20201130","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-30","",7582,""
"'When will this end? Will it end?' The impact of the March-June 2020 UK Covid-19 lockdown response on mental health: a longitudinal survey of mothers in the Born in Bradford study","Objectives To determine clinically important change in anxiety and depression from before to during the first UK Covid-19 lockdown and factors related to this change, including ethnic differences. Design Pre-Covid and lockdown surveys nested within two longitudinal Born in Bradford cohort studies. Participants 1,860 mothers with a child aged 0-4 or 9-13, 48% Pakistani heritage Main outcome measures Odds ratios (OR) for a clinically important increase (5 points) in depression (PHQ-8) and anxiety (GAD-7) in unadjusted regression analyses, parsimonious multivariate modelling to explore ethnicity and mental ill health and lived experience of mothers captured in open text questions. Results Clinically important depression and anxiety increased from 11% to 19%, and 10% to 16% respectively from before to during the first Covid-19 lockdown. Loneliness during lockdown was most strongly associated with increases in depression (OR: 8.37, 95% CIs: 5.70-12.27) and anxiety (8.50, 5.71-12.65), followed by financial insecurity (6.23, 3.96-9.80; 6.03, 3.82-9.51). Other strongly associated variables included food and housing insecurity, a lack of physical activity and a poor partner relationship. When level of financial insecurity was taken into account, Pakistani heritage mothers were less likely than White British mothers to experience an increase in depression (0.67, 0.51-0.89) and anxiety (0.73, 0.55-0.97). Responses to open text highlighted a complex inter-play of health anxieties, mental load, loss of social support and coping strategies, and financial insecurity contributing to mental ill health. Positive aspects of lockdown were also reported, including a more relaxed pace of life. Conclusions Mental ill health has worsened with the Covid-19 lockdown, particularly in those who are lonely, economically insecure and/or of White British ethnicity. Mental health problems may have longer term consequences for public health. Strategies to mitigate adverse impacts of future lockdowns on mental health should focus on those factors we highlight as associated with worsening mental health.","Josie Dickerson; Brian Kelly; Bridget Lockyer; Sally Bridges; Christopher Cartwright; Kathryn Willan; Katy Shire; Kirsty Crossley; Maria Bryant; Najma Siddiqi; Trevor A Sheldon; Deborah A Lawlor; John Wright; Rosemary RC McEachan; Kate E Pickett","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.30.20239954","20201130","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-30","",7583,""
"Self-harm during the early period of the COVID-19 Pandemic in England: comparative trend analysis of hospital presentations","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic and public health measures necessary to address it may have major effects on mental health, including on self-harm. We have used well-established monitoring systems in two hospitals in England to investigate trends in self-harm presentations to hospitals during the early period of the pandemic.

MethodData collected in Oxford and Derby on patients aged 18 years and over who received a psychosocial assessment after presenting to the emergency departments following self-harm were used to compare trends during the three-month period following lockdown in the UK (23rd March 2020) to the period preceding lockdown and the equivalent period in 2019.

ResultsDuring the 12 weeks following introduction of lockdown restrictions there was a large reduction in the number of self-harm presentations to hospitals by individuals aged 18 years and over compared to the pre-lockdown weeks in 2020 (mean weekly reduction of 13.5 (95% CI 5.6 - 21.4) and the equivalent period in 2019 (mean weekly reduction of 18.0 (95% CI 13.9 - 22.1). The reduction was greater in females than males, occurred in all age groups, with a larger reduction in presentations following self-poisoning than self-injury.

ConclusionsA substantial decline in hospital presentations for self-harm occurred during the three months following the introduction of lockdown restrictions. Reasons could include a reduction in self-harm at the community level and individuals avoiding presenting to hospital following self-harm. Longer-term monitoring of self-harm behaviour during the pandemic is essential, together with efforts to encourage help-seeking and the modification of care provision.","Keith Hawton; Deborah Casey; Elizabeth Bale; Fiona Brand; Jennifer Ness; Keith Waters; Samantha Kelly; Galit Guelayov","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.25.20238030","20201129","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-30","",7584,""

"The Anxiety and Pain of Fibromyalgia Patients during the COVID-19 Pandemic","BackgroundEarly research on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic found persistent related anxiety in the general population. We hypothesised that this anxiety will be associated with increased pain in chronic pain patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia (FM).

MethodsTo study this, we carried out a 10-day online survey with 58 female participants, diagnosed with FM and no other pain condition. We identified which aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic evoked anxiety. We then asked participants to provide daily ratings of both anxiety and pain on 101-point visual analogue scales (VAS). Key participant characteristics were included as mediators in a mixed-effects analysis, where the primary outcome was pain VAS.

ResultsWe found that participants were most often anxious about ""impact on relationships"", ""a family member contracting COVID-19"", and ""financial hardships"", but on average rated ""financial hardship"", ""access to medication"", and ""home loss/eviction"" as evoking the strongest anxiety. Mixed-effects modelling showed that an increase in pain was significantly associated with an increase in anxiety, when taking into account individual variance and daily caffeine intake. Age and intake of some mild analgesics were also linked to stronger pain.

ConclusionOur results extend the initial findings from the literature about the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on chronic pain sufferers. We found that not only is pandemic anxiety in FM patients present, but it is associated with amplified self-assessed chronic pain.

SignificanceThe long-term support of fibromyalgia patients is challenging for healthcare professionals due to the nature of the condition. The new normal introduced by the pandemic particularly hinders pain management, which is the leading request from this patient group. Our study demonstrates that mental health decline during the COVID-19 pandemic is directly related to the worsening of pain in fibromyalgia. Core stressors that evoke the strongest anxiety were identified thus providing guidance for where to focus patient support.","Anna Y. Kharko; Kirralise J. Hansford; Paul L. Furlong; Stephen D.

"Loneliness among older adults in the community during COVID-19","ObjectivePhysical distancing and stay-at-home measures implemented to slow transmission of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) may intensify feelings of loneliness in older adults, especially those living alone. Our aim was to characterize the extent of loneliness in a sample of older adults living in the community and assess characteristics associated with loneliness.

DesignOnline cross-sectional survey between May 6 and May 19, 2020

SettingOntario, Canada

ParticipantsConvenience sample of the members of a national retired educators organization.

Primary outcome measuresSelf-reported loneliness, including differences between women and men.

Results4879 respondents (71.0% women; 67.4% 65-79 years) reported that in the preceding week, 43.1% felt lonely at least some of the time, including 8.3% that felt lonely always or often. Women had increased odds of loneliness compared to men, whether living alone (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 1.52 [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.13-2.04]) or with others (2.44 [95% CI 2.04-2.92]). Increasing age group decreased the odds of loneliness (aOR 0.69 [95% CI 0.59-0.81] 65-79 years and 0.50 [95% CI 0.39-0.65] 80+ years compared to <65 years). Living alone was associated with loneliness, with a greater association in men (aOR 4.26 [95% CI 3.15-5.76]) than women (aOR 2.65 [95% CI 2.26-3.11]). Other factors associated with loneliness included: fair or poor health (aOR 1.93 [95% CI 1.54-2.41]), being a caregiver (aOR 1.18 [95% CI 1.02-1.37]), receiving care (aOR 1.47 [95% CI 1.19-1.81]), high concern for the pandemic (aOR 1.55 [95% CI 1.31-1.84]), not experiencing positive effects of pandemic distancing measures (aOR 1.94 [95% CI 1.62-2.32]), and changes to daily routine (aOR 2.81 [95% CI 1.96-4.03]).

ConclusionsWhile many older adults reported feeling lonely during COVID-19, several characteristics - such as being female and living alone - increased the odds of loneliness. These characteristics may help identify priorities for targeting interventions to reduce loneliness.

Strengths and limitations of this studyO_LIThis survey study leveraged a strong community-based partnership to obtain timely data from a large sample of older Canadians on the impacts of COVID-19.
C_LIO_LIThis study identified several characteristics that increased the odds of loneliness, which may help to identify priorities for targeted interventions to reduce loneliness.
C_LIO_LIThe data were based on a convenience sample of retired, educational staff, who are not fully representative of the Canadian population. The perspectives of vulnerable groups who may be at greater risk for loneliness (e.g. those with severe mental health illness, low income, no home internet access, etc.) are likely underrepresented in this sample.

"Identifying optimal combinations of symptoms to trigger diagnostic work-up of suspected COVID-19 cases in vaccine trials: analysis from a community-based, prospective, observational cohort","BackgroundSeveral COVID-19 vaccine efficacy trials are ongoing with others predicted to start soon. Diagnostic work-up of trial participants following any COVID-19 associated symptom will lead to extensive testing, potentially overwhelming laboratory capacity whilst primarily yielding negative results. We aimed to identify an efficient symptom combination to capture most cases using the lowest possible number of tests.

MethodsUK and US users of the COVID-19 Symptom Study app who reported new-onset symptoms between March-September 2020 and an RT-PCR test within seven days of symptom onset were included. Sensitivity, specificity, and number of RT-PCR tests needed to identify one RT-PCR positive case were calculated for individual symptoms and symptom combinations. A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm was applied to generate symptom combinations with good trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity.

FindingsThe UK dataset included 122,305 individuals (1,202 RT-PCR positive). Findings were replicated in a US dataset including 3,162 individuals (79 RT-PCR positive). Within three days of symptom onset, the COVID-19 specific symptom combination (cough, dyspnoea, fever, anosmia/ageusia) identified 69% of cases requiring 47 RT-PCR tests per positive case. The symptom combination with highest sensitivity was fatigue, anosmia, cough, diarrhoea, headache, and sore throat, identifying 96% of cases and requiring 96 tests.

InterpretationWe confirm the significance of COVID-19 specific symptoms widely recommended for triggering RT-PCR. By using the data-driven optimization technique we identified additional symptoms (fatigue, sore throat, headache, diarrhoea) that enabled many more positive cases to be captured efficiently. By providing a set of solutions with optimal trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity, we produced a selection of symptom subsets that maximise the capture of cases given different laboratory capacities. The methodology may be of particular use for COVID-19 vaccine developers across a range of resource settings and have more far-reaching public health implications for detection of symptomatic SARS CoV2 infection.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed up to November 16, 2020, with the terms ""COVID-19"" OR ""SARS-CoV-2"" AND ""symptom"" AND ""community-based"", with no date or language restrictions, to find information about symptoms associated with COVID-19 from the community setting. The search retrieved 68 articles; however, most were not relevant as related to specific subgroups (e.g. pregnant women, cancer patients) or aspects (e.g. mental health, diagnostic testing). Fever, cough, dyspnoea, tachypnoea, anosmia, and ageusia are the symptoms most commonly identified in COVID-19 patients and typically included in guidelines from the WHO and similar bodies. These data however come primarily from hospital-based studies. An assessment of the value of symptom combinations in the community in predicting COVID-19 is lacking.

Added value of this studyWe present data from the largest, prospective community-based cohort study to date and quantify the contribution of various COVID-19 symptoms and symptom-combinations to RT-PCR positive COVID-19 case-finding. Our study is unique in that it simulates PCR testing in a clinical trial situation. Newly-symptomatic individuals were investigated at three days of symptom onset, and a second analysis of symptoms that occurred within seven days of symptom onset was also included to capture delayed symptom triggers. We confirm the significance of symptoms (e.g. fever, cough, anosmia/ageusia) widely used for triggering a RT-PCR test and identified additional symptoms such as fatigue, headache, sore throat, and diarrhoea to define the most efficient symptom combinations.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe applied methodology enables the selection of symptom subsets to maximise the capture of cases while taking account of specific laboratory capacity. Our findings have important implications for COVID-19 vaccine developers to optimise the choice of triggering symptoms for diagnostic work-up COVID-19 vaccine efficacy trials and also implications for public health due to the community-based nature of the data source used.","Michela Antonelli; Joan Capdevila; Amol Chaudhari; Julia Granerod; Liane Canas; Mark Graham; Kerstin Klaser; Marc Modat; Erica Moldeni; Ben Murray; Carole Sudre; Richard Davies; Anna May; Long Nguyen; David Drew; Amit Joshi; Andrew Chan; Jakob Cramer; Tim Spector; Jonathan Wolf; Sebastien Ourselin; Claire Steves; Alfred E Loeliger","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.23.20237313","20201124","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-30","",7588,""

"Online-Learning due to COVID-19 Improved Mental Health Among Medical Students","In reference to the announcement of the pandemic of the new coronavirus 2019-(nCoV), all educational institutions in the Republic of Kazakhstan have switched to online learning (OL). The purpose of this study was to investigate the mental state of the medical students switching to OL in comparison with the mental state of the students who had traditional learning (TL). A repeated questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was conducted among medical students ranging from 1st year to 5th year at Astana Medical University in the 2019-2020 academic year. The first study was conducted during the TL (October-November 2019, N = 619), and the second study was conducted during the OL period (April 2020, N = 798). Burnout syndrome, depression, anxiety, somatic symptoms, and satisfaction with academic performance have been studied. The findings revealed that prevalence of the burnout syndrome, depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms decreased after transitioning from TL to OL. However, during the OL period, the prevalence of colleague-related burnout increased, which tells us about the negative impact of OL on students' communication and interpersonal relationships. The most common depression and anxiety symptoms, dissatisfaction with academic performance were among students who indicated a decrease in academic performance during OL. Students who lived alone during the quarantine were more prone to depression during OL. In conclusion, during the quarantine period after the transition from TL to OL, the mental health state of medical students improved, despite the severe conditions of the pandemic.

"Anxiety, depression and PTSD among children and their parent during 2019 novelÂ coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in China","Home quarantine may lead to families developing a variety of psychological distress. The purpose of this study was to examine the psychological status of children and their parent during 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in China. Data were collected from children (n = 1360) and their parent (n = 1360) in China using online survey during February 2020. Demographic information, media exposure, and psychological status including anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms were assessed using self-report measures. The results indicated that, for children, 1.84% experienced moderate anxiety, 2.22% experienced depression and 3.16% met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD; for parent, 1.18%, 0.01% and 3.60% experienced moderate anxiety, severe depression, and moderate depression, respectively, and 3.53% met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD. Moreover, excessive media exposure (ÃŸ = -0.08 ~ 0.13, ps < 0.05) was a risk factor for anxiety and PTSD for children, a positive factor against anxiety and depression for parent. Being a mother (ÃŸ = 0.07 ~ 0.21, ps < 0.01), being younger (ÃŸ = -0.09 ~ -0.07, ps < 0.05), lower levels of educational attainment (ÃŸ = -0.17 ~ -0.08, ps < 0.01) and family monthly income (ÃŸ = -0.17 ~ -0.11, ps < 0.05) were risk factors for anxiety, depression and PTSD for parent. Findings suggested that children and their parent in non-severe area didn't suffer major psychological distress during the outbreak. Factors associated with lower levels of mental health problems were identified to inform the use of psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the pandemic.","Yue, Jinming; Zang, Xueyan; Le, Yunying; An, Yuanyuan","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12144-020-01191-4","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Curr Psychol;: 1-8, 2020 Nov 14.; Publication details: Curr Psychol;: 1-8, 2020 Nov 14.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-30","",7592,""

"The Relationships of Deteriorating Depression and Anxiety With Longitudinal Behavioral Changes in Google and YouTube Use During COVID-19: Observational Study","BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety disorders among the global population have worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, current methods for screening these two issues rely on in-person interviews, which can be expensive, time-consuming, and blocked by social stigma and quarantines. Meanwhile, how individuals engage with online platforms such as Google Search and YouTube has undergone drastic shifts due to COVID-19 and subsequent lockdowns. Such ubiquitous daily behaviors on online platforms have the potential to capture and correlate with clinically alarming deteriorations in depression and anxiety profiles of users in a noninvasive manner. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to examine, among college students in the United States, the relationships of deteriorating depression and anxiety conditions with the changes in user behaviors when engaging with Google Search and YouTube during COVID-19. METHODS: This study recruited a cohort of undergraduate students (N=49) from a US college campus during January 2020 (prior to the pandemic) and measured the anxiety and depression levels of each participant. The anxiety level was assessed via the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). The depression level was assessed via the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). This study followed up with the same cohort during May 2020 (during the pandemic), and the anxiety and depression levels were assessed again. The longitudinal Google Search and YouTube history data of all participants were anonymized and collected. From individual-level Google Search and YouTube histories, we developed 5 features that can quantify shifts in online behaviors during the pandemic. We then assessed the correlations of deteriorating depression and anxiety profiles with each of these features. We finally demonstrated the feasibility of using the proposed features to build predictive machine learning models. RESULTS: Of the 49 participants, 49% (n=24) of them reported an increase in the PHQ-9 depression scores; 53% (n=26) of them reported an increase in the GAD-7 anxiety scores. The results showed that a number of online behavior features were significantly correlated with deteriorations in the PHQ-9 scores (r ranging between -0.37 and 0.75, all P values less than or equal to .03) and the GAD-7 scores (r ranging between -0.47 and 0.74, all P values less than or equal to .03). Simple machine learning models were shown to be useful in predicting the change in anxiety and depression scores (mean squared error ranging between 2.37 and 4.22, R2 ranging between 0.68 and 0.84) with the proposed features. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that deteriorating depression and anxiety conditions have strong correlations with behavioral changes in Google Search and YouTube use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Though further studies are required, our results demonstrate the feasibility of using pervasive online data to establish noninvasive surveillance systems for mental health conditions that bypasses many disadvantages of existing screening methods.","Zhang, Boyu; Zaman, Anis; Silenzio, Vincent; Kautz, Henry; Hoque, Ehsan","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/24012","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;7(11): e24012, 2020 Nov 23.; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;7(11): e24012, 2020 Nov 23.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-30","",7594,""
"Digital Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia Promotes Later Health Resilience During the Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) Pandemic","Stressful life events contribute to insomnia, psychosocial functioning, and illness. Though individuals with a history of insomnia may be especially vulnerable during stressful life events, risk may be mitigated by prior intervention. This study evaluated the effect of prior digital cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I) versus sleep education on health resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID impact, insomnia, general- and COVID-related stress, depression, and global health were assessed in April 2020 in adults with a history of insomnia who completed a randomized controlled trial of dCBT-I (n = 102) versus sleep education control (n = 106) in 2016-2017. Regression analyses were used to evaluate the effect of intervention conditions on subsequent stress and health during the pandemic. Insomnia symptoms were significantly associated with COVID-19 related disruptions, and those previously received dCBT-I reported less insomnia symptoms, less general stress and COVID-related cognitive intrusions, less depression, and better global health than those who received sleep education. Moreover, the odds for resurgent insomnia was 51% lower in the dCBT-I versus control condition. Similarly, odds of moderate to severe depression during COVID-19 was 57% lower in the dCBT-I condition. Those who received dCBT-I had increased health resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic in adults with a history of insomnia and ongoing mild to moderate mental health symptoms. These data provide evidence that dCBT-I is a powerful tool to promote mental and physical health during stressors, including the COVID-19 pandemic.","Cheng, Casement, Kalmbach, Castelan, Drake","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsaa258","20201129","CBT-I; COVID-19; depression; digital health; engagement; insomnia; prevention; primary care; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-30","",7595,""
"Maladaptive coping with the infodemic and sleep disturbance in the COVID-19 pandemic","COVID-19 is caused by a novel virus with an unknown aetiology. People across the globe are dealing with not only a health crisis but also an 'infodemic', a term coined by the World Health Organization to refer to the avalanche of contradictory information that is arousing widespread confusion and anxiety. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of anxiety and sleep disturbance at the early stage of the pandemic, and unveil the information coping process underlying differential susceptibility to COVID-19 infection anxiety and sleep disturbance. The participants were 1,270 adults (47% men, M<sub>age</sub> Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 42.82) from the UK and US who completed initial (Time 1) and follow-up (Time 2) surveys from 16 to 22 March and 18 to 24 May 2020, respectively. The prevalence of probable clinically relevant anxiety was 61% and 45% at the first and second time points, and more than half of the participants in this anxiety group also reported mild to severe sleep disturbance. Moreover, 41% of the participants perceived themselves as not having enough COVID-19-related information and reported higher levels of COVID-19 infection anxiety and sleep disturbance over time than those who perceived themselves as having enough of such information. Moderated mediation analysis identified two groups who were more vulnerable to both psychological problems: high blunters who sought COVID-19-related information online more frequently and high monitors who sought such information offline less frequently. These findings highlight the importance of a good match between information coping style and strategy deployment in dealing with an infodemic surrounding a novel disease.","Cheng, Ebrahimi, Lau","https://doi.org/10.1111/jsr.13235","20201128","epidemic; mental health; outbreak; psychological distress; sleep health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-30","",7596,""

"Coronaviruses in Children: A Review of Potential Mechanisms of Childhood Protection","The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread worldwide and the number of cases continues to rise exponentially. Epidemiologic reports indicate that severity of illness increases with age. However, the reasons behind the relative protection of children and infants are unclear. Whether the rationale is host-related or virus-dependent is important to determine since the latter could change with viral mutations. We review factors that could affect the susceptibility of children to the novel coronavirus. We search publications indexed on PUBMED. Descriptions of the pathophysiology of current and previous coronavirus infections suggest several viral targets and immunomodulatory pathways affecting the severity of illness. There is limited evidence to suggest age-variability of viral cell receptors and transmembrane co-factors required for coronavirus entry and replication. However, the ensuing cytokine storm and the effect of higher melatonin in children are age-dependent and could explain decreased disease variability in children. We believe that current evidence suggests host factors can play a role in disease severity in children and thus may remain protective despite potential virus mutation in the future. However, we recognize and discuss avenues of future research that can further illuminate the reasons children are protected from severe COVID-19 illness.","Rabi, Al Zoubi, Al-Iede, Kasasbeh, Badran","https://doi.org/10.1111/apa.15691","20201128","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-30","",7598,""
"The Role of Telemental Health, Tele-consultation, and Tele-supervision in Post-disaster and Low-resource Settings","The goal of this paper was to review recent literature and provide recommendations regarding the use of telemental health, with a focus on tele-consultation and tele-supervision in post-disaster and low-resource settings, including the impact of COVID-19. The latest research on mental health needs in low-resource settings has identified a high need for mental health services for difficult-to-reach and underserved populations. Research on tele-consultation and tele-supervision was reviewed and found that tele-consultation and tele-supervision to be an effective modality for insuring quality mental health care delivery in low-resource settings. Additionally, two case studies were included which illustrate the use of both tele-consultation and tele-supervision in low-resource low- and middle-income settings. The paper concludes that tele-consultation and tele-supervision hold the promise to narrow the gap in quality mental health services in low-resource settings so often impacted by disaster and conflict. The authors recommend that telemental health training be developed that specifically enhances consultants' and supervisors' skills in tele-consultation and tele-supervision.","Augusterfer, O'Neal, Martin, Sheikh, Mollica","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-020-01209-5","20201128","COVID-19; Consultation; Disaster response; Supervision; Telemental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-30","",7599,""
"Mental health of Urban Mothers (MUM) study: a multicentre randomised controlled trial, study protocol","Mental health disorders are common during pregnancy and the postnatal period and can have serious adverse effects on women and their children. The consequences for global mental health due to COVID-19 are likely to be significant and may have a long-term impact on the global burden of disease. Besides physical vulnerability, pregnant women are at increased risk of mental health problems such as anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder due to the consequences of social distancing. It can result in altered healthcare routines, less support from the family and friends, and in some cases, partners not being allowed to be present during prenatal visits, labour and delivery. Higher than expected, rates of perinatal anxiety and depression have been already reported during the pandemic. Pregnant women may also feel insecure and worried about the effects of COVID-19 on their unborn child if they get infected during pregnancy. Today, young urban women are used to using internet services frequently and efficiently. Therefore, providing mental health support to pregnant women via internet may be effective in ameliorating their anxiety/depression, reducing the risk of serious mental health disorders, and lead to improved maternal and perinatal outcomes. Our aim is to explore the effectiveness of a web-based psychosocial peer-to-peer support intervention in reducing the risk and severity of perinatal mental health disorders and preventing adverse pregnancy outcomes among pregnant women living in metropolitan urban settings. We plan to conduct a multicentre prospective randomised controlled trial, Mental health of Urban Mothers trial. Pregnant women living in large metropolitan cities will be recruited using internet-based application through non-profit organisations' websites. The women who consent will be randomised to receive a web-based peer-to-peer support intervention or usual care. Data will be analysed to identify the effects of intervention on Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Score and Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7 scores as well as pregnancy outcomes. The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on maternal stress will be assesed using Impact Event Scale-R. Any differences in outcomes between cities will be addressed in subgroup analyses. The study will be conducted according to the principles of Good Clinical Practice and will follow the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

"Upper extremity emergencies during SARS-COV-2 pandemic: Turnout trends","During the SARS-COV-2 pandemic and consequent government measures to prevent the overwhelming of public hospitals, emergency department (ED) orthopaedic turnout was significantly altered. This study compared the turnout of patients with upper extremity (UE) and hand &amp; wrist (H&amp;W) emergencies during the SARS-COV-2 pandemic, with the same period of 2019, in the public and private sector. Data from a two-month period [March 23, 2020 (application of severe restrictions of civilian circulation) to May 18, 2020 (two weeks after lockdown cessation)] were collected from a public-university hospital and a private hospital and were compared with data from the same &quot;normal&quot; period in 2019. During the pandemic, the number of patients with orthopaedic, UE, and H&amp;W problems was significantly reduced by 57.09%, 49.77%, 49.92% respectively (p&lt;0.001) compared to 2019. However, the ratios of UE/total orthopaedic emergencies and of H&amp;W/total orthopaedic emergencies increased significantly during the pandemic from 37.17% to 43.32% and from 25.07% to 29.15% (p=0.006 and p&lt;0.001) respectively, compared to 2019. In the private sector, the turnout Ã‚Â was increased for patients with UE problems (8.82%, p=0.67) and H&amp;W problems (24.39%, p=0.3), while in the public sector the turnout was significantly decreased for UE (49.77%, p&lt;0.001) and H&amp;W problems (49.92%, p&lt;0.001) in 2020 compared to 2019. The extent of lockdown was unprecedented in recent years. The reduction of orthopaedic, UE and H&amp;W emergencies during lockdown can be attributed to the fear of contracting the virus in the hospitals and even more in hospitals serving as COVID-19 reference centers. Despite the decrease -in absolute numbers- of patients, the increased percentages of UE to total orthopaedic and of H&amp;W to total orthopaedic emergencies in 2020 in both hospitals, reflect the new hobbies' uptake and the increase of domestic accidents during the lockdown, despite overall activity decrease, and underline the necessity of presence of hand surgeons in the EDs. This is one of the very few population-based studies worldwide to show trends in incidence of different injuries of the UE at a regional level during the pandemic, and its results could affect future health care policies.","Fyllos, Varitimidis, Papageorgiou, Karamanis, Alexiou, Veloni, Malizos, Dailiana","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.injury.2020.11.045","20201128","Emergency department; Hand; SARS-COV-2 pandemic; Turnout; Upper extremity; Wrist","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-30","",7601,""
"Can COVID-19 pandemic boost the epidemic of neurodegenerative diseases?","The pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents the world with the medical challenge associated with multifactorial nature of this pathology. Indeed COVID-19 affects several organs and systems and presents diversified clinical picture. COVID-19 affects the brain in many ways including direct infection of neural cells with SARS-CoV-2, severe systemic inflammation which floods the brain with pro-inflammatory agents thus damaging nervous cells, global brain ischaemia linked to a respiratory failure, thromboembolic strokes related to increased intravascular clotting and severe psychological stress. Often the COVID-19 is manifested by neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms that include dizziness, disturbed sleep, cognitive deficits, delirium, hallucinations and depression. All these indicate the damage to the nervous tissue which may substantially increase the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases and promote dementia.","Verkhratsky, Li, Melino, Melino, Shi","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13062-020-00282-3","20201128","Brain; COVID-19; Cognitive deficits, neurodegeneration; SARS-Cov-2; Systemic inflammation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-30","",7602,""
"Psychological distress among infectious disease physicians during the response to the COVID-19 outbreak in the Republic of Korea","This study aimed to investigate psychological distress among infectious disease (ID) physicians during the coronavirus diseaseÃ‚Â 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in the Republic of Korea. Using an online-based survey link sent via text message and email, we conducted a survey from April 21 to 25, 2020, targeting all ID physicians currently working in ID (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°265). The questionnaire was based on the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales, and information was collected on factors protecting against psychological distress and difficulties in relation to COVID-19. Of 265 ID physicians, 115 (43.3%) responded, showing burnout (97, 90.4%), depression (20, 17.4%), anxiety (23, 20.0%), and stress (5, 4.3%). There were no differences in terms of distress between ID physicians who were directly involved in the care of patients with COVID-19 or not. Greater than 50% of physicians valued their work and felt recognized by others, whereas &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°10% indicated that sufficient human and financial support and private time had been provided during the outbreak. The most challenging issues concerned a lack of attending physicians caring for COVID-19 patients or infection control practitioners, a shortage of personal protective equipment or airborne infection isolation rooms, pressure for research, and lack of guidelines for COVID-19 management. During the COVID-19 outbreak in the Republic of Korea, most respondents reported psychological distress.

"A bioinformatic approach to investigating cytokine genes and their receptor variants in relation to COVID-19 progression","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection produces a wide spectrum of manifestations, ranging from no symptom to viral pneumonia. This study aimed to determine the genetic variations in cytokines and their receptors in relation to COVID-19 pathogenesis using bioinformatic tools. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of genes encoding the cytokines and cytokine receptors elevated in patients with COVID-19 were determined from the National Biotechnology Information Center website (using the dbSNP database). Missense variants were found in 3 cytokine genes and 10 cytokine receptor genes. Computational analyses were conducted to detect the effects of these missense SNPs via cloud-based software tools. Also, the miRSNP database was used to explore whether SNPs in the 3'-UTR altered the miRNA binding efficiency for genes of cytokines and their receptors. Our in silico studies revealed that one SNP in the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) gene was predicted as deleterious using sorting intolerant from tolerant. Also, the stability of VEGFR2 decreased in the I-Mutant2.0 (biotool for predicting stability changes upon mutation from the protein sequence or structure) prediction. It was suggested that the decrease in VEGFR2 function (due to the rs1870377 polymorphism) may be correlated with the progression of COVID-19 or contribute to the pathogenesis. Moreover, 27 SNPs were determined to affect miRNA binding for the genes of cytokine receptors. CXCR2 rs1126579, TNFRSF1B rs1061624 and IL10RB rs8178562 SNPs were predicted to break the miRNA-mRNA binding sites for miR-516a-3, miR-720 and miR-328, respectively. These miRNAs play an important role in immune regulation and lung damage repair. Further studies are needed to evaluate the importance of these miRNAs and the SNPs.","Karakas Celik, Cakmak Genc, Dursun","https://doi.org/10.1111/iji.12522","20201127","COVID-19; CXCR2; IL10RB; TNFRSF1B; VEGFR2; cytokine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-30","",7604,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic Infection in Patients Admitted to the Hospital for Reasons Other Than COVID-19 Infection","COVID-19 or SARS CoV-2 is a worldwide public health emergency. The first case of COVID-19 was described in Wuhan, China in December, 2019 and within a short time the infection had spread quickly to the rest of China and then the world. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a huge impact on patients who do not have COVID-19 but other diseases like cancer, diabetes, and many more non-communicable diseases; their care is compromised because of the pandemic.Ã‚Â COVID-19 also poses a work-related health risk for healthcare workers who are treating patients with COVID-19, and many have themselves become infected.

"Mental health of clinical staff working in high-risk epidemic and pandemic health emergencies a rapid review of the evidence and living meta-analysis","The SARS-CoV-2 / COVID-19 pandemic has raised concerns about the potential mental health impact on frontline clinical staff. However, given that poor mental health is common in acute medical staff, we aimed to estimate the additional burden of work involving high exposure to infected patients. We report a rapid review, meta-analysis, and living meta-analysis of studies using validated measures from outbreaks of COVID-19, Ebola, H1N1 influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). A random effects meta-analysis found that high-exposure work is not associated with an increased prevalence of above cut-off scoring (anxiety: RRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.30, 95% CI 0.87-1.93, Total NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°12,473; PTSD symptoms: RRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.16, 95% CI 0.75-1.78, Total NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6604; depression: RRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.50, 95% CI 0.57-3.95, Total NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°12,224). For continuous scoring, high-exposure work was associated with only a small additional burden of acute mental health problems compared to low-exposure work (anxiety: SMDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.16, 95% CI 0.02-0.31, Total NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6493; PTSD symptoms: SMDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.20, 95% CI 0.01-0.40, Total NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5122; depression: SMDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.13, 95% CI -0.04-0.31, Total NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4022). There was no evidence of publication bias. Although epidemic and pandemic response work may add only a small additional burden, improving mental health through service management and provision of mental health services should be a priority given that baseline rates of poor mental health are already very high.

"Emerging mental health challenges, strategies, and opportunities in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic: Perspectives from South American decision-makers","To identify emerging mental health problems, strategies to address them, and opportunities to reform mental health systems during the COVID-19 pandemic in South America. An online questionnaire was sent to mental health decision-makers of ministries of health in 10 South American countries in mid-April 2020. The semi-structured questionnaire had 12 questions clustered into three main sections: emerging challenges in mental health, current and potential strategies to face the pandemic, and key elements for mental health reform. We identified keywords and themes for each section through summative content analysis. Increasing mental health burden and needs were reported as direct and indirect consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. National lockdowns challenge the delivery and access to mental health treatment and care. Strategies to meet mental health needs rely heavily on timely and adequate responses by strengthened mental health governance and systems, availability of services, virtual platforms, and appropriate capacity-building for service providers. Short- and medium-term strategies focused on bolstering community-based mental health networks and telemedicine for high-risk populations. Opportunities for long-term mental health reform entail strengthening legal frameworks, redistribution of financial resources, and collaboration with local and international partners. Mental health and psychosocial support have been identified as a priority area by South American countries in the COVID-19 response. The pandemic has generated specific needs that require appropriate actions, including implementing virtual interventions, orienting capacity-building toward protecting users and health providers, strengthening evidence-driven decision-making, and integrating mental health and psychosocial support in high-level mechanisms guiding the response to COVID-19. Determinar los problemas de salud mental emergentes, las estrategias para abordarlos y las oportunidades para reformar los sistemas de salud durante la pandemia de COVID-19 en AmÃƒÂ©rica del Sur. A mediados de abril del 2020, se enviÃƒÂ³ un cuestionario en lÃƒÂ­nea a los encargados de tomar decisiones en materia de salud mental en los Ministerios de Salud de diez paÃƒÂ­ses de AmÃƒÂ©rica del Sur. El cuestionario semiestructurado consistÃƒÂ­a en doce preguntas agrupadas en tres secciones principales: desafÃƒÂ­os emergentes en materia de salud mental, estrategias actuales y posibles para enfrentar la pandemia, y elementos clave para la reforma de la salud mental. Establecimos palabras clave y temas para cada secciÃƒÂ³n mediante el anÃƒÂ¡lisis del contenido sumativo. Se informÃƒÂ³ un aumento de la carga y las necesidades en materia de salud mental como consecuencia directa e indirecta de la pandemia de COVID-19. Los confinamientos a nivel nacional representan un desafÃƒÂ­o en la prestaciÃƒÂ³n y el acceso al tratamiento y la atenciÃƒÂ³n de la salud mental. Las estrategias para satisfacer las necesidades de salud mental dependen en gran medida de las respuestas oportunas y adecuadas, que requieren el fortalecimiento de la gobernanza y de los sistemas en el ÃƒÂ¡mbito de la salud mental, la disponibilidad de servicios y plataformas virtuales, y la formaciÃƒÂ³n de capacidad apropiada para los prestadores de servicios. Las estrategias a corto y mediano plazo se centran en reforzar las redes comunitarias de salud mental y la telemedicina para los grupos poblacionales de alto riesgo. Las oportunidades para la reforma de la salud mental a largo plazo entraÃƒÂ±an fortalecer los marcos jurÃƒÂ­dicos, la redistribuciÃƒÂ³n de los recursos financieros y la colaboraciÃƒÂ³n con los asociados a nivel nacional e internacional. En los paÃƒÂ­ses de AmÃƒÂ©rica del Sur, se ha determinado que la salud mental y el apoyo psicosocial son un ÃƒÂ¡rea prioritaria en la respuesta a la COVID-19. La pandemia ha generado necesidades especÃƒÂ­ficas que requieren medidas apropiadas, como las intervenciones virtuales, la orientaciÃƒÂ³n de la formaciÃƒÂ³n de capacidad hacia la protecciÃƒÂ³n de los usuarios y prestadores de servicios de salud, el fortalecimiento de la toma de decisiones basadas en la evidencia, y la integraciÃƒÂ³n de la salud mental y el apoyo psicosocial en los mecanismos de alto nivel que guÃƒÂ­an la respuesta a la COVID-19.

O aumento das necessidades e da carga sobre os serviÃƒÂ§os de saÃƒÂºde mental foram descritos como consequÃƒÂªncias diretas e indiretas da pandemia de COVID-19. As medidas de confinamento implementadas pelos governos nacionais dificultam o acesso e a prestaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o de cuidados e tratamentos de saÃƒÂºde mental. As estratÃƒÂ©gias para atender ÃƒÂ s necessidades de saÃƒÂºde mental dependem de respostas rÃƒÂ¡pidas e adequadas atravÃƒÂ©s do fortalecimento da governanÃƒÂ§a e dos sistemas de saÃƒÂºde mental, da disponibilidade de serviÃƒÂ§os, de plataformas virtuais e da capacitaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o apropriada dos prestadores de serviÃƒÂ§os. As estratÃƒÂ©gias de curto e mÃƒÂ©dio prazo se concentraram no reforÃƒÂ§o das redes comunitÃƒÂ¡rias de saÃƒÂºde mental e da telemedicina para as populaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂµes de alto risco. As oportunidades de reforma da saÃƒÂºde mental a longo prazo implicam o fortalecimento dos quadros jurÃƒÂ­dicos, a redistribuiÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o de recursos financeiros e a colaboraÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o com parceiros locais e internacionais.

"Rejuveinix Shows a Favorable Clinical Safety Profile in Human Subjects and Exhibits Potent Preclinical Protective Activity in the Lipopolysaccharide-Galactosamine Mouse Model of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and Multi-Organ Failure","<b>Background:</b> New treatment platforms that can prevent acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or reduce its mortality rate in high-risk coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, such as those with an underlying cancer, are urgently needed. Rejuveinix (RJX) is an intravenous formulation of anti-oxidants and anti-inflammatory agents. Its active ingredients include ascorbic acid, cyanocobalamin, thiamine hydrochloride, riboflavin 5' phosphate, niacinamide, pyridoxine hydrochloride, and calcium D-pantothenate. RJX is being developed as an anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant treatment platform for patients with sepsis, including COVID-19 patients with viral sepsis and ARDS. Here, we report its clinical safety profile in a phase 1 clinical study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03680105) and its potent protective activity in the lipopolysaccharide galactosamine (LPS-GalN) mouse model of ARDS. <b>Methods:</b> A phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, two-part, ascending dose-escalation study was performed in participating 76 healthy volunteer human subjects in compliance with the ICH (E6) good clinical practice guidelines to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of RJX (Protocol No. RPI003; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03680105). The ability of RJX to prevent fatal shock, ARDS, and multi-organ failure was examined in the well-established LPS-GalN mouse model of sepsis and ARDS. Standard methods were employed for the statistical analysis of data in both studies. <b>Findings:</b> In the phase 1 clinical study, no participant developed serious adverse events (SAEs) or Grade 3-Grade 4 adverse events (AEs) or prematurely discontinued participation in the study. In the non-clinical study, RJX exhibited potent and dose-dependent protective activity, decreased the inflammatory cytokine responses (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, transforming growth factor beta), and improved survival in the LPS-GalN mouse model of sepsis and ARDS. Histopathological examinations showed that RJX attenuated the LPS-GalN induced acute lung injury (ALI) and pulmonary edema as well as liver damage. <b>Conclusion:</b> RJX showed a very favorable safety profile and tolerability in human subjects.

Police officers are bravely fighting on the front lines of the epidemic. The main purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence and severity of psychological responses among police officers during the COVID-19 pandemic and find influencing factors in depression and anxiety. A cross-sectional online questionnaire was administered to police officers in Wuhu through WeChat, and data were collected between March 10 and 26, 2020. A total of 3,561 questionnaires were received, of which 3,517 were considered valid. The questionnaires included demographic information and a psychological survey. The depression scale of the Patient Health QuestionnaireQ9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale were utilized to assess depression and anxiety, respectively. The mean depression score of participants was 4.10Ã‚Â±4.87 (0-27), and 12.17%had moderate-severe depression. The mean anxiety score of participants was 3.59Ã‚Â±4.228 (0-21), and 8.79% had moderate-severe anxiety. Older and married police officers were at higher risk of anxiety. Those with a bachelor's degree or above, living near the city center, and taking sleeping pills were at greater risk of depression and anxiety. Auxiliary police had lower depression and anxiety scores. Depression scores were strongly correlated withanxiety scores (<i>r</i>=0.863, <i>p</i>&lt;0.001). Our findings identify factors associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety that can be utilized to develop psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable populations during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Yuan, Zhu, Chen, Cheng, Yang, Zhou, Zhu, Wu, Zhou, Zha","https://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S269886","20201128","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; police officers; psychological responses","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-30","",7610,""
"Assessing the Impact of COVID-19 on the Mental Health of Healthcare Workers in Three Metropolitan Cities of Pakistan","The COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-2019) has been associated with psychological distress during its rapid rise period in Pakistan. The present study aimed to assess the mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs) in the three metropolitan cities of Pakistan. A cross-sectional, web-based study was conducted in 276 HCWs from April 10, 2020, to June 5, 2020. Depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS-21) were used for the mental health assessment of the HCWs. Multivariable logistic regression analysis (MLRA) was performed to measure the association between the demographics and the occurrence of depression, anxiety, and stress (DAS). The frequency of DAS in the HCWs was 10.1%, 25.4%, and 7.3%, respectively. The MLRA showed that the depression in HCWs was significantly associated with the profession (P&lt;0.001). The anxiety in HCWs was significantly associated with their age (P=0.005), profession (P&lt;0.05), and residence (P&lt;0.05). The stress in HCWs was significantly associated with their age (P&lt;0.05). This study was conducted in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the number of COVID-19 cases was on the rise in Pakistan and it only represents a definite period (April to June 2020). The symptoms of DAS are present in the HCWs of Pakistan and to manage the psychological health of HCWs, there is a need for the initiation of psychological well-being programs.","Arshad, Hussain, Nafees, Majeed, Imran, Saeed, Hashmi, Akbar, Abrar, Ramzan, Chaudhry, Islam, Usman, Nisar, Rasool","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S282069","20201128","DASS-21; anxiety; depression; pandemic; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-30","",7611,""
"Assessing international alcohol consumption patterns during isolation from the COVID-19 pandemic using an online survey: highlighting negative emotionality mechanisms","The COVID-19 pandemic has required drastic safety measures to control virus spread, including an extended self-isolation period. Stressful situations increase alcohol craving and consumption in alcohol use disorder (AUD) and non-AUD drinkers. Thus, we assessed how COVID-19 related stress may have affected drinking behaviours in the general population. We developed an online cross-sectional survey, Habit Tracker (HabiT), which measured changes in drinking behaviours before and during COVID-19 quarantine. We also assessed psychiatric factors such as anxiety, depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and impulsivity (Short-Impulsive Behavior Scale). Lastly, we related drinking behaviours to COVID-19 specific stress factors. HabiT was released internationally, with individuals from 83 countries participating. Participants were included if they were 18 years of age or older and confirmed they were proficient in English. The survey was completed by 2873 adults with 1346 usable data (46.9% accurately completed). Primary outcome measures were change in amount and severity of drinking behaviours before and during quarantine, and current drinking severity during quarantine. Although drinking behaviours decreased overall during quarantine, 36% reported an increase in alcohol use. Those who increased alcohol use during quarantine were older individuals (95% CI 0.04 to 0.1, p&lt;0.0001), essential workers (95% CI -0.58 to -0.1, p=0.01), individuals with children (95% CI -12.46 to 0.0, p=0.003), those with a personal relationship with someone severely ill from COVID-19 (95% CI -2 to -0.38, p=0.01) and those with higher depression (95% CI 0.67 to 1.45, p&lt;0.0001), anxiety (95% CI 0.61 to 1.5, p=0.0002), and positive urgency impulsivity (95% CI 0.16 to 0.72, p=0.009). Furthermore, country-level subsample analyses indicated that drinking amount (95% CI 9.36 to 13.13, p=0.003) increased in the UK during quarantine. Our findings highlight a role for identifying those vulnerable for alcohol misuse during periods of self-isolation and underscore the theoretical mechanism of negative emotionality underlying drinking behaviours driven by stress. Limitations include a large degree of study dropout (n=1515). Future studies should assess the long-term effects of isolation on drinking behaviours.","Sallie, Ritou, Bowden-Jones, Voon","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-044276","20201127","COVID-19; depression &amp; mood disorders; psychiatry; public health; substance misuse","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-30","",7612,""
"Exploring the impact of COVID-19 and restrictions to daily living as a result of social distancing within veterans with pre-existing mental health difficulties","Data are emerging showing the adverse consequences on mental health of the general public due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Little is known about the needs of veterans with pre-existing mental health difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected through a cross-sectional online survey from a randomly selected sample (n=1092) of military veterans who have sought help for mental health difficulties from a veteran-specific UK-based charity. The response rate was 25.2% (n=275). Participants were asked to complete a range of standardised mental health outcomes (post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist, common mental health difficulties (CMDs): 12-Item General Health Questionnaire, difficulties with anger: 5-Item Dimensions of Anger Reactions-Revised and alcohol misuse: Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test) and endorse a list of potential stressors related to changes to daily life resulting from COVID-19. Regression analyses were fitted to explore predictors of mental health severity. It was observed that symptoms of common mental disorder and PTSD (69.3% and 65.0%, respectively) were the most commonly reported to have been exacerbated by the pandemic. Lack of social support and reporting increasing numbers of stressors related to COVID-19 were consistently associated with increasing severity of a range of mental health difficulties. Our findings suggest veterans who had pre-existing mental health difficulties prior to the outbreak of COVID-19 may be at increased risk of experiencing CMDs as a result of the pandemic. Intervening to improve levels of social support and offering practical guidance to better manage any additional stressors relating to the pandemic may provide strategies to help reduce the burden of mental health symptoms.","Murphy, Williamson, Baumann, Busuttil, Fear","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjmilitary-2020-001622","20201127","anxiety disorders; depression &amp; mood disorders; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-30","",7613,""
"Confinement variables by COVID-19 predictors of anxious and depressive symptoms in pregnant women","The appearance of a highly contagious disease forced the confinement of the population in almost all parts of the world, causing an increase in psychological problems, with pregnant women being a particularly vulnerable group to suffer negative consequences. The aim of this research was to check which confinement or psychological stress variables are related to the increase of anxious and depressive symptoms in pregnant women, as a consequence of the pandemic caused by the COVID-19. The sample was composed of 131 pregnant women who experienced the confinement imposed by the Government of Spain on March 14, 2020. Sociodemographic, obstetric, confinement related and psychological variables were collected. Perceived stress, pregnancy-specific stress, as well as insomnia are predictive variables in most anxious (obsessions and compulsions, anxiety and phobic anxiety) and depressive symptoms related to COVID-19. It is important to focus future psychological interventions in this population on stress control and sleep monitoring, since these variables influence the increase of anxiety and depression.","Romero-Gonzalez, Puertas-Gonzalez, MariÃƒÂ±o-Narvaez, Peralta-Ramirez","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medcli.2020.10.002","20201127","Ansiedad; Anxiety; COVID-19; DepresiÃƒÂ³n; Depression; Embarazo; EstrÃƒÂ©s; Pregnancy; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-30","",7614,""
"Analysis of anxiety-related factors amongst frontline dental staff during the COVID-19 pandemic in Yichang, China","Dental staff were characterized with the tolerance of enduring stress and they are at a high risk to respiratory infectious disease. This study compared the anxiety level of the frontline dental staff (FDS) to the general public in Yichang during the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and examined potential explanatory factors to the differences. Two online questionnaires were used separately to collect data from FDS and the general public. The Chinese version of Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) was included for the assessment of anxiety. Firstly, a Chi-square test was conducted to compare the anxiety state between these two groups. Then, a bivariate analysis using Cramer's V and Eta squared was conducted to find the potential factors. Lastly, a binary logistic regression was performed to examine the association between potential factors and the anxiety state of FDS. In general, FDS were 4.342 (95% CI: 2.427-7.768) times more likely to suffer from anxiety disorders than the general public. The bivariate analysis showed that age, Level Three Protective Measures (PM-3), conflicts with patients and/or colleagues were moderately associated with the anxiety state of FDS. But the knowledge of COVID-19, the treatment to suspected or confirmed cases both had a weak association with the anxiety among FDS. Conversely, workload, the exposure to potential infectious substance and conducting aerosol generated performance were not significantly related to the anxiety of FDS. As the model indicated, an elder age and PM-3 protective measures could lower the anxiety state of FDS, whereas the conflict with patients or/and colleagues would worsen it. During the COVID-19 pandemic, FDS were more likely to suffer from anxiety disorders than the general public. An elder age, sufficient personal protective measures and good relationships with colleagues and patients would help them to maintain good mental health.","Zhao, Cao, Sun, Zhang, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12903-020-01335-9","20201129","Anxiety disorders; Becker anxiety inventory; COVID-19; Frontline dental staff","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-30","",7615,""

"Prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress in china during COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review with meta-analysis","The novel coronavirus disease which is believed to have initially originated in Wuhan city of China at the end of 2019 was declared as pandemic by March 2020 by WHO. This pandemic significantly impacted the mental health of communities around the globe. This project draws data from available research to quantify COVID-19 mental health issues and its prevalence in China during the early period of the COVID-19 crisis. It is believed that this pooling of data will give fair estimate of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. We conducted this study in accordance with PRISMA guidelines 2009. The protocol for this review is registered and published in PROSPERO (CRD42020182893). The databases used were Pubmed, Medline, Google scholar and Scopus. The studies were extracted according to pre-defined eligibility criteria and risk of bias assessment was conducted. The Meta-analysis was done using OpenMeta [analyst]. Total of 62382 participants in nineteen studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Stress was the most prevalent (48.1%) mental health consequence of Covid-19 pandemic, followed by depression (26.9%) and anxiety (21.8%). After performing subgroup analysis, prevalence of depression and anxiety in both females and frontline health care workers were high as compared to the prevalence in general Chinese population. The prevalence of depression and anxiety is moderately high whereas pooled prevalence of stress was found to be very high in Chinese people during this Covid-19 crisis.","Bareeqa, Ahmed, Samar, Yasin, Zehra, Monese, Gouthro","https://doi.org/10.1177/0091217420978005","20201127","China; Covid-19; anxiety; depression; health care worker; mental health; pandemic; psychological impact; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-30","",7617,""

"Paternal Depression & Anxiety During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed family functioning and increased parenting demands, leading to increased risk for poor psychosocial outcomes. Emerging evidence underscores the significant impact the pandemic has had on maternal mental health concerns. In contrast, paternal mental health has yet to be described. The current study describes the prevalence of depression and anxiety in fathers of young children as well as associated risk and protective factors. Methods: As part of the Parenting during the Pandemic study, fathers (N = 70) of children age 0-8 years old self-reported on mental health symptoms and additional concerns, while mothers (N = 236) provided a partner-report of father perinatal depression. Results:. Clinically significant depression (37.1%) and anxiety (22.9%) were prevalent in fathers. Partner reported perinatal depression was prevalent in 61.9% of fathers. Higher financial strain and previous mental health history were associated with increased risk of both depression and anxiety. Maternal report of paternal depression was associated with higher financial strain, greater number of children in the home, and lower maternal-reported marital quality. Limitations: The current study used cross-sectional data from an online cohort. The sample size limits the generalizability of the findings; future research should continue evaluating this important topic with larger samples. Conclusions: Compared to pre-pandemic population comparisons, paternal depression and anxiety are elevated in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Intervention recommendations and implications are discussed.","Emily E Cameron et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46245-CFF-468","20201129","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Mental Disorders; mental health; anxiety; covid-19; depression; paternal","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-30","",7619,""
"The Impact of Covid-19 on Trumpâ€™s Electoral Demise","Did the Covid-19 crisis have a significant effect on Trump's electoral demise? We present survey experimental evidence on two substantial effects of the pandemic. First, the unprecedented economic downturn significantly depressed Trump's popular support across all partisan groups, and especially among middle-low and low-income respondents. Second, the poor public health record of the Trump administration reduced its electoral prospects in 25 percentage points among citizens aged between 55 and 70 years old. By contrast, populist attitudes proved to have a negligible effect on the outcome. We conclude that the 2020 election was a normal contest compatible with theories of economic voting and political competence. Our results cast doubts on the role of populism as a major and permanent electoral driver of Trumpâ€™s base, and suggest that democratic accountability is a powerful determinant of the fate of political outsiders once in power.","Sergi Pardos-Prado et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460CB-FBD-95F","20201128","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics; economic voting; trump; survey experiment; covid-19","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-30","",7620,""
