"Stressors, Manifestations and Course of COVID-19 Related Distress Among Nurses and Midwives in Tasmania","Introduction The deleterious effects relating to the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of healthcare workers has now been widely established. Understanding how COVID-19 affects their work and life is complex and multidimensional. This longitudinal study describes the critical stressors and how they manifest within both the work and larger social environment for nurses and midwives in Tasmania, Australia. Methods This longitudinal, descriptive survey explores the trajectory of the psychological health of Tasmanian public sector nurses and midwives during the COIVD-19 pandemic. The survey was distributed at 3 timepoints over a 12-month period and consisted of a battery of psychological tests which included the Patient Health Questionnaire, General Anxiety Disorder, Insomnia Severity Index, and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised, together with free text comments. Analysis The associations between outcome and predictor variables were assessed using mixed effects linear regression and linear mixed model analyses. Free text comments were themed. Results High levels of stress and mental exhaustion were attributed to threatened workplace team culture; compromised quality of patient care; the impact on family, home, financial and economic domains; lack of clear communication; issues surrounding personal protective equipment; and female gender. Study data show younger nurses and midwives suffered higher levels of stress and mental exhaustion than older. Conclusion This study highlights the need for stable and functional relationships at home and at work for nurses and midwives. Factors which will help preserve the mental health of nurses and midwives include strong workplace culture with ongoing processes to monitor organisational burnout; building resilience, particularly among younger nurses and midwives; protection of healthcare worker safety; clear communication processes and supporting stable and functional relationships at home. The health service has an imperative to ensure optimum service delivery by safeguarding staff, despite the inevitable health stress imposed by the nature of the work.","Kathryn M Marsden; Julie M Porter; I.K.

"Effect of perceived discrimination on depression and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic: A large-scale, repeated-measures study in the All of Us Research Program","Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has coincided with an increase in depressive symptoms as well as a growing awareness of health disparities and discrimination against racial and ethnic minority communities in the United States. Here, we examine the mental health impact of perceived discrimination during the pandemic in a large and diverse cohort of the All of Us Research Program. Methods: Using repeated assessments of 62,651 participants in May to July of 2020, we fitted mixed-effects models to assess the effect of perceived discrimination on moderate to severe depression (Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 [&ge;] 10) and suicidal ideation (PHQ-9 item 9 > 0), and applied inverse probability weights to account for non-random probabilities of completing the voluntary survey. Results: Perceived discrimination was associated with an increased odds of depression (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 1.21 [1.20 -1.22]) and suicidal ideation (1.17 [1.16-1.18]). For depression, the effects were larger in earlier phases of the pandemic (interaction p=8.2x10-5), which varied by main reason for discrimination and self-reported race. Among those who identified race or ancestry as a primary reason for discrimination, Asian and Black participants had 24% and 17% increase in the odds of depression in May of 2020 (1.24 [1.17-1.31] and 1.17 [1.12-1.22]), respectively, versus a 3% and 7% increase in July (1.03 [0.96-1.10] and 1.07 [1.02-1.12]). Conclusion: In this large and diverse sample, increased levels of perceived discrimination were associated with higher odds of depression, particularly during the early phase of the pandemic among participants self-identifying as Asian or Black.","Younga Heather Lee; Zhaowen Liu; Daniel Fatori; Joshua R.

"Parental perspectives on the grief and support needs of children and young people bereaved during the Covid-19 pandemic: Qualitative findings from a national survey","Background: During the Covid-19 pandemic, many children and young people have experienced the death of close family members, whilst also facing unprecedented disruption to their lives. This study aimed to investigate the experiences and support needs of bereaved children and young people from the perspective of their parents and guardians. Methods: We analysed cross-sectional qualitative free-text data from a survey of adults bereaved in the UK during the pandemic. Participants were recruited via media, social media, national associations and community/charitable organisations. Thematic analysis was conducted on free text data collected from parent/guardian participants in response to a survey question on the bereavement experiences and support needs of their children. Results: Free-text data from 104 parent and grandparent participants was included. Three main themes were identified: the pandemic-related challenges and struggles experienced by children and young people; family support and coping; and support from schools and services. Pandemic-related challenges include the impacts of being separated from the relative prior to their death, isolation from peers and other family members, and disruption to daily routines and wider support networks. Examples were given of effective family coping and communication, but also of difficulties relating to parental grief and childrens existing mental health problems. School and bereavement service provision of specialist support was valued, but there was evidence of unmet need, with some participants reporting a lack of access to specialist grief or mental health support. Conclusion: Children and young people have faced additional strains and challenges associated with pandemic bereavement. We recommend resources and initiatives that facilitate supportive communication within family and school settings, adequate resourcing of school and community-based specialist bereavement/mental health services, and increased information and signposting to the support that is available.","Emily J Harrop; Silvia Goss; Mirella Longo; Kathy Seddon; Anna Torrens-Burton; Eileen Sutton; Damian JJ Farnell; Alison Penny; Anthony Byrne; Annmarie Nelson; Lucy E Selman","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.12.06.21267238","20211207","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-08","",23323,""
"The pandemic of COVID-19 and its impact on the mental health of humanity - literature review","Covid-19's pandemic expansion to more than 100 countries around the world has prompted several governments to enact restrictive social mobility measures, known as 'social isolation'. Associated with this fact, a disease with the possibility of causing serious complications generates fear, anxiety and stress. This new scenario, as a side effect, could cause the development or worsening of several psychiatric syndromes. The entire population is touched by the context of a pandemic, but the frontline professionals is a group at risk for the development of psychopathologies associated with exhaustion, frustrations and feelings of helplessness in the face of the increased demands imposed on the health area. Although the relationship between the pandemic and the repercussions for mental health proposed in this work is an extremely relevant topic, it is known that further studies are still needed. This information can be corroborated by the fact that it is still a new disease, which needs further studies in several aspects. Due to this lack, the present study searched for relevant information in several digital libraries, in order to integrate data on the theme addressed.","Schittini, M. de A.; Bassetti, B.

"National and state trends in anxiety and depression severity scores among adults during the COVID-19 pandemic - United States, 2020-2021","Mental health services and resources, including behavioral telehealth, are critical during the COVID-19 pandemic. The frequency of symptoms of anxiety and depression in US adults increased after August 2020 and peaked between December 2020 and January 2021. The frequency of symptoms then decreased, but in June 2021 remains high compared to NHIS 2019 estimates. The relative increases and decreases in frequency of anxiety and depressive symptoms reported nationally and at the state level reflect the number of new weekly COVID-19 cases nationwide. in the same period. An international group of clinicians and mental health professionals recommends that during a pandemic, mental health care delivery systems must be adjusted to reduce disparities in delivery. provision of health care services. It is often difficult to predict and plan for fluctuations in demand for behavioral health services;However, real-time monitoring of mental health symptoms can provide important information to respond to the surge in demand for mental health services during national emergencies. The observed differences in severity scores and interstate peaks in this study indicate that these efforts are important at both the national and state levels.","Jia, HaoMiao, Guerin, R.

"Psychological stress in the era of Covid-19 pandemic in diabetic population of Nagpur, India - a cross sectional study","BACKGROUND: The global health care system has been impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdowns have been imposed to stop the virus from spreading. Due to rapid spread of corona virus, citizens are facing fear, anxiety, and depression directly affecting their mental health. Adults having poor health are at a higher risk of being infected. This situation has created a stressful atmosphere and resulted in the development of many psychological problems in individuals. Those having pre-existing conditions or co-morbidities have higher mortality risk as compared to healthy individuals. Hence, the issue is more common in people having co-morbidities, with diabetes mellitus being one common among them. We wanted to study the psychological impact mainly stress in diabetic population residing in rural setup in this era of Covid-19 outbreak. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 381 diagnosed diabetic patients attending outpatient department of Rural Health Training Centre affiliated to the tertiary care hospital. The collected data was entered and also analyzed for percentage, mean, standard deviation and variation coefficient. RESULTS: Approximately half (51.96%) of the participants reported a stress of moderate level during Covid-19 with mean +or- SD (20.07 +or- 3.83), overall mean was (21.55 +or- 8.67) and the variation coefficient was 40.22%. The variance in stress level in diabetics with HbA1c levels of less than 6%, 6 - 8% and &gt; 8% depicting the various levels of control of diabetes was 39.36, 40.84 and 40.50 respectively. Similarly the variance coefficient among stress was 42.39, 41.34, 34.65 and 32.12% when the duration of diabetes was compared in the respondents indicating that the stress level was widely distributed amongst all the participants.

"Mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on reverse migrant workers in Uttarakhand: A cross-sectional study","Introduction: The announcement of a nationwide lockdown in India in March 2020 in response to the CoVID-19 pandemic led an exodus of migrant workers back to their homes. The significant adverse impact of this event in its early phase on these reverse migrants has been well documented. With the passage of several months, these reverse migrants eventually reached their homes and re-entered their own communities. This study was conducted amongst a rural community on the interior regions of Almora in hill state of Uttarakhand. Aim: It aims to assess the impact of the later phase of the CoVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on the reverse migrants, and compare this impact with the residents, who have never migrated. Methodology: Door-to-door survey was conducted in the study population, 5-9 months after the lockdown was announced. The participants were matched and grouped into residents and reverse migrants and were evaluated on PHQ-9, GAD-7, IES, and BRIEF-COPE to assess the impact on the participants. Results: No significant depression or anxiety was found in the reverse migrants group, even though the impact of the pandemic and lockdown was felt more by them as compared to the residents group. In addition, there was no significant difference between the two groups for depression or anxiety. Conclusion: These findings can be attributed to factors such as social support from the community members, engagement in work and the use of approach based coping mechanisms.","Verma, Kanupriya, Mujawar, Zeeshan, Mujawar, Swaleha, Banerjee, Amiya","https://doi.org/10.4103/ijsp.ijsp_19_21","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Indian Journal of Social Psychiatry; 37(4):407-412, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-08","",23330,""

In this trial (short name: PsiDeR) we aimed to test the feasibility of a parallel-group, randomised, placebo-controlled design. The primary outcomes in this trial are measures of feasibility: recruitment rates, dropout rates and the variance of the primary outcome measure of depression.Methods and analysisWe are recruiting up to 60 participants at a single centre in London, UK who are unresponsive to, or intolerant of, at least two evidence-based treatments for MDD. Participants are randomised to receive a single dosing session of 25 mg psilocybin or a placebo. All participants receive a package of psychological therapy. The primary outcome measure for depression is the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale collected by blinded, independent raters. The primary endpoint is at 3 weeks, and the total follow-up is 6 weeks. With further informed consent, this study collects neuroimaging and omics data for mechanism and biomarker analyses and offers participants an open label extension consisting of a further, open label dose of 25 mg of psilocybin.Ethics and disseminationAll participants will be required to provide written informed consent.

"Antidepressant prescribing in general practice: A call to action","Productivity Commission inquiry report (2020) recommended as a 'priority reform' that we '[ajddress adverse outcomes from prescribing practices of mental health medication'.1 The report states that 'while antipsychotic prescribing in aged care facilities is one element of this ... arguably a greater concern, given its frequency, is antidepressant prescribing'.1 The report recommends that general practitioner (GP) 'mental health training and professional development' be improved to increase 'adherence to evidence-based clinical practices (including the clinical appropriateness of GP's [sic] prescribing practices for mental health medication, management of medication side effects and de-prescribing)'.1 This article discusses antidepressant prescribing in Australian general practice, adverse drug effects and withdrawal symptoms, and the changes we might make to improve patient outcomes. According to the most recent Bettering the Evaluation and Care of Health (BEACH) survey data, 12.4% of general practice encounters are mental health-related, and most of these encounters are managed with medication (61.6%).7 Clinical guidelines recommend psychological therapies for mild depression and anxiety, and 6-12 months of antidepressant therapy for a single episode of moderateto-severe depression.8'9 Yet in Australia the average duration of therapy is now approximately four years,4 and half of users are long-term users.5 There is also concerning variation in antidepressant prescribing, with rates higher for people in lower socioeconomic or inner regional areas and nearly double in older (&gt;65 years) when compared with younger people.10 Nearly one in three older Australians admitted to residential care in 2008-15 was taking antidepressants on admission, and this only increased after admission.11 There remains ongoing debate about what constitutes appropriate prescribing, but every GP knows that antidepressants cannot treat common social issues such as grief, loneliness, unemployment or poverty. Reviewing and stopping medication when it is no longer indicated is an essential part of good prescribing practice, but in the time-pressured context of general practice it is sometimes overlooked and has been described as 'swimming against the tide'.25 Barriers for GPs include time constraints, reluctance to destabilise a stable situation and poor access to non-pharmaceutical alternatives;barriers for patients include an expectation that doctors would suggest stopping if it were warranted, fear of relapse and unpleasant withdrawal symptoms.24 Ready access to social, financial and psychological supports will be part of the equation, but helping patients to stop antidepressants is also important, especially as the withdrawal process can be complex, often requiring slow tapering, tailored support and regular follow-up (Table 2).26-28 The Productivity Commission recommends 'more research focused in these areas, and uptake of its resulting lessons among treating clinicians'.1 As the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic continues, there has never been a more pressing time to address the issue of unnecessary and potentially harmful prescribing of antidepressants in general practice.

"Effects of COVID-19 restrictions on mechanization service providers and mechanization equipment retailers: insights from phone surveys in Myanmar","COVID-19 continues to plague global food security not only directly through health effects but also indirectly through responses that restrict key economic functions of the agri-food sector. Despite the growing literature on the effects of COVID-19 on the agri-food sector, evidence on certain players like mechanization service providers (MSP) and mechanization equipment retailers (MER) remain scarce. This study provides insights into the effects of COVID-19 restrictions on MSP and MER in Myanmar, where the majority of MSP and MER are relatively new and potentially vulnerable to these economic shocks, using an unbalanced panel data from five rounds of phone surveys. The researchers find that direct responses to COVID-19 involving movement restrictions, as well as disruptions in the market that led to increased cost and reduced availability of machinery and equipment, and growing financial challenges, had significantly negative effects on revenue prospects, service delivery, sales of machines and equipment by MSE and MER. Our analyses based on rare multi-round surveys during a single production season also reveal important dynamics in MSP's decision-making;negative revenue prospects at particular period can further hurt revenue prospects in subsequent periods, which is consistent with the hypotheses that agents like MSP who had incurred significant sunk-cost in machines can engage in more desperate and thus potentially suboptimal business practice to recover the sunk-cost. This may result in a vicious cycle of declining revenues in the future in the face of shocks like COVID-19. Overall, evidence suggests that, policies to minimize movement restrictions, various financial support, and mitigate any pessimism at the beginning of production season are all important to make sure MSP and MER continue to function effectively during the COVID-19 pandemic that persists in 2021.","Takeshima, H.; Masias, I.; Myat Thida, Win, Phoo Pye, Zone","https://www.google.com/search?q=Effects+of+COVID-19+restrictions+on+mechanization+service+providers+and+mechanization+equipment+retailers:+insights+from+phone+surveys+in+Myanmar","","Database: CAB s; Publication details: IFPRI - Discussion Papers|2021.

"CREATION OF FILM MEDIA TO ENCOURAGE BREAKDANCING AS A FORM OF EXERCISE FOR SOUTHERN SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS","The objectives of this research are tol) make a breakdance film to motivate secondary school students in the southern to exercise. 2) to find out how satisfied video viewers were with the breakdancing video 3) To study the motivation of video viewer to exercise with breakdance. This research was conducted by quantitative research, used a multistage sampling of 396 secondary school students. The research instruments of this research are 1) A breakdance film to persuade secondary students in the south to do more exercise. 2) The evaluation of the breakdancing video to promote exercise for secondary students, measured through a questionnaire. The percentage, average, and standard deviation were the statistics employed in the analysis. The result showed that 1) the video media quality motivated the exercise with breakdance for secondary school students in the south region. There are four aspects as follows;content, visual, audio, and presentation techniques. The overall mean was reasonable, the mean (x) was 4.15, the standard deviation (S.D.) was 0.57, 2) Viewers' satisfaction with the video regarding benefits from exercise for both physical and mental health, the mean was 4.39, the standard deviation was 0.66, and 3) Viewers are motivated to exercise by creating the attraction, enthusiasm, and results after viewing breakdance film. The mean was 4.43, and the standard deviation was 0.59. This research can be the guideline to the agency and organization that produces creative media to incentivize students for their health and encourage them to exercise.","Suansaen, Chadaporn, Manlee, Nattapong","https://www.google.com/search?q=CREATION+OF+FILM+MEDIA+TO+ENCOURAGE+BREAKDANCING+AS+A+FORM+OF+EXERCISE+FOR+SOUTHERN+SECONDARY+SCHOOL+STUDENTS","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of Management Information and Decision Sciences; 24:1-11, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-08","",23337,""
"""Whoever Dies, Dies"": A Pedagogical Model for Understanding the COVID-19 Outbreak in United States Prisons","A year into the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly half of the United States prison population, or five times the rate found in the general population, had been infected. Limited social distancing and difficult to implement preventative measures helped to spread COVID-19 in prisons, while many incarcerated individuals felt that government policy prevented their ability to self-care. These feelings of alienation reflect a history of policy that links disease to deviance and social death. Based on the written self-reflections of anthropology students in Wisconsin prisons, this article outlines an ethnographic and pedagogical model for analyzing pandemic policy. Students learned to relate anthropological terminology to their critiques of policy and revealed how prisoners adapted to feelings of invisibility and hopelessness during a pandemic.","Scott, Jason Bartholomew","https://www.google.com/search?q=Whoever+Dies,+Dies:+A+Pedagogical+Model+for+Understanding+the+COVID-19+Outbreak+in+United+States+Prisons","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Human Organization; 80(4):282-291, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-08","",23338,""

"Clinicians' Perspectives on the Impacts of Post-2016 Immigration Enforcement on Immigrant Health and Health Care Use","Objective. To examine clinicians' perspectives on changes in health and health care utilization of immigrant patients, the presence of immigration enforcement in health facilities, and institutional responses to these changes in the post-2016 period in the United States. Methods. From a survey of clinician members of the Physicians for Human Rights Asylum Network (Marchâ€“June 2020), we described responses and identified key themes. Results. Post-2016 anti-immigrant policies and rhetoric negatively affected mental health, physical health, and health care-seeking behaviors among immigrant patients. Although most clinicians reported rarely witnessing immigration enforcement activities, nearly half reported persistent fear among their immigrant patients. A higher percentage of clinicians in U.S. border states reported increased fears associated with adverse physical and mental health effects among immigrant patients than those in non-border states. Conclusion. Clinicians' perspectives on the impact of immigration enforcement on patient health is critical to informing multi-level interventions to improve immigrant health.","Saadi, Altaf, Taleghani, Sophia, Hampton, Kathryn, Heisler, Michele","https://www.google.com/search?q=Clinicians'+Perspectives+on+the+Impacts+of+Post-2016+Immigration+Enforcement+on+Immigrant+Health+and+Health+Care+Use","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved; 32(4):1778-1797, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-08","",23340,""

"Environmental Health Professionals: Local Interprofessional Collaborations Require Global Thinking to Meet Shared Ethical Obligations","The work of environmental health professionals (EHPs) shares a common conceptual framework undergirding local practice, namely that the normal state of humanity is one of health and that the chief aim of practice is to prevent deviations from health as well as to promote wellness in the public by improving the local environment. This conceptual framework was well captured in Florence Nightingale's Environmental Theory. Today, while much of the work of EHPs remains intensely local, there is a growing need for EHPs to have a global world view.

A COVID-19 vaccine that could help bring the world back to normal had just been released and two additional vaccines would follow soon after. With a vaccine in place, the feeling was that we would see fewer people get sick and fewer people would lose their battle to the virus.

"At the Intersection of Harm Reduction and COVID-19: The Role of Anthropologists during and Post-Pandemic","Harm reduction is a public health approach that emphasizes reducing the negative effects of drug use rather than eliminating it. It has been practiced for decades;however, the COVID-19 pandemic poses new challenges for people who use drugs (PWUD) and harm reduction providers. In the United States, public health recommendations to curb the pandemic are complicating harm reduction efforts. Harm reduction programs are rethinking how they engage with PWUD to comply with these recommendations while also providing essential services. In this article, we draw on academic literature, news articles, and information distributed by harm reduction programs to discuss issues currently faced by PWUD and harm reduction providers across the country. This discussion focuses on policy changes and programming adaptations related to three harm reduction interventions-syringe services programs, overdose prevention, and medications for opioid use disorder-that have emerged or gained traction during the pandemic. We argue that anthropologists should play a key role in addressing the obstacles and opportunities for harm reduction in the United States during and post-pandemic. Ethnographic research can generate important knowledge of how pandemic-related service and policy changes are localized by providers and experienced by PWUD and uncover how race, class, and gender may shape access to and experiences with modified harm reduction services. Applied anthropologists also have an important role in collaborating with harm reduction programs to ensure that the voices of marginalized individuals are not ignored as policy and programming changes take place during and after the pandemic.","Harris, Shana, Schlosser, Allison","https://www.google.com/search?q=At+the+Intersection+of+Harm+Reduction+and+COVID-19:+The+Role+of+Anthropologists+during+and+Post-Pandemic","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Human Organization; 80(4):272-281, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-08","",23346,""
"The COVID-19 Pandemic and Environmental Health: Lessons Learned","Environmental health is historically an overlooked and underrated discipline. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the value of environmental health and environmental health professionals (EHPs). EHPs have a unique set of skills and knowledge that were, or could have been, significant in controlling the pandemic. This skill set includes a thorough understanding of legislation and regulations;the ability to conduct human health risk assessment and implement effective risk-control measures;enforcement, communication, and education skills;and a significant understanding of their own local communities. The opportunities for applying the skills of EHPs vary across the world depending on several factors, including legislative and regulatory frameworks in each jurisdiction. Here we present our early evaluation of the unique skills and knowledge base of EHPs and lessons that can be learned from EHP engagement in public health protection. We also argue that local knowledge and engagement need to be recognized as valuable tools in emergency preparedness. In our increasingly globalized world, mechanisms to maintain and value local knowledge are needed, which could be achieved by embedding the ""value of local"" into policy to ensure that the importance and value of local knowledge are captured. We also advocate for raising awareness of the value of public health, and specifically, environmental health.","Dyjack, David T. DrPH C. I. H.; Choonara, Adam Mcieh CEnvH, Davis, Gayle M. P. H.

"Living with Mental Health Challenges: Personal Stories of Recovery from Across the Globe","This symposium includes twelve personal narratives from individuals who live with serious mental health challenges that are sometimes diagnosed as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, or other conditions. Such challenges are often persistent, lead to stigma and discrimination, and can deeply affect quality of life. Serious mental health challenges are frequently approached as life-long medical conditions, given a diagnosis and treated with medications. However, some pursue non-medical treatments, peer support, use diet and exercise to promote wellness, embrace models of recovery, and function well even when symptoms persist. Approaches often differ across nations, depending upon their resources and philosophy of mental health challenges. Three commentaries on these narratives are also included, authored by experts and scholars in the fields of cultural psychiatry, refugee mental health, human rights advocacy, child's health, and global mental health. We intend this collection of stories to broaden the range of acceptable responses to mental health challenges, raise awareness of stigma and bias in mental health care, and share the wisdom and preferences of those living with mental health challenges.","DuBois, James M.; Walsh, Heidi A.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Living+with+Mental+Health+Challenges:+Personal+Stories+of+Recovery+from+Across+the+Globe","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Narrative Inquiry in Bioethics; 11(2):141-145, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-08","",23348,""

"Remote Mentoring Optimizes Virtual Collection of Patient-Reported Data: A Prospective Cohort Study with Adaptive Design Conducted in COVID-19 Era (preprint)","Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, patients attending ambulatory clinics at cancer centers in Ontario completed the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) at each visit. At our center, completion was via touch pad, with assistance by clinic volunteers. As of March 2020, clinic appointments were conducted virtually when possible and touch pads removed. We anticipated a negative impact on the collection of patient-reported outcomes (PROs), and the recognition of severe symptoms. Methods: : We performed a prospective cross-sectional cohort study to test the feasibility of remote ESAS completion by patients with appointments at a weekly surgical oncology clinic. Patients in the initial study cohort were asked to complete and return the ESAS virtually(V). Given low completion rates, the ensuing cohort was asked to complete a hard-copy(HC) ESAS. For the final cohort, we used an adaptive approach, providing remote, personal mentorship by a member of the care team to support virtual electronic ESAS completion (virtual-mentored(VM) cohort). Results: : Between May-July 2020, a total of 174 patient encounters were included in the study. For the V cohort, 20/46 patients (44%) successfully completed and returned the electronic ESAS, compared to 49/50 (98%) for the HC cohort. For the VM cohort (n=78), the completion rate was 74%. Questionnaire completion was not predicted by age, sex or tumor site, although patients who completed the ESAS were more likely to be in active management rather than surveillance(p=0.04). Of all completed forms, 42% revealed a depression score Â³2, and 27% an anxiety score Â³4. Conclusions: : We identified significant barriers to the virtual completion of ESAS forms, with a lack of predictive variables. The severe degree of psychological distress reported by ~50% of respondents demonstrates the need for ongoing regular collection/review of these data. Innovative solutions are required to overcome barriers to virtual collection of PROs.","Kazazian, Karineh, Bogach, Jessica, Johnston, Wendy, Ng, Deanna, Swallow, Carol","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1011736/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-08","",23354,""

Depression risk (OR = 41.43, 95% CI 5.54 - 311.63), insomnia risk (OR = 5.25, 95% CI 1.77 - 18.71), low income (OR = 3.46, 95% CI 1.38 - 8.67) and being married or free union (OR = 2.65, 95% CI 1.13 - 6.22) were associated with PTSD-R. In conclusion, two out of every fifteen COVID-19 survivors are in PTSD-R. Depression and insomnia risk are strongly associated with PTSD-R in COVID-19 survivors.","Campo-Arias, Adalberto, Pedrozo-Pupo, John Carlos, Herazo, Edwin","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.02.21267210","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-08","",23355,""
"The mental health impact of daily news exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic: An ecological momentary assessment study (preprint)","Consumption of distressing news media, which increased substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic, has demonstrable negative effects on mental health. The current study examines the proximal impact of daily exposure to distressing news on mental health. A sample of 128 college students completed daily ecological momentary assessments for 8 weeks measuring exposure to news about COVID-19, worry and optimism specifically related to COVID-19, hopelessness, and general worry. Participants completed &gt;22,700 surveys. Multilevel mediation models indicated that greater daily exposure to news about COVID-19 was associated with higher same-day and next-day worry about the pandemic. Elevations in worry specifically about COVID-19 were in turn associated with greater next-day hopelessness and general worry. Optimism about COVID-19 was not associated with daily exposure to COVID-19 news or to same-day or next-day hopelessness or general worry. This study demonstrates the mental health impact of daily exposure to COVID-19 news and highlights how specific worry contributes over time to hopelessness and general worry.","Kellerman, John, Hamilton, Jessica, Selby, Edward, Kleiman, Evan","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/yner3","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-08","",23356,""
"Mental Health and Self-Determination Profiles of the Diverse Population of Medical Students in Malaysia During the COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)","Introduction:  Medical schools throughout the world were forced to modify their programming during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Malaysia, virtual learning plans were implemented for non-clinical programming, while clinical posting modifications were designed to meet local SOPs. The prolonged enforcement of these modifications to undergraduate medical education will have affected student experiences, including well-being. Since these feelings can relate to perceived relatedness, autonomy, and competence, it is important to identify any potential factors that may lead to reduced intrinsic motivation in students. It is also important to consider how demographic features may contribute to student perspectives, which can be studied using the unique diversity represented by Malaysian students. Methods: A quantitative survey was distributed to Malaysian medical students to assess their overall wellbeing, autonomy in educational decision making, student experiences, and position on changes to graduation timing. Intrinsic components were identified using Principal Component Analysis and were aligned with the three needs for self-determination, namely relatedness, autonomy, and competence. Finally, trends in responses for participants from various sub-populations were assessed using ANOVA testing. Results: Responses were collected from 442 students representing 23 accredited Malaysian medical schools. Upon validation and reliability testing, eight components were identified with themes relating to: mental health, social concerns, communication, timing of modifications, depth of learning, and student-centred learning. Of these, gender was related to mental health, student-centred learning, and delayed graduation, while stage was related to student-centred learning and delayed graduation in addition to concerns about depth of learning and timing of modifications. Interestingly, ethnicity was related to differences in opinions about delayed graduation and income was related to social concerns. Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that, while students were satisfied in general with the content and delivery of their programmes given the circumstances, there is evidence to suggest negative effects on emotional wellbeing, expression of student voice, due to the modifications that were made. Additionally, these feelings related to the three motivational needs, suggesting that students were experiencing a dampened motivational profile during the pandemic. Further, motivational profiles were distinct between student sub-groups, providing insight for developing appropriate and inclusive accommodations moving forward.","Cockburn, Jessica, Tan, Chee Yang, Poh, Dawn Celine Siaw Chern, Tan, Ding Jun, Foong, Chan Choong, Hong, Wei-Han","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1094460/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-08","",23357,""
"Maximum Level of COVID-19 Vaccination in Rich and Democratic Countries, and in Other Political Systems (preprint)","Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccinations play a main role in the immunization program of countries to decrease the numbers of COVID-19 related infected individuals and deaths. However, countries, after a certain share of people vaccinated against COVID-19 have to cope with vaccine hesitancy and resistance in population. One of the fundamental problems is the detection of the max share of people vaccinable between countries without the introduction of any rule that affects basic aspects of individual freedoms of people in public and private life. The study here confronts this problem with a global analysis based on N =150 countries, using relationships between socioeconomic, institutional and political variables, and levels of vaccination. Results reveal that the share of people vaccinated increases with the level of development (and democratization) of countries, achieving the maximum level of about 70%;beyond this level, the share of vaccination starts to decrease across countries. Moreover, findings reveal that governments with Monarchy and Parliamentary Monarchy have average share of people vaccinated higher than Mixed Executives. These main findings suggest that in developed and democratic countries the maximum level of vaccination has a physiological limit, but many Western (democratic) countries are applying restriction rules (e.g., green pass/vaccine passport) to overcome this max level reducing and regulating, at the same time, many aspects of public and private life of individuals. Discussion explains these sociopolitical phenomena with aspects of politics of fear, focused on deaths of COVID-19, and of strong leaders having domestic and international support that apply rules in contexts of social insecurity with consequential reduction of equity, trust and solidarity and increase of socioeconomic issues. All these results here could aid policymakers to prepare sustainable policy responses against COVID-19 in society without distressing basics of democracy with rules of autocratic systems that can generate economic and social deterioration, and problems for mental health and economic conditions of people in society.","Coccia, Mario","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1131026/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-08","",23358,""
"In their own words: Understanding Australiansâ€™ priority concerns regarding mental health in the context of COVID-19 (preprint)","The COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the recent bushfires and flash floods, have resulted in significant and unprecedented mental health impacts in Australia. Despite the known impacts, there is a paucity of research directly asking Australian community members about their mental health experiences and what they perceive to be the most important mental health issues in the context of the pandemic. This study utilises qualitative data from Alone Together, a longitudinal mixed-methods study investigating the effects of COVID-19 on mental health in an Australian community sample (N = 2,056). Of the 1,350 participants who completed the first follow-up survey, a total of 1,037 participants, who ranged in sex (69.9% female), age (M = 40-49 years), state/territory of residence, and socioeconomic status, shared responses to two open-ended questions regarding the most important issues for mental health in Australia and the impact of COVID-19 on their individual mental health. Responses were analysed using thematic analysis. Participants described COVID-19 as primarily impacting their mental health through the disruption it posed to their social world and financial stability. A key concern for participants who reported having poor mental health was the existence of multiple competing barriers to accessing good mental health care. According to participant responses, the pandemic had pressurized an already over-burdened mental health service system, leaving many without timely, appropriate support. Further absent or stigmatising rhetoric around mental health, at both a political and community level, also prevented participants from seeking help. Insights gained from the present research provide opportunities for policymakers and health practitioners to draw on the expertise of Australiansâ€™ lived experience and address priority issues through targeted policy planning. This could ultimately support a more responsive, integrated and effective mental health system, during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bower, Marlee, Donohoe-Bales, Amarina, Smout, Scarlett, Nguyen, Andre Quan Ho, Boyle, Julia, Barrett, Emma, Teesson, Maree","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/pwfdm","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-08","",23359,""
"Exploring the Mental, Social and Lifestyle Effects of COVID-19 Infection on Syrian Refugees in Jordan: A Qualitative Study (preprint)","Background:  The fear of testing positive for COVID-19 infection has created panic among patients and families and discouraged some people from being tested and receiving medical care. Migrants and refugees are among the vulnerable populations that suffered disproportionately from the COVID-19 crisis. However, their experiences with COVID-19 positivity status have not been investigated. This study aimed to explore the physical, mental, and psychosocial impact of a positive COVID-19 diagnosis on Syrian refugees living in Jordan. Methods: : Using a qualitative approach, twenty phone interviews were conducted with ten adult Syrian refugees living within the camp and ten refugees living in non-camp (host-community) settings. A follow-up interviews with five health care providers in the refugee camp were conducted to explore the services and support given to the refugees with COVID-19 infection. The findings were thematically analysed using Braun & Clarke's six-phase framework. Results: : Physical effects of a positive COVID-19 status varied according to the seriousness of the condition but affected most participants' lifestyle by adopting more precautionary measures and caring for their physical health. Self-isolation and fear to infect others were common themes identified among all participants living within community settings. Resorting to friends and family members for mental and psychological support was the only option available for all participants. Refugees living within the community preferred to manage their condition at home utilizing traditional remedies and avoided being tested for financial reasons, poor healthcare access and fear of being identified. Refugees living within camps had better access to testing, healthcare, and disease management and did not experience fear of being deported. They did not display worries and feelings of shame and guilt, which were feelings expressed by refugees living within the community. Both groups suffered mental and psychosocial health impacts, as well as social isolation and fear of death and disease complications. Conclusions: : COVID-19 infection has negatively impacted refugeesâ€™ well-being with noticeable disparities across the different living conditions. While mental health impact seems to be standardized, refugees living within host-community may need more support into managing their condition, accessibility to free testing as well as treatment and healthcare services.","Kheirallah, Khalid, Ababneh, Bayan, Bendak, Heba, Alsuwaidi, Ahmed, Elbarazi, Iffat","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1101153/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-08","",23360,""
"Digital exclusion predicts worse mental health among adolescents during COVID-19 (preprint)","Background Social isolation is strongly associated with poor mental health. The COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing social restrictions disrupted young peopleâ€™s social interactions and resulted in several periods during which school closures necessitated online learning. We hypothesise that digitally excluded young people would demonstrate greater deterioration in their mental health than their digitally connected peers during this time. Methods We analysed representative mental health data from a sample of UK 10â€“15-year-olds ( N = 1387);Understanding Society collected the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire in 2017-19 and thrice during the pandemic (July 2020, November 2020 and March 2021). We employed cross-sectional methods and longitudinal latent growth curve modelling to describe trajectories of adolescent mental health for participants with and without access to a computer or a good internet connection for schoolwork. Outcomes Adolescent mental health had a quadratic trajectory during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the highest mean Total Difficulties score around December 2020. The worsening and recovery of mental health during the pandemic was greatly pronounced among those without access to a computer, although we did not find evidence for a similar effect among those without a good internet connection. Interpretation Digital exclusion, as indicated by lack of access to a computer, is a tractable risk factor that likely compounds other adversities facing children and young people during periods of social isolation.

"Coping with COVID-19 Stressors: Adverse and Protective Factors Responding to Emotions in a Chinese Sample (preprint)","Background:  The potential roles of affective responses to environmental stressors in individuals' physical and mental health are complex and multi-faceted. This study, then, explores Chinese citizens' emotional responses to COVID-19-related stressors and influence factors which may boost or buffer such effects. Methods: From late March to early June (2020), a cross-sectional study was conducted using an anonymous online questionnaire included demographic characteristics, COVID-19-related stressors related to individuals' daily functioning, and the self-assessed impact of protective and adverse internal factors on emotions. Results: 1,662 questionnaires were received from residents in 32 Chinese provinces classified by prevalence level according to COVID-19 infections. Among the 17 positive and negative emotional responses, agglomerative hierarchical clustering revealed four subclassifications: (1) stress relations;(2) missing someone relations;(3) individual relations;and (4) social relations. Additionally, heightened regional prevalence levels positively corresponded to intensity of stress relations. Lowest intensity of social relations was found in the areas surrounding Wuhan and coastal areas. Specially, economic- and work-related stressors as well as negative self-perceptions (e.g., suppression, emotionally unstable, self-denial) implicated in negative emotions. While positive emotions were tied to demographic characteristics (e.g., high education, young age and male) and protective traits (e.g., creativity, sympathy, social responsibility), and inversely linked to relationships- and pandemic-related stressors, etc. Conclusion: Associations were clearly noted among Chinese residents' emotions to specific stressors during pandemic. Providing appropriate psychological resources/supports during future or extended public health crises may help offset the cognitive burden of individuals striving to regain an adequate level of normalcy and emotional well-being.","Xu, Rui, Zhang, Xinfeng, Liu, Danni, Li, Qiang, Wang, Yanping, Jiao, Rong, Gong, Ximei, Hou, Xueyan, Xu, Tao, Qing, Xuemei, Song, Kangxing, Kavcic, Voyko, Yan, Shiyan, Gu, Ruolei, Stratton, Terry, Jiang, Yang","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.30.21250895","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-08","",23362,""
"Examining the role of traditional masculinity and depression in menâ€™s risk for contracting COVID-19 (preprint)","Background: In the light of the COVID-19 pandemic and claims that traditional masculinity may put some men at increased risk for infection, research reporting menâ€™s health behaviors is critically important. Traditional masculine norms such as self-reliance and toughness are associated with a lower likelihood to vaccinate or follow safety restrictions. Furthermore, infection risk and traditional masculinity should be investigated in a differentiated manner including gender role orientation, underlying traditional masculine ideologies and male gender role conflict. Methods: In this pre-registered online survey conducted during March/April 2021 in German-speaking countries in Europe, 490 men completed questionnaires regarding contracting COVID-19 as confirmed by a validated test, fear of COVID-19 (FCV-19S), and experience of psychological burden due to COVID-19. In addition, depression symptomatology was assessed by using prototypical internalizing and male-typical externalizing depression symptoms. Furthermore, self-identified masculine gender orientation, endorsement of traditional masculine ideologies, and gender role conflict were measured. Results: A total of 6.9% of men (n = 34) reported having contracted COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic. Group comparisons revealed that men who had contracted COVID-19 exhibited higher overall traditional masculine ideology and gender role conflict. Logistic regression controlling for confounders (age, income, education, and sexual orientation) indicated that only depression symptoms are independently associated with the risk of having contracted COVID-19. While prototypical depression symptoms were negatively associated with the risk of having contracted COVID-19, male-typical externalizing depression symptoms were positively associated with the risk of having contracted COVID-19. Conclusion: For traditional masculinity, no robust association for an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 could be established, while higher male-typical externalizingdepression symptoms were associated with an increased risk of having contracted COVID-19.","Walther, Andreas, Eggenberger, Lukas, Grub, Jessica, Ogrodniczuk, John, Seidler, Zac, Rice, Simon, Kealy, David, Olive, John, Ehlert, Ulrike","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/6rp8u","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-08","",23363,""
"Outlining the Challenges of COVID-19 Pandemic on Africaâ€™s Maritime Industry: the Case of Marine and Seafaring Professionals (preprint)","Despite the â€˜Key Workerâ€™ status accorded seafarers in moments of demonstrable selflessness -ensuring, adequate supply of food, medicines, consumables like personal protective equipment (PPEs), and energy - there is a lack of genuine interest in their concerns, leading to various calls from major stakeholders such as the United Nations and International Maritime Organization. These calls associate- with various covid-19-related policies and regulations having a direct bearing on the ongoing crew change crises, maroon and overstay of contracts, poor mental health, rise in covid-19 infections and other unrelated illnesses among ship crew. Thus, to what extent are non-traditional seafaring nations of Africa being impacted? The study examines these concerns by identifying and investigating implemented covid-19 policies and regulations and their impact on maritime operations and crew â€˜wellbeing;â€™ the contingency measures and innovations aiding mitigate responses with minimal challenges to seafarers and marine professionals. The case study approach focuses on West Africaâ€™s maritime corridor, examining operations in Ghana, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Nigeria and Angola to a host of varied ports and offshore installations operations. Direct field observations, as well as questionnaires and interviews of expert or â€˜eye witnessâ€™ account, deployed via phone calls, online social media and emails are carried out. The study finds MLC 2006 was not been complied with. Embarkation quarantine measures and testing implemented for offshore Ghana and Angola could not prevent the outbreak of cases onboard FPSO units respectively, though the process identified positive cases during quarantine. The stigma associated with positive cases amongst the crew were prevalent in the first six months of pandemic declaration. Of the survey conducted amongst 71 vessel crew, 32.14% were certain of having recorded Covid-19 positive cases on their various Jobsites, 91.06% showed support for IMO-led interventions against covid-19, 30% complained of uncertainty spared by rumours as fueling poor mental health. However, only 19% willingly addressed issues of their proximity to covid-19. Vaccine inoculations upon commencing March 2021 remained low in the region amongst marine professionals. Mitigating measures implemented include increased internet and call access, and extensive boarding protocols.

"Pattern of Opioid Overdoses and Interventions at the Emergency Department: Impact of COVID-19 (preprint)","Background:  Opioid-related overdoses cause substantial numbers of preventable deaths. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist available in take-home naloxone (THN) kits as a lifesaving measure for opioid overdose. As the emergency department (ED) is a primary point of contact for patients with high-risk opioid use, evidence-based recommendations from the Society of Hospital Pharmacists of Australia THN practice guidelines include the provision of THN, accompanied by psychosocial interventions. However, implementation of these guidelines in practice is unknown. This study investigated ED opioid-related overdose presentations, concordance of post-overdose interventions with the THN practice guidelines, and the impact, if any, of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic on case presentations.MethodsA single-centre retrospective audit was conducted at a major tertiary hospital of patients presenting with overdoses involving opioids and non-opioids between March to August 2019 and March to August 2020. Patient presentations and interventions delivered by the paramedics, ED and upon discharge from the ED were collated from medical records and analysed using descriptive statistics, chi square and independent T-tests.ResultsThe majority (66.2%) of patients presented to hospital with mixed drug overdoses involving opioids and non-opioids. Pharmaceutical opioids were implicated in a greater proportion (72.1%) of overdoses than illicit opioids. Fewer patients presented in March to August 2020 as compared with 2019 (26 vs. 42), and mixed drug overdoses were more frequent in 2020 than 2019 (80.8% vs. 57.1%). Referral to outpatient psychology (22.0%) and drug and alcohol services (20.3%) were amongst the most common post-discharge interventions. Naloxone was provided to 28 patients (41.2%) by the paramedics and/or ED. No patients received THN upon discharge.ConclusionsThis study highlights opportunities to improve ED provision of THN and other interventions post-opioid overdose. Large-scale multi-centre studies are required to ascertain the capacity of EDs to provide THN and the impact of COVID-19 on opioid overdose presentations.","Potaka, Katherine, Freeman, Rebecca, Soo, Danny, Nguyen, Nam-Anh, Sim, Tin Fei, Moullin, Joanna","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1083704/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-08","",23365,""

METHODS : 4000 patients (1900 men and 2100 women) with mild, moderate or chronic disease, appealing to our Second Opinion Medical Consultation Network, signed an informed consent and were injected subcutaneously with C.parvum . The treatment was followed up at 6 months after therapy, filling the short form of the medical outcome health survey questionnaire (SF-36), directly by the patients or its parents and monitoring the health regularly via telemedicine (Skype, WhatsApp, mail, etc) or physicianâ€™s visit. RESULTS: The main efficacy endpoints, as assessed by the SF-36 questionnaire, are significant improvements in the mental and physical role functioning score (p&lt; 0.02), in general health, in social role functioning (p &lt; 0.02), vitality (p &lt; 0.03), and a significant reduction in bodily pain (p&lt; 0.03). There was a quick (48-72 hours) symptoms improvement and/or complete regression of the herpetic eruptions observed in 1000 affected patients and of herpetic neuralgia (reduced in 80% of cases), also full recovery or frequency reduction (30%) of recurrent cystitis and prostatitis in 120 affected patients, and last, but not least, a life quality improvement in 100 oncologic patients of overall 200 cases. A significant increase in the lymphocyte count (p&lt;0.01), mainly Helper and Killer lymphocytes, was noted after 6 months by Parvulan injection vs. the baseline.The asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 patients, incidentally, enrolled in our survey, were tested at sixth months for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and 14 patients occurred high level of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The incubating Covid infections in the Parvulan injected patients even if rail and multi-morbid recovered in a short term (48-96 hours) and with benign clinical course, usually no need of further drugs administration except for the variants, which lasted on average one week and required some antipyretics, and low dose steroid for a few days. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that C.parvum is quite safe and effective to support immune-compromised patients when epidemic or pandemic events rise the life risk and any kind of infections and complications rate.Further double-blind placebo evidence-based studies are urgently required, and our numerically substantial not sponsored spontaneous observation aims exclusively to promote further evidence based double blind institutional studies.","palmieri, beniamino, manenti, antonio, Vadala, Maria","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1106959/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-08","",23366,""
"Young Parentsâ€™ Experiences of Pregnancy and Parenting During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Study in the United Kingdom (preprint)","Young parents (aged 16-24 years) in the perinatal period are at an increased risk of poor mental health especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, due to multiple risk factors including social and economic instability. COVID-19 related restrictions had profound implications for the delivery of perinatal care services and other support structures for young parents. Investigating young parentsâ€™ experiences during the pandemic, including their perceived challenges and needs, is important to inform good practice and provide appropriate support for young parents. Qualitative interviews were conducted with young parents (n=21) during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom from February â€“ May 2021. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Three key themes were identified to describe parentsâ€™ experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. Parents reported specific COVID-19 related anxieties and stressors, including worries around contracting the virus and increased feelings of distress due to uncertainty created by the implications of the pandemic. Parents described feeling alone both at home and during antenatal appointments and highlighted the absence of social support as a major area of concern. Also, parents felt their perinatal care had been disrupted by the pandemic and experienced difficulties accessing care online or over the phone. This study highlights the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on young parents, including their mental wellbeing and the perinatal support they were able to access. Insights from this study can inform the support and services offered to families going forward. Specifically, the findings emphasise the importance of (a) supporting both parents during perinatal appointments, (b) providing parents with mental health support early on and (c) finding ways to facilitate communication pathways between professionals and parents.","Moltrecht, Bettina, Dalton, Louise, Hanna, Jeffrey, Law, Clare, Rapa, Elizabeth","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1028241/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-08","",23367,""
"Increased Risk Perception, Distress Intolerance and Health Anxiety in Stricter Lockdowns: Self-Control as a Key Protective Factor in Early Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)","Studies provide evidence that distress, (health) anxiety and depressive symptoms were high during the first weeks of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions, decreasing over time, possibly due to individualsâ€™ protective psychological factors. Relations between different lockdown restrictions, mental health issues, and protective factors need to be explored, since even small lockdown effects might increase the risk of future mental health issues. We merged objective lockdown stringency data with individual data (N = 1,001) to examine differences in lockdown effects in strict lockdown (Romania) and mild lockdown (Hungary) conditions between March and May 2020 on stressors and mental health symptoms, taking protective factors into account. The stricter lockdown in Romania revealed higher levels of perceived risk of infection, distress intolerance, and COVID-19 health anxiety. Protective psychological factors were not affected by the lockdown measures. Surpassing psychological flexibility and resilient coping, self-control proved to be the most promising protective factor. It is recommended that future research merge objective data with study data to investigate the effects of different COVID-19 lockdown measures on mental health and protective factors. Policy decisions should consider lockdown-dependent consequences of mental health issues.

"Unhappy or unsatisfied: Distinguishing the role of negative affect and need frustration in depressive symptoms over the academic year and during the COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)","Mental health problems are becoming increasingly prevalent across college campuses. Past research has found that negative affect and frustration of basic psychological needs contribute to the development of depressive symptoms, but there is limited research which compares whether these are antecedents or concomitants of depressive symptoms. The present set of studies aimed to distinguish the differential associations of affect and need frustration on depressive symptoms. Students (Nstudy1 = 379;Nstudy2 = 235) completed measures on negative affect, need frustration (e.g., relatedness, competence, and autonomy), and depressive symptoms over an academic year and during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In both samples, fully cross-lagged path models were used to examine the relation between need frustration, negative affect, and depressive symptoms over time. Across both studies, basic psychological need frustration was the only consistent predictor of both negative affect and depressive symptoms over time, suggesting that need frustration is an antecedent of depressive symptoms over time, and especially during vulnerable time periods. Additionally, in Study 2, reports from close others confirm that need frustration is the largest indicator of depressive presentation in students. These results highlight the relative importance of basic psychological need frustration in predicting depressive symptoms in university students.","Levine, Shelby","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/nf7st","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-08","",23369,""
"Emotional determinants of public responses to the risk of epidemics and pandemics: a systematic review (preprint)","Background:  Understanding how peopleâ€™s emotions influence their health decisions and behaviours at a population level is fundamental to designing effective communication strategies and public health interventions for infectious disease outbreaks. This review identifies relevant research to assess the role of emotional determinants and their impact on public responses to the risk of infectious disease outbreaks, specifically in relation to the uptake of public health interventions. Methods A comprehensive systematic review was conducted exploring the differences in public responses by emotion, infection, outcome and region. A basic consensus approach was followed in which emotional stimuli were categorised as being either pleasant or unpleasant, and predisposing people to bivalent behaviour ( i.e. , approach or withdrawal). All primary research studies published in five global databases between 1988-2019 were eligible for inclusion. Binomial tests (against a test proportion of 0.5 or 50% for each study outcome) were performed using the direction of effect observed in each study, i.e. , either favouring or not favouring intervention uptake. Results A total of 75 studies from 28 different nations were eligible for inclusion in the review. A total of 97 correlations were made between 12 emotions, 10 infectious diseases, and the uptake of seven types of public health interventions. Unpleasant emotions were evoked much more often than pleasant following public health risk communications, with fear and anxiety being the most common. Overall, moderate anxiety-related emotions (worry, anxiety, stress, concern) seemed to be much more significant motivators for public action compared to extreme unpleasant emotions (fear, panic, hopelessness, shame), which had a statistically significantly negative effect on the uptake of public health interventions in several cases. Pleasant emotions (empathy, hope) also showed promise as motivators for public health intervention uptake, but more research is needed to corroborate this. Conclusions The results of this review show that the publicâ€™s emotional responses to epidemics in the past 30 years have played a clear role in determining how successful the rollout of public health interventions has been. Emotions need to be considered in crisis communications, and these research findings can help inform communications strategies in the evolving context of the COVID-19 pandemic and future infectious disease outbreaks.","Kousoulis, Antonis, Francis, Mark, Grant, Imogen, Larson, Heidi","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1079281/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-08","",23370,""
"On the Development of an Information System for Monitoring User Opinion and its Role for the Public (preprint)","Social media services and analytics platforms are rapidly growing. A large number of various events happen mostly every day, and the role of social media monitoring tools is also increasing. Social networks are widely used for managing and promoting brands and different services. Thus, most popular social analytics platforms aim for business purposes while monitoring various social, economic, and political problems remains underrepresented and not covered by thorough research. Moreover, most of them focus on resource-rich languages such as the English language, whereas texts and comments in other low-resource languages such as the Russian and Kazakh languages in social media are not represented well enough. So, this work is devoted to developing and applying the information system called the OMSystem for analyzing usersâ€™ opinions on news portals, blogs, and social networks in Kazakhstan. The system uses sentiment dictionaries of the Russian and Kazakh languages and machine learning algorithms to determine the sentiment of social media texts. The whole structure and functionalities of the system are also presented. In the experimental part, the systemâ€™s monitoring of the healthcare, political and social aspects of the most relevant topics connected with the vaccination against the coronavirus disease are thoroughly observed and analyzed. The analysis allowed discovering the public social mood in the cities of Almaty and Nur-Sultan and other large regional cities of Kazakhstan. The systemâ€™s study included two extensive periods: 10-01-2021 to 30-05-2021 and 01-07-2021 to 12-08-2021. In the obtained results, peopleâ€™s mood and attitude to the Governmentâ€™s policies and actions were studied by such social network indicators as the level of topic discussion activity in society, the level of interest in the topic in society, and the mood level of society. These indicators calculated by the OMSystem allowed careful identification of alarming factors of the public (negative attitude to the government regulations, vaccination policies, trust to vaccination, etc.) and assessment of the social mood.","Karyukin, Vladislav, Mutanov, Galimkair, Mamykova, Zhanl, Nassimova, Gulnar, Torekul, Saule, Sundetova, Zhanerke, Negri, Matteo","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1122375/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-08","",23371,""

This study estimates the prevalence of mental health problems during the first wave of COVID and identifies its determinants among the general population of Indian metropolitan cities.The study uses a Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes model to measure depression, anxiety and stress using observed indicators of these latent constructs, and to identify the socio-economic groups at risk of these disorders. The data was collected from 1,275 adults randomly selected from the list of mobile phone users in Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Hyderabad. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale was administered to the study participants.About 46, 24 and 48 percent of respondents reported symptoms of anxiety, depression and stress, respectively. Single respondents, members of minority groups, less educated and those belonging to large households are identified to be at-risk. Results also indicate a positive relationship between economic stress and mental illness.Although COVID has increased the psychological burden of the population, all persons reporting psychological disorders may not require clinical attention.

"Increased risk of psychiatric sequelae of COVID-19 is highest early in the clinical course (preprint)","Background:  COVID-19 has been shown to increase the risk of adverse mental health consequences. A recent electronic health record (EHR)-based observational study showed an almost two-fold increased risk of new-onset mental illness in the first 90 days following a diagnosis of acute COVID-19. Methods: We used the National COVID Cohort Collaborative, a harmonized EHR repository with 2,965,506 COVID-19 positive patients, and compared cohorts of COVID-19 patients with comparable controls. Patients were propensity score-matched to control for confounding factors. We estimated the hazard ratio (COVID-19:control) for new-onset of mental illness for the first year following diagnosis. We additionally estimated the change in risk for new-onset mental illness between the periods of 21-120 and 121-365 days following infection. Findings: We find a significant increase in incidence of new-onset mental disorders in the period of 21-120 days following COVID-19 (3.8%, 3.6-4.0) compared to patients with respiratory tract infections (3%, 2.8-3.2). We further show that the risk for new-onset mental illness decreases over the first year following COVID-19 diagnosis compared to other respiratory tract infections and demonstrate a reduced (non-significant) hazard ratio over the period of 121-365 days following diagnosis. Similar findings are seen for new-onset anxiety disorders but not for mood disorders. Interpretation: Patients who have recovered from COVID-19 are at an increased risk for developing new-onset mental illness, especially anxiety disorders. This risk is most prominent in the first 120 days following infection.","Coleman, Ben, Casiraghi, Elena, Blau, Hannah, Chan, Lauren, Haendel, Melissa, Laraway, Bryan, Callahan, Tiffany, Deer, Rachel, Wilkins, Ken, Reese, Justin, Robinson, Peter","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.30.21267071","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-08","",23375,""
"An Evaluation of Childhood Tuberculosis Program in Chegutu District, Zimbabwe, 2020: A Descriptive Cross-Sectional Study (preprint)","Background:  Childhood tuberculosis (TB) is a major global public health concern contributing to significant child morbidity and mortality. A records review of the TB notification for Chegutu District Health Information System 2 (DHIS2) showed a low childhood TB case detection rate. For 2018 and 2019, childhood TB notifications were 4% and 7% respectively against the national 12% case detection rate. We evaluated the performance of the childhood TB program in Chegutu. Methods We conducted a descriptive cross-sectional study. Sixty-six health workers (HW) participated in the study. Interviewer-administered questionnaires and checklists were used to collect data on reasons for low TB case detection, HW childhood TB knowledge, program inputs, processes and outputs. Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats analysis was used to assess the childhood TB processes. We analyzed the data using Epi Info 7 TM to generate frequencies, proportions and means. A Likert scale was used to assess health worker knowledge. Results The majority 51/66(77%) of HW were nurses and 51/66(67%) of respondents were females. Reasons for the low childhood TB case detection were lack of HW confidence in collecting gastric aspirates 55/66(83%) and HWâ€™s negative attitudes towards gastric aspirate collection 23/66(35%). HW 24/66 (37%) had a fair childhood TB notification knowledge. The district had only one functional X-ray machine for 34 health facilities. Only 6/18 motorcycles were functional with inadequate fuel supply. No desk guide for the management of TB in children for HW (2018) was available in 34 health facilities. Ethambutol 400mg was out of stock and adult 800mg tablets were used. Funds allocated for motor vehicle and motorcycles service ($1612USD/year) were inadequate. The district failed to perform planned quarterly TB review meetings, contact tracing and childhood TB training due to funding and COVID-19 lockdown restrictions. Conclusion The childhood TB program failed to meet its targets due to inadequate inputs and suboptimal HW childhood TB knowledge. Case detection and notification can be improved through on-job training, mentorship, support and supervision and adequate resources.","Chimsimbe, Memory, Mucheto, Pride, Juru, Tsitsi Patience, Chadambuka, Addmore, Govha, Emmanuel, Gombe, Notion Tafara, Tshimanga, Mufuta","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1067049/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-08","",23376,""
"What Was the Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Low Back Pain? Data from the PAMPA Cohort, Brazil (preprint)","Background:  To evaluate how COVID-19 pandemic impacted low back pain (LBP) outcomes in southern Brazil. Methods: : Data from the Prospective Study about Mental and Physical Health (PAMPA) Cohort were analyzed. Adults were recruited between June and July 2020 in the Rio Grande do Sul state using online-based strategies. Participants responded a self-reported, online questionnaire on LBP with two timepoints: before (retrospectively) and during COVID-19 pandemic. We assessed the presence of LBP, LBP-related activity limitation (no/yes), and LBP intensity (0 to 10 [strongest pain]). Results: : From a total sample of 2,321 respondents (mean age: 37.6 Â± 13.5;75.4% women), the prevalence of LBP did not change significantly from before (74.7% [95%CI 72.3;76.9]) to during the COVID-19 pandemic (74.2% [95%CI 71.9;76.3]). However, an increased pain levels (ÃŸ: 0.40;95%CI 0.22;0.58) and a higher likelihood for activity limitation due to LBP was observed during the pandemic (PR 1.14;95%CI 1.01;1.29). Longitudinal analyzes showed that age, gender, BMI, chronic diseases, physical activity and anxiety and depression symptoms, were associated with LBP during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion:  Although the prevalence of LBP did not change during the COVID-19 pandemic, LBP-induced impairment in daily activities and LBP intensity was higher during than before the pandemic. Sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics were associated with increased LBP and related outcomes.","Caputo, Eduardo, Ferreira, Paulo, Feter, Natan, Doring, Igor, Leite, Jayne, Alt, Ricardo, Cassuriaga, JÃºlia, Reichert, Felipe, Rombaldi, Airton, Silva, Marcelo da","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1053577/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-08","",23377,""
"Mindfulness-Based Online Intervention Increases Well-Being And Decreases Stress After Covid-19 Lockdown (preprint)","Mindfulness interventions were shown to be effective in improving well-being and reducing perceived stress in several conditions.

The aim of this study was to test the effectiveness of online mindfulness intervention on healthy employees especially after the first Italian Covid-19 lockdown.Participants in the intervention group underwent an 8-week mindfulness online training program based on the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) protocol compared to a control (no-intervention) group. All participants filled in weekly surveys for the whole intervention duration via online questionnaires to measure their habits, mindfulness (FFMQ-15), emotion regulation (ERQ), positive and negative affect (PANAS), depression, anxiety and stress (DASS-21), resilience (RSA) and insomnia (ISI). 46 participants in the intervention group and 54 in the control group completed at least half of the weekly questionnaires and were considered in the longitudinal analyses. We found significant differences between the intervention and control groups over time in the measures of mindfulness (in particular the nonreactivity subscale), positive affect, depression, and insomnia. Moreover, we found that the frequency of practice and ease perceived in practicing were positively correlated to several indices of well-being (mindfulness, positive affect, cognitive reappraisal) and negatively correlated to several indices of stress (negative affect, depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, expressive suppression).

"Masked Emotions: Do Face Mask Patterns and Colors Affect the Recognition of Emotions? (preprint)","Previous research has shown that face masks restrain the ability to perceive social information and readability of emotions. These studies mostly explored the effect of standard medical, often white masks on emotion recognition. However, in reality, many individuals prefer masks with different styles. We investigated whether the appearance of the mask (pattern-angular vs. curvy and color-black vs. white) affected the recognition of emotional states. Participants were asked to identify the emotions on faces covered by masks with different designs. The presence of masks impeded emotional recognition, dropping the accuracy and confidence and increasing reaction times. There were no main effects of angularity vs. curvature or color on emotion recognition, which suggests that mask design may not impair the recognition beyond the effect of mere mask wearing. Besides, we found relationships between individual difference variables such as mask wearing attitudes, mask design preferences, individual traits and emotional recognition. The majority of participants demonstrated positive attitudes towards mask wearing and preferred non-patterned black and white masks. Preferences for white masks were associated with better emotional recognition of masked faces. In contrast, those with negative attitudes towards masks showed lower performance in emotional recognition for masked faces, preferring patterned more than plain masks, perhaps viewing masks as a fashion item rather than a necessity. Moreover, preferences to wear patterned masks were negatively related to actual wearing masks indoors and perceived risks of COVID.","Blazhenkova, Olesya, Dogerlioglu-Demir, Kivilcim","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/jszhd","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-08","",23379,""
"An exploratory study of social media usersâ€™ engagement with COVID-19 vaccine-related content [version 3;peer review: 2 approved] (preprint)","Background: Facebook, as the worldâ€™s most popular social media platform, has been playing various important roles throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing users to produce and share health-related information that both eases and complicates public health communication. However, the characteristics of vaccine-related Facebook content and usersâ€™ reaction to the vaccine issue has been an unexplored area to date. Methods: To fill the previous knowledge-gap, this exploratory study wants to understand the communication climate of Facebook on the COVID-19 vaccine issue, including the nature of dominant content and usersâ€™ engagement patterns with them. Therefore, the study analyzes the 10,000 most popular Facebook posts with the highest interactions on the vaccine issue. Results: The results show that Facebook users prioritize more vaccine-related news links (71.22%) over other content. The declining interactions on the issue suggests that interaction growth mainly depends on positive news on the vaccine. Finally, usersâ€™ reaction to the vaccine issue is dominantly positive, though they may show a highly negative attitude toward vaccine misinformation. Conclusions: A few limitations and strengths of this study are discussed along with values and implications. This study for the first time analyzes Bangla language-based Facebook content related to the COVID-19 vaccine issue, which is largely overlooked in global academic research.","Al-Zaman, Md Sayeed","https://www.google.com/search?q=An+exploratory+study+of+social+media+usersâ€™+engagement+with+COVID-19+vaccine-related+content+[version+3;peer+review:+2+approved]+(preprint)","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-08","",23380,""
