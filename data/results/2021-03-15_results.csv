"Clomipramine suppresses ACE2-mediated SARS-CoV-2 entry","Myocardial damage caused by the newly emerged coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection is one of key determinants of COVID-19 severity and mortality. SARS-CoV-2 entry to host cells are initiated by binding with its receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2, and the ACE2 abundance is thought to reflect the susceptibility to infection. Here, we found that clomipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection and metabolic disorder in human iPS-derived cardiomyocytes. Among 13 approved drugs that we have previously identified as potential inhibitor of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, clomipramine showed the best potency to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein pseudovirus-stimulated ACE2 internalization. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 infection to human iPS-derived cardiomyocytes (iPS-CMs) and TMPRSS2-expressing VeroE6 cells were dramatically suppressed even after treatment with clomipramine. Furthermore, the combined use of clomipramine and remdesivir was revealed to synergistically suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results will provide the potentiality of clomipramine for the breakthrough treatment of severe COVID-19.","Yuri Kato; Shigeru Yamada; Kazuhiro Nishiyama; Ayano Satsuka; Suyong Re; Daiki Tomokiyo; Jae Man Lee; Tomohiro Tanaka; Akiyuki Nishimura; Kenzo Yonemitsu; Hiroshi Asakura; Yuko Ibuki; Yumiko Imai; Noriho Kamiya; Kenji Mizuguchi; Takahiro Kusakabe; Yasunari Kanda; Motohiro Nishida","https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.13.435221","20210314","","bioRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-15","",11898,""

"Modelling the complexity of pandemic-related lifestyle quality change and mental health: An analysis of a nationally representative UK general population sample","Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the way many individuals go about their daily lives. This study attempted to model the complexity of change in lifestyle quality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its context within the UK adult population. Methods: Data from the COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium Study (Wave 3, July 2020; N=1166) were utilised. A measure of COVID-19-related lifestyle change captured how individualsâ€™ lifestyle quality had been altered as a consequence of the pandemic. Exploratory factor analysis and latent profile analysis were used to identify distinct lifestyle quality change subgroups, while multinomial logistic regression analysis was employed to describe class membership. Results: Five lifestyle dimensions, reflecting partner relationships, health, family and friend relations, personal and social activities, and work life were identified by the EFA, while seven classes characterised by distinct patterns of change across these dimensions emerged from the LPA: (1) Better overall (3.3%), (2) Worse except partner relations (6.0%), (3) Worse overall (2.5%), (4) Better relationships (9.5%), (5) Better except partner relations (4.3%), (6) No different (67.9%), and (7) Worse partner relations only (6.5%). Predictor variables differentiated membership of classes. Notably, classes 3 and 7 were associated with poorer mental health (COVID-19 related PTSD and suicidal ideation). Conclusions: Four months into the pandemic, most individualsâ€™ lifestyle quality remained largely unaffected by the crisis. Concerningly however, a substantial minority (15%) experienced worsened lifestyles compared to before the pandemic. In particular, a pronounced deterioration in partner relations seemed to constitute the more severe pandemic-related lifestyle change.","Sarah Butter et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460DE-783-5A5","20210315","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; uk; covid-19; latent variable modelling; lifestyle; mental health; relationships; pandemic","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-15","",11901,""
"Telephone-based Behavioral Activation with Mental Imagery for depression: a pilot randomized clinical trial in isolated older adults during the Covid-19 pandemic","Objectives To shield vulnerable persons, particularly the eldery, during the Covid-19 pandemic governments around the world have adviced to use social distancing and self-isolation. Social isolation might put older adults at an increased risk for mental health problems such as depression. There is a need for brief, easy-accessible psychological treatments for depressive symptoms that can be delivered remotely. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of telephone-delivered Behavioral Activation with Mental Imagery for the treatment of depressive symptoms in individuals 65 years and older living in isolation during the covid-19-pandemic. Methods In this open-label pilot randomized clinical trial, N = 41 individuals aged 65 years or older with clinically significant symptoms of depression were randomly assigned to either a Behavioral Activation with Mental Imagery treatment condition, or an Attention-Assessment control condition delivered over the telephone over a four week period. Results Depressive symptoms decreased more in the treatment condition compared to the control condition. At post treatment 2 out of 16 participants in the treatment condition met diagnostic criteria for depression compared to 9 out of 13 in the control condition. Most participants in the treatment condition were satisfied with the treatment and few adverse effects were observed. Conclusions This pilot study suggests that behavioral activation with mental imagery delivered over the telephone is feasible, acceptable and potentially efficacious for the treatment of depressive symptoms in older individuals living in isolation. Replication in larger samples is needed.","Johnny Pellas et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46005-8B6-D3D","20210311","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Intervention Research; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Psychotherapy; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Therapy; depression; mental imagery; social isolation; older adults; activity scheduling; behavioural activation","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-15","",11902,""
"Mothering and Stress During COVID-19: Exploring the Moderating Effects of Employment","Using primary data from the Assessing the Social Consequences of COVID-19 study (N=1,647), we examined how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the stress levels (i.e., pre-pandemic vs. during-pandemic stress) of women with and without coresiding minor children, paying special attention to the moderating role of womenâ€™s employment status. Results from OLS regression models show that following the pandemic outbreak, among women who worked full-time, mothers reported smaller stress increases than non-mothers. Among part-time and non-employed women, mothers and non-mothers experienced similar levels of stress increase. Changes in womenâ€™s work hours and employment status, following the pandemic onset, had limited impacts on the patterns of stress level changes. This study contributes to research on parenting and health by showing that during times of crisis, full-time employment may play a protective role for motherâ€™s mental health, but may not buffer the mental health deterioration of women not raising children.","Xu Yan et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D7-DB2-C95","20210314","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class; women; parenting; covid-19; employment; stress; mental health","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-15","",11903,""
