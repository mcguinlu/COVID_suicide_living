"Moral distress in physicians","Moral distress, initially described as the form of distress that occurs ""when one knows the right thing to do, but institutional constraints make it nearly impossible to pursue the right course of action,"" is highly prevalent among physicians. Contemporary descriptions of moral distress involve three domains including negative attitudes one experiences, one's perceived involvement in a situation, and perceived moral undesirability of the situation. Common sources of moral distress stem from clinical situations and internal and external constraints. Interventions can be targeted at the root causes and components of moral injury and distress, on both individual and organizational levels. These include fostering resiliency in individual clinicians, providing support and moral leadership and ethical culture. This chapter will provide an overview of moral distress in physicians including definitions, common sources and constraints, as well as interventions with specific examples from oncology and the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Humour as a coping strategy for employees in remote workspaces during COVID-19","COVID-19 has put a mental strain on many people globally in the short- and long-term perspective. It is extremely important to stay mentally healthy in times of pandemic challenges during social distancing, repeated lockdowns and social isolation, remote work, and home office and home-schooling practices. Humour is a coping strategy to deal with difficult situations and has a positive effect on mental health and well-being.This study uses a qualitative design and a hermeneutical research paradigm to explore the humour used in the professional WhatsApp communications of colleagues working in a consultancy organisation in Gauteng, South Africa, during a hard lockdown in March and April 2020. Findings show that humour was used to cope with the highly challenging situation of working remotely during these times. Humour could be identified in terms of five themes: women professionals and work-life challenges, individual change from professional to ""savage"", new lifestyles, marital relationships during social isolation, and the cure of COVID-19. Conclusions are drawn and recommendations for future research and practice are given.

"Prevention of panic buying","Panic buying (PB), an interdisciplinary phenomenon of social and public health relevance, has gained significant attention since the initial days of the COVID-19 pandemic. A combination of psychological and social factors has been proposed to explain the genesis of PB. Insights drawn from these theories can potentially inform preventive strategies for PB though empirical research on prevention of PB has been limited. In this chapter, we focus on outlining the possible preventive measures to control PB. The strategies are divided into universal prevention strategies, aimed at the entire population, selective prevention strategies that target vulnerable sub-sections of the population and indicated prevention for those showing early signs of the condition. Universal prevention strategies cover the role of governmental agencies, retailers, media and promotion of kinship/resilience among the public. Selective prevention strategies involve identification of individuals prone to PB, monitoring their behaviour and specifying purchase limits for commodities, while indicated prevention involves referral to mental health professionals for those with co-morbid anxiety or depression.

"Providing differentiated service delivery to the ageing population of people living with HIV","IntroductionDifferentiated service delivery (DSD) models for HIV are a person-centred approach to providing services across the HIV care cascade;DSD has an increasing policy and implementation support in high-burden HIV countries. The life-course approach to DSD for HIV treatment has focused on earlier life phases, childhood and adolescence, families, and supporting sexual and reproductive health during childbearing years. Older adults, defined as those over the age of 50, represent a growing proportion of HIV treatment cohorts with approximately 20% of those supported by PEPFAR in this age band and have specific health needs that differ from younger populations. Despite this, DSD models have not been designed or implemented to address the health needs of older adults.DiscussionOlder adults living with HIV are more likely to have significant co-morbid medical conditions. In addition to the commonly discussed co-morbidities of hypertension and diabetes, they are at increased risk of cognitive impairment, frailty and mental health conditions. Age and HIV-related cognitive impairment may necessitate the development of adapted educational materials. Identifying the optimal package of differentiated services to this population, including the frequency of clinical visits, types and location of services is important as is capacitating the healthcare cadres to adapt to these challenges. Technological advances, which have made remote monitoring of adherence and other aspects of disease management easier for younger populations, may not be as readily available or as familiar to older adults. To date, adaptations to service delivery have not been scaled and are limited to nascent programmes working to integrate treatment of common co-morbidities.ConclusionsOlder individuals living with HIV may benefit from a DSD approach that adapts care to the specific challenges of ageing with HIV. Models could be developed and validated using outcome measures, such as viral suppression and treatment continuity. DSD models for older adults should consider their specific health needs, such as high rates of co-morbidities. This may require educational materials, health worker capacity building and outreach designed specifically to treat this age group.","Godfrey, Catherine, Vallabhaneni, Snigdha, Shah, Minesh Pradyuman, Grimsrud, Anna","https://doi.org/10.1002/jia2.26002","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of the International AIDS Society; 25, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39241,""
"Psychological stress and influencing factors of hospital workers in different periods under the public health background of infectious disease outbreak: A cross-sectional study","Background and AimsIt is well known that public health emergencies can affect the mental health of medical personnel, and many studies have focused on cross-sectional studies with short-term benefits. The present study aimed to investigate the long-term influence of infectious disease outbreak about the mental health of hospital staff.MethodsThe demographic characteristics and mental health status of staff in Fuzhou, China, were analyzed by using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) Scale and Depression Screening Scale (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9]) in February and December 2020.ResultsThere were no significant differences in anxiety levels during different time periods (p &gt; 0.05), but there were significant differences among anxiety level and total score of GAD-7 scale (p &lt; 0.001). There were significant differences among the number of people with depression, depression level, and total score on the PHQ-9 scale (p &lt; 0.001). As the pandemic progressed, total scores of anxiety in medical staff with different titles decreased (p &lt; 0.05), but depression scores in professionals with intermediate and senior titles increased significantly (p &lt; 0.05). changes in anxiety and depression scores during different time periods also changed according to hospital worker specialty. Total scores of anxiety in doctors, nurses, medical technicians, and other staff members all decreased (p &lt; 0.05), while total scores of depression in doctors, nurses, and other staff members significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05). There were no significant differences in total depression score among medical technicians (p &gt; 0.05).ConclusionsSince the outbreak of an infectious disease public health emergency, the anxiety of hospital staff has decreased over time, but the depression has increased. The management and psychological support personnel in medical institutions should continue to pay attention to the mental health of medical staff, and it is necessary to take different intervention measures in different periods when implementing the psychological crisis prevention mechanism.","Miao, Xing, Wang, Wei, Chen, Yongli, Huang, Xiufang, Wang, Rehua","https://doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.834","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Health Science Reports; 5(5), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39242,""
"Improving quality of early care and education to support children's mental health","The United States is currently experiencing a youth mental health crisis. An already vulnerable, and from some perspectives, fundamentally flawed mental healthcare system has shown to be severely inadequate in supporting the increasing mental health needs of children and teens throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, a 2021 advisory report released by the Office of the Surgeon General named the youth mental health crisis as an ""urgent public health issue"" and called for a coordinated response by the country's child-serving institutions.

"Mental health response to COVID-19 in China and impact on psychiatrists","The COVID-19 outbreak has raised numerous challenges for mental health service system in China. The pandemic has many affects on clinical, research and teaching, due to the strict quarantine in china. Fight the COVID-19 became the most important thing in work. We outlined major mental health needs during COVID-19 outbreak from the exiting studies and challenges for mental health professionals, and how to manage these challenges in China. To reduce the risk of negative psychological outcomes associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the Central Health Authority of China and different national academic societies have integrated mental health crisis interventions into the general deployment of disease prevention and treatment. The NHCC developed a mental health triage strategy to provide four levels of psychological crisis interventions. More than 20 specific guidelines and expert consensus for mental health services for the COVID-19 outbreak were disseminated by the end of February 2020 to provide timely guidance for frontline health care professionals. External mental health expert teams in other provinces were also established to provide emergency mental health services in Hubei province, China. In addition, widespread adoption of online public education, psychological counseling, and hotline services have been set up for those in need. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has been under control in China, we should take a proactive lead to share its protocol of emergency mental health services with other countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Also international cooperation is urgely needed to control the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. Large-scale epidemiological surveys should be conducted to examine the prevalence of mental health problems associated with the COVID-19 pandemic to inform the development of appropriate mental health services in future.

"The Impact of SARS-CoV-2 on Mental Health Focus on depression, Antidepressants Consumption and ADRs Signal Detection: An International Journal of Medical Toxicology and Drug Experience","Introduction: The SARS-CoV-2 public health emergency is leading to challenges for healthcare professionals, students, patients with COVID-19 and vulnerable persons, blocking the economic development and mental wellbeing. The pandemic containment measures and the fear of infection have caused psychological distress and inflamed underlying diseases Objective: To analyse the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 on the Mental Health in Friuli-Venezia Giulia Region, Italy, focusing on depression disorder and Antidepressants consumption. Furthermore, to assess the state of adverse event reports, from spontaneous signalling method, in patients taking Antidepressants Methods: For consumption data extraction I utilized the Regional Social and Health Information System. About reports of ADRs based on the National Pharmacovigilance Network I used the VigiSegn app. I accessed on INTERCheck System to balancing the risks and benefits of therapies. I compared two periods from 11.03.2019 to 10.03.2020 and from 11.03.2020 to 11.03.2021 separated by 11 March 2020, when the Director General of the WHO described the situation as a pandemic [1]. Antidepressants were classified using the ATC code system. Anonymous drug utilization was expressed in DDDs Results: Since 11 March 2020 I observed a marginal increase in consumption of sertraline, trazodone and vortioxetine. Regarding pharmaceutical spending there has been an increase of sertraline, trazodone, vortioxetine, bupropion, mirtazapine and venlafaxine. In the feminine gender, I observed an increase in AD consumption in the age ranges &lt; 15 yrs, 16-19, 30-34, 55-59, 60-64, 70-74, 80-84, over 85;in the male gender in the ranges &lt; 15 yrs, 20-24, 30-34, 55-59, 70-74, 80-84, over 85 (Picture 1). Concerning ADRs I analysed one tab about AD out of a total of 2146 medicines and vaccines reports in which the ""hyponatremia"" is reported on the warning label and caused by significant drug interactions Conclusion: Although the SARS-CoV-2 public health emergency is a rapidly evolving situation, the knowledge about the impact on the Mental Health is still limited. It is likely that the psychosocial demand will increase in the coming months. In the regional context, the thesis has highlighted a very slight rise in AD consumptions and a cant decrease spontaneous signalling method compared to the previous year. These scenarios also depend on the new balance of health services and the lack of access to care (10% of citizens has given up on care) [13, 14].

"A COVID-19 necessity or the future of medical education? An evaluation of online psychiatry tutorials for medical students","Introduction Following the national lockdown in the UK in March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we instigated regular online tutorials for fourth year medical students undertaking their psychiatry placement. Objectives The aims of these tutorials were threefold: to ensure that students covered a range of key psychiatry topics, to enable them to have the opportunity for interactive tutorials with experienced psychiatrists and, not least, to create a sense of continuity and connection with their tutors and peers across the mental health block. Methods Each student was allocated to a tutorial group comprising 10 â€“ 15 medical students and a psychiatrist facilitator. These groups met weekly for 7 consecutive weeks at an agreed time for 60 â€“ 90 minutes via an online platform and all covered the same allocated topic each week. We evaluated these groups via an online survey sent to the students following the programme. Results The students rated the tutorials on average as 4.5/5 on whether they met the defined learning outcomes. On average the students did not consider that the virtual format made a significant difference to their learning, but this disguised a wide range of views that were expressed via a comment box. Conclusions The evaluation of this project supports the use of virtual tutorials as a valuable learning tool but educators need to be aware that student viewsâ€™ on these can be varied and so, long-term, a blend of virtual and face to face learning is most likely to meet the needs of all students.","Wyke, C.; Butler, S.","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+COVID-19+necessity+or+the+future+of+medical+education?+An+evaluation+of+online+psychiatry+tutorials+for+medical+students","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists; 64(Suppl 1):S596-S596, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39246,""
"The influence of cultural values on caregiving stress for Chinese American dementia/Alzheimer's family caregivers","Literature review revealed that stress and coping strategies utilized in caring for a family member with Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia were understudied among Chinese American caregivers in the United States in relation to cultural values. The focus of the study was to examine the lived experiences of the Chinese American caregivers caring for a family member with Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia. The purpose of the study was to explore Chinese American caregivers' stress and coping strategies and how cultural values and attitudes towards traditional values affected the experiences. Alzheimer's can be a burdensome disease to the individuals who live with the disease and to their families and informal caregivers (often are family members), which appeared to have increased in recent years. Though there has been much research on dementia care, there is a lack of studies on racial and ethnic minorities, the impact of the cultures, and the generational differences and attitudes towards caregiving. The participants met the following criteria: (a) must be self-identified as a Chinese American, (b) must currently live in the San Francisco Bay Area, (c) must be 21 years and older, (d) must be fluent in English, (e) must have a family member who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's or other forms of dementia, and (f) must be providing care for a family member with Alzheimer's or other dementia. Eight Chinese American caregivers participated in a virtual interview, due to COVID-19 restrictions. A Conventional Content Analysis approach was used to understand the participants' lived experiences by examining emerging categories (themes). Four categories emerged regarding caregiving stressors: Care Recipient's Diagnosis and Treatments, Finances, Care Recipient's Behaviors, and Physical Strains. Five categories emerged regarding emotional reactions towards caregiving: Happiness, Anger, Inadequacy, Fear, and Remorse. Three categories emerged regarding cultural factors: Acculturation, Stigma, and Family Dynamics. Four categories emerged regarding coping strategies: Physical Escape, Social Supports, Problem-Solving, and Unhelpful Coping. Study results provided a better understanding of the types of stressors and of the emotional responses, further insights into the influence of the Chinese values, and the coping strategies among Chinese American caregivers. Implications for clinicians working with the Chinese American families were provided to help mental health professionals understand the importance of developing culturally appropriate and sensitive interventions and programs to meet the needs of the Chinese American Alzheimer's and other dementia caregivers and care recipients.

"Risk and protective factors for opioid overdose during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction People who use drugs (PWUD) are now at the intersection of two public health emergencies â€“ the Covid-19 pandemic and the overdose crisis. They may be at heightened risk of overdose due to increased isolation, worsened mental health, and changes to the illicit drug supply. The province of British Columbia (BC) in Canada is anticipated to experience a record-breaking year of overdose deaths as over 1,500 people (32.9 deaths per 100,000) have died from overdose in 2020. In response, BC released new clinical guidelines in March to allow the prescribing of pharmaceutical alternatives aiming to reduce PWUDâ€™s risk of overdose and contracting Covid-19. Objectives We examined the risk and protective factors for overdose during these dual crises. We explored how the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted the mental health and substance use of PWUD and their access to treatment and harm reduction services. Methods We are conducting a survey among patients with opioid use disorder at a major hospital in Vancouver, BC. It includes the following domains: sociodemographic characteristics;mental and physical health;substance use patterns;opioid overdose history;access to treatment, harm reduction services;impacts of Covid-19. Results We anticipate collecting data from 200 participants. Descriptive statistics and regression analysis will be conducted to describe the sample and determine the risk, protective factors for overdose. Conclusions We will gain a better understanding of overdose risk in PWUD who are now navigating the complex challenges created by the dual crises. This will in turn inform the establishment of evidence-based strategies to reduce their overdose risk.

"Public Health Nursing's Impact on Strengthening Community Resilience","Beginning with the Henry Street Visiting Nurse Service in 1895, public health nursing was envisioned by Lillian Wald and Mary Brewster to promote community resilience, in cooperation with multisectoral private-public partnerships, by meeting people where they are without blaming them for their problems.2 Two articles in this supplement demonstrate the impact of public health nursing practices and policies on strengthening community resilience at multiple levels of influence: adaptive (ability to adjust), absorptive (ability to cope), anticipatory (ability to predict and be proactive), and transformative (ability to transform systems to deal with change and uncertainty).3 Guided by the Community Resiliency Model, Duva et al. (p. S271) describe the impact of a nurse-led public health intervention designed to meet population mental health needs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Guided by the Public Health 3.0 and communitybased participatory frameworks, Austin et al. (p. S275) describe a communityvalidated mobile application that provided actionable data to communities to address substance use during the COVID-19 pandemic, shifting the focus of the communities from a deficit-based approach to a strength-based or resilience approach.

"Health Insurers' Response to Current Mental Health Parity Laws","[...]this Note argues that health insurers should take a more meaningful role in complying with and promoting mental health well-being. By the 1980s, any progress made up to that point was soon after undetectable.24 President Bill Clinton later considered mental health parity during his healthcare reform efforts in 1993,25 but these efforts were equally unsuccessful.26 It was only in 1996 that Senators Pete Domenici and John Danforth introduced the first round of momentous federal parity legislation known as The Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 (MHPA).27 Although the MHPA was a compromised version of the more extensive 1992 Domenici-Wellstone bill, it nonetheless was the first of its kind and a sign of things to come.28 According to the MHPA, insurers were prohibited from imposing disparate annual and lifetime limits for mental health benefits when compared to surgical and medical benefits as offered by a group health plan or health insurance issuer offering coverage in connection with a group health plan.29 While this meant that insurers could no longer stymie access to mental health services by providing unequal coverage under a plan, the MHPA contained certain important exceptions. Rather, it only applied to group health plans that offered mental health benefits at the outset, and it did not apply to employers with fewer than 50 employees.30 Moreover, insurers were free to charge different copays and coinsurance rates.31 Lastly, employers could request exempt status from any requirements if they could show a one percent increase in premiums.32 a. The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act To combat the vast shortcomings of the MHPA,33 Congress eventually passed the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act in 2008 (MHPAEA).34 This newly enacted law prohibited differences in treatment options as well as certain cost-sharing schemes insurers previously engaged in under the MHPA. [...]according to the MHPA, insurers could set daily limits on outpatient mental health services, set their own coinsurance rates (including co-pays, deductibles, and out-of-pocket maximums), and limit treatment benefits irrespective of any parity considerations.35 Nonetheless, despite these additional requirements, the MHPAEA did not require that health insurers provide coverage for any type of mental health services.36 b. The Affordable Care Act Beyond providing health care for 20 million previously uninsured Americans, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) set the stage for what would become the largest development in access to mental health services this country has ever seen.37 Most notably, the ACA defined ""mental health and substance use treatment"" as an essential health benefit (EHB)38 and required individual and small-group plans to cover all EHBs.39 As previously noted, the MHPAEA only applied to large employers (50 or more employees) and only if they chose to provide mental health coverage.","Ward, Charles","https://www.google.com/search?q=Health+Insurers'+Response+to+Current+Mental+Health+Parity+Laws","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Corporation Law; 47(3):843-859, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39250,""
"Managing the challenges in implementing digital mental health in europe","Body The demand for mental health care is increasing globally as a result of societal challenges such as automation, increased economic competition, unemployment and the growing impact of climate change. The direct and indirect economic costs of mental health problems are substantial, totalling over â‚¬ 600 billion yearly across the EU (OECD 2018). The COVID-19 crisis has led to an additional increase in demand and has changed the way care is delivered. Since March 2020 there has been a significant increase in the use of e-mental health (eMH), telemental health in particular. eMH can contribute to keeping services, accessible, affordable and patient focused. The eMEN project (funded by the EU Interreg North-West-Europe programme) is promoting the latter through a European cooperation platform for eMH development, research and implementation. This platform focuses on high quality and professional â€˜blended careâ€™, which combines face-to-face and online treatment. The implementation of eMH has been slow and varies considerably between EU countries, even though this technology has been on the market for over 20 years. The reasons for this are related to quality problems (e.g. validation, usability), resistance from clinicians, lack of blended care treatment protocols, digital skills, reimbursement systems and policies and other barriers. Many service providers and public health authorities are increasing their efforts to overcome these barriers.

"Maintaining therapeutic continuity in adolescent psychiatric day hospital programs during the COVID-19 lockdown","Introduction The COVID-19 social lockdown imposed important limitation to non-emergency health care services in Italy, between March and May 2020, with many difficulties in the mental health assistance of those chronic conditions needing a continuative therapeutic support. Objectives Our study aimed to describe how therapeutic activities have been carried on by remote services in two Adolescent Psychiatric Day Hospital Units (Rome and Turin) and the outcome of these assistance interventions in youths with subacute psychopathology. Methods The patient cohort includes 162 adolescents (12-19 years old;QI&gt;70) DH outpatients presenting a complete clinical and neuropsychiatric assessment before the lockdown. During the several phases of COVID-19 quarantine all patients were monitored and supported by telemedicine interventions. All data were recorded and standardized every 15 days: symptom severity was rated by global severity (CGI-S) and stress level by self-reported measures of stress (IES-R). Results Among patients, CGI score remained stable, IES-R score declined over time: higher IES-R score was significantly associated with female gender and but no differences was observed related with the primary diagnosis. 5 patients presented a clinical acute state needing a hospitalization. The rate of hospitalization was not significantly different compared with the rate observed in the same period of 2019. Conclusions In youth with psychopathological conditions, remote assistance for psychiatric cares resulted effective and it was associated with a clinical stability with decreasing stress levels.

"The challenges of psychopharmacological treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic in lombardy","Introduction: Public Mental Health Services in Lombardy (Italy) has 27 Departments for Mental Health and Addiction Services and a number of private residential facilities. With the reorganization of the entire Healthcare system to deal with COVID-19, Regional Health Authorities recognized mental health as a priority and authorized the continuation of mental health services for the general population. Objectives: To review the initiatives and procedures implemented in Lombardy during the Covid-19 pandemic in relation to the organization of Psychiatric Services and continuity of psychopharmacological treatment. Results: Hospital admissions for acute psychiatric disorders in patients positive for COVID-19 required a dedicated area in the psychiatric ward or alternatively, a medical ward supported by psychiatric staff. Psychiatric hospital activity for patients negative for Covid-19 has been maintained as usual. The activity in the Mental Health Centers has been maintained in patients suffering from severe mental disorders as well as in those with serious social problems or judicial sentences. Particular attention was paid to patientsâ€™ clinical monitoring and drug administration. Long-acting Injection antipsychotics were often preferred to oral treatment to ensure adherence and continuity of care. Appropriate e-health technologies were used to reach patients and their families, for monitoring patients and avoiding drop-outs of patients with serious diseases. Conclusions: Maintaining continuous monitoring of patients in contact with mental health services is essential for a careful assessment of their condition from both a psychopathological and medical point of view during pandemic.

"Inpatient psychiatry care during coronavirus 2019 pandemic lockdown: Results from a department of psychiatry in northern Portugal","Introduction COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent containment measures have a negative impact on mental health. Simultaneously, the fear of infection can discourage patients from seeking necessary care. Objectives We aim to compare sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of inpatients admitted during the COVID-19 confinement period in Portugal vs. inpatients admitted in the same period the previous year. Methods Retrospective observational study of inpatients admitted between March 19thÂ 2020 and May 1stÂ 2020 and the analog period of 2019 in a psychiatry inpatient unit of a tertiary hospital. Descriptive analysis of the results was performed using the SPSS software, version 26.0. Results During the lockdown period, there were 30 admissions to the psychiatry inpatient unit, 55.2% less than the same period last year (n=67). The proportion of compulsory admissions and the average length of stay did not differ between the two periods. Regarding sociodemographic characteristics, in the confinement period inpatients were similar to the ones in the same period of 2019. In both periods, the majority of patients had previous psychiatric history (lockdown vs. same period last year: 95.5% and 90.0%) and a similar proportion of readmissions rate (previous year) was similar in the two groups (49.9% vs 47.6%). At discharge, the most frequent diagnostic groups were mood disorders (33.3% (n=10) and 34.3% (n=23)) and schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders (26,7% (n=8) and 31.3% (n=21)). Conclusions Although there was an expressive reduction of admissions to the psychiatry inpatient unit during lockdown, the clinical characteristics of these patients were analogous to the same period in the previous year.","Vieira, A.; Andrade, F.; Machado, A.

"Lessons learned from the coronavirus health crisis in the nordic countries","Body The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented influence on the global economy and population health. Vigorous, well-designed studies with complete, long-term follow-up of high risk groups including COVID-19 patients, their families and frontline workers are imperative for a comprehensive understanding of the mental health impact of the pandemic. The Nordic-Baltic national registries and biobank resources provide a unique opportunity to gain critical insight into the interplay between mental and somatic health during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVIDMENT consortium leverages an extensive research experience and infrastructure from ongoing collaborations between four Nordic countries and Estonia, including national registry resources (est. &gt;24 million individuals) and new COVID-19 cohorts with questionnaire data (est. &gt; 220.000 individuals), to significantly advance current knowledge of mental morbidity trajectories in the COVID-19 pandemic. This program will address the following specific aims: 1) The role of preexisting psychiatric disorders in subsequent risk and progression of a COVID-19 infection. 2) The impact of COVID-19 on short and long-term psychiatric sequel among COVID-19 patients, their families and frontline workers. 3) The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on population mental health by the varying mitigating responses and corresponding COVID-19 related mortality rates across 4 Nordic countries and Estonia.

"Lessons learned from an e-mental health intervention: The promotion of stopblues in 41 french cities","Introduction For more than a decade, digital health has held promise for enabling a much broader population to have access to health information, education and services. However, the increasing number of studies on the subject show mixed results and currently, there is a certain disillusionment regarding its benefits. And yet, the Covid-19 crisis has revealed the importance of developing digital-based complementary support to existing resources. Objectives Factors associated with higher utilization rates among the target audience need to be investigated. Methods In 2018, 41 French cities enrolled in an intervention program aimed at promoting StopBluesÂ®, a digital health tool that helps prevent mental distress and suicide among the general population. After two years of experimentation, a Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) was performed using quantitative and qualitative data collection methods from institutional sources, questionnaires and web analytics tools. Results Finding trends show that higher utilization rates were associated with the involvement of general practitioners (GPs) in the promotion of StopBlues and the use of digital marketing channels. Context-specific characteristics also played an important role in the adoption of the tool. Conclusions The local context has a strong influence on how digital tools are locally promoted and accepted. Further research is needed to understand how local actors and specifically GPs can be involved in suicide prevention. More broadly, the challenge today is to ensure acceptance of digital health technology among targeted populations by adapting the digital offer to their needs and promoting the available tools.

"Locked in and stressed out: COVID-19 and video-telemedicine in community perinatal mental health services","Introduction The COVID-19 viral pandemic has taken the world by surprise. The pandemic has caused a great impact on the mental health and wellbeing of pregnant women with mental health difficulties. Healthcare providers veered towards video-telemedicine to safely and swiftly provide services to its users. Objectives To determine impact of Video-telemedicine on: 1. Access to Care 2. Ease of Use 3. Quality of Care 4. Difficulties of Use 5. Future Prospects of Video Telemedicine Methods We have decided to conduct a targeted survey to 100 pregnant women who are known to Perinatal Mental Health services to assess the new methods of contact that the viral pandemic has enforced upon healthcare providers. Results Pre-pandemic: video-telemedicine was ranked as least preferred Post-pandemic it is ranked as second favourite. 70.4% of responders have confirmed that video-telemedicine significantly facilitated access to care. 23.3% of responders insisted video-telemedicine made the service better. 50% of responders thought it was much easier to use video options to access their care services needs 95.4% of responders felt that video-telemedicine alternatives should remain post-pandemic Conclusions Video-telemedicine options have significantly improved the access and quality of services provided by Community Health Services to pregnant women during the pandemic. Video options can also make it easier to reach critical care without negatively affecting the quality of wholistic care provided, in fact, it can sometimes improve it. It is important that the psychiatric field learn from this pandemic and implement these services permanently. Bigger and wider studies need to be done in the future to support these conclusions.

"Psychological distress associated with acculturation in Latinx youth","There are various areas in the United States whose geographic location makes for unique rural communities, distanced from cities in more urban or industrialized regions. One such place is the population of Presidio, Texas, a rural community of approximately 5,000 people with the nearest cities being approximately 250 miles away. Existing research attempts to define acculturation through the lens of Latino or Hispanic cultures, otherwise known as Latinx, often failing to address specific subcultural groups within this cultural classification and disregarding the inter- and within cultural differences that may be impacted by regional differences (Michaels, 2014). Latinx, or Latino/Latina, is the umbrella term used for individuals of Latin descent. Populations of Mexican American adolescents residing in rural communities are believed to be uniquely affected by the acculturation or enculturation processes (Michaels, 2014). Acculturation refers to the process of integrating and adopting the values, customs, norms, attitudes, and behaviors of the dominant host culture (Nair et al., 2018). This happens when two or more cultures meet requiring an individual to adapt (Nair et al., 2018). Like acculturation, enculturation refers to socialization but is the individual process. A person learns the dynamics of their surrounding culture and acquires values and norms appropriate or necessary in that culture, like a child being born into a specific culture who naturally learns the culture's dynamics (Lorenzo-Blanco et al., 2012). As part of this process, the influences that limit, direct, or shape the individual (whether deliberately or not) include parents, other adults, peers, exposure to media, school settings, and so on. Several studies suggest gender roles may play a significant role in the way females and males respond to the acculturation process, resulting in differences in mental health outcomes (Revilla, 2008;Diaz & Bui, 2017). This study used the Brief Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans-II (ARSMA) and the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement System (PROMIS) to determine if psychological well-being is associated with levels of acculturation (ARSMA, n.d.;PROMIS, n.d.). The study focused on a group of students believed to be affected by the acculturation process due to disadvantages related to cultural factors or race. These students have been identified as English Language Learners (ELL) that participate in Limited English Proficiency programs in public school systems. By investigating Mexican American youth between ages 13 and 17 who reside in a rural border community, this study focused on this specific cultural group rather than the general Latinx population. Ultimately, the goal of the present study was to identify gender differences in acculturation and psychological well-being within Mexican American ELL youth residing in a rural border-town community. Due to obstacles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the researcher was unable to gather a large enough sample to yield statistical significance.

Methods The study entailed completing an online survey. 829 women, 103 partners, and 90 midwives participated in the study. Quantitative data were explored using descriptive statistics. Open-ended responses regarding the perceived benefits and barriers to using a digital mental health assessment were investigated using thematic analysis. Resultant themes were then mapped onto the Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation Model of Behaviour (COM-B model). Results The provision of perinatal mental healthcare support was limited and varied across respondents, particularly throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. There was a strong interest in using a digital mental health assessment placed within maternity healthcare settings to screen, diagnose, and triage concerns (Figure 1). In-person and blended care approaches (i.e., in-person and remote support) were preferred by women and partners in the event of further care being advised (Figure 1). Identified barriers and benefits mainly related to physical opportunity (e.g., accessibility), psychological capability (e.g., cognitive skills) and automatic motivation (e.g., emotions). Conclusions This study provides proof-of-concept support for the development of a digital mental health assessment to inform clinical decision-making for perinatal mental health concerns.

"Eviction, post-traumatic stress, and emergency department use among low-income individuals in New Haven, CT","Highlights â€¢ Past research indicates that eviction adversely impacts physical and mental health.â€¢ Few studies have examined whether and how eviction impacts healthcare use.â€¢ We found that legal and informal evictions were associated with subsequent ED use.â€¢ We found that post-traumatic stress symptoms were common after eviction.â€¢ Interventions to advance housing stability may improve health and decrease future ED use. We sought to examineÂ whether and how landlord-related forced moves (inclusive of, but not limited to, legal eviction) were associated with emergency department (ED) use over time. We used survey data collected between 2017 and 2019 among 283 low-income participants in New Haven, CT to examine whether experiencing a legal eviction or other landlord-related forced move (T0) was associated with increased odds of ED use 6Â months (T1) and 12Â months (T2) later. We conducted bootstrapped mediation analyses to examine indirect effects of post-traumatic stress symptoms. One-fifth of participants (nÂ =Â 61) reported a recent forced move at baseline (T0);half of these were legally evicted. Landlord-related forced moves were associated with ED use at T1Â (AORÂ =Â 2.06, 95Â % CI: 1.04â€“4.06) and T2Â (AORÂ =Â 3.05, 95Â % CI: 1.59â€“5.88). After adjustment for sociodemographic factors and other health-related confounders, legal eviction was not significantly associated with ED use at T1 (AORÂ =Â 1.61, 95Â % CI: 0.68â€“3.81), but was significantly associated with ED use at T2 (AORÂ =Â 3.58, 95Â % CI: 1.58â€“8.10). Post-traumatic stress symptoms accounted for 15.1% of forced movesâ€™ association with ED use (pÂ &lt;.05). Landlord-related forced moves are positively associated with subsequent ED use, and post-traumatic stress symptoms are one factor that may help explain this association. Structural interventions that promote housing stability are needed to advance health equity, and they may also help to reduce preventable ED use. Such interventions are imperative in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has strained health system capacity and exacerbated housing instability for many low-income renters. Results underscore the relevance of trauma-informed care and integrated care management to clinical practice in emergency settings.","Smith, Patrick D.; Groves, Allison K.; Langellier, Brent A.; Keene, Danya E.; Rosenberg, Alana, Blankenship, Kim M.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Eviction,+post-traumatic+stress,+and+emergency+department+use+among+low-income+individuals+in+New+Haven,+CT","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Preventive medicine reports; 29, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39266,""
"Outpatient psychiatric service utilization during the Covid-19 pandemic","Background The conditions related to the Covid-19 pandemic and quarantine have endangered the mental health of people in the community, especially psychiatric patients. This study aims to determine the mental health services usage of outpatient psychiatric patients who attended a public mental health clinic in Tehran, during the quarantine. The study sample consisted of 387 patients with an active record in the mental health clinic. They were selected using systematic random sampling. Data was gathered with the telephone interviews using the researcher-made checklist. The data were then collected and analyzed. Results Participants in this study included 141 male and 264 female patients. One-hundred forty-two patients (36.7%) felt better during this period, and the rest got worse or did not make a difference. Among the patients who felt the need to visit, 144 (47.2%) referred for services, of which 81.7% had visited in person. Among the applicants, 84 (56%) succeeded in receiving the service. A total of 53.5% of patients had used at least one face to face, telephone, or online visit. Among them, women are compared to men (p = 0.002), educated people to low education (p &lt; 0.001), and adults to children and the elderly (p = 0.02), and Tehran residents to foreigners (p = 0.01) used significantly more services. Conclusions Experience with pandemic quarantine conditions has shown that face-to-face use of these services faces significant barriers. In this situation, the expansion of online services can help improve the condition of patients and should be on the agenda of mental health policymakers.","Shirzad, Fateme, Shati, Mohsen, Mortazavi, Seyede Salehe, Gholamzad, Shakiba, Ahmadkaraji, Shahrzad, Pazhooyan, Mahdie, Saeedi, Narges, Hashemi, Rana, Shirdel, Saeedeh, Salehi, Mahdieh","https://www.google.com/search?q=Outpatient+psychiatric+service+utilization+during+the+Covid-19+pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Middle East Current Psychiatry, Ain Shams University; 29(1), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39267,""
"Digitalization of education and mental health","Introduction Various social problems, financial difficulties and academic factors contribute to the fact that more and more students around the world experience mental health problems (Chen et al., 2013;Gotlib et al., 2019). On the other hand, all the sides of studentsâ€™ lives â€“ from education to family relationships â€“ are mediated by information communication technologies, that may have broad and ambiguous influence on students mental health. What is undoubtedly that youth mental health can no longer be considered without touching on the digitalization, including in education. Objectives The current study aims to point up positive and negative examples of intersection of education digitalization and mental health of modern youth. Methods Theoretical analysis of research publications and conceptualization of practical applications in education mediated by digital technologies. Results A striking example of the negative impact of total digitalization of education was the sharp deterioration in mental health in the context of the transition to fully distant learning in conditions of the spread of coronavirus infection. Positive education as teaching form for both traditional skills and positive functioning and happiness provides a broad opportunities to combine the concepts of positive psychology with cutting-edge high-tech education approaches. Conclusions Digitalization of modern education can be accompanied by both mental health risks and new opportunities.

"Telehealth in childrenâ€™s psychiatric services","Introduction Covid-19 intensified public demand for telehealth services in child psychiatry. The shift towards online services raised concerns related to safety and quality of services. Objectives The objective of the study was to explore outcomes and perceptions regarding psychiatric telehealth services from the patientsâ€™ and professionalsâ€™ perspectives. Methods Survey and questionnaires were the main methods to collect feedback after 1129 sessions conducted by psychiatrists and psychotherapists for 559 young patients in 2020. Results Overall, patients/caregivers were generally satisfied with the quality of services, despite some technical issues and limitations of the platform. The most common outcomes of the sessions were: psychotherapy, in-depth assessment, pharmacotherapy, in-patient treatment, referrals for in-person appointments with other specialists, parenting strategies. Professionals gave more positive feedback on telehealth services after a few months of practice and training. Psychiatrists preferred conducting telehealth appointments for the patients they have previously seen in-person. The most common diagnosis were various neurodevelopmental disorders (48,9%), as well as patients within F84.0-F84.5 27,9%, and F84.8 (19,8%). Identification challenges, confidentiality and safety maintenance were among the top concerns for mental health workers. Specific guidelines for caregivers helped to use the appointment time effectively, prevent some technical and organizational issues and decrease negative effects of limited communication capabilities during a telehealth appointment. Conclusions Telehealth services in psychiatry are meeting real needs of patients, caregivers and professionals, and require further development. Proper training for professionals and clear guidelines for caregivers are among the key factors that enhance the quality of services.","Shchedrinskaya, O.; Bebtschuk, M.; Khairetdinov, O.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Telehealth+in+childrenâ€™s+psychiatric+services","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists; 64(Suppl 1):S346-S347, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39269,""

"Relationship quality in couples related to mental health of women and men during the COVID-19 pandemic and stay-at-home orders","Introduction The data on gender differences in mental health make the investigation of the specific impact of the pandemic and of the stay-at-home orders on men and women relevant. Objectives The study focuses on the quality of the relationship in couples and mental health in men and women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The study was conducted through an online survey a few weeks after the pandemic was declared and the stay-at-home order was introduced in Russia. 274 participants (50 men and 224 women) engaged in long-term relationships aged from 18 to 62 (M=34.2;SD=9.1) took part in the research. The instruments included the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale, the Perceived Relationship Quality Components, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales. Results Women show a considerably higher level of stress (t=3.805;p&lt;0.001), depression (t=3.76;p&lt;0.001) and anxiety (t=2.959;p=0.003). The quality of relationship for women is significantly connected with mental wellbeing (r=0.423;p&lt;0.001) and negatively correlated with the stress level (r= -0.60;p&lt;0.001), depression (r= -0,381;p&lt;0,001) and anxiety (r=-0,313;p&lt;0,001). Meanwhile for men, the quality of the relationship is connected to mental wellbeing (r=0.280;p=0.049), opposed to stress levels (r= -0.316;p=0.025) and is neither connected to depression (r= -0.210;p=0.144) nor to anxiety (r= -0.126;p=0.383). Conclusions During the pandemic, a favorable partnership has a positive effect on the mental health of both men and women. However, while the relationship quality affects all investigated indicators of mental health in women, in men the relationship quality is only connected to the level of mental wellbeing and stress.

"Mood disorders and suicides during coronavirus pandemic","Introduction The outbreak of COVID-19 has disrupted the lives of countless people worldwide. The pandemic has imposed a sense of uncertainty and anxiety, as the world could not predict or prepare for this crisis. It is important to study risk factors, including employment, marital status, and pre-existing medical or psychiatric conditions to effectively handle this pandemicâ€™s mental health impact. Objectives We aim to evaluate factors contributing to the suicides and mood disorders during the coronavirus pandemic. Methods We examined MeSH terms â€œCOVID-19â€ in the context of â€œMood Disorders,â€ â€œSuicide,â€ â€œSuicidal Ideation,â€ â€œAssisted or Suicide, Attempted or Suicide,â€ â€œRisk Factors.â€ We identified eight case studies for the qualitative synthesis per the PRISMA guidelines, searching Medline, PubMed, PubMed Central, and PsychInfo databases until August 2020. Results We identified that the population of all age groups and sex are at risk of stress and mental illness due to the pandemic. Several factors are attributed to the increased risk of mood disorders and suicide. Not having pre-existing psychiatric or medical condition is not a protective factor, since suicide was attempted or committed due to external factors such as economic and social.

"Mental health impact of covid on athletes","Introduction The coronavirus pandemic continues to impact all aspects of the daily life of the public worldwide. With decreased economic activity, the sports industry faces significant challenges of maintaining athletesâ€™ mental health while seeking the best strategies for eventual return to sports competition. Objectives We aim to evaluate COVID-19 related factors impacting on the mental health of athletes and provide appropriate management steps. Methods We examined MeSH terms â€œAthletes,â€ â€œSports,â€ â€œCOVID-19,â€ in the context of â€œMental Health,â€ â€œMental Disorders,â€ â€œBehavioral Medicine,â€ â€œRisk Factors.â€ We identified seven studies for the qualitative synthesis per the PRISMA guidelines, searching Medline, PubMed, PubMed Central, and PsychInfo databases until July 2020. Results The pandemic has negatively impacted athletesâ€™ mental wellbeing due to decreased physical activities, limited resources, fears, and delays or cancellations of the sporting event. The negative psychological impact on athletes is due to self-isolation measures leading to worries of less preparedness for the lockdown, reduced physical activity, loss of competitive advantages, fear of being infected, social isolation, and loneliness. During this period, athletes struggled to maintain baseline routine and engaged in excessive calorie intake, eating low-quality food, substance use, and sleep disruption. It has caused anxiety, depression, PTSD, and mood disorder at varying degrees of severity in athletes. Conclusions Limited resources during a pandemic have caused adverse mental impact on athletes.

"Problematic facebook use during COVID-19 pandemic among Tunisian women","Introduction Due to COVID-19 pandemic, the Tunisian government officially announced a lockdown on March 2020. This decision caused a significant change in the everyday life of Tunisians such as movement restriction revealing the psychosocial aspect of this crisis. Objectives This study aims to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of Tunisian women and its association with social media addiction. Methods This study was conducted using an online survey, between April 25 and May 6, 2020. Women were asked about sociodemographic information, lockdown conditions. The Facebook Bergen Addiction Scale (FBAS) was used to evaluate addiction to Facebook and social media. The Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21) was used to evaluate depression, anxiety and stress. Results We included 751 participants. Scores of the FBAS ranged from 6 to 30 and the mean score was 16.49 (Â± 5.4). Forty percent (n = 300) of respondents might have facebook addiction, as per the scale. A significant positive correlation was found between Facebook addiction score and DASS scores of depression (p = 0.001, r = 0.43), anxiety (p = 0.001, r = 0.39) and stress (p = 0.001, r = 0.41).

"The impact of new psychosocial stresssors on the mental health of young people: Results from a national multicentric study in italy","The COVID-19 pandemic and its related containment measures, such as lockdown, is affecting mental health of the general population worldwide. This is an unprecedented event, which is influencing the health care, political, economic, and social welfare systems. Among Western countries, Italy has been one of the first severely hit by the pandemic in terms of number of cases and mortality rates. Therefore, on March 8, 2020, the Italian Prime Minister issued restrictive measures in order to limit the spread of the disease. During this period known as â€œPhase oneâ€ of the national health emergency, all not necessary activities have been closed, more than 29,000 people have died and almost 100,000 people have been home-isolated, with strict lockdown measures. The COvid Mental hEalth Trial (COMET) network, including ten university Italian sites and the National Institute of Health, has promoted a national online survey in order to evaluate the impact of lockdown measures on the mental health of the Italian general population. The COMET survey reports data from a large sample of more than 20.000 people from Italian general population, showing that lockdown has had a detrimental impact on mental health, in terms of worsening of anxiety, depressive and stress symptoms.

Methods Systematic review on PubMed and Uptodate databases since declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 was performed using the keywords: Distance Education, Pandemia, COVID-19, Medical Residency. Discussing online-learning. Results The described European countries (Germany, Spain, United Kingdom) used different strategies to maintain the e-learning. Practical undergraduate education was replaced in countries like Spain by â€œproblem-based learningâ€ tasks, clarifying and commenting case reports or videos through working groups. The increase of the resources from teachers and trainers wasnÂ´t taken in account for the preparation of the digital program. Social inequities for the digital access for groups of students or clients were also claimed.

"Online psychotherapy in times of COVID-19: professionalâ€™s experience","Introduction The global pandemic of corona virus has brought on the imperative of swift organisational changes within mental health care institutions. Outpatient psychiatric care system with all its complex features was organized online. Patientâ€™s adjustment to different modality of treatment, and their benefit, was of our primary concern. Mental health professionals had many challenges in this process as well. Couple of months into providing this form of treatment, we were interested in therapist experience. Objectives The aim of this study was to highlight challenges faced by the various mental health professionals that were a part of interdisciplinary team at University Psychiatric Hospital Vrapce. Methods We used self-assessment scales to assess mental health professionals experience and to recognize some of the possible difficulties in this process. We have examined satisfaction with available technology, suitability of different psychotherapeutic background when providing online treatment, therapists competencies for this kind of treatment and levels of perceived stress. Mental health treatment comprised individual and group approach, and was provided by interdisciplinary teams of psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, social workers, social pedagogues, psychiatric nurses, and work therapists. Results The results show differences between professionalâ€™s psychotherapy background, educational level and previous experience in perceived efficiency and experienced stress in the process of providing online treatment.

"Psychological impact and coping strategies of medical students during university closure due to COVID-19 in a state university in Sri Lanka â€“ an online survey","Introduction Loss of routine, disengagement from peers and adapting to distant learning during the pandemic may lead to psychological distress in medical students. Psychological impact of the pandemic on medical students has not been assessed in Sri Lanka Objectives To identify the psychological impact and coping strategies of medical students during the pandemic. Methods An online survey was done among 527 medical students in a state Medical Faculty in Sri Lanka. Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) was used to measure psychological impact. Results The main worries among the students was upcoming exams (74.4%, n=389) and taking a longer time than expected to complete their undergraduate medical education (68.1%, n=356). 68.7% (n=362) of the respondents experienced difficulty in working up the initiative to do things and 62.6% (n=330) had tendency to overreact to situations. Depressive symptoms were present in 40.8%, anxiety in 34% and high levels of stress were seen in 24.7%. In 10.8% depression was severe and anxiety was severe in 10.3%. Depression (p&lt;0.01), anxiety (p&lt;0.05) and stress (p&lt;0.01) were significantly higher in students with a past history of psychiatric disorders. Depression, anxiety or stress was not associated with the gender, ethnicity, family income or living circumstances. The main coping strategy of the participants was engaging more with family (73.4%). Conclusions Given the high levels of psychological distress, supportive strategies should be designed to minimize the psychological impact in this vulnerable group.

"COVID-19 and technological addiction: The role of loneliness","Introduction The Covid-19 outbreak has shown to negatively impact on mental health. Several anecdotical and theoretical evidences argued that lockdown measures would have increased subjective feelings of loneliness and addictionsâ€™ proneness. Objectives In addition, preliminary data underlined a possible increase in the frequency of gaming and social media use. Increased loneliness levels are likely to account for increased gaming and social media addiction during the lockdown. Methods We conducted a longitudinal study administering to a sample of 154 Italian adults several self-report questionnaires at the beginning of lockdown (Time 1) and three days before the end of the lockdown (Time 2). We therefore assessed loneliness feelings, frequency of gaming and social media use as well as both gaming and social media addiction. Data were analysed using Structural Equation Modelling. Results We observed that loneliness levels longitudinally predicted both gaming and social media addiction also controlling for gaming and social media use at Time 1. Conclusions Increased feelings of loneliness, a well-known risk factor for gaming and social media addiction, may be a central variable heightening vulnerability to the onset or the maintenance of technological addiction during forced social isolation. Thus, future prevention interventions may want to target this issue.","Rogier, G.; Zobel, S.

"Resilient care in times of covid: The stress buddy","Introduction The COVID-19 outbreak poses a challenge for health care professionals due to a surge in care demands, overwork, fear of contagion and concerns on the availability of protective equipment, and coping with distress of patients and their families. Although there is emerging evidence on prevalence of stress and its predictors, less is known on the trajectory of stress symptoms and the differences between cohorts of health care professionals. Objectives To sustain and restore health care professionals the Leiden University Medical Center has launched the Digital Stress Buddy, a mobile app, to assess psychological stress, depressive symptoms, anxiety and posttraumatic stress symptoms. Methods Participants fill in a 14-item questionnaire on stress and resilience resources, followed by a COVID-related questionnaire and finally a set of validated questionnaires on depression and anxiety (DASS-21), posttraumatic stress-symptoms (IES-R), burn-out (CBI) and resilience (RES). Results To date, 959 health care workers have completed the stress monitor, of whom 223 (23%) showed relevant stress levels. Within this group, anxiety and posttraumatic symptoms were most prevalent (45%), followed by depressive symptoms (15%). Predictors of stress were being female, coping with distress of patients and their families, teleworking, and overwork. Conclusions By identifying vulnerabilities and resilience for psychological distress, we are able to tailor the support interventions for health care workers within our hospital. This is an ongoing study and future follow-up during the second wave of the pandemic will provide more insight on the trajectories of stress-related symptoms.

"The role of research in evaluating and implementing digital mental health : Lecture title","Body The clinical evidence and cost-effectiveness of digitalised prevention and treatment of mental disorders such as depression, anxiety and alcohol misuse have been steadily growing over the last two decades. However, bridging the gap between evidence-based eMental-health interventions and their actual delivery, evaluation and implementation in routine care has proven to be more difficult and a longer process than previously expected thereby reaching the estimated forecast of Rogerâ€™s innovation cycle of 20 years. In contrast, during the appearance of COVID-19 in 2020 for many patients and therapists digitalized treatment was the only option. Meanwhile from a scientific and policy perspective the implementation and upscaling of digital mental health care innovations in routine care have gained momentum in terms of theoretical perspectives on organizational change, empirical research into how to effectively implement digital innovations from the perspective of a variety of stakeholders and organizational levels (micro, macro and meso).

"Internet and psychosocial interventions: What is the evidence?","Body Digital mental health, before, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic Over the last two decades the digital landscape of mental health care research and service innovation has gained momentum. This period is characterized by many successesâ€™ stories but brilliant failures as well. Today, e-mental health is like a two-headed Janus. One side of his face illustrates the birth of innovative technologies that entered mental health service provision. In parallel, the evidence-base for the application of these new technologies, such as internet-based treatments for depression, has been established with effect sizes comparable to those of face-to-face treatments. The other side of his face shows, however, that eMental-health has not yet lived up to itsâ€™ full potential as its actual delivery, evaluation and implementation in routine care has proven to be a much longer and bumpier road than expected. The question addressed in this presentation will be â€˜what does the future holdâ€™? Acknowledging that futures are difficult to predict Heleen Riper nevertheless provides insights into how we may overcome some of these bumps by combining the best of two worlds, i.e. blending digital and face-to-face components into one integrated treatment approach.

"Digital psychiatry and COVID-19: a potential recruitment opportunity","Psychiatry has long been battling with a recruitment crisis in the UK which is also reflected across much of Europe. Covid-19 has brought about widespread changes to our ways of working, as well as driving technological developments, which provides potential opportunities for the profession to draw people into the speciality. Covid-19 has brought interest in digital psychiatry from the peripheries to the mainstream. Mental health professionals are currently using sophisticated technologies such as Virtual Reality, Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing in the diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders. Highlighting the ways in which our profession is at the cutting edge of innovation to junior doctors offers a fruitful avenue to improve recruitment into the speciality. Many outpatient clinics have made the move to online service delivery during the pandemic to varying degrees. For many clinicians this has allowed more flexible and efficient ways of working. Psychiatry is better placed than most other medical disciplines to retain online patient contact in future clinical practice, post pandemic and may provide an attractive proposition for future psychiatrists. This talk will review some of the ways in which developments in digital psychiatry have been used to help generate interest for recruitment into the discipline as well as evaluating the benefits and challenges of the shift to telepsychiatry during Covid-19 and will offer some suggestions what the profession can learn from this to help future recruitment.

"Internet addiction in times of COVID-19: Review of the situation","Introduction Covid-19 pandemic represents a sanitary crisis with social, economic and political negative impacts. Studies had well established the link between stress and the display or maintenance of addictive behaviour. Measures like social distancing and confinement imposed by governments during this pandemic, could explain an outbreak of internet addiction cases. Objectives Assess the prevalence of internet addiction in times of the covid-19 pandemic and to study its relationship with personal and family factors but also with the psychiatric comorbidities. Methods We conducted a cross sectional analytical study during the period of the covid-19 pandemic, using an internet survey exploring socio-demographic and clinical data: through Hamilton depression and anxiety rating scale and the Rosenberg self esteem scale. The assessment of internet addiction was carried out using Youngâ€™s Internet Addiction test. Results Our study included 150 users, the average age was 36 years, mainly made up of women, married, having children, with a good socioeconomic level and of university education. The prevalence of depressive and anxious symptoms were respectively 7.3% and 18.7%. The prevalence of internet addiction in our study was 9.4% including 0.7% having severe repercussions. Being married (p&lt;10-3) and having children (p=0.006) were considered as protective factors against internet addiction. People having an internet addiction were at bigger risk of having low self esteem (p=0.023), depressive (p=0.04) and anxious symptoms (p&lt;10-3).

"Perceived stress during the COVID-19 pandemic among the tunisian population","Introduction Documenting Tunisianâ€™ stress responses to an unprecedented pandemic is essential for mental health interventions and policy-making. Objectives To describe the perceived stress generated by the Covid-19 epidemic and confinement among the Tunisian people. Methods Participants had to fill out a questionnaire including epidemiological data and the Perceived Stress Scale 10 (PSS10), which is the most widely used psychological instrument for measuring the stress perception. Individual scores can range from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicating higher perceived stress. Results Our study included 121 subjects, of which 70.6% were women.They had an average age of 36.52 years and a history of psychiatric disorders in 13.1% of cases, such as anxiety disorders (10.4%), depressive disorders (5.9%) and obsessive compulsive disorders (2.3%). More than one in two participants (61.4%) reported the presence of sleep disorders. Regarding medical history, participants declared having asthma (5%), diabetes (1.8%), high blood pressure (3.6%), and a chronic disease with corticosteroid treatment (5%).

"The impact of COVID-19 on clinical practice and well-being of global mental health professionals","Some of the most direct and brutal effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are experienced by health care professionals who are working in demanding environments while having to deal with their own fears of infection and mortality. To assess the impact of COVID-19 on the practice and well-being of global mental health professionals, we designed a three-part, longitudinal, internet-based study. Here we present data from part 1, implemented in June-July 2020 in six languages to members of WHOâ€™s Global Clinical Practice Network composed of 15,500 mental health practitioners. The study assessed COVID-19â€™s impact on: work circumstances;occupational well-being;use and transition to telehealth;and expectations, needs and recommendations. 2,505 mental health professionals from 126 countries responded to the study (47% psychiatrists). 93.7% of respondents were currently practicing and 70.9% continued to see patients in person. The impact on clinical workload varied in terms of direction and extent depending on type of service provided and country of practice. Most participants had started or increased their use of telehealth services, and we identified a need for training to support telehealth use. Overall, clinicians scored high on well-being indices. However, a subset scored above the cutoff for low well-being and reported a significant number of post-traumatic symptoms. Five factors affected work-related stress: fear of infection, severe COVID-related events, life disruption, lack of adequate protection and role disruption.

"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on suicides in portugal during the emergency state","Introduction The mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is well documented. Portugal entered the emergency state on 19thÂ march due to rising numbers of infected patients. The emergency state introduced regulatory measures that restricted peopleâ€™s movements, applied a curfew, and closed most non-essential spaces and activities, such as shops and religious celebrations. Objectives To evaluate the rates of suicides during the emergency state in Portugal. Methods We obtained the number of probable suicides during 19thÂ march and 2ndÂ may 2020, 2019 and 2018 from SICO/eVM (Real Time Mortality Electronic Surveillance). This system is used for health planning in Portugal and provides provisory data which is updated every 10 minutes. ExcelÃ’ was used for the statistical analysis. Results During the Emergency State in Portugal there were 57 probable suicides. Comparing to the same period in 2018 and 2019, there were 62 and 70 probable suicides, respectively. Social isolation, anxiety, fear of contagion, chronic stress, and economic difficulties may lead to the development or exacerbation of depressive, anxiety, substance use, and other psychiatric disorders. Literature on suicides due to COVID-19 mention not only fear of infection, but also social isolation and distancing and economic recession as causes for suicide attempts and completions. Conclusions During the emergency state there was not an increase of probable suicides, compared to previous years. The greater vigilance of peopleâ€™s movements may have deterred many attempts. However, policymakers and health care providers must be alert as the current psychosocial predispose to an increase in suicide rates. Disclosure No significant relationships.","Ramos, S.

"Psychosocial rehabilitation for severe mental illness: A community project adjustable to the needs and resources of the population","Introduction Psychosocial rehabilitation is a challenge in a society with demands unsuitable for those with severe mental illness (SMI). The Mental Health Department of Matosinhos Local Health Unity (MHD-MLHU) has developed a solidarity project aiming to evaluate and elaborate individualized rehabilitative responses with people with SMI, including people from the community motivated for solidarity initiatives. Objectives To describe a psychosocial rehabilitation project focused on community integration of people with SMI, considering needs and resources of the population, and to present the individualized rehabilitation plans carried out for people with SMI. Methods In January 2019, we began the home evaluation of people with SMI monitored in the MHD-MLHU. To develop solidary based play-occupational groups, we interviewed people from the community and from the common mental pathology outpatient clinic willing to participate. Results We present the description and evaluation of the psychosocial responses developed by the project. These responses include recreational-occupational groups, tailored to interests of each person with SMI, and using the community support group built for the purpose. These responses promote face-to-face activities, and enhance the destigmatization of SMI. The constraints resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic led to the creation of digital responses aimed at people with SMI and the community in general.

"Acceptance and commitment therapy for chronic pain: A systematic review","Introduction Chronic pain is common, costly, and associated with significant disability and negative effects on well-being and mental health. The treatment is challenging, requiring a multidisciplinary approach. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) aims to help patients in engaging in a flexible and persistent pattern of values-directed behavior while in contact with continuing pain and discomfort. Objectives To provide an updated review on the efficacy of ACT for the management of chronic pain. Methods We conducted a systematic review based on the PubMedÂ® and EBSCO databases up to April 2020. Results Fifteen trials were included. The results were in favour of ACT in pain acceptance, functioning and pain intensity with small to large effect sizes. Few studies evaluated quality of life, but half of those were favourable to ACT. We also focused our analysis on ACT online interventions, considering the current demands due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions The current systematic review points in favour of ACT for the management of chronic pain conditions, though the studies included suffered from methodological limitations, which may have led to overestimated effects. Methodologically robust trials are required to further understand the clinical efficacy of ACT for chronic pain and which patients most benefit from this intervention.","Ramos, S.

"Occurrence of Z-drugs, benzodiazepines, and ketamine in wastewater in the United States and Mexico during the Covid-19 pandemic","Z-drugs, benzodiazepines and ketamine are classes of psychotropic drugs prescribed for treating anxiety, sleep disorders and depression with known side effects including an elevated risk of addiction and substance misuse. Both groups of these drugs have a strong potential for misuse, which has escalated over the years and was hypothesized here to have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) constitutes a fast, easy, and relatively inexpensive approach to epidemiological surveys for understanding the incidence and frequency of uses of these drugs. In this study, we analyzed wastewater (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯376) from 50 cities across the United States and Mexico from July to October 2020 to estimate drug use rates during a pandemic event. Both time and flow proportional composite and grab samples of untreated municipal wastewater were analyzed using solid-phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to determine loadings of alprazolam, clonazepam, diazepam, ketamine, lorazepam, nordiazepam, temazepam, zolpidem, and zaleplon in raw wastewater. Simultaneously, prescription data of the aforementioned drugs were extracted from the Medicaid database from 2019 to 2021. Results showed high detection frequencies of ketamine (90Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%), lorazepam (87Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%), clonazepam (76Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%) and temazepam (73Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%) across both Mexico and United States and comparatively lower detection frequencies for zaleplon (22Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%), zolpidem (9Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%), nordiazepam (&lt;1Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%), diazepam (&lt;1Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%), and alprazolam (&lt;1Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%) during the pandemic. Average mass consumption rates, estimated using WBE and reported in units of mg/day/1000 persons, ranged between 62 (temazepam) and 1100 (clonazepam) in the United States. Results obtained from the Medicaid database also showed a significant change (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.05) in the prescription volume between the first quarter of 2019 (before the pandemic) and the first quarter of 2021 (pandemic event) for alprazolam, clonazepam and lorazepam.

"Loneliness and psychosocial predictors of psychosis-proneness during COVID-19: Preliminary findings from Croatia","The present study investigated psychosocial predictors of psychosis-risk, depression, anxiety, and stress in Croatia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given Croatia's recent transgenerational war trauma and the relative lack of available prodromal data, this study presents a unique opportunity to examine the impact of loneliness and other psychosocial factors on psychosis-risk and mental health in this population. 404 Croatian participants completed an anonymous online survey of physical and mental health questions. 48 participants met the criteria for elevated psychosis-risk on prodromal questionnaire (PQ-16). Loneliness had a significant impact on psychosis-risk.Ã‚Â Exposure to trauma was associated with psychosis-risk and loneliness, while domestic abuse/violence was associated only with the distress surrounding psychotic-like symptoms. COVID concern was also associated with psychosis-risk. Lastly, the associations between psychosis-risk and depression, anxiety, and stress were robust. These findings highlight the important role of loneliness in psychosis-proneness in Croatia. Depression, anxiety, and stress were also closely related to elevated psychosis-risk. Loneliness is a highly salient issue for individuals with psychosis and it is important to target loneliness within a multi-faceted psychosocial intervention for those at risk for schizophrenia.","Gizdic, Baxter, Barrantes-Vidal, Park","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114900","20221015","COVID-19; Croatia; Loneliness; Mental health; Psychosis; Trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39295,""
"The Psychological Impact of Isolation on Hospitalised Patients with COVID-19 Infection in the UAE","Infection prevention and control measures for COVID-19 may include immediate admission to an isolation facility for the infected. However, the mental health impact of this isolation worldwide is not fully documented. This study aims to contribute to global data on the psychological impact of COVID-19 and to be the first study to assess psychological distress among hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in the UAE. Using a cross-sectional study design on 132 hospitalised patients, we found that 90% of participants scored within the normal levels for psychological distress. The length of stay was associated with higher levels of psychological distress and those aged 41-60Ã‚Â years had lower levels of psychological distress compared to the 31-40Ã‚Â years group.

"Face memory and facial expression recognition are both affected by wearing disposable surgical face masks","Faces are fundamental stimuli for social interactions since they provide significant information about people's identity and emotional states. With the outburst of the COVID-19 pandemic, global use of preventive measures, such as disposable surgical face masks (DSFMs), has been imposed. The massive use of DSFMs covering a large part of the face could interfere with identity and emotion recognition. Thus, the main aim of the current study was (i) to assess how DSFMs affect identity recognition (Experiment 1), (ii) how DSFMs affect emotion recognition (Experiment 2), and (iii) whether individual empathy levels correlate with emotion recognition with DSFMs. The potential relation between identity and emotion recognition with and without DSFMs was also investigated. Two tasks were administered to 101 healthy participants: (i) the Old-new face memory task aimed to assess whether the learning context (i.e., DSFMs on/off) affects recognition performance, whereas (ii) the Facial affect task explored DSFMs' effect on emotion recognition. Results from the former showed that the stimuli's features in the learning stage affect recognition performances; that is, faces wearing DSFMs were better recognized if wearing DSFMs at first exposure and vice versa. Results from the Facial affect task showed that DSFMs lead to reduced disgust, happiness, and sadness recognition. No significant correlation emerged between identity and emotion recognition. The Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) was administered to assess affective and cognitive empathy; however, IRI scores did not correlate with either face memory recognition or facial affect recognition. Overall, our results demonstrate (a) a ""context effect"" for face memory with and without DSFMs; (b) a disruptive effect of DSFMs depending on the expressed emotion; and (c) no correlation between empathy and emotion recognition with DSFMs.","Ventura, Palmisano, Innamorato, Tedesco, Manippa, CaffÃƒÂ², Rivolta","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10339-022-01112-2","20221015","Disposable surgical face masks (DSFMs); Emotion recognition; Face masks; Face memory; Face perception","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39297,""

"Clozapine Therapy and COVID-19: A Systematic Review of the Prevalence Rates, Health Outcomes, Hematological Markers, and Patient Perspectives","There have been concerns that clozapine treatment may undermine the capacity of the body to fight infection and increase the vulnerability to contracting COVID-19. This review of recent cohort studies investigated (1) whether people with a severe psychiatric disorder are at increased risk of COVID-19 and complications, (2) the immunological response of clozapine-users who contract COVID-19, and (3) patients' perspectives on COVID-19 and the pandemic response. A systematic search of EMBASE, Medline, Pubmed, and PsycINFO databases using PRISMA guidelines using ""COVID-19"", ""clozapine"", and ""vaccination"" terms. 18 studies (out of 330 identified) met all criteria (N = 119 054 including 8045 on clozapine). There was no strong evidence that clozapine users may be at increased risk of contracting COVID-19 or developing complications after adjusting for medical comorbidities. Hematological studies showed temporary reductions in neutrophils in COVID-19-positive patients and vaccination suggesting a clozapine effect in defence against infection. Vaccination studies did not report major adverse effects. Increased plasma levels of clozapine and neutropenia however point to COVID-19-related interference of clozapine metabolism. Patient surveys reported limited impact on mental health and positive attitudes regarding pandemic response. This review did not find compelling evidence that the immune system of clozapine users put them at risk of COVID-19 and further complications. Evidence of drug-infection interactions however points to the importance of adhering to consensus guidelines about clozapine therapy during the pandemic. More evidence using longitudinal designs is required to examine the longer-term effects of COVID-19 and vaccination in this vulnerable population.","Giles, Varghese, Shymko, Nguyen, Waters","https://doi.org/10.1093/schbul/sbac148","20221015","COVID-19; clozapine; coronavirus; schizophrenia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39299,""
"Health and development-related priorities and challenges of adolescents and young people: findings from South Africa and Kenya prior to and during COVID-19 pandemic","Growing evidence documents the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescents in East and Southern Africa. We present and explore the longitudinal health and development-related priorities and challenges of adolescent advisors in South Africa and Kenya, including prior to, and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings were co-generated with adolescent advisors in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa (n=15, ages 18-22 in 2019) and Kisumu, Kenya (n=16, ages 10-14 in 2020). Prior to COVID-19, adolescent advisors engaged in a participatory exercise to share and explore their health and development-related priorities and challenges in 2019 and 2020. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, members of the same groups shared their experiences, challenges and coping strategies in semi-structured telephone interviews (Eastern Cape: n=14, aged 19-23; Kisumu n=12, aged 11-16) and group-based remote participatory social media activities (n=27 activities with n=12 advisors, Eastern Cape). We thematically analysed COVID-19 activities, considering them alongside pre-pandemic priorities and challenges. Many of the health and development-related priorities and challenges identified prior to COVID-19 remained issues of concern during COVID-19. These included education; victimization and violence; teenage pregnancy; substance use; household tension, conflict and inadequate family and caregiver support; health and medication concerns (South Africa) and water and food shortages (Kenya). Other issues such as financial insecurity, mental health, and crime were strong themes that emerged during COVID-19, which were not directly reported as priorities prior. Although almost all of adolescent advisors' most pressing pandemic-related challenges were also priorities for them prior to COVID-19, these issues were often discussed as new, and caused by the onset of COVID-19. While demonstrating how COVID-19 has exacerbated pre-existing vulnerabilities, we also suggest that the pandemic may have brought about a new way for adolescents to make sense of, and articulate pre-existing challenges.","Gittings, Price, Kelly, Kannemeyer, Thomas, Medley, Ralayo, Omollo, Cluver, Logie, Evalia, Toska","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2022.2108084","20221015","Adolescence; COVID-19; Kenya; South Africa; health &amp; development","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39300,""
"Kangyi Qiangshen Gong exercise prescription for pulmonary function and quality of life in patients recovered from COVID-19: a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial","Since early 2022, patients with 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection have increased rapidly in Shanghai, China. Nevertheless, there is no widely used unified rehabilitation treatment available for discharged patients with post-infection sequelae such as dyspnea, depression, and fatigue. To promote the rehabilitation of discharged patients, our team formulated Kangyi Qiangshen Gong exercise prescription on the basis of traditional Chinese medicine rehabilitation exercises (TCMRE). We designed a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of rehabilitation and advantages of KQG for discharged patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome. This is a parallel-design, two-arm, analyst assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial. In total, 60 discharged patients with COVID-19 sequelae, aged from 20 to 80Ã‚Â years will be recruited and randomly assigned to the World Health Organization instructed breathing techniques (BT) group and the Kangyi Qiangshen Gong exercise prescription (KQG) group at a ratio of 1:1. The patients in the BT group will perform breathing techniques exercise, and the patients in the KQG group will perform KQG exercise. Both groups will perform exercises twice a day for 3Ã‚Â months. The primary outcome will be measured with the Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale, and the secondary outcomes will include the Modified Borg Scale, Fatigue Scale-14, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and the Respiratory Symptoms Scale. Clinical scales will be assessed at three points (pre-exercise, 3Ã‚Â months post-exercise, and 3Ã‚Â months follow-up). Adverse events will be recorded for safety assessment.

Despite the fact that a number of essential building blocks of recovery in this population have been identified (e.g. social relationships, treatment, personal beliefs), the actual process of recovery in persons with complex mental health needs largely remains a black box. The aim of this study was to gain insight into how the recovery processes of persons with complex mental health needs take place, by applying a relational geographical approach and scrutinizing the place-making dynamics of one low-threshold meeting place in Belgium engaging with this group. Data collection took place during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic by means of 11 in-depth interviews with different involved actors (service users, staff members, volunteers) and analyzed thematically. Results showed how the daily practice of the meeting place is continuously reproduced through place-making rituals that create an inclusive space of hospitality, are fueled by creative processes and form an indispensable counterweight for service users' mental health needs. To further open up the 'black box' of recovery in persons with complex mental health needs, it is vital to focus our analytic gaze onto recovery as a dynamic and relational practice.","De Ruysscher, Vandevelde, Vanheule, Bryssinck, Haeck, Vanderplasschen","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13033-022-00560-9","20221014","Complex mental health needs; Place-making dynamics; Recovery; Rituals","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39302,""
"Attitude changes following short-form opioid overdose video education: a pilot study","Opioid overdose response training (OORT) and the need for its rapid expansion have become more significant as the opioid epidemic continues to be a health crisis in the USA. Limitation of funding and stigmatization often hinders expansion of OORT programs. Primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been widespread transition from in-person to virtual communication. However, OORT programs may benefit from long-term use of this modality of education if it can be as effective. To measure the change in participant attitude after a brief, virtual OORT. A 6.5-min OORT video explained recognition of opioid overdose, appropriate response and proper administration of intranasal naloxone. Pre- and post-video scores from a 19-item survey were used to determine the video's impact on participants' self-perceived competence and readiness to administer naloxone to a person with a suspected opioid overdose. Paired t tests were used in the analysis of pre- and post-video scores. Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis H testing were used to compare variance between several demographic subgroups of interest. A sample of 219 participants had a significant mean difference of 15.12 (SD 9.48; 95% CI 13.86-16.39, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) between pre- and posttest scores. Improvements were found to be greatest in content-naÃƒÂ¯ve participants with lower levels of education and non-health care-related jobs than participants endorsing previous content awareness, formal naloxone training, masters, doctorate or professional degrees and health care-related jobs. This pilot study demonstrated encouraging evidence that a brief, virtual, pre-recorded educational intervention improved participant-rated competence and readiness to administer intranasal naloxone in a suspected opioid overdose. Due to scalability and ability to overcome common healthcare accessibility barriers, short-form videos focused on key facts about naloxone and the benefits of its use could be part of a strategy for rapid expansion of OORT programs to mitigate opioid overdose fatalities.","Galiher, Huffman","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-022-00696-4","20221014","Accessibility; Naloxone training; Opioid; Overdose; Prevention; Video education","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39303,""

"Unwanted Sexual Activity among US Women early in the COVID-19 Pandemic","Female sexual activity and, accordingly, birth rates, tend to decline in times of stress, such as a pandemic. Additionally, when resources are scarce or exogenous conditions are threatening, some women may engage in sexual activity primarily to maintain socioeconomic security. Having unwanted sex may indicate sexual activity in exchange for economic security. To describe patterns and correlates of unwanted sex, defined as having sex more frequently than desired, among U.S. women early in the COVID-19 pandemic. The National U.S. Women's Health COVID-19 Study was conducted in April 2020, using a nested quota sample design to enroll 3,200 English-speaking women (88% cooperation rate) ages 18-90 years recruited from a research panel. The quota strata ensured sufficient sample sizes in sociodemographic groups of interest, namely racial and ethnic sub-groups. Patterns of sexual activity, including unwanted sex early in the pandemic, were described. To further elucidate the experiences of women reporting unwanted sex, open-ended responses to an item querying ""how the coronavirus pandemic is affecting your sex life"" were assessed using conventional content analysis. Logistic regression analyses - adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, self-reported health and pre-pandemic health-related socioeconomic risk factors (HRSRs), including food insecurity, housing instability, utilities and transportation difficulties and interpersonal violence - were used to model the odds of unwanted sex by pandemic-related change in HRSRs. The proportion of women who were sexually active early in the pandemic (51%) was about the same as in the 12 months pre-pandemic (52%), although 7% became active and 7% became inactive. Eleven percent of sexually active women were having unwanted sex in the early pandemic. Rates of anxiety, depression, traumatic stress symptoms and each of the five HRSRs assessed were about 2 times higher among women having unwanted sex compared to others (p-values &lt;0.001). Women having unwanted sex were also 5 times more likely than others to report increased frequency of sex since the pandemic (65% vs 13%, p&lt;0.001) and 6 times more likely to be using emergency contraception (18% vs 3%, p&lt;0.001). Women reporting unwanted sex commonly described decreased libido or interest in sex related to mood changes since the pandemic, having ""more sex,"" fear or worry about transmission of the virus due to sex, and having sex to meet the partner's needs. Among sexually active women, odds of unwanted sex (adjusting for demographic, reproductive and health factors) were higher among women with one (aOR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1, 3.8) and two or more pre-pandemic HRSRs (aOR 6.0, 95% CI 3.4, 10.6). Among sexually active women with any pre-pandemic HRSRs, those with new or worsening transportation difficulties early in the pandemic were particularly vulnerable to unwanted sex (aOR 2.7, 95% CI 1.7, 4.3). More than one in ten sexually active U.S. women was having unwanted sex early in the COVID-19 pandemic. Socioeconomically vulnerable women, especially those with new or worsening transportation problems due to the pandemic, were more likely than others to engage in unwanted sex. Pandemic response and recovery efforts should seek to mitigate unwanted sexual activity and related health and social risks among women.","Lindau, Jagai, Abramsohn, Fuller, Wroblewski, Pinkerton, Makelarski","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2022.09.048","20221014","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39305,""

A key contribution of the present study is to provide a deeper subsector level of analysis lacking in existing literature. An event study approach is applied in identifying abnormal returns due to the November 9th vaccine announcement. Several event periods (-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0-1, 0-3) are analysed to provide a more complete picture of the effects. Based on analysis, it is established that there are considerable inter and intra sectoral variations in the impact of the vaccine news. The results show that the impact follows a clear pattern. The sectors that were hit hardest by the pandemic such as energy, financials, as well as subsectors like hotels and casinos, benefited the most from positive vaccine news. Subsectors that gained from the pandemic such as airfreight, household appliances and computers and electronics retail were depressed the most by the news. These findings suggest that while the availability of vaccines is expected to help steer economies gradually to normalcy, the re-adjustment is likely to be asymmetric across subsectors. While some subsectors expect to expand as these industries recover from the contraction inflicted by the COVID-19 environment, other subsectors expect adjustment losses as these industries shed off the above average gains driven by the COVID-19 environment.","Kapar, Buigut, Rana","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0275773","20221014","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39306,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on community-dwelling older adults: A longitudinal qualitative study of participants from the Hertfordshire Cohort Study","Older adults have been especially vulnerable to adverse effects from the COVID-19 pandemic including higher mortality and more severe disease complications. At the same time, social isolation, malnutrition and physical inactivity are serious concerns among older adults. The pandemic and associated restrictions may serve to exacerbate these issues, presenting increased risks to physical and mental health. The aims of this qualitative study were: i) to explore how community-living older people in the UK experienced the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically how it impacted their well-being and associated health behaviours; ii) to explore how older people's experiences and behaviours changed over time throughout the first wave. Qualitative data were collected by conducting serial telephone interviews, with an interval of approximately three months. Participants were from the Hertfordshire Cohort Study, all aged over 80 years. Discussions were audio-recorded, information related to the COVID-19 pandemic was transcribed verbatim and transcripts analysed thematically. Interviews were conducted from March to October 2020. Data for twelve participants (7 men and 5 women) from a total of 35 interviews were used, comprising two or three timepoints per participant. Analysis identified five overarching themes: 1) shopping strategies and food accessibility, 2) limitations on activities and going out, 3) disruption to healthcare, 4) social and psychological repercussions, and 5) coping strategies. Findings highlight challenges associated with accessing shops, healthcare, and usual activities due to pandemic-related restrictions. Longitudinal findings showed that for some, the ongoing pandemic and related restrictions appeared to aggravate mental health issues (low mood, anxiety) over time, as well as greater feelings of isolation or loneliness, reduced activity and functional limitations; this was despite some relaxation of restrictions later on. Coping strategies used by participants included finding ways to keep busy and to do physical activity safely, maintaining social contact remotely, and having an optimistic or positive outlook, a 'do what you can' attitude. Interventions are likely to be needed in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic to support health behaviours, such as increasing physical activity, social engagement and improving mental health among community-living older adults.","Bloom, Zhang, Hammond, Bevilacqua, Lawrence, Ward, Cooper, Dennison","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0275486","20221014","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39307,""
"Prevalence, causes, and consequences of moral distress in healthcare providers caring for people living with dementia in long-term care during a pandemic","Healthcare providers caring for people living with dementia may experience moral distress when faced with ethically challenging situations, such as the inability to provide care that is consistent with their values. The COVID-19 pandemic produced conditions in long-term care homes (hereafter referred to as 'care homes') that could potentially contribute to moral distress. We conducted an online survey to examine changes in moral distress during the pandemic, its contributing factors and correlates, and its impact on the well-being of care home staff. Survey participants (n = 227) working in care homes across Ontario, Canada were recruited through provincial care home organizations. Using a Bayesian approach, we examined the association between moral distress and staff demographics and roles, and characteristics of the long-term care home. We performed a qualitative analysis of the survey's free-text responses. More than 80% of care home healthcare providers working with people with dementia reported an increase in moral distress since the start of the pandemic. There was no difference in the severity of distress by age, sex, role, or years of experience. The most common factors associated with moral distress were lack of activities and family visits, insufficient staffing and high turnover, and having to follow policies and procedures that were perceived to harm residents with dementia. At least two-thirds of respondents reported feelings of physical exhaustion, sadness/anxiety, frustration, powerlessness, and guilt due to the moral distress experienced during the pandemic. Respondents working in not-for-profit or municipal homes reported less sadness/anxiety and feelings of not wanting to go to work than those in for-profit homes. Front-line staff were more likely to report not wanting to work than those in management or administrative positions. Overall, we found that increases in moral distress during the pandemic negatively affected the well-being of healthcare providers in care homes, with preliminary evidence suggesting that individual and systemic factors may intensify the negative effect.","Haslam-Larmer, Grigorovich, Quirt, Engel, Stewart, Rodrigues, Kontos, Astell, McMurray, Levy, Bingham, Flint, Maxwell, Iaboni","https://doi.org/10.1177/14713012221124995","20221014","COVID-19 pandemic; dementia; long-term care; mixed methods; moral distress; older adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39308,""
"The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on infant development and maternal mental health in the first 2Ã‚Â years of life","We investigated how exogenous variation in exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic during the first year of life is related to infant development, maternal mental health, and perceived stress. Ninety-three socioeconomically diverse pregnant women were recruited before the pandemic to participate in a longitudinal study. Infants ranged in age at the beginning of lockdown (0-9.5Ã‚Â months old), thus experiencing different durations of pandemic exposure across the first year of life. The duration of pandemic exposure was not associated with family demographic characteristics, suggesting it captured exogenous variability. We tested associations between this exogenous variation in pandemic exposure and child and family outcomes. We also examined whether mother-reported disruptive life events were correlated with child and family outcomes. We found no association between duration of pandemic exposure in the first year of life and infant socioemotional problems, infant language development, or maternal mental health and perceived stress symptoms, at 12 or 24Ã‚Â months. However, we found that self-reported exposure to pandemic-related disruptive life events predicted greater maternal depression, anxiety, and perceived stress at 12Ã‚Â months, and greater depression and anxiety at 24Ã‚Â months. Socioeconomic status did not moderate these associations. These findings suggest cautious optimism for infants raised during this period.","Sperber, Hart, Troller-Renfree, Watts, Noble","https://doi.org/10.1111/infa.12511","20221014","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39309,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on eating disorders in US military veterans","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on mental health around the world. Although there have been reports that the incidence of eating disorders (EDs) has increased during the pandemic, few longitudinal studies have examined recent changes in EDs. Men and women with military histories may be particularly vulnerable to EDs, underscoring the importance of investigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on EDs in this population. We examined whether early-pandemic (Time 1; T1) posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms were associated with change in probable ED diagnostic status 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°year later (T2). We also investigated relationships from early pandemic mental health symptoms to change in ED diagnostic status from T1 to T2 via pandemic-related life circumstance pathways (health, financial, social, etc.). Participants included a population-based sample of 372 U.S. veterans who completed the T1 and T2 surveys. Early pandemic mental health was significantly and positively associated with probable ED diagnostic status. Social and health satisfaction as well as physical health pandemic impacts mediated the associations between mental health symptoms and ED diagnostic status. Findings highlight the importance of bolstering social connection, health-promoting behaviors, and access to ED treatment among veteran men and women impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

"COVID-19 infection: Positive mental health, psychological vulnerability and sex: Cross-sectional study","Since mid-March 2020, a state of emergency was decreed in Portugal due to the COVID-19 pandemic and, consequently, measures were implemented to protect public health, such as social isolation, which will certainly have a notable impact on the mental health of the population, especially in the most vulnerable groups. Positive Mental Health (PMH) is essential to deal with adversity, in this case with the pandemic, and to live better and with greater satisfaction. We consider it relevant to investigate how PMH was used as a resource to deal with the pandemic, depending on the level of vulnerability and sex. A, cross-sectional study was carried out whose the aim was to evaluate the levels of PMH and psychological vulnerability in people with COVOD-19 infection and analyze the association between PMH and psychological vulnerability among men and women. The instruments used were a sociodemographic characterization questionnaire, the Positive Mental Health Questionnaire, and the Psychological Vulnerability Scale (PVS), that were sent and filled out online. A quantitative, cross-sectional, descriptive, and correlational study was carried out. After analyzing the results, it was found that approximately 50.4% of the respondents (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 387) had global PMH values that place them in quartile 50. There was also a statistically significant difference between female and male PMH, with women showing greater psychological vulnerability and lower overall PMH. We conclude that the women present a greater psychological vulnerability and a lower level of PMH when compared to men. Considering the study's statistically significant results, when we talk about mental health, we should always consider the sex variable as a vulnerability factor, in a pandemic or non-pandemic phase.","Almeida, Novo, Lluch Canut, FerrÃƒÂ©-Grau, Sequeira","https://doi.org/10.1111/jnu.12826","20221014","pandemic; positive mental health; psychological vulnerability; sex","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39311,""
"COVID-19 and psychiatric disorders: The impact of face masks in emotion recognition face masks and emotion recognition in psychiatry","Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, reading facial expressions has become more complex due to face masks covering the lower part of people's faces. A history of psychiatric illness has been associated with higher rates of complications, hospitalization, and mortality due to COVID-19. Psychiatric patients have well-documented difficulties reading emotions from facial expressions; accordingly, this study assesses how using face masks, such as those worn for preventing COVID-19 transmission, impacts the emotion recognition skills of patients with psychiatric disorders. To this end, the current study asked patients with bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, and healthy individuals to identify facial emotions on face images with and without facial masks. Results demonstrate that the emotion recognition skills of all participants were negatively influenced by face masks. Moreover, the main insight of the study is that the impairment is crucially significant when patients with major depressive disorder and schizophrenia had to identify happiness at a low-intensity level. These findings have important implications for satisfactory social relationships and well-being. If emotions with positive valence are hardly understood by specific psychiatric patients, there is an even greater requirement for doctor-patient interactions in public primary care.","Escelsior, Amadeo, Esposito, Rosina, Trabucco, Inuggi, Pereira da Silva, Serafini, Gori, Amore","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.932791","20221015","COVID-19; emotion recognition; face masks; happiness; psychiatric disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39312,""
"An alternative mechanism for skeletal muscle dysfunction in long-term post-viral lung disease","Chronic lung disease is often accompanied by disabling extrapulmonary symptoms, notably skeletal muscle dysfunction and atrophy. Moreover, the severity of respiratory symptoms correlates with decreased muscle mass and in turn lowered physical activity and survival rates. Previous models of muscle atrophy in chronic lung disease often modeled COPD and relied on cigarette smoke exposure and LPS-stimulation, but these conditions independently affect skeletal muscle even without accompanying lung disease. Moreover, there is an emerging and pressing need to understand the extrapulmonary manifestations of long-term post-viral lung disease (PVLD) as found in Covid-19. Here, we examine the development of skeletal muscle dysfunction in the setting of chronic pulmonary disease using a mouse model of PVLD caused by infection due to the natural pathogen Sendai virus. We identify a significant decrease in myofiber size when PVLD is maximal at 49 d after infection. We find no change in the relative types of myofibers, but the greatest decrease in fiber size is localized to fast-twitch type IIB myofibers based on myosin heavy chain immunostaining. Remarkably, all biomarkers of myocyte protein synthesis and degradation (total RNA, ribosomal abundance, and ubiquitin-proteasome expression) were stable throughout the acute infectious illness and chronic post-viral disease process. Together, the results demonstrate a distinct pattern of skeletal muscle dysfunction in a mouse model of long-term PVLD. The findings thereby provide new insight into prolonged limitations in exercise capacity in patients with chronic lung disease after viral infections and perhaps other types of lung injury.","Martin, Keeler, Wu, Shearon, Patel, Hoang, Hoffmann, Hughes, Holtzman","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.10.07.511313","20221014","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39313,""
"Mental health impact of COVID-19 on Saudi families and children with special educational needs and disabilities in Saudi Arabia: A national perspective","The COVID-19 pandemic revealed a multidimensional impact on mental health due to health concerns, social distancing and lockdowns, job loss, and limits in institutional support. Accordingly, COVID-19 may disproportionally impact families with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) due to the already high prevalence of mental health conditions in children with SEND and their parents. Hence, it is essential to determine the short-term impact of the pandemic on the mental health of families with SEND to identify their ongoing health, including psychological wellbeing and support needs. The current study examines the anxiety level and concerns of children with SEND and their parents living in Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional national study design was utilized as a part of an international consortium using an online Arabic survey. Data were collected from the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development beneficiaries from May to July 2020. The sample consisted of 1,848 parents of children with SEND aged between 1 and 18 years (mean = 9.66; SD = 4.31). A descriptive and bivariant analysis is reported. Parental worries on all those concerns when the pandemic started were significantly higher than before the pandemic, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.050. Parental-perceived general anxiety had risen significantly across time, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, and their perceived anxiety when the pandemic started exceeded their anxiety before the pandemic, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001. The general anxiety of children with SEND had risen significantly across time (from before the pandemic to when it had started to during the pandemic), <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001. The children's general worries at the start of the pandemic had correlated significantly and positively with their anxiety, adaptive, maladaptive, and coping efficacies, and parental anxiety scores, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.010 each. Anxiety levels were high in SEND and their caregivers before and during COVID-19. At the start of the pandemic, the anxiety, adaptive, maladaptive, coping efficacies, and parental anxiety scores of children with SEND were significantly and favorably correlated. These findings support the notion of SEND-specific anxiety and patterns of coping in SEND and their caregivers. The notion also attests to the institutional support required for this specifically vulnerable population during epidemics.","Alenezi, Temsah, Alyahya, Almadani, Almarshedi, Algazlan, Alnemary, Bashiri, Alkhawashki, Altuwariqi, Alsedrani, Alkhiri, Alarabi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.992658","20221015","COVID-19; Saudi Arabia; children with special educational needs and disabilities; coping behavior; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39314,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health in Childhood and Adolescence: The Reality of a Portuguese School","Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)Ã‚Â outbreak has led to social isolation, with the potential to increase depressive symptoms, even at the pediatric age. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the rateÃ‚Â of depressive symptoms in large youth cohorts was 12.9% worldwide. Aims This study aims to characterize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the pediatric population's mental health. Materials and methods This was an observational, descriptive,Ã‚Â and cross-sectional study conducted through the use of a questionnaire, including the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), between April 5 and May 5, 2021. The study was conducted on children and adolescents aged 7 to 17 years oldÃ‚Â in a school in the geographical area of Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã¢â‚¬â€¹a Portuguese grade II hospital. Incomplete data were excluded. Data were statistically analyzed using the IBM SPSSÃ‚Â® program (version 28; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY), considering statistical significance if p&lt;0.05. Results A total of 228 children and adolescents were included; 113 were female (49.6%). The average age of the population was 12.2 years. Fifteen point four percent (15.4%) had depressive symptoms, of which 51,9% were female. Of the children and adolescents with depressive symptoms, 5.7% had a personal history of past COVID-19 infection and 42.9% had at least one family member with a history of past COVID-19 infection. Seventeen point one percent (17.1%) had at least one family member involved in pandemic-related work. Children and adolescents who were infected with COVID-19 had more depressive symptoms than noninfected children and adolescents (p=0.013). At the same time, children and adolescents, with at least one family member with a history of past COVID-19 infection, had more depressive symptoms thanÃ‚Â children and adolescents without a family history of past COVID-19 infection (p=0.004). Children and adolescents with a family member involved in pandemic-related work had more depressive symptoms than children and adolescents without any family member involved in pandemic-related work (p=0.004).

"Neuropsychiatric phenotype of post COVID-19 syndrome in non-hospitalized patients","The post COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) is an emerging phenomenon worldwide with enormous socioeconomic impact. While many patients describe neuropsychiatric deficits, the symptoms are yet to be assessed and defined systematically. In this prospective cohort study, we report on the results of a neuropsychiatric consultation implemented in May 2021. A cohort of 105 consecutive patients with merely mild acute course of disease was identified by its high symptom load 6 months post infection using a standardized neurocognitive and psychiatric-psychosomatic assessment. In this cohort, we found a strong correlation between higher scores in questionnaires for fatigue (MFI-20), somatization (PHQ15) and depression (PHQ9) and worse functional outcome as measured by the post COVID functional scale (PCFS). In contrast, neurocognitive scales correlated with age, but not with PCFS. Standard laboratory and cardiopulmonary biomarkers did not differ between the group of patients with predominant neuropsychiatric symptoms and a control group of neuropsychiatrically unaffected PCS patients. Our study delineates a phenotype of PCS dominated by symptoms of fatigue, somatisation and depression. The strong association of psychiatric and psychosomatic symptoms with the PCFS warrants a systematic evaluation of psychosocial side effects of the pandemic itself and psychiatric comorbidities on the long-term outcome of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Lier, Stoll, Obrig, Baum, Deterding, Bernsdorff, Hermsdorf, Kunis, BrÃƒÂ¤secke, Herzig, Schroeter, ThÃƒÂ¶ne-Otto, Riedel-Heller, Laufs, Wirtz, Classen, Saur","https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2022.988359","20221015","COVID-19; MFI-20; PCFS; neuropsychiatric disorders; post COVID-19 syndrome","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39316,""

Participants completed online surveys in April-July 2020, at the early stage of the pandemic, and one year later. At one-year follow-up, we added questions addressing retrospective changes in ED symptoms, treatment, and anxiety/depression since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. We present descriptive statistics and assess change in ED symptomatology, treatment, and anxiety/depression among those with an active or lingering ED. Participants (US nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 132; NL nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 219; SE nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 702) were mostly young and female with a history of anorexia nervosa (&gt;60% in all three countries). Across countries, respondents reported impact of COVID-19 on ED symptoms at both time points, with improvement in US and NL at one-year follow-up, and stable but less impact on ED symptoms in SE. Furthermore, at one-year follow-up, roughly half of those in treatment reported reduced treatment access and quality, and the majority of the sample reported increased anxiety and depressive mood since the start of the pandemic.

"Is Primary Bone Marrow Edema of the Knee Associated with Thyroid Disorders? A Retrospective Clinical Study","Primary bone marrow edema (BME) of the knee is still an elusive condition. This retrospective study was undertaken to gain insight into its characteristic features. The records of 48 patients with primary BME of the knee diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging were reviewed. Demographic data, medical history, current medications, pain type, smoking and drinking habits, allergies, occupation, sports practiced, environmental factors, and life events predating symptom onset were examined. Data analysis demonstrated that 56.3% of patients had experienced a stressful event before BME pain onset and that 50% suffered from thyroid disorders. Standard conservative treatment resulted in pain resolution irrespective of the use of anti-inflammatories. However, most patients reported new persistent symptoms: dysesthesia/hypoesthesia on palpation in the skin area overlying the previous edema and a reduced ipsilateral patellar reflex. To our knowledge, this is the first study characterizing a substantial cohort of patients with BME. We found that middle-aged, sedentary, and slightly overweight women smokers are the typical patients with primary BME of the knee. The appearance and persistence of cutaneous dysesthesia/hypoesthesia at the site of the earlier lesion and ipsilateral patellar hyporeflexia implicate an autonomous nervous system dysfunction in BME pathogenesis and warrant further investigation.","De Berardinis, Qordja, Farinelli, Faragalli, Gesuita, Gigante","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11195973","20221014","COVID-19; NSAIDs; anxiety-depressive disorders; bone marrow edema; knee; thyroid disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39318,""

Three research questions (RQs) were investigated. Study 1 (longitudinal sub-sample) explored whether medical students had higher levels of depressive symptoms and stress during the pandemic compared with a pre-pandemic period (RQ1) and what variables were associated with these conditions during the pandemic adjusting for baseline levels (RQ2). Study 2 (repeated cross-sectional data) aimed to examine whether medical students had higher levels of these conditions during the pandemic compared with their same-year peers during a pre-pandemic period (RQ3). In Study 1, higher levels of depressive symptoms and stress were shown during the pandemic (RQ1). Multivariable models highlighted associations between poor mental health and worsening of the judgment of medical school choice, worsened psychological condition due to the pandemic, economic repercussions due to the pandemic, and baseline levels of symptoms (RQ2). In Study 2, our findings reported higher levels of depressive symptoms and stress during the pandemic, also adjusting for other variables (RQ3).

"Prevalence and Risk Factor Analysis of Post-Intensive Care Syndrome in Patients with COVID-19 Requiring Mechanical Ventilation: A Multicenter Prospective Observational Study","Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) is an emerging problem in critically ill patients and the prevalence and risk factors are unclear in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This multicenter prospective observational study aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of PICS in ventilated patients with COVID-19 after ICU discharge. Questionnaires were administered twice in surviving patients with COVID-19 who had required mechanical ventilation, concerning Barthel Index, Short-Memory Questionnaire, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores. The risk factors for PICS were examined using a multivariate logistic regression analysis. The first and second PICS surveys were obtained at 5.5 and 13.5 months (mean) after ICU discharge, with 251 and 209 patients completing the questionnaires and with a prevalence of PICS of 58.6% and 60.8%, respectively, along with the highest percentages of cognitive impairment. Delirium (with an odds ratio of (OR) 2.34, 95% CI 1.1-4.9, and <i>p</i> = 0.03) and the duration of mechanical ventilation (with an OR of 1.29, 95% CI 1.05-1.58, and <i>p</i> = 0.02) were independently identified as the risk factors for PICS in the first PICS survey.

"Influence of Codiagnosis of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Habitual Physical Exercise on the Psychological Status and Quality of Life of Patients with Fibromyalgia","Fibromyalgia (FM) and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) are two diseases that are frequently codiagnosed and present many similarities, such as poor tolerance to physical exercise. Although exercise is recommended in their daily routine to improve quality of life, little is known about how CFS codiagnosis affects that. Using scientifically validated questionnaires, we evaluated the psychological state and quality of life of patients with FM (n = 70) and how habitual physical exercise (HPE) reported by patients with only FM (FM-only n = 38) or codiagnosed with CFS (FM + CFS, n = 32) influences those aspects. An age-matched reference group of ""healthy"" women without FM (RG, n = 70) was used. The FM-only group presented a worse psychological state and quality of life compared to RG, with no influence of CFS codiagnosis. The patients of the FM-only and FM + CFS groups who perform HPE presented better levels of stress and state anxiety, but with no differences between them. Depression and trait anxiety improved only in women with just FM. CFS codiagnosis does not worsen the psychological and quality of life impairment of FM patients and does not have a great influence on the positive effect of HPE.","Hinchado, Otero, Navarro, MartÃƒÂ­n-Cordero, GÃƒÂ¡lvez, Ortega","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11195735","20221014","COVID-19; chronic fatigue syndrome; exercise; fibromyalgia; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39321,""
"Uptake of a Switching Program for Patients Receiving Intravenous Infliximab and Vedolizumab to Subcutaneous Preparations","Recent trials support the clinical efficacy and safety of subcutaneous infliximab (IFX) or vedolizumab (VDZ) for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). We evaluated the uptake and rationale for choosing to switch from intravenous infusions to subcutaneous injections. Retrospective analysis of all adult patients receiving standard dosing IFX or VDZ maintenance therapy to investigate uptake of subcutaneous injections and the rationale for switching to subcutaneous injections. Of 232 eligible patients (total = 258: IFX = 190, VDZ = 68, and no longer eligible = 26), 58% of patients on IFX and 59% of patients on VDZ chose to switch to subcutaneous treatment. Age, sex, diagnosis, drug, line of treatment, and duration of treatment were not predictors for willingness to switch. Questionnaire responses (<i>n</i> = 51) demonstrate that the decision to switch was not influenced by COVID-19 exposure risk, impact on wider IBD service provision, impact on patient mental health, financial savings, seeking support following a switch, or a sense of independence managing IBD. Switchers (68%) were more motivated by time savings than non-switchers (25%; <i>p</i> = 0.0042). Switch uptake rates were 58%, with 90% of patients eligible to switch.

"COVID-19 in Memes: The Adaptive Response of Societies to the Pandemic?","COVID-19 expanded rapidly throughout the world, with enormous health, social, and economic consequences. Mental health is the most affected by extreme negative emotions and stress, but it has been an underestimated part of human life during the pandemic. We hypothesized that people may have responded to the pandemic spontaneously with increased interest in and creation of funny internet memes. Using Google and Google Trends, we revealed that the number of and interest in funny internet memes related to COVID-19 exploded during the spring 2020 lockdown. The interest in coronavirus memes was positively correlated with interest in mortality due to COVID-19 on a global scale, and positively associated with the real number of deaths and cases reported in different countries. We compared content of a random sample of 200 coronavirus memes with a random sample of 200 non-coronavirus memes found on the Internet. The sentiment analysis showed that coronavirus memes had a similar proportion of positive and negative words compared to non-coronavirus memes. However, an internet questionnaire revealed that coronavirus memes gained higher funniness scores than a random sample of non-coronavirus memes. Our results confirm that societies may have turned to humor to cope with the threat of SARS-CoV-2.","SkÃƒÂ³rka, Grzywacz, MoroÃ…â€ž, Lenda","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912969","20221014","COVID-19; entertainment; extreme negative emotions; healing; health; humor; mental health; recovery; stress; the internet","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39323,""
"COVID-19 Vaccination and Mental Stress within Diverse Sociodemographic Groups","In this study, we surveyed 635 participants to determine: (a) major causes of mental stress during the pandemic and its future impacts, and (b) diversity in public perception of the COVID-19 vaccination and its acceptance (specifically for children). Statistical results and intelligent clustering outcomes indicate significant associations between sociodemographic diversity, mental stress causes, and vaccination perception. For instance, statistical results indicate significant dependence between gender (we will use term 'sex' in the rest of the manuscript) and mental stress due to COVID-19 infection (<i>p</i> = 1.7 Ãƒâ€” 10<sup>-5</sup>). Over 25% of males indicated work-related stress compared to 35% in females, however, females indicated that they were more stressed (17%) due to relationships compared to males (12%). Around 30% of Asian/Arabic participants do not feel that the vaccination is safe as compared to 8% of white British and 22% of white Europeans, indicating significant dependence (<i>p</i> = 1.8 Ãƒâ€” 10<sup>-8</sup>) with ethnicity. More specifically, vaccination acceptance for children is significantly dependent with ethnicity (<i>p</i> = 3.7 Ãƒâ€” 10<sup>-5</sup>) where only 47% participants show willingness towards children's vaccination. The primary dataset in this study along with experimental outcomes identifying sociodemographic information diversity with respect to public perception and acceptance of vaccination in children and potential stress factors might be useful for the public and policymakers to help them be better prepared for future epidemics, as well as working globally to combat mental health issues.","Khan, Khan, Yasen, Al-Dahiri, Al-Jumeily, Dajani, Hussain","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912932","20221014","COVID-19 mental health issues; future epidemics; mental stress dataset; vaccine acceptance rate; vaccine dataset; vaccine sociodemographic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39324,""
"Prevalence and Associated Factors of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress in University Students in Paraguay during the COVID-19 Pandemic","We aimed to determine the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress in university students in Paraguay during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 293 students from four universities in Paraguay in 2021. The DASS-21 mental health scale was used to measure the outcomes (depression, anxiety, and stress) and evaluate their association with socio-educational variables. A total of 77.1% of the participants were women and 136 (46.4%) were between 21 and 25 years old. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress was 74.7%, 87.4%, and 57%, respectively. We found that being a woman and studying at a public university was positively associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. Receiving COVID-19 training increases the prevalence of mental health problems. In conclusion, high levels of anxiety, depression, and stress were found in university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Being a woman, studying at a public university, and receiving training on COVID-19 were factors associated with a higher prevalence of presenting all the mental health problems evaluated. Furthermore, students aged 31 and over had a higher prevalence of depression and stress.","Aveiro-RÃƒÂ³balo, Garlisi-Torales, ChumÃƒÂ¡n-SÃƒÂ¡nchez, Pereira-Victorio, Huaman-Garcia, Failoc-Rojas, Valladares-Garrido","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912930","20221014","COVID-19; Paraguay; anxiety; depression; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39325,""
"Mental Health, Support System, and Perceived Usefulness of Support in University Students in Hong Kong Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic: A Mixed-Method Survey","This study explored the association of students' mental health with their support system, identified the preferred ways and sources of support, investigated the perceived usefulness of available university support, and recommended actionable strategies to enhance students' mental health. An online questionnaire survey and semi-structured focus group interviews were conducted in 2021. Among 1121 university students, 39.4% reported anxiety symptoms, which were less common in Chinese students and those pursuing medical and health programmes. Overall, 32.6% reported depression symptoms, which were more common in undergraduates. Both anxiety and depression symptoms were less common in students with higher resilience and support system and more common in students with family distress. Students with higher resilience had a better support system and less family distress. Perceived support from universities was lower than from peers and families. Peer support and phone contacts were the most preferred sources and ways of support. The most useful available university support was updated university guidelines, and the least useful was the emotional hotline service from universities The qualitative findings corroborated the quantitative results. We suggested that a holistic care approach and more proactive student-oriented university support would help students face adversity and enhance mental health.","Lai, Cheung, Choi, Wang, Chan, Lam, Lo, Lin, Lam","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912931","20221014","COVID-19; Hong Kong; family functioning; mental health; resilience; support system; university students; university support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39326,""
"Incorporating the Co-Creation Method into Social Innovation Design to Promote Intergenerational Integration: A Case Study of a Public Square","With the COVID-19 pandemic sweeping the world, there is an increased focus on intergenerational relationships, community mental health issues, and well-being in community contexts. This paper assesses the effectiveness of a co-creation approach for intergenerational integration at the theoretical level. The study used a collaborative co-creation design method in the community design process to explore whether the participation of community residents of all ages in addressing community issues promoted communication and alleviated stereotyping between the various generations. This study was conducted in Shanghai's Hongqiao New Village square, where we conducted participatory research and co-creation workshops in response to the demand for the use of the public space as a location for social interactions. The results showed that intervention in community creation through collaborative design is conducive to promoting friendly relations among different age groups, forming a sense of social security and thus enhancing social well-being. Finally, this paper combines practical cases and theoretical models of collaborative co-creative design approaches to promote the intergenerational integration of communities and is summarized from the input and output parts as well as the influencing factors and constraints of the collaborative co-creative. In addition, it provides new ideas on how to improve intergenerational relationships and form a positive and sustainable community mental health environment in the future.","Wu, Zhang, Ren","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912908","20221014","co-creation design; community mental health; design method; design strategy; intergenerational integration; social innovation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39327,""
"Families, Schools, and the Longitudinal Changes in Psychological Distress among College Students during the First Year of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence from a National Panel Survey in China","The psychological well-being of students in higher education has become an increasingly important concern in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of prior studies were cross-sectional and thereby failed to capture the individual changes in mental health over time. Moreover, few studies have explored whether and how socioeconomic and education backgrounds could be related to college students' mental health changes. This study aimed to fill these gaps. Data were from a nationwide, two-wave panel survey of college students in China. Baseline information was collected in November 2019, i.e., before the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in China. A follow-up survey was conducted in November and December 2020, when the epidemic was effectively contained in mainland China. In both waves, mental health was assessed with the 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). The between-wave changes in psychological distress were measured and categorized. Overall, 13.5% of students experienced at least a one-standard-deviation increase in psychological distress over the one-year follow-up. Results from both bivariate and multivariable analysis showed that this marked distress increase was more pronounced among vocational college students (vs. academic undergraduate and postgraduate students) and those with lower levels of academic performance. In contrast, family socioeconomic status (as measured by parental education, family economic condition, and current residence) was not associated with distress changes over time. These findings highlight the importance of the educational disparities within the higher education system in understanding the mental health dynamics of college students in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zhu, Zhang, Li, Xu, Liu","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912882","20221014","COVID-19; college students; education background; longitudinal study; psychological distress; socioeconomic status","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39328,""
"Adverse Childhood Experiences and COVID-19 Stress on Changes in Mental Health among Young Adults","The COVID-19 pandemic has been linked to poor mental health outcomes and may be particularly damaging for young adults who may be more affected by governmental pandemic responses such as mandatory school and work closures, online schooling, and social isolation. Exposure to Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) has also been shown to have a significant impact on mental health among young adults. This prospective study examined whether young adults with higher ACE profiles were more vulnerable to COVID-19 stressors. Using pre-COVID-19 data from the Niagara Longitudinal Heart Study and a follow-up online survey during COVID-19, we examined 171 young adults and found that high COVID-19-related stress, especially emotional and relationship stress, led to a greater reduction in mental health among young adults with higher levels of ACEs. Findings indicate that young adults with high ACE profiles may benefit from resources and intervention programs directed at mental health in times of crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Alradhi, Moore, Patte, O'Leary, Wade","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912874","20221014","COVID-19; adverse childhood experiences (ACEs); mental health; stress; young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39329,""

"Substance Use and Mental Health during the First COVID-19 Lockdown in Germany: Results of a Cross-Sectional Survey","The measures taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic have led to significant changes in people's daily lives. This paper examines changes in substance use during the first lockdown (March-July 2020) and investigates mental health burdens in substance users with increased consumption of alcohol, nicotine or tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in Germany compared to users with unchanged or reduced consumption. In a cross-sectional online survey, 2369 people were asked about their mental health and their substance use during the first lockdown in Germany. Of the participants, 28.5% increased their alcohol use, 28.8% their use of tobacco products, and 20.6% their use of THC-containing products during the pandemic. The groups with increased alcohol, nicotine, and THC use during the first lockdown reported more depressive symptoms and anxiety. Individuals who reported increased consumption of alcohol or nicotine were also more likely to experience loneliness and have suicidal thoughts and were more often stressed due to social distancing. Alcohol, nicotine and THC increased in a subgroup of consumers who reported to have more mental health problems compared to individuals who did not increase their consumption. This increased substance use could, therefore, be understood as a dysfunctional strategy to cope with negative emotions during the lockdown.","Deimel, Firk, StÃƒÂ¶ver, Hees, Scherbaum, FleiÃƒÅ¸ner","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912801","20221014","COVID-19; mental health during lockdown; substance use during lockdown","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39331,""
"COVID-19-Related Health Literacy of School Leaders in Hong Kong: A Cross-Sectional Study","To date, we know little about COVID-19-related health literacy among school leaders, particularly in East Asia. The present study aimed to assess the level of COVID-19-related health literacy and associated factors (vaccine hesitancy, self-endangering behaviour, and work satisfaction) among school leaders in Hong Kong. A cross-sectional study of 259 school leaders was carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic between April 2021 and February 2022. COVID-19-related health literacy using HLS-COVID-Q22, three subscales of self-endangering work behaviour scales (i.e., ""extensification of work"", ""intensification of work"" and ""quality reduction""), and two dimensions of Burnout Assessment Tool (BAT) (i.e., psychosomatic complaints and exhaustion) were used. The study employed independent sample <i>t</i>-test, ANOVA, and multilinear regression models. The findings show that more than half (53.7%) of school leaders had insufficient health literacy. Participants with insufficient health literacy scored significantly higher in the following factors: exhaustion related to work situation (<i>p</i> = 0.029), psychosomatic complaints (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001), attitude about vaccination (i.e., less agree with vaccination) (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001), level of informing on COVID-19 related information (i.e., felt less informed) (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001), and level of confusion about COVID-19-related information (i.e., felt more confused) (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). In a linear regression model predicting attitude about coronavirus vaccination, age (ÃŽÂ², -0.188, 95% CI, -0.024, -0.005, <i>p</i> = 0.002) and health literacy (ÃŽÂ², -0.395, 95% CI, -0.716, -0.361, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) were the negative predictors, <i>F</i>(5, 214) = 11.859, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001. For the linear regression model adjusted for sex and age for predicting health literacy, the model was insignificant. Despite being a highly educated group, this study reveals that one in two Hong Kong school leaders have insufficient health literacy. Inadequate health literacy was strongly associated with a negative attitude about vaccination, low information, and confusion about COVID-19-related information. Additionally, insufficient health literacy was associated with the two secondary symptoms of burnouts. The study highlights an urgent need to develop intervention programmes to promote the COVID-19-specific as well as overall health literacy of the school leaders.","Lau, Shum, Man, Cheung, Amoah, Leung, Dadaczynski, Okan","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912790","20221014","COVID-19; Hong Kong; health literacy; school heads; school principals; self-endangering work behaviour; vaccine hesitancy; work satisfaction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39332,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Professional Autonomy of Anesthesiological Nurses and Trust in the Therapeutic Team of Intensive Therapy Units-Polish Multicentre Study","The COVID-19 pandemic as well as the rate of spread of this particular pathogen around the world have caused the number of patients requiring medical attention and intensive care to exceed the capacity of even the best organized health care systems. This resulted in the need to hire employees who had not previously worked in intensive care units. Experience and knowledge have become particularly important in the context of mutual trust in the ICU team. At the same time, it could affect the level of professional autonomy of nurses, understood as the freedom to perform work based on knowledge, skills and competence without the need to submit to other medical professions. The pandemic status has required that nurses are always involved in their work by participating in training. Faced with the dangers of COVID-19, there is no doubt that by the end of the pandemic, both nursing and healthcare will be better equipped to face future challenges. The study lasted from July to September 2021. The data collection procedure started with the consent of the heads of the institutions where the data was collected. The study was conducted using the Dempster Practice Behavior Scale (DPBS), which examines work autonomy. The survey using the proprietary questionnaire was conducted among 225 nurses working in eleven ICUs in five voivodeships in Poland. The autonomy of nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic was assessed at a high level. Younger respondents rated autonomy as being higher. Almost half of the respondents assessed the level of professional independence as high, including 52% of nurses, and significantly less, including 34% of doctors. A group of 47% of respondents assessed that trust had decreased and 28% said that trust had improved slightly. Professional independence allows you to perform work independently on others, taking responsibility for decisions and actions. The COVID-19 pandemic, through the influx of new staff members into treatment teams, had an impact on both nursing autonomy and the level of trust in a team, as shown in this study.","Krukowska-Sitek, Krupa, Grad","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912755","20221014","COVID-19; ICU; pandemic; professional autonomy; therapeutic team; trust","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39333,""
"Examining the Relationship between Paternal Mental Health and Informal Support Networks: Reflections on the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic","Paternal mental health remains an under-researched area in the UK. Consequently, father-focused formal and informal support provisions fail to address the complex emotional and psychological wellbeing needs of fathers. Drawing on data from twenty semi-structured interviews with fathers in the York area, this study seeks to better understand how access to and participation in informal support networks is influenced by gendered perceptions and the impact hegemonic perceptions of masculinity have on fathers' access to support prior and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings demonstrate that fathers internalise stereotypical masculine tropes, such as stoicism, which prevent them from actively seeking support. While fathers value informal support network, they generally struggle to engage in mental health talks. The COVID-19 lockdown exacerbated fathers' struggles to access informal support or prioritise their mental health. Fathers felt the pandemic presented a unique challenge that only people that became parents at the time understood. This meant that fathers could not rely on their parents or other parents who did not have similar experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper aims at challenging structural and cultural barriers that inhibit fathers' participation in informal support networks, and to promote more meaningful, supportive engagement with peer groups.","Gheyoh Ndzi, Holmes","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912751","20221014","COVID-19; fatherhood; fathersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ mental health; informal support; pandemic; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39334,""

The data collection took place from 26th July to 17th September 2021 (the analytical sample included <i>n</i> = 491 observations). The well-established UCLA-3 tool was used to quantify loneliness. Independent variables included sex, age, marital status, the existence of children and pets, level of education, country of origin, duration of homelessness, alcohol and drug consumption, mental health concerns and concerns regarding COVID-19 illness. Multiple logistic regressions were used to examine the predictors of loneliness. The frequency of loneliness was 41.7% for the total sample. Multiple logistic regression analysis stratified by gender showed that a higher likelihood of loneliness was associated with being born in Germany, being middle aged (40 to 49 years compared to 18 to 29 years), having mental health problems and a short period of homelessness (1 month compared to longer periods) among women. In men, a higher likelihood of loneliness was associated with a higher fear of COVID-19 and a short period of homelessness. Our study revealed a high frequency rate of loneliness among homeless individuals. The study results highlight the associations between some explanatory variables (i.e., the duration of homelessness and mental health problems). Identifying the factors associated with loneliness may help to adequately address the problems of homeless individuals at risk of loneliness. Longitudinal studies are required to confirm our findings.","Dost, Heinrich, Graf, Brennecke, Kowalski, Leider, Kraus, van RÃƒÂ¼th, Ondruschka, PÃƒÂ¼schel, KÃƒÂ¶nig, Bertram, Hajek","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912718","20221014","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; homelessness; loneliness; social exclusion; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39336,""
"Changes in Public Sentiment under the Background of Major Emergencies-Taking the Shanghai Epidemic as an Example","The occurrence of major health events can have a significant impact on public mood and mental health. In this study, we selected Shanghai during the 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic as a case study and Weibo texts as the data source. The ERNIE pre-training model was used to classify the text data into five emotional categories: gratitude, confidence, sadness, anger, and no emotion. The changes in public sentiment and potential influencing factors were analyzed with the emotional sequence diagram method. We also examined the causal relationship between the epidemic and public sentiment, as well as positive and negative emotions. The study found: (1) public sentiment during the epidemic was primarily affected by public behavior, government behavior, and the severity of the epidemic. (2) From the perspective of time series changes, the changes in public emotions during the epidemic were divided into emotional fermentation, emotional climax, and emotional chaos periods. (3) There was a clear causal relationship between the epidemic and the changes in public emotions, and the impact on negative emotions was greater than that of positive emotions. Additionally, positive emotions had a certain inhibitory effect on negative emotions.","Zhang, Lin, Luo, Zeng, Feng, Zhou, Deng","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912594","20221014","COVID-19; Coupla entropy; ERNIE pre-training model; Shanghai; emotions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39337,""
"Exploring the Socio-Demographic and Psychosocial Factors That Enhance Resilience in the COVID-19 Crisis","The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has greatly affected mental health worldwide. This study aimed to identify sociodemographic and psychosocial factors that influence the level of resilience among Singaporeans amidst the pandemic. An online questionnaire was administered to Singaporeans and permanent residents aged 21 and above. The online questionnaire collected information on sociodemographics, infection, and contact with COVID-19. Psychosocial variables-specifically optimism, self-efficacy, hope, and resilience-were also assessed through validated questionnaires. A total of 404 responses were collected in this study. Men were reported to have higher resilience compared to women (28.13 vs. 25.54, <i>p</i>-value &amp;lt; 0.001). Married individuals were observed to have higher resilience compared to their single counterparts (27.92 vs. 25.77, <i>p</i>-value &amp;lt; 0.001). Interestingly, participants who knew of family members/friends who had contracted COVID-19 were reported to be more resilient than those who did not (28.09 vs. 26.19, <i>p</i>-value = 0.013). Optimism, self-efficacy, and hope were also found to be associated with higher resilience (<i>p</i>-value &amp;lt; 0.001). In conclusion, one's sex, marital status, contact with COVID-19, level of optimism, self-efficacy, and hope were shown to significantly affect resilience. Given the long-drawn nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, interventions should aim to improve optimism, self-efficacy, and hopefulness in the community.","Lin, Tan, Tay, Koh, Siew, Teo, Tan, Hilal","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912580","20221014","COVID-19; Singapore; psychosocial; resilience; sociodemographic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39338,""
"Exploring the Factors Associated with Mental Health Attitude in China: A Structural Topic Modeling Approach","Mental health attitude has huge impacts on the improvement of mental health. In response to the ongoing damage the COVID-19 pandemic caused to the mental health of the Chinese people, this study aims to explore the factors associated with mental health attitude in China. To this end, we extract the key topics in mental health-related microblogs on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, using the structural topic modeling (STM) approach. An interaction term of sentiment polarity and time is put into the STM model to track the evolution of public sentiment towards the key topics over time. Through an in-depth analysis of 146,625 Weibo posts, this study captures 12 topics that are, in turn, classified into four factors as stigma (<i>n</i> = 54,559, 37.21%), mental health literacy (<i>n</i> = 32,199, 21.96%), public promotion (<i>n</i> = 30,747, 20.97%), and social support (<i>n</i> = 29,120, 19.86%). The results show that stigma is the primary factor inducing negative mental health attitudes in China as none of the topics related to this factor are considered positive. Mental health literacy, public promotion, and social support are the factors that could enhance positive attitudes towards mental health, since most of the topics related to these factors are identified as positive ones. The provision of tailored strategies for each of these factors could potentially improve the mental health attitudes of the Chinese people.","Yin, Tian, Wu, Gan","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912579","20221014","COVID-19; China; Weibo; mental health attitude; social media; structural topic modeling; text analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39339,""
"Depressive, Anxious, and Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms Related to Violence during the COVID-19 Pandemic, by Sex, COVID-19 Status, and Intervention-Seeking Conditions among the General Population","Worldwide, three out of four of the general population have reported experiencing violence. Governments should address solutions to violence and its effects on mental health. The study aimed to determine depressive, anxious, and posttraumatic stress symptoms related to the violence experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population. The study was conducted with 18,449 Mexicans of 33 years (SD = 11.00, range = 18-59), with 12,188 (66.10%) being women, 3559 (19.29%) having COVID-19, 2706 (14.67%) seeking psychological care, and 5712 (30.96%) experiencing violence. Subjects completed the Major Depressive Episode (MDE) Checklist, Generalized Anxiety (GA) Scale, and the Posttraumatic Stress (PTS) Checklists (PCL-5) programmed in a WebApp application. We assessed the dimensionality of the scales through the Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), the measurement invariance, and a structural equation model (SEM). In the total sample, 28.10% fulfilled the MDE criteria, and 42.30% had high levels of GA. In the sample of those experiencing violence, 48.40% met the MDE criteria, 61.70% had high GA symptoms, and 50% met the criteria for a PTS disorder. Experiencing violence was associated with GA and severe PTS symptoms when the discomfort had bothered them for over a month since the onset of these symptoms. Subjects who had experienced violence and had mental health symptoms seemed ready for treatment. Further studies will evaluate the effect of remote psychological care to help reduce the treatment gap.","Morales ChainÃƒÂ©, Robles GarcÃƒÂ­a, Bosch, TreviÃƒÂ±o Santa Cruz","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912559","20221014","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; help-seeking; measurement; posttraumatic stress; violence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39340,""
"Digital and Non-Digital Solidarity between Older Parents and Their Middle-Aged Children: Associations with Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic","We incorporated intergenerational digital communication (frequency of texting, video call, and social media interaction) into the intergenerational solidarity paradigm and identified new types of intergenerational and digital solidarity with adult children among older parents during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we examined whether those types are associated with older parents' mental health (depressive symptoms, psychological well-being, and self-esteem). We used the 2021/2022 wave of the Longitudinal Study of Generations (LSOG), and a sample of 519 older parents (mean age = 69 years). Latent class analysis identified four classes describing intergenerational and digital solidarity with adult children (<i>distant-but-digitally connected</i>, <i>tight-knit-traditional</i>, <i>detached</i>, and <i>ambivalent</i>). We found that older parents who had <i>distant-but-digitally connected</i> and <i>tight-knit-traditional</i> relationships with their adult children reported better mental health, compared to those who had <i>detached</i> and <i>ambivalent</i> relationships with their adult children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings suggest that intergenerational digital communication should be considered as a digital solidarity in intergenerational solidarity paradigm, which is useful for measuring multidimension of intergenerational relationships within family members during and after the pandemic.","Hwang, Fu, Brown, Silverstein","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912560","20221014","COVID-19 pandemic; digital solidarity; intergenerational digital communication; intergenerational solidarity; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39341,""
"Effects of Yoga and Mindfulness Programs on Self-Compassion in Medical Professionals during the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Intervention Study","Stress among healthcare workers (HCWs) increased during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. We aimed to determine whether a yoga and mindfulness program could alleviate burnout and other psychological and physical distress in HCWs, and how this might affect their empathy for patients. A weekly one-hour yoga and mindfulness program was conducted for three months in 2021. Participants were 18 consenting HCWs and, the final analysis included 13 participants. They responded to online questionnaires before and after the program. We measured salivary cortisol levels before and after the program on the first and last days.

"Favorable Adaptation during SARS-CoV-2-Pandemic as Told by Student-Athletes-A Longitudinal and Behavioral Study","(1) Background: The aim was to explore the impact of adaptive responses (resilience factors) on student-athletes' behaviors during a stressful period of life during the SARS-CoV-2-pandemic of 2020 and 2021. (2) Methods: A constructivist-based grounded theory (CGT) was used guided by a biopsychosocial approach. Based on purposeful sampling, 22 male and female student-athletes were divided into four focus group interviews (FGI) seven months after the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2-pandemic (October 2020) and 18 of these were followed up by FGI seven months later (May 2021). The mean age was 17.65 and they represented golf and handball. (3) Results: The CGT contained four main categories seven months after the SARS-CoV-2-pandemic outbreak: Social support, Self-discipline, Physical practice and recovery and Management of everyday life. Fourteen months after the SARS-CoV-2-pandemic outbreak, four additional main categories emerged: More extensive social support, Belief in the future, Self-awareness and Responsibility and problem-solving. (4) Conclusions: The CTG suggests that student-athletes' favorable adaptations to the stressful SARS-CoV-2-pandemic period 2020-2021 are based on a gradually developed ability to take responsibility for one's own actions, insight into the importance of deepened social interaction, belief in a positive post-COVID future and increased awareness of physical activity and its relation to perceived health.","Johnson, Hertting, Ivarsson, Lindgren","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912512","20221014","SARS-CoV-2-pandemic; biopsychosocial approach; corona mental health; focus group interviews; resilience; youth athletes","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39343,""
"Supporting Physical Activity for Informal Caregivers during and beyond COVID-19: Exploring the Feasibility, Usability and Acceptability of a Digital Health Smartphone Application, 'CareFit'","The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed how our global societies rely upon the care and support of informal (unpaid) caregivers: in the UK alone, there are an estimated 6.5 million informal carers. The caring role is not just precarious, it is often associated with high levels of stress, poor/deteriorating health and crisis points (hospitalisations, worsening of health). Fittingly, there has been much research in recent years focusing on mental health supports. A lesser explored area is physical health and physical activity. To address this, we conducted a real-world feasibility, usability and acceptability study of a novel codesigned digital health app for caregivers to improve levels of physical activity. Our study was designed to test the prototype app use for three weeks, following participants across questionnaires/in app data/qualitative data. Our findings (from 27 caregivers) highlights key knowledge gaps around physical activity-national guidelines were not reaching populations studies and behavioural change techniques hold promise to help support caregivers in the longer term. Our collective results support the acceptability, usability and feasibility of the Carefit app and warrant further investigation.","Egan, Hodgson, Imperatore, Dunlop, Maguire, Kirk","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912506","20221014","caregivers; co-design; collaboration at distance; digital health; innovation; interdisciplinary; participatory design; research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39344,""

"The Impact of COVID-19 on Maternal Mental Health during Pregnancy: A Comparison between Canada and China within the CONCEPTION Cohort","The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal mental health has been described in Canada and China but no study has compared the two countries using the same standardized and validated instruments. In this study, we aimed to evaluate and compare the impact of COVID-19 public health policies on maternal mental health between Canada and China, as we hypothesize that geographical factors and different COVID-19 policies are likely to influence maternal mental health. Pregnant persons &amp;gt;18 years old were recruited in Canada and China using a web-based strategy. All participants recruited between 26 June 2020 and 16 February 2021 were analyzed. Self-reported data included sociodemographic variables, COVID-19 experience and maternal mental health assessments (Edinburgh Perinatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Generalized Anxiety Disorders (GAD-7) scale, stress and satisfaction with life). Analyses were stratified by recruitment cohort, namely: Canada 1 (26 June 2020-10 October 2020), Canada 2 and China (11 October 2020-16 February 2021). Overall, 2423 participants were recruited, with 1804 participants within Canada 1, 135 within Canada 2 and 484 in China.

For increased physical activity, the figures were lower (20 and 14%-23 and 18%, in women and men, respectively). The participants with a decreasing physical activity evolution were older and more likely to be living in urban areas. The main reasons for (i) decreased physical activity were limitations of movement and not liking indoor exercise, (ii) increased physical activity were to stay physically fit and healthy.

"Interactive Compensation Effects of Physical Activity and Sleep on Mental Health: A Longitudinal Panel Study among Chinese College Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Physical activity (PA) and sleep are both important to mental health. However, their joint effects on mental distress have not been well explored. The aim of this study was to investigate the joint effects of PA and sleep on mental health, as well as the dose-response relationships between PA and mental health under different sleep health statuses. A longitudinal panel study was adopted to evaluate the relationship between PA, sleep, and mental health among 66 healthy Chinese college students with four online questionnaire surveys. A mixed-effect model with individual-level random effect was used to analyze the interactive regulation effect of PA and sleep on mental health, and a generalized additive model with splines was further fitted to analyze dose-response relationships between variables. When sleep was at a healthy level, no significant difference in mental health was observed between different levels of PA (<i>p</i> &amp;gt; 0.05). However, poor sleepers with moderate and high PA levels indicated significantly fewer negative emotions than those with low PA levels (<i>p</i> = 0.001, <i>p</i> = 0.004). Likewise, poor sleepers who engaged in more moderate intensity PA could significantly reduce negative emotions (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = -0.470, <i>p</i> = 0.011) in a near-linear trend. In summary, both sleep and PA benefit mental health, and they probably regulate mental health through an interactive compensation mode. For good and poor sleepers, PA plays a different role in maintaining and improving mental health. Increasing moderate intensity PA up to moderate-and-high levels is recommended for those who simultaneously suffer from sleep and psychological health problems.","Zhang, Liu, Zhang, Ke, Liu","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912323","20221014","interactive compensation effect; longitudinal panel study; mental health; physical activity; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39350,""

The FILLED (Filipino Lived Experiences during COVID-19) Project launched a cross-sectional online survey between April-August 2021 among FilAm adults in Southern California to document community issues and outcomes during the pandemic. Among 223 participants, 47.5% were immigrants, 50.9% identified as essential workers, and 40.6% had a pre-existing health condition before the pandemic. Despite high rates of health insurance (93.3%), 24.4% of the sample did not have a regular health care provider. During the pandemic, 32.7% needed mental health help but did not get it and 44.2% did not know where to get such services. Most respondents felt that the COVID-19 vaccination was a personal responsibility to others (76.9%) and the majority had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine (82.4%). Regarding COVID-19 impact, participants reported moderate-severe changes in their daily routines (73.5%), access to extended social support (38.9%), housing issues (15.4%), and access to medical care (11.6%). To our knowledge, this study is the first community-driven effort highlighting FilAm community experiences in Southern California, where the highest proportion of FilAms in the United States reside, specifically after the COVID-19 vaccine was made widely available. The observational findings may help community leaders, policy makers, and public health researchers in the design, development, and implementation of post-pandemic intervention strategies used by community-partnered projects that address FilAm and sub-Asian group health disparities at grassroots to societal levels.","Sabado-Liwag, Zamora, Esmundo, Sumibcay, Kwan","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912303","20221014","Asian American; COVID-19; FilAm; Filipino American; barriers; culture; essential workers; health disparities; healthcare workers; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39351,""
"Faith-Based Community Members, Family, and COVID-19: The Role of Family Cohesion, Social Support, and Spiritual Support on Quality of Life, Depression, and COVID-19-Prevention Behaviors","This study examined relationships between family cohesion, social support/spiritual support, and quality of life and depression among faith-based community members during the 2020 COVID-19 restrictions. Drawing upon the buffering model of social support and family cohesion as theoretical frameworks, the authors examined these factors in a survey of 551 faith-based community members between March 2020 and June 2020. Family cohesion had a direct and indirect effect (mediated by overall social support and spiritual support on quality of life). Moreover, family cohesion only had a direct effect on depression (e.g., not mediated by overall social support or spiritual support). Greater family cohesion and overall social support were predictive of increased COVID-19-prevention behaviors, while spiritual support was predictive of reduced COVID-19-prevention behaviors.","Wright, Davidson Mhonde","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912267","20221014","faith-based communities; family cohesion; health outcomes; social support; spiritual support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39352,""
"Patient Experiences after Physical Trauma: The Negative Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Recovery","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic generated a crisis within the healthcare system, during which acute, COVID-19-related health needs were prioritized over less urgent needs, including vulnerable subgroups. This study explored experiences of recovery among survivors of physical injuries associated with severe pain during the COVID-19 pandemic in Norway. In-depth interviews were conducted among 13 participants. Findings generated by a thematic analysis revealed that the pandemic, including the contagion control measures and interrupted healthcare, were of negative consequence for the participants' recovery experiences and mental and physical health. Despite experiencing severe pain and perceived needs for support, the participants experienced being deprioritized by the healthcare system. They experienced a reduced capacity to cope with pandemic-related stress and to perform everyday tasks, which they perceived as generating an additional burden for their loved ones. Alcohol was reported to be used in an effort to relieve the associated mental distress. As suggested by this study, injury survivors constitute a vulnerable subgroup for whom the continuity of rehabilitation services during a national crisis, as well as the integration of mental health support, can be essential for mitigating the negative impact of the crisis on recovery and for promoting optimal long-term health outcomes.","Finstad, Clausen, Rosseland, RÃƒÂ¸ise, Havnes","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912258","20221014","COVID-19; mental health; pandemic; physical trauma; qualitative research; recovery; rehabilitation; substance use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39353,""
"Perceptions of Quality of Life during the Pandemic: A Case Study on B40 Single Mothers","During the pandemic, the lives of B40 single mothers were severely affected, especially in terms of social, economic, and psychological factors. The reduction of income caused by the crisis has forced single mothers and their children to live frugally and without luxury. They also had to perform more than one job at a time during the pandemic to meet their children's needs. A qualitative study has been conducted to explore the perceptions of quality of life during the pandemic among B40 single mothers. Respondents were selected based on demographic characteristics established before the study. A focus group discussion has been conducted on ten (10) B40 single mothers in Balik Pulau, Penang. Single mothers were selected based on purposive sampling. They had to meet the inclusive criteria required to participate in the study, specifically: aged between 20 and 60 years old, belonged to the B40 income category, had children under 18 years old living together, and became single mothers due to divorce or death of husbands. The focused group discussion explored issues related to qualities of life during the pandemic. B40 single mothers expressed their concern about access to health facilities, security in residence, children's education, and economic stability. These areas of life quality have been significantly affected especially during Movement Control Order (MCO). In short, the quality of life of these single mothers has been significantly affected by the pandemic. Their vulnerability towards stress, anxiety, and depression have worsened due to financial issues. Besides the need for emotional and social support, this study found that these single mothers entail financial support.","Zakaria, Abdullah, Md Akhir, Amin, Mohd Shukry, Abdul Rashid, Wan Yusof","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912219","20221014","B40; COVID-19; MCO; pandemic; quality of life; single mothers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39354,""
"Pregnancy Complications in Pandemics: Is Pregnancy-Related Anxiety a Possible Physiological Risk Factor?","Birth and pregnancy complications increased by 10.2% during the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Pregnant women are at high risk for anxiety, which might trigger physio-logical stress, leading to pregnancy complications. This study aimed to investigate factors leading to antenatal anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also aimed to discuss our find-ings with regard to the current literature about pregnancy complications. This cross-sectional study interviewed 377 pregnant women and assessed anxiety using a validated 7-item general anxiety disorder (GAD-7) scale. Anxiety was related to physiological and demo-graphic parameters. Anxiety was subdivided into pandemic- and pregnancy-related anxiety to minimize results bias. Our results showed that 75.3% of pregnant women were anxious. The mean GAD-7 score was 8.28 Ã‚Â± 5. Linear regression analysis showed that for every increase in the number of previous pregnancies, there was a 1.3 increase in anxiety level (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). Women with no previous miscarriages were more anxious (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). Surprisingly, pregnant women who were previously infected with COVID-19 were 6% less stressed. Pregnant women with comorbid-ities were more stressed (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). Low income (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) and age (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05) were the demo-graphic factors most significantly related to increased anxiety. The prevalence of pregnancy-related anxiety increased threefold in Saudi Arabia due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare support should be available remotely during pandemics; pregnant women (especially those with comorbidities) should be educated about the risks of infection and complications to prevent anxiety-related complications during pregnancy.","Abahussain, Al-Otaibi, Al-Humaidi, Al-Mutairi, Al-Khatir, Abualnaja, Al-Mazidi","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912119","20221014","COVID-19; anxiety; mental health; pregnancy; womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39355,""
"Changes in the Dog's and Cat's Behaviors, as Reported by the Owners, before and during the Lockdown in China","Considering the effects that the COVID-19 pandemic had and still has on human psychological health, it is expected that it might also affect household dogs' and cats' welfare. The current study explores the behavioral changes in dogs and cats before (BL) and during the lockdown (DL), as reported by their owners in China. Besides demographic parameters, variables related to the daily management of dogs and cats were analyzed in relation to behavioral problems, stress-related behaviors, and anxiety-related behaviors before and during the lockdown. A total of 261 questionnaires were collected. In general, behavioral problems and stress-related behaviors in dogs (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) and cats (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) decreased DL compared to BL, while anxiety-related behaviors in cats did not show any differences between the two periods considered. On the other hand, anxiety-related behaviors were more frequent in dogs DL (36.3%) compared to BL (35%), which were associated with reduced frequency of play activities with the owners (<i>p</i> = 0.016) and altered sleeping habits (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.01). During the lockdown, dogs' and cats' daily routines and management (feeding and sleeping habits, dogs' walks, dogs' and cats' play activities, litter box management, and cats' lifestyle) experienced changes, but they were not associated with any behavioral issues. On the other hand, the behavioral issues considered for dogs and cats were more frequent BL, which were influenced by the daily management of the pets. The current study showed how critical the attention the owners can provide to the pets could be, to improve their companion animals' welfare. Therefore, it is important to provide pet owners with behavioral management support both during particularly difficult periods such as a lockdown and during regular daily routines.","Platto, Serres, Normando, Wang, Turner","https://doi.org/10.3390/ani12192596","20221014","Wuhan lockdown; cats during the lockdown; dogs during the lockdown; pets during the lockdown in China; petsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ behavioral problems","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39356,""
"Analysis of Food Delivery Using Big Data: Comparative Study before and after COVID-19","This study examined consumers' change in perception related to food delivery using big data before and after the COVID-19 crisis. This study identified words closely associated with the keyword ""food delivery"" based on big data from social media and investigated consumers' perceptions of and needs for food delivery and related issues before and after COVID-19. Results were derived through analysis methods such as text mining analysis, Concor analysis, and sentiment analysis. The research findings can be summarized as follows: In 2019, frequently appearing dining-related words were ""dining-out,"" ""delivery,"" ""famous restaurant,"" ""delivery food,"" ""foundation,"" ""dish,"" ""family order,"" and ""delicious."" In 2021, these words were ""delivery,"" ""delivery food,"" ""famous restaurant,"" ""foundation,"" ""COVID-19,"" ""dish,"" ""order,"" ""application,"" and ""family."" The analysis results for the food delivery sentimental network based on 2019 data revealed discourses revolving around delicious, delivery food, lunch box, and Korean food. For the 2021 data, discourses revolved around delivery food, recommend, and delicious. The emotional analysis, which extracted positive and negative words from the ""food delivery"" search word data, demonstrated that the number of positive keywords decreased by 2.85%, while negative keywords increased at the same rate. In addition, compared to the pre-COVID-19 pandemic era, a weakening trend in positive emotions and an increasing trend in negative emotions were detected after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic; sub-emotions under the positive category (e.g., good feelings, joy, interest) decreased in 2021 compared to 2019, whereas sub-emotions under the negative category (e.g., sadness, fear, pain) increased.","Jang, Lee, Jung","https://doi.org/10.3390/foods11193029","20221014","COVID-19 pandemic; big data; dining out trend; food delivery; social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39357,""

"The Impact of Household Economic Deterioration Caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic and Socioeconomic Status on Suicidal Behaviors in Adolescents: A Cross-sectional Study Using 2020 Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey Data","Economic hardship has a serious impact on adolescents' mental health. The financial impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was more severe for low-income families, and this also impacted adolescents. This study aimed to examine the associations of economic deterioration (ED) caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and low socioeconomic status (SES) with adolescents' suicidal behaviors. This study analyzed data from the 2020 Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey, which included 54 948 middle and high school students. Odds ratios (ORs) of suicidal ideation, suicidal planning, and suicide attempts related to ED and SES were calculated using multivariable logistic regression. We calculated relative excess risks due to interaction to assess additive interactions. The ORs for suicidal ideation, suicidal planning, and suicide attempts related to combined severe ED and low SES were 3.64 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.13 to 4.23), 3.88 (95% CI, 3.09 to 4.88), and 4.27 (95% CI, 3.21 to 5.69), respectively. ED and low SES were significantly associated with suicidal behaviors in adolescents. Although no significant additive interaction was found, the ORs related to suicidal ideation, suicidal planning, and suicide attempts were highest among adolescents from low-income families with severe ED. Special attention is needed for this group, considering the increased impact of economic inequality due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kang, Jeong, Park, Hwang","https://doi.org/10.3961/jpmph.22.241","20221014","Adolescent; COVID-19; Health inequities; Suicidal ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39359,""
"The relationship between changes in exercise habits and psychosomatic activities in older hypertensive patients during the COVID-19 pandemic","We conducted a one-year follow-up study to determine the temporal change in exercise habits and the related factors during the COVID-19 pandemic in older hypertensive patients. A total of 190 patients were 76.1Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.7 years, and 44.7% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°85) were male. One-hundred fifty-one and 138 patients had exercise habits at baseline and a year later, respectively (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.053). We categorized patients based on the change in exercise habits (at baseline/a year later): Group A: +/+ (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°122); Group B: +/- (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°29); Group C: -/+ (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°16); and Group D: -/- (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°23).

"Daily Dynamics of Parental Mental Health: Investigating Depressive Symptoms and Negative Parental Experiences","Background: Investigating psychopathological processes and how these are connected to psychiatric symptoms is important to understand how disorder states emerge and are maintained over time. Focusing on within-person relationships between variables further allows investigation of how these relations on average unfold within individuals. Methods: This preregistered intensive longitudinal study investigates connections between depressive symptoms, psychopathological processes, and negative parental experiences. Daily observations from 1036 parents were retrieved from two 40-day periods during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data was modelled using multilevel dynamic network analysis, unveiling across-day associations and contemporaneous interactions within the same time window. Results: On an across-day basis, helplessness was strongly interwoven with and predictive of the cognitive-affective features of depression and the other psychopathological processes. Being overwhelmed by the parental role (parenting stress) and emotionally drained as a parent (parental burnout) reciprocally reinforced each other from one day to the next, indicating how these components can manifest as a vicious loop over time. Finally, depressive symptomatology and negative parental experiences displayed within-day connections, with emotion regulation difficulties being connected to all parental components. Conclusions: The findings suggest that vicious cycles between helplessness and worthlessness predict the prolonged experience of depressed states in parents and that elevations in parenting stress and parental burnout reinforce each other over time.","Nora Skjerdingstad et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E00EE-6D8-043","20221015","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; depressive symptomatology; daily dynamics; parenting stress; covid-19; negative parental experiences; parental mental health; parental burnout; network analysis","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39370,""
"Measuring Intolerance of Uncertainty after Acquired Brain Injury Part 1: The Factor Structure of the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-12","Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is a risk factor for poor mental health. Acquired brain injury (ABI), such as stroke or traumatic brain injury, often brings considerable uncertainty. This is the first of a two-part investigation of the psychometric properties of the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-12 (IUS-12) in ABI. Here, we evaluate its internal consistency and factor structure in 176 adults with ABI. A two-factor structure (Prospective Anxiety and Inhibitory Anxiety) was superior to a one-factor model. However, some fit statistics were unacceptable. In an exploratory factor analysis, a new two-factor model emerged with a superior fit. A bifactor model provided even better fit, though the sample size precluded exhaustive evaluation. For now, retaining the original Prospective Anxiety and Inhibitory Anxiety subscales is recommended for ABI. IUS-12 scores did not differ pre- or during COVID-19 assessment, suggesting the IUS-12 is measuring individual differences regardless of uncertainty levels.","Andrea Kusec et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0201-F6B-307","20221014","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Clinical Neuropsychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Assessment; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; intolerance of uncertainty; mood disorder; assessment; neurological impairment; acquired brain injury; psychometrics","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","",39371,""
