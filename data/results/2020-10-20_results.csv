"Economic precarity, social isolation, and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic","ImportanceThe US population faces stressors associated with suicide brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding the relationship between stressors and suicidal ideation may inform policies and programs to prevent suicide.

ObjectiveTo evaluate the relationship between stressors and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic.

DesignWe compared suicidal ideation in 2017-2018 to suicidal ideation in 2020. We estimated the association between stressors and suicidal ideation in bivariable and multivariable Poisson regression models with robust variance.

SettingUnited States

ParticipantsParticipants were from two, nationally representative surveys of US adults: The 2017-2017 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the 2020 COVID-19 and Life Stressors Impact on Mental Health and Well-being study (conducted March 31 to April 13), analyzed April 28 to September 30, 2020.

ExposuresEconomic precarity as measured through job loss or difficulty paying rent and social isolation based on reporting ""feeling alone.""

Main outcome measureSuicidal ideation based on reporting ""Thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself in some way"" over the past two weeks.

ResultsSuicidal ideation increased more than fourfold, from 3.4% in the 2017-2018 NHANES to 16.3% in the 2020 CLIMB survey, and from 5.8% to 26.4% among participants in low-income households. Suicidal ideation was more prevalent among people facing difficulty paying rent (31.5%), job loss (24.1%), and loneliness (25.1%), with each stressor associated with suicidal ideation in bivariable models. In the multivariable model, difficulty paying rent was associated with suicidal ideation (aPR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.2 to 2.1), while losing a job was not (aPR: 0.9, 95% CI: 0.6 to 1.2). Feeling alone was associated with suicidal ideation (aPR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.5 to 2.4).

Conclusions and relevanceSuicidal ideation increased more than fourfold during the COVID-19 pandemic. Difficulty paying rent and loneliness were most associated with suicidal ideation. Policies and programs to support people experiencing economic precarity and loneliness may contribute to suicide prevention.","Julia Raifman; Catherine Ettman; Lorraine Dean; Colleen Barry; Sandro Galea","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20205955","20201007","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-20","",6154,""

"Finding the 'right' GP: a qualitative study of the experiences of people with long-COVID","BACKGROUND: An unknown proportion of people who had an apparently mild COVID-19 infection continue to suffer with persistent symptoms, including chest pain, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pains, headaches, cognitive impairment ('brain fog'), and fatigue. Post-acute COVID-19 ('long-COVID') seems to be a multisystem disease, sometimes occurring after a mild acute illness; people struggling with these persistent symptoms refer to themselves as 'long haulers'. AIM: To explore experiences of people with persisting symptoms following COVID-19 infection, and their views on primary care support received. DESIGN & SETTING: Qualitative methodology, with semi-structured interviews to explore perspectives of people with persisting symptoms following suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. Participants were recruited via social media between July-August 2020. METHOD: Interviews were conducted by telephone or video call, digitally recorded, and transcribed with consent. Thematic analysis was conducted applying constant comparison techniques. People with experience of persisting symptoms contributed to study design and data analysis. RESULTS: This article reports analysis of 24 interviews. The main themes include: the ' hard and heavy work ' of enduring and managing symptoms and accessing care; living with uncertainty, helplessness and fear, particularly over whether recovery is possible; the importance of finding the 'right' GP (understanding, empathy, and support needed); and recovery and rehabilitation: what would help? CONCLUSION: This study will raise awareness among primary care professionals, and commissioners, of long-COVID and the range of symptoms people are experiencing. Patients require their GP to believe their symptoms and to demonstrate empathy and understanding. Ongoing support by primary care professionals during recovery and rehabilitation is crucial.","Kingstone, Tom; Taylor, Anna K; O'Donnell, Catherine A; Atherton, Helen; Blane, David N; Chew-Graham, Carolyn A","https://dx.doi.org/10.3399/bjgpopen20X101143","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BJGP Open;2020 Oct 13.; Publication details: BJGP Open;2020 Oct 13.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-20","",6183,""
"Investigation of mental health among hospital workers in the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study","BACKGROUND: The rapid spread of the COVID-19 epidemic has led to extraordinary measures taken worldwide, and has led to serious psychological disorders. Healthcare professionals face greater severity of stress burden, due both to their direct contact with patients with the virus and to the isolation dimension of this outbreak. OBJECTIVE: To examine psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression and sleep disorders among healthcare professionals working in an emergency department and a COVID-19 clinic. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional study including healthcare professionals in the emergency department and other units serving patients with COVID-19, of a training and research hospital in Turkey. METHODS: 210 volunteers, including 105 healthcare professionals in the emergency department and 105 healthcare professionals working in other departments rendering services for COVID-19 patients, were included in this study. A sociodemographic data form and the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HAD), Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), World Health Organization Quality of Life scale (WHOQOL-BREF-TR) and Religious Orientation Scale were applied to the volunteers. RESULTS: The perceived stress levels and PSQI subscores were found to be significantly higher among the volunteers working in the emergency department than among those in other departments. The risk of development of anxiety among women was 16.6 times higher than among men. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare professionals on the frontline need systematic regular psychosocial support mechanisms. Anxiety due to fear of infecting family members can be prevented through precautions such as isolation. However, it should be remembered that loneliness and feelings of missing family members consequent to isolation may increase the risk of depression.","AraÃ§, SongÃ¼l; DÃ¶nmezdil, SÃ¼leyman","http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&nrm=iso&lng=pt&tlng=pt&pid=S1516-31802020005022204","","Country: BR; BRASIL; BRAZIL; BRASIL; BRESIL; BRASILE; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Sao Paulo Med J;2020 Oct 09.; Publication details: Sao Paulo Med J;2020 Oct 09.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-20","",6184,""
"ELSI-COVID-19 initiative: methodology of the telephone survey on coronavirus in the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging","The COVID-19 pandemic (caused by the SARS-CoV-2) is a public health emergency of international concern that particularly affects older people. Brazil is one of the countries most affected by the pandemic, ranking second with the highest number of confirmed cases and deaths worldwide as of mid-June 2020. The ELSI-COVID-19 initiative is based on telephone interviews with participants of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil), conducted on a nationally representative sample of the population aged 50 or older. This initiative aims to provide information on adherence to preventive measures (social distancing, wearing masks, and handwashing/hygiene); reasons for leaving the house, when that was the case; difficulties obtaining medications, medical diagnosis of COVID-19, and receipt of confirmatory results; use of health-care services (recent care-seeking, care-seeking location, care receipt, among other aspects); and mental health (sleep, depression, and loneliness). The first round of telephone interviews was conducted between May 26 and June 8, 2020. The second and third rounds are expected to occur within the coming months. This article presents this initiative methodology and some sociodemographic characteristics of the 6,149 participants in the survey first round, relative the Brazilian population within the same age group.","Lima-Costa, Maria Fernanda; Macinko, James; Andrade, Fabiola Bof de; Souza JÃºnior, Paulo Roberto Borges de; Vasconcellos, MaurÃ­cio Teixeira Leite de; Oliveira, Cesar Messias de","http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&nrm=iso&lng=pt&tlng=pt&pid=S0102-311X2020001506001; http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&nrm=iso&lng=pt&tlng=pt&pid=S0102-311X2020001506001","","Country: BR; BRASIL; BRAZIL; BRASIL; BRESIL; BRASILE; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Cad Saude Publica;36Suppl 3(Suppl 3): e00183120, 2020.; Publication details: Cad Saude Publica;36Suppl 3(Suppl 3): e00183120, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-20","",6185,""

"Coronavirus infection and PARP expression dysregulate the NAD Metabolome: an actionable component of innate immunity","Poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) superfamily members covalently link either a single ADP-ribose (ADPR) or a chain of ADPR units to proteins using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) as the source of ADPR. While the well-known poly-ADP-ribosylating (PARylating) PARPs primarily function in the DNA damage response, many non-canonical mono-ADP-ribosylating (MARylating) PARPs are associated with cellular antiviral responses. We recently demonstrated robust upregulation of several PARPs following infection with Murine Hepatitis Virus (MHV), a model coronavirus. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection strikingly upregulates MARylating PARPs and induces the expression of genes encoding enzymes for salvage NAD synthesis from nicotinamide (NAM) and nicotinamide riboside (NR), while downregulating other NAD biosynthetic pathways. We show that overexpression of PARP10 is sufficient to depress cellular NAD and that the activities of the transcriptionally induced enzymes PARP7, PARP10, PARP12 and PARP14 are limited by cellular NAD and can be enhanced by pharmacological activation of NAD synthesis. We further demonstrate that infection with MHV induces a severe attack on host cell NAD+ and NADP+ Finally, we show that NAMPT activation, NAM and NR dramatically decrease the replication of an MHV virus that is sensitive to PARP activity. These data suggest that the antiviral activities of noncanonical PARP isozyme activities are limited by the availability of NAD, and that nutritional and pharmacological interventions to enhance NAD levels may boost innate immunity to coronaviruses.","Heer, Collin D; Sanderson, Daniel J; Voth, Lynden S; Alhammad, Yousef M O; Schmidt, Mark S; Trammell, Samuel A J; Perlman, Stanley; Cohen, Michael S; Fehr, Anthony R; Brenner, Charles","https://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.RA120.015138","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Biol Chem;2020 Oct 13.; Publication details: J Biol Chem;2020 Oct 13.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-20","",6187,""
"Acute psychological effects of Coronavirus Disease 2019 outbreak among healthcare workers in China: a cross-sectional study","To study the acute psychological effects of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak among healthcare workers (HCWs) in China, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among HCWs during the early period of COVID-19 outbreak. The acute psychological effects including symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire, and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and PTSD was estimated at 15.0%, 27.1%, and 9.8%, respectively. Having an intermediate technical title, working at the frontline, receiving insufficient training for protection, and lacking confidence in protection measures were significantly associated with increased risk for depression and anxiety. Being a nurse, having an intermediate technical title, working at the frontline, and lacking confidence in protection measures were risk factors for PTSD. Meanwhile, not worrying about infection was a protective factor for developing depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Psychological interventions should be implemented among HCWs during the COVID-19 outbreak to reduce acute psychological effects and prevent long-term psychological comorbidities. Meanwhile, HCWs should be well trained and well protected before their frontline exposure.","Wang, Ying; Ma, Simeng; Yang, Can; Cai, Zhongxiang; Hu, Shaohua; Zhang, Bin; Tang, Shiming; Bai, Hanping; Guo, Xin; Wu, Jiang; Du, Hui; Kang, Lijun; Tan, Huawei; Li, Ruiting; Yao, Lihua; Wang, Gaohua; Liu, Zhongchun","https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41398-020-01031-w","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Transl Psychiatry;10(1): 348, 2020 Oct 13.; Publication details: Transl Psychiatry;10(1): 348, 2020 Oct 13.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-20","",6188,""

"Time of isolation, education and gender influence the psychological outcome during COVID-19 lockdown in caregivers of patients with dementia","PURPOSE: The study evaluated the effects of the COVID-19 emergency lockdown on the psychological outcome in caregivers (children or spouses) of patients with dementia and the loss of the welfare services in these patients. METHODS: Zung's depression and anxiety assessment scales and the Perceived Stress Scale were administered by a telephone interview or a self-compilation directly on the online platform. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 239 participants (men = 124; women = 115) with a mean age of 54.4Â years (SD = 12.1). Education was associated with significantly lower overall anxiety and depression scores while days of isolation and female gender were associated with the higher scores.

Many people with dementia were deprived of care services and time of isolation had a significant negative effect on anxiety and depression in caregivers.","Carpinelli Mazzi, Michele; Iavarone, Alessandro; Musella, Caterina; De Luca, Marzia; de Vita, Dalila; Branciforte, Stefano; Coppola, Alessia; Scarpa, Rosa; Raimondo, Sabina; Sorrentino, Sara; Lualdi, Flavia; Postiglione, Alfredo","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s41999-020-00413-z","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Eur Geriatr Med;2020 Oct 14.; Publication details: Eur Geriatr Med;2020 Oct 14.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-20","",6190,""
"Refusals after prehospital administration of naloxone during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objective: To determine if COVID-19 was associated with a change in patient refusals after Emergency Medical Services (EMS) administration of naloxone.Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study in which the incidence of refusals after naloxone administration in a single EMS system were evaluated. The number of refusals after naloxone administration were compared across the before-pandemic interval (01/01/20 to 02/15/20) and the during-pandemic interval (03/16/20 to 04/30/20). For comparison the incidence of all other patient refusals before and during COVID-19 as well as the incidences of naloxone administration before and during COVID-19 were also reported.Results: Prior to the widespread knowledge of the COVID-19 pandemic, 24 of 164 (14.6%) patients who received naloxone via EMS refused transport. During the pandemic, 55 of 153 (35.9%) patients who received naloxone via EMS refused transport. Subjects receiving naloxone during the COVID-19 pandemic were at greater risk of refusal of transport than those receiving naloxone prior to the pandemic (RR =2.45; 95% CI 1.6-3.76). Among those who did not receive naloxone, 2067 of 6956 (29.7%) patients were not transported prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and 2483 of 6016 (41.3%) were not transported during the pandemic. Subjects who did not receive naloxone with EMS were at greater risk of refusal of transport during the COVID-19 pandemic than prior to it (RR =1.39; 95% CI 1.32-1.46).Conclusion: In this single EMS system, more than a two-fold increase in the rate of refusal after non-fatal opioid overdose was observed following the COVID-19 outbreak.","Glenn, Melody J; Rice, Amber D; Primeau, Keith; Hollen, Adrienne; Jado, Isrealia; Hannan, Philipp; McDonough, Sharon; Arcaris, Brittany; Spaite, Daniel W; Gaither, Joshua B","https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10903127.2020.1834656","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Prehosp Emerg Care;: 1-15, 2020 Oct 15.; Publication details: Prehosp Emerg Care;: 1-15, 2020 Oct 15.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-20","",6191,""
"The Resurgence of Cyber Racism During the COVID-19 Pandemic and its Aftereffects: Analysis of Sentiments and Emotions in Tweets","BACKGROUND: With increasing numbers of patients with COVID-19 globally, China and the World Health Organization have been blamed by some for the spread of this disease. Consequently, instances of racism and hateful acts have been reported around the world. When US President Donald Trump used the term ""Chinese Virus,"" this issue gained momentum, and ethnic Asians are now being targeted. The online situation looks similar, with increases in hateful comments and posts. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to analyze the increasing instances of cyber racism during the COVID-19 pandemic, by assessing emotions and sentiments associated with tweets on Twitter. METHODS: In total, 16,000 tweets from April 11-16, 2020, were analyzed to determine their associated sentiments and emotions. Statistical analysis was carried out using R. Twitter API and the sentimentr package were used to collect tweets and then evaluate their sentiments, respectively. This research analyzed the emotions and sentiments associated with terms like ""Chinese Virus,"" ""Wuhan Virus,"" and ""Chinese Corona Virus."" RESULTS: The results suggest that the majority of the analyzed tweets were of negative sentiment and carried emotions of fear, sadness, anger, and disgust. There was a high usage of slurs and profane words. In addition, terms like ""China Lied People Died,"" ""Wuhan Health Organization,"" ""Kung Flu,"" ""China Must Pay,"" and ""CCP is Terrorist"" were frequently used in these tweets. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insight into the rise in cyber racism seen on Twitter.

"Baseline well-being, perceptions of critical incidents, and openness to debriefing in community hospital emergency department clinical staff before COVID-19, a cross-sectional study","BACKGROUND: Emergency department personnel routinely bear witness to traumatic experiences and critical incidents that can affect their own well-being. Peer support through debriefing has demonstrated positive impacts on clinicians' well-being following critical incidents. This study explored community hospital emergency department staff's perceptions of critical incidents, assessed openness to debriefing and measured baseline well-being. Our analysis provides a baseline of provider well-being immediately prior to the local onset of COVID-19. The potential need for additional resources to support frontline providers during the pandemic can be evaluated. METHOD: We conducted a cross-sectional study for 4-weeks prior to the first COVID-19 case in Connecticut using a survey offered to an interprofessional group of emergency department clinical staff. The main outcome measures were the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Professional Quality of Life (ProQOL) scale. Pearson's chi-square test was used to identify significant differences in perceptions of critical incidents and debriefings between professional categories. One-way ANOVA and Tukey's test were used to analyze significant differences in well-being between professional categories. RESULTS: Thirty-nine clinical personnel from St. Vincent's Emergency Department responded to the survey. Events frequently selected as critical incidents were caring for critically ill children (89.7%), mass casualty events (84.6%), and death of a patient (69.2%). Critical incidents were commonly reported (81.6%) as occurring once per week. Additionally, 76.2% of participants reported wanting to discuss a critical incident with their team. Across all respondents, 45.7% scored borderline or abnormal for anxiety, 55.9% scored moderate for burnout, and 55.8% scored moderate to high for secondary traumatic stress. CONCLUSIONS: At baseline, providers reported caring for critically ill children, mass casualty events, and death of a patient as critical incidents, which typically occurred once per week. Death of a patient occurs at increased frequency during the protracted mass casualty experience of COVID-19 and threatens provider well-being. Receptiveness to post-event debriefing is high but the method is still underutilized. With nearly half of staff scoring borderline or abnormal for anxiety, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress at baseline, peer support measures should be implemented to protect frontline providers' well-being during and after the pandemic.","Cantu, Laura; Thomas, Listy","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12873-020-00372-5","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMC Emerg Med;20(1): 82, 2020 Oct 15.; Publication details: BMC Emerg Med;20(1): 82, 2020 Oct 15.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-20","",6193,""
"EMDR in Telemental Health Counseling for Healthcare Workers Caring for COVID-19 Patients: A Pilot Study","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is putting a strain on health systems around the world. Healthcare workers, on the front lines of the epidemic, are facing major and potentially traumatic stressful events, overwhelming their ability to cope and their resources. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article will be to show how the use of the URG-EMDR protocol in a telemental health setting has proven to be feasible and effective in the treatment of a group of healthcare professionals working in nursing homes or hospital services that were highly mobilized during the acute phase of COVID-19. METHOD: 17 participants, registered nurses (N = 7) and licensed practical nurses (N = 10), were remotely treated using the URG-EMDR protocol in a single session. The assessment focused on anxiety and depressive symptoms (HAD scale) and the level of perceived disturbance (SUD). An additional evaluation of the satisfaction with the remote psychotherapy intervention was conducted. RESULTS: As the URG-EMDR protocol has already proven itself during emergency interventions, it is interesting to note that its remote use in the treatment of healthcare providers caring for COVID-19 patients allows for an improvement in the emotional state and a decrease in perceived disturbance, in a single session. This result is maintained 1 week after the intervention, despite the continued professional activities of the participants and the continuity of the event. Moreover, the remote therapy setting was judged satisfactory by the patients, even if it required adjustments and certain recommendations for practice. DISCUSSION: The remote use of the URG-EMDR protocol opens up innovative perspectives for early interventions and the prevention of the development of psychological disorders in the long term following a situation of acute stress.","Tarquinio, Cyril; Brennstuhl, Marie-Jo; Rydberg, Jenny Ann; Bassan, Fanny; Peter, Lydia; Tarquinio, Camille Louise; AuxÃ©mÃ©ry, Yann; Rotonda, Christine; Tarquinio, Pascale","https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01612840.2020.1818014","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Issues Ment Health Nurs;: 1-12, 2020 Oct 14.; Publication details: Issues Ment Health Nurs;: 1-12, 2020 Oct 14.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-20","",6194,""

"Psychological Wellbeing of Vulnerable Children During the COVID-19 Pandemic","A pandemic disaster has specific effects on mental health, however, little is known about those specific effects in children and adolescents. Thus, the aim of this study is to describe the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on a sample of children and adolescents and to compare the results with previous national data and other studies to determine variations. A total of 459 children and adolescents in residential care, foster families, kinship families, or family strengthening programs under SOS Children&amp;rsquo;s Villages Spain were evaluated using the SDQ to measure internalizing and externalizing problems and using KIDSCREEN-10 index to measure heath related quality of life. An independent sample t-test, one-way ANOVA and the chi-square test were used. The children and adolescents in this study had worse psychological wellbeing than those in the 2017 Spanish reference, that is, before the COVID-19 outbreak. Quality of life remained the same. No differences between care modalities were found. It is necessary to monitor the mental health status of children and adolescents to prevent possible problems. Additionally, it is necessary to use well-known assessment instruments because it is essential to have a reference to other situations and populations.","Vallejo-Slocker, Fresneda, Vallejo","https://doi.org/10.7334/psicothema2020.218","20201019","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-20","",6196,""
"How did Different Generations Cope with the COVID-19 Pandemic? Early Stages of the Pandemic in Spain","The World Health Organization has highlighted the importance of studying the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. The aim of this study is to examine the role of age in the early psychological responses to the pandemic in a Spanish community sample, focusing on how different generations coped with it. An online survey was conducted during the early stages of the quarantine. Sociodemographic, health and behavioral variables were compared for five age groups. Mental health was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and psychological impacts were assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). 3,524 participants were included (Mage = 39.24, SDage = 12.00). Participants aged between 18 and 33 years old showed more hyperactivation and evitation, were more depressed, anxious and stressed. Those aged between 26 and 33 years old showed more intrusion. Those aged between 18 and 25 years old suffered more sleep disturbances, claustrophobia and somatization and maintained worse routines. Elderly people showed better psychological responses in general. This study provides initial evidence that the negative psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic hits young people harder. These results should be taken into account when developing specific evidence-based strategies.","Justo-Alonso, GarcÃƒÂ­a-Dantas, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-VÃƒÂ¡zquez, SÃƒÂ¡nchez-MartÃƒÂ­n, Del RÃƒÂ­o-Casanova","https://doi.org/10.7334/psicothema2020.168","20201019","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-20","",6197,""

"Prevalence and risk factors of COVID-19 suicidal behavior in Bangladeshi population: are healthcare professionals at greater risk?","Current COVID-19 researches suggest that both general population and health-care providers (HCPs) are at risk of elevated psychological sufferings including suicidality. However, suicidality has not been addressed properly, although mental health problems are studied globally. Besides, the extreme fear of COVID-19 infection is being existed among the Bangladeshi HCPs, that is reported by a recent patients' suicide because of HCPs treatment negligence. A web-based cross-sectional study was administered through the social media platforms. A total 3,388 respondents took part in the survey (mean age 30.1 Ã‚Â± 6.4 years) among them 834 were frontline HCPs (30.7 Ã‚Â± 5.6 years). The measures included socio-demographics, PPE-related and patient-care related information and a question concerned with the COVID-19 suicidal behavior. About 6.1% of the total participants had suicidal behavior, with no detectable differences within the groups (i.e., general population and HCPs). Regression analysis showed that being female, being divorced, and having no child were emerged as independent predictors for suicidality. There was no significant association between the PPE-related or patient-care related variables and suicidal behavior of the HCPs. Majority of the participants sometimes had fear of death although no significant relation of the factor was found with suicidality. The study can be limited because of its nature (i.e., cross-sectional self-reporting online survey) and not considering non-COVID-19 related suicide risk factors etc. The present findings identified the substantial proportion of the HCPs and general population had COVID 19 related suicidal behavior. It can be used to advocate a large-scale suicide safety plan using a multidisciplinary approach herein.","Mamun, Akter, Zohra, Sakib, Bhuiyan, Banik, Muhit","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05259","20201019","COVID-19 and suicide; Frontline worker's suicide; Health-care professional' suicide; Psychology; Public health; Suicidal behavior; Suicidal ideation; Suicide in Bangladesh","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-20","",6199,""

"Anxiety levels and obsessive compulsion symptoms of pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic","Reliable data regarding maternal mental well-being during the Severe Acute Respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic are scarce. This study aimed to assess the state/trait anxiety and obsessive-compulsive symptoms of pregnant women and compare those with the non-pregnant population using patient-reported validated outcome measures. This prospective case-control study was conducted at a tertiary 'Coronavirus Pandemic Hospital' in Ã„Â°stanbul, Turkey in April, 2020. Pregnant and non-pregnant women were consecutively allocated to two groups regardless of gestational age. The primary outcome was to identify the anxiety levels and obsessive-compulsive symptoms of pregnant women during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic using the State-Trait Anxiety inventory (STAI) and Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive inventory (MOCI), respectively. Two hundred three pregnant women and 101 non-pregnant women were included. The mean STAI-S questionnaire score of pregnant and nonpregnant women was 41.96Ã‚Â±9.15 and 46.62Ã‚Â±12, respectively (p=0.001). The overall incidence of STAI &gt;40 in pregnant and non-pregnant women was 62.6% and 73.3%, respectively. The mean total score of MOCI was 17.9Ã‚Â±6.7 and 15Ã‚Â±6.6 in pregnant and non-pregnant women, respectively. The overall incidence of 30-item-MOCI Ã¢â€°Â¥13.1 in pregnant and non-pregnant women was 61.6% (125/203) and 30.7% (31/103), respectively (p&lt;0.001). State anxiety and obsessive-compulsive symptoms in pregnant women were found increased during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Pregnant women showed more favourable anxiety levels compared with non-pregnant women. These findings can be used to improve the coping skills of pregnant women during the pandemic, to prepare for the post-pandemic period, and to deal with the long-term mental health impact of COVID-19.","Yassa, Yassa, YirmibeÃ…Å¸, Birol, ÃƒÅ“nlÃƒÂ¼, Tekin, Sandal, Mutlu, Ãƒâ€¡avuÃ…Å¸oÃ„Å¸lu, Tug","https://doi.org/10.4274/tjod.galenos.2020.91455","20201019","Anxiety; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; obsessive-compulsion; pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-20","",6201,""

With a case fatality rate of 2.6% (until June 2020) and the social isolation measures enforced on the population, the population's mental health has been affected. We aimed to assess the mental health burden of the Cypriot population during the outbreak and to explore the potential influence factors. Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, we collected data from 216 volunteers regarding demographic data, COVID-19-related knowledge, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and major depressive symptoms. The overall prevalence of GAD and major depressive symptoms of the public were 13.89% and 8.33%, respectively. No demographic had shown any statistical significance with GAD. The younger age group of the study showed a statistically significant association with major depressive symptoms when compared to the adult population in both univariate and multivariable analyses. Our study identified a mental health burden of the Cypriot population, especially the younger age groups. As part of the preparedness for situations as the one we are experiencing and the future impact the pandemic may have on society, interventions should be focused on vulnerable groups of the population to alleviate the psychosocial effects.","Stylianou, Samouti, Samoutis","https://doi.org/10.25122/jml-2020-0114","20201019","COVID-19; Cyprus; anxiety; depressive symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-20","",6202,""

"&quot;<i>AndrÃƒ tutto bene</i>&quot;: Associations Between Character Strengths, Psychological Distress and Self-efficacy During Covid-19 Lockdown","The Covid-19 pandemic obliged people around the world to stay home and self-isolate, with a number of negative psychological consequences. This study focuses on the protective role of character strengths in sustaining mental health and self-efficacy during lockdown. Data were collected from 944 Italian respondents (mean ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°37.24Ã‚Â years, SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°14.50) by means of an online survey investigating character strengths, psychological distress and Covid-19-related self-efficacy one month after lockdown began. Using principal component analysis, four strengths factors were extracted, namely transcendence, interpersonal, openness and restraint. Regression models with second-order factors showed that transcendence strengths had a strong inverse association with psychological distress, and a positive association with self-efficacy. Regression models with single strengths identified hope, zest, prudence, love and forgiveness as the strengths most associated with distress, love and zest as the most related to self-efficacy and zest to general mental health. Openness factor and appreciation of beauty showed an unexpected direct relation with psychological distress. These results provide original evidence of the association of character strengths, and transcendence strengths in particular, with mental health and self-efficacy in a pandemic and are discussed within the field of positive psychology.","Casali, Feraco, Ghisi, Meneghetti","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10902-020-00321-w","20201019","COVID-19; Character strengths; Lockdown; Psychological distress; Psychological impact; Self-efficacy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-20","",6205,""
"Colorectal Services in Covid-19 Times: Minimally Invasive Surgery and Enhanced Recovery, the Need of the Hour","The health services across the world have been deeply impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic which has resulted in diversion of resources to testing, isolating and treating COVID-19 patients. This meant cutting down resources and manpower away of various healthcare facilities and severely hampering the functioning of various cancer services across the world. It is however, important to understand, cancer itself is a life-threatening condition, and there is a need to continue running cancer care services, at least for those who needed the most. Various clinical societies have put forward guidelines and protocols to help continue surgical services during the pandemic. The role of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) was initially questioned at the start of the pandemic, however gradually increasing evidence favored MIS as it reduced hospital stay and complication. Enhanced recovery programs which have been introduced to various fields of surgery to improve outcomes and reduce hospital stay. It plays an essential role in times like this, where the optimal usage of minimal resources is essential. We embraced these methods to ensure safety of our patients and staff and at the same time provide the highest standards of care.

"Stroke Care Trends During COVID-19 Pandemic in Zanjan Province, Iran From the CASCADE Initiative: Statistical Analysis Plan and Preliminary Results","The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted global healthcare systems and this may affect stroke care and outcomes. This study examines the changes in stroke epidemiology and care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Zanjan Province, Iran. This study is part of the CASCADE international initiative. From February 18, 2019, to July 18, 2020, we followed ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke hospitalization rates and outcomes in Valiasr Hospital, Zanjan, Iran. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model and an interrupted time series analysis (ITS) to identify changes in stroke hospitalization rate, baseline stroke severity [measured by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)], disability [measured by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS)], presentation time (last seen normal to hospital presentation), thrombolytic therapy rate, median door-to-needle time, length of hospital stay, and in-hospital mortality. We compared in-hospital mortality between study periods using Cox-regression model. During the study period, 1,026 stroke patients were hospitalized. Stroke hospitalization rates per 100,000 population decreased from 68.09 before the pandemic to 44.50 during the pandemic, with a significant decline in both Bayesian [Beta: -1.034; Standard Error (SE): 0.22, 95% CrI: -1.48, -0.59] and ITS analysis (estimate: -1.03, SEÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.24, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.0001). Furthermore, we observed lower admission rates for patients with mild (NIHSSÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 5) ischemic stroke (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.0001). Although, the presentation time and door-to-needle time did not change during the pandemic, a lower proportion of patients received thrombolysis (-10.1%; pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.004). We did not see significant changes in admission rate to the stroke unit and in-hospital mortality rate; however, disability at discharge increased (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.0001). In Zanjan, Iran, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted stroke outcomes and altered the delivery of stroke care. Observed lower admission rates for milder stroke may possibly be due to fear of exposure related to COVID-19. The decrease in patients treated with thrombolysis and the increased disability at discharge may indicate changes in the delivery of stroke care and increased pressure on existing stroke acute and subacute services. The results of this research will contribute to a similar analysis of the larger CASCADE dataset in order to confirm findings at a global scale and improve measures to ensure the best quality of care for stroke patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ghoreishi, Arsang-Jang, Sabaa-Ayoun, Yassi, Sylaja, Akbari, Divani, Biller, Phan, Steinwender, Silver, Zand, Basri, Iqbal, Ranta, Ruland, Macri, Ma, Nguyen, Abootalebi, Gupta, Alet, Lattanzi, Desai, Gagliardi, Girotra, Inoue, Yoshimoto, Isaac, Mayer, Morovatdar, Nilanont, Nobleza, Saber, Kamenova, Kondybayeva, Krupinski, Siegler, Stranges, Torbey, Yorio, ZurrÃƒÂº, Rubinos, Shahripour, Borhani-Haghighi, Napoli, Azarpazhooh","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2020.105321","20201019","COVID-19; Disability; Epidemiology; Mortality; Outcome; Stroke; Stroke care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-20","",6211,""
"The Needle in the Haystack: Identifying Credible Mobile Health Apps for Pediatric Populations during a Pandemic and beyond","The COVID-19 pandemic has ignited wider clinical adoption of digital health tools, including mobile health apps (mHealth apps), to address mental and behavioral health concerns at a distance. While mHealth apps offer many compelling benefits, identifying effective apps in the crowded and largely unregulated marketplace is laborious. Consumer demand and industry productivity are increasing, although research is slower, making it challenging for providers to determine the most credible and safe apps for patients in need. This commentary offers a practical, empirically guided framework and associated resources for selecting appropriate mHealth apps for pediatric populations during the pandemic and beyond. In the first stage, Narrow the target problem, end user, and contender apps. Beginning the search with continuously updated websites that contain expert app ratings can help expedite this process (e.g., Psyberguide). Second, Explore each contender app's: (a) scientific and theoretical support (e.g., are app components consistent with health behavior change theories?), (b) privacy policies, and (c) user experience (e.g., through crowdsourcing feedback about app usability and appeal via social media). Third, use clinical expertise and stakeholder feedback to Contextualize whether the selected app is a good fit for a particular patient and/or caregiver (e.g., by considering age, race/ethnicity, ability, gender, sexual orientation, technology access), including conducting a brief self-pilot of the app. Youth are increasingly turning to technology for support, especially during the pandemic, and pediatric psychologists must be primed to recommend the most credible tools. We offer additional recommendations for rapidly disseminating evidence-based apps to the public.","Psihogios, Stiles-Shields, Neary","https://doi.org/10.1093/jpepsy/jsaa094","20201017","chronic illness; computer applications/eHealth; health behavior; mental health; professional and training issues","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-20","",6212,""
"Parenting-Related Exhaustion During the Italian COVID-19 Lockdown","Worldwide, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has generated significant worry, uncertainty, anxiety, sadness, and loneliness. In Italy, these effects have been particularly pronounced. While research on the COVID-19 outbreak has mainly focused on the clinical features of infected patients and the psychological impact on the general population and health professionals, no investigation has yet assessed the psychological impact of the pandemic on parents. In the present research, we conducted a web-based survey of Italian parents to examine the prevalence of parenting-related exhaustion-and to identify its associated risk and protective factors-4Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks into the lockdown. A total of 1,226 parents provided their consent to participate in the study and completed a demographic questionnaire, information relating to particular COVID-19 experiences, and measures of emotional exhaustion, parental resilience, social connections, and psychological distress during the lockdown. Seventeen percent of our sample experienced significant parenting-related exhaustion, with mothers more severely affected. Multiple regression analyses showed that greater parenting-related exhaustion was predicted by psychological distress, lower parental resilience, motherhood, fewer perceived social connections, and being single, as well as having a child with special needs, having a large number of children, and having younger children. The findings add further support to the call for preventive programs to support parents throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health professionals and social workers should be warned of the effects of lockdown and social distancing on parenting and, consequently, the well-being of children.","Marchetti, Fontanesi, Mazza, Di Giandomenico, Roma, Verrocchio","https://doi.org/10.1093/jpepsy/jsaa093","20201017","parent stress; resilience; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-20","",6213,""
"Women's mental health: acute impact of COVID-19 pandemic on domestic violence","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic created a situation of general distress. Although the focus has been initially more on the physical health during the pandemic, mental health concerns linked to the lockdown have quickly risen. This study aims to assess the effect of the COVID-19-related lockdown on Tunisian women's mental health and gender-based violence. An online survey was conducted, using the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21) and the Facebook Bergen Addiction Scale (FBAS). We chose a female-exclusive social group on Facebook and used the snowball sampling method. A total of 751 participants originating from all the Tunisian regions completed the questionnaire. More than half of the participants (57.3%) reported extremely severe distress symptoms, as per the DASS-21. Those who had a history of mental illness and who were allegedly abused during lockdown were found to have more severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Around 40% of women reported problematic social media use. Violence against women also reportedly increased significantly during the lockdown (from 4.4 to 14.8%; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Psychological abuse was the most frequent type of violence (96%). Women who had experienced abuse before the lockdown were at an increased risk of violence during lockdown (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001; ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°19.34 [8.71-43.00]). To our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluates the acute impact of COVID-19 on mental health and violence against women in Tunisia, Africa, and the Arab world. It may be a sound basis for developing a more effective psychological intervention aimed at women in these regions.","Sediri, Zgueb, Ouanes, Ouali, Bourgou, Jomli, Nacef","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00737-020-01082-4","20201017","Anxiety; Coronavirus; Depression; Gender-based violence; Quarantine; Spouse abuse","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-20","",6214,""
"Undergraduate Neuroscience Education: Meeting the Challenges of the 21Ã¢â‚¬â€°st Century","The dedication of undergraduate neuroscience faculty to their students could not have been more evident than what these educators demonstrated when the COVID-19 pandemic impacted colleges and universities across the United States. These faculty faced the crisis head-on to provide their students with exceptional instruction in virtual formats that many faculty had never used for instruction before the pandemic. This same tenacious attitude has been reflected in pedagogical efforts that undergraduate neuroscience faculty have undertaken since the mid-1990s. The challenges of providing cutting-edge neuroscience education to undergraduates in a dynamic field have produced a series of curricular designs and approaches that capitalize on discipline-based education research. This article reviews curricular models and pedagogical strategies aimed at enhancing the educational experiences of undergraduate neuroscience students whose lived experiences and academic backgrounds reflect the richly kaleidoscopic demographics of college students in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.

"Does the COVID-19 pandemic impact parents' and adolescents' well-being? An EMA-study on daily affect and parenting","Due to the COVID- 19 outbreak in the Netherlands (March 2020) and the associated social distancing measures, families were enforced to stay at home as much as possible. Adolescents and their families may be particularly affected by this enforced proximity, as adolescents strive to become more independent. Yet, whether these measures impact emotional well-being in families with adolescents has not been examined. In this ecological momentary assessment study, we investigated if the COVID-19 pandemic affected positive and negative affect of parents and adolescents and parenting behaviors (warmth and criticism). Additionally, we examined possible explanations for the hypothesized changes in affect and parenting. To do so, we compared daily reports on affect and parenting that were gathered during two periods of 14 consecutive days, once before the COVID-19 pandemic (2018-2019) and once during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multilevel analyses showed that only parents' negative affect increased as compared to the period before the pandemic, whereas this was not the case for adolescents' negative affect, positive affect and parenting behaviors (from both the adolescent and parent perspective). In general, intolerance of uncertainty was linked to adolescents' and parents' negative affect and adolescents' positive affect. However, Intolerance of uncertainty, nor any pandemic related characteristics (i.e. living surface, income, relatives with COVID-19, hours of working at home, helping children with school and contact with COVID-19 patients at work) were linked to the increase of parents' negative affect during COVID-19. It can be concluded that on average, our sample (consisting of relatively healthy parents and adolescents) seems to deal fairly well with the circumstances. The substantial heterogeneity in the data however, also suggest that whether or not parents and adolescents experience (emotional) problems can vary from household to household. Implications for researchers, mental health care professionals and policy makers are discussed.","Janssen, Kullberg, Verkuil, van Zwieten, Wever, van Houtum, Wentholt, Elzinga","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0240962","20201019","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-20","",6216,""
"Association between opioid dose escalation and time to death in a comfort measures only population","In an effort to expedite the publication of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AJHP is posting these manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance. Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. Opioids are crucial to the relief of pain and dyspnea experienced by patients dying in the hospital setting; however, there are concerns about the association of opioid dosage with hastened death via opioid-induced respiratory depression, and there is little published evidence regarding the association between opioid dose escalation and time to death in the inpatient comfort measures only (CMO) population. The medical records of adult patients admitted to 2 hospitals who had an active CMO order at the time of death and received opioid dose escalations after CMO pronouncement were assessed in a retrospective cohort study. Patients were categorized into higher and lower opioid dose escalation groups according to an institutional palliative care symptom guide. A Cox proportional hazards model was constructed to test the associations between dose escalation group, patient sex, opioid naivety, palliative care consultation, and opioid dosage after CMO pronouncement (independent variables) and time to death (dependent variable). In the 71-patient cohort, 39 patients (54.9%) were male and 32 (45.1%) were female. The mean (SD) age of patients was 67.2 (16.6) years. Higher dose escalation (n = 46, 64.8%) was associated with a nonsignificant decrease in survival time compared to lower dose escalation (n = 25, 35.2%), with a mean difference in time to death of 19.8 hours (hazard ratio [HR], 1.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94-2.97). Receipt of a palliative care consult (n = 56, 78.9%) during the final hospital visit was associated with increased survival time (mean difference, 20.1 hours; HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.16-0.63). Time to death in an inpatient CMO population was not significantly associated with the degree of opioid dose escalation.","Abraham, Hernandez, Ayers, Pruskowski","https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/zxaa367","20201016","death; end-of-life care; opioid; pain; pain management; palliative care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-20","",6217,""
"Suicide Prevention in the COVID-19 Era: Transforming Threat Into Opportunity","Suicide, a leading cause of death with devastating emotional and societal costs, is a generally preventable cause of death and a critical global public health issue. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may increase the risk of population suicide through its effects on a number of well-established suicide risk factors. Prior to the pandemic, many countries were engaging in suicide prevention strategies, and although the overall global burden of suicide deaths has increased, some national efforts were beginning to see positive results. Additionally, the gap between mental health needs and services has been increasing in many nations. With the added physical and mental health, social, and economic burdens imposed by the pandemic, many populations worldwide may experience increased suicide risk. Data and recent events during the first 6 months of the pandemic reveal specific effects on suicide risk. However, increases in suicide rates are not a foregone conclusion even with the negative effects of the pandemic. In fact, emerging suicide data from several countries show no evidence of an increase in suicide during the pandemic thus far. There are actionable steps that policy makers, health care leaders, and organizational leaders can take to mitigate suicide risk during and after the pandemic. COVID-19 presents a new and urgent opportunity to focus political will, federal investments, and global community on the vital imperative of suicide prevention. Suicide prevention in the COVID-19 era requires addressing not only pandemic-specific suicide risk factors, but also prepandemic risk factors. This Special Communication provides prioritized, evidence-based strategies for clinicians and health care delivery systems, along with national and local policy and educational initiatives tailored to the COVID-19 environment. If implemented to scale, these interventions could significantly mitigate the pandemic's negative effects on suicide risk.","Moutier","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2020.3746","20201016","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-20","",6218,""
"[Mental Health and COVID-19 in children and adolescents: psychopathologycal and Public Health approach]","The pandemic produced by COVID-19 has a significant impact on society and has also affected childhood and adolescence, which, in general, has been the most silenced group. This article addresses the contents that affect the mental health of children and adolescents in the heart of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is located in the &quot;fourth wave of care&quot; in category F54 of the ICD-10 (&quot;Behavioral and psychological factors in disorders or diseases classified elsewhere&quot;). The presentation mechanism is: reactive-adaptive to the pandemic; triggering factor, before a previous affective-emotional instability; decompensation of a pre-existing process. The clinical features have had their initial phase, fundamentally, in confinement: somatoform disorders, behavioral disorders, emotional symptoms, reactivation of child abuse and dysfunctional grief reactions. The most prevalent symptoms are of the anxious or anxious-depressive type. The response to chronic stress, including that of low profile and intensity but maintained over time, has significant repercussions for childhood and adolescence. Few percentage that present prominent mental disorders, but we must recognize that when projected to the whole the child-adolescent population, there could be a significant number that could be subsidiary of a more specific help. The return to schooling is going to represent another important moment, the repercussions of confinement being of capital importance, especially in terms of addictive behaviors with information and communication technologies. Intervention by professionals trained in childhood and adolescent mental health is a priority to avoid unwanted clinical evolutions or iatrogenesis.

"The Impact of Infectious Disease-Related Public Health Emergencies on Suicide, Suicidal Behavior, and Suicidal Thoughts","<b/><i>Background:</i> Infectious disease-related public health emergencies (epidemics) may increase suicide risk, and high-quality evidence is needed to guide an international response. <i>Aims:</i> We investigated the potential impacts of epidemics on suicide-related outcomes. <i>Method:</i> We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, PsyArXiv, medRxiv, and bioRxiv from inception to May 13-16, 2020. Inclusion criteria: primary studies, reviews, and meta-analyses; reporting the impact of epidemics; with a primary outcome of suicide, suicidal behavior, suicidal ideation, and/or self-harm. Exclusion criteria: not concerned with suicide-related outcomes; not suitable for data extraction. PROSPERO registration: #CRD42020187013. <i>Results:</i> Eight primary papers were included, examining the effects of five epidemics on suicide-related outcomes. There was evidence of increased suicide rates among older adults during SARS and in the year following the epidemic (possibly motivated by social disconnectedness, fears of virus infection, and concern about burdening others) and associations between SARS/Ebola exposure and increased suicide attempts. A preprint study reported associations between COVID-19 distress and past-month suicidal ideation. <i>Limitations:</i> Few studies have investigated the topic; these are of relatively low methodological quality. <i>Conclusion:</i> Findings support an association between previous epidemics and increased risk of suicide-related outcomes. Research is needed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on suicide outcomes.","Zortea, Brenna, Joyce, McClelland, Tippett, Tran, Arensman, Corcoran, Hatcher, Heise, Links, O'Connor, Edgar, Cha, Guaiana, Williamson, Sinyor, Platt","https://doi.org/10.1027/0227-5910/a000753","20201016","COVID-19; epidemics; pandemics; self-harm; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-20","",6220,""

"Delayed Development of Coronary Artery Dilitation in Suspected Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome: More Research Needed","Although significant disease burden in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic has been relatively uncommon in children, worldwide cases of a postinfectious multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and possible atypical Kawasaki-like disease attributing to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection have arisen. Original thinking for coronavirus disease-19 disease was that an overwhelming proinflammatory response drove disease pathogenesis. Emerging reports suggest that a robust immune suppression may be more relevant and predominant. Recently reported data on children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children have demonstrated a heterogeneity of immune phenotypes among these patients, with concern for a strong initial proinflammatory state; however, data are lacking to support this. Likewise, understanding development of certain clinical findings to changes in the immune system is lacking. We report a 12-year-old multiracial male with negative coronavirus disease-19 nasopharyngeal RNA polymerase chain reaction testing but positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 serology, subsequent development of vasodilatory shock with myocardial depression, and subsequent delayed development of coronary artery dilatation after resolution of myocardial depression. Unlike previous reported cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, he exhibited profound lymphopenia without specific inflammatory cytokines elevations, whereas nonspecific markers (ferritin and C-reactive protein) were increased. He subsequently was discharged on day 12 of hospitalization with complete recovery. Our representative case of a patient with coronavirus disease-19-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children without robust hyperinflammation and a delayed finding of coronary artery dilatation compared with reported case series highlights the need for further mechanistic understanding of coronavirus disease-19 disease and subsequent multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children or Kawasaki disease development. This report offers a number of disease mechanisms and clinical evolution considerations for further elucidation to guide development of potential therapies.","Orr, Elward, Lin, Reich, Scheel, Hayes, Remy","https://doi.org/10.1097/CCE.0000000000000236","20201016","Kawasaki disease; coronavirus disease-19; immune suppression; multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children; research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-20","",6222,""
"Can a 'second disaster' during and after the COVID-19 pandemic be mitigated?","In most disasters that have been studied, the underlying dangerous cause does not persist for very long. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic a progressively emerging life threat remains, exposing everyone to varying levels of risk of contracting the illness, dying, or infecting others. Distancing and avoiding company have a great impact on social life. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has an enormous economic impact for many losing work and income, which is even affecting basic needs such as access to food and housing. In addition, loss of loved ones may compound the effects of fear and loss of resources. The aim of this paper is to distil, from a range of published literature, lessons from past disasters to assist in mitigating adverse psychosocial reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic. European, American, and Asian studies of disasters show that long-term social and psychological consequences of disasters may compromise initial solidarity. Psychosocial disruptions, practical and financial problems, and complex community and political issues may then result in a 'second disaster'. Lessons from past disasters suggest that communities and their leaders, as well as mental healthcare providers, need to pay attention to fear regarding the ongoing threat, as well as sadness and grief, and to provide hope to mitigate social disruption. En la mayorÃƒÂ­a de los desastres que han sido estudiados, la causa subyacente que genera el peligro no persiste por mucho tiempo. Sin embargo, durante la pandemia COVID-19 una amenaza a la vida progresivamente emergente es mantenida, exponiendo a todos a variados niveles de riesgo de contraer la enfermedad, morir o infectar a otros. Distanciarse y evitar la compaÃƒÂ±ÃƒÂ­a tiene un gran impacto en la vida social. AdemÃƒÂ¡s, la pandemia COVID-19 tiene un impacto econÃƒÂ³mico enorme para muchos por la pÃƒÂ©rdida de trabajos e ingreso, lo que estÃƒÂ¡ incluso afectando las necesidades bÃƒÂ¡sicas como la comida o la vivienda. En adiciÃƒÂ³n a esto, la pÃƒÂ©rdida de seres queridos puede agravar los efectos del miedo y la pÃƒÂ©rdida de recursos. El objetivo de este artÃƒÂ­culo es sintetizar a partir de una variedad de literatura publicada, lecciones de desastres pasados para ayudar a mitigar las reacciones psicosociales adversas a la pandemia COVID-19. Trabajos europeos, americanos y asiÃƒÂ¡ticos sobre desastres muestran que las consecuencias a largo plazo tanto sociales como econÃƒÂ³micas de los desastres pueden poner en peligro la solidaridad inicial. Las disrupciones psicosociales, los problemas prÃƒÂ¡cticos y financieros, y los complejos problemas comunitarios y polÃƒÂ­ticos pueden resultar en un Ã¢â‚¬ËœSegundo desastreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Las lecciones de desastres pasados sugieren que las comunidades, sus lÃƒÂ­deres y tambiÃƒÂ©n los proveedores de atenciÃƒÂ³n en salud mental necesitan prestar atenciÃƒÂ³n al miedo en relaciÃƒÂ³n a la amenaza en curso, asÃƒÂ­ como a la tristeza y al duelo, y proveer esperanza para mitigar la disrupciÃƒÂ³n social.

"How to communicate with families living in complete isolation","During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a complete physical isolation has been worldwide introduced. The impossibility of visiting their loved ones during the hospital stay causes additional distress for families: in addition to the worries about clinical recovery, they may feel exclusion and powerlessness, anxiety, depression, mistrust in the care team and post-traumatic stress disorder. The impossibility of conducting the daily meetings with families poses a challenge for healthcare professionals. This paper aims to delineate and share consensus statements in order to enable healthcare team to provide by telephone or video calls an optimal level of communication with patient's relatives under circumstances of complete isolation. PubMed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts and Reviews of Effectiveness and the AHCPR Clinical Guidelines and Evidence Reports were explored from 1999 to 2019. Exclusion criteria were: poor or absent relevance regarding the aim of the consensus statements, studies prior to 1999, non-English language. Since the present pandemic context is completely new, unexpected and unexplored, there are not randomised controlled trials regarding clinical communication in a setting of complete isolation. Thus, a multiprofessional taskforce of physicians, nurses, psychologists and legal experts, together with some family members and former intensive care unit patients was established by four Italian national scientific societies. Using an e-Delphi methodology, general and specific questions were posed, relevant topics were argumented, until arriving to delineate position statements and practical checklist, which were set and evaluated through an evidence-based consensus procedure. Ten statements and two practical checklists for phone or video calls were drafted and evaluated; they are related to who, when, why and how family members must be given clinical information under circumstances of complete isolation. The statements and the checklists offer a structured methodology in order to ensure a good-quality communication between healthcare team and family members even in isolation, confirming that time dedicated to communication has to be intended as a time of care.","Mistraletti, Gristina, Mascarin, Iacobone, Giubbilo, Bonfanti, Fiocca, Fullin, Fuselli, Bocci, Mazzon, Giusti, Galazzi, Negro, De Iaco, Gandolfo, Lamiani, Del Negro, Monti, Salvago, Di Leo, Gribaudi, Piccinni, Riccioni, Giannini, Livigni, Maglione, Vergano, Marinangeli, Lovato, Mezzetti, Drigo, Vegni, Calva, Aprile, Losi, Fontanella, Calegari, Ansaloni, Pugliese, Manca, Orsi, Moggia, Scelsi, Corcione, Petrini","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjspcare-2020-002633","20201016","communication; family management; hospital care; psychological care; social care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-20","",6226,""
"Post-traumatic growth and influencing factors among frontline nurses fighting against COVID-19","To explore the level and influencing factors of frontline nurses' post-traumatic growth (PTG) during COVID-19 epidemic. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in February 2020 in three hospitals in China. The Post-traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) was used to investigate the PTG of frontline nurses. Data on related factors, including demographic characteristics and subjective variables, were collected. The Event-Related Rumination Inventory was used to assess rumination. Pearson's or Spearman's correlation was calculated for bivariate analysis. Independent sample t-tests or one-way analysis of variance and multiple linear regression analysis were used to examine the related factors. A total of 179 frontline nurses were recruited, and 167 were included in the analyses. The mean PTG score was 70.53Ã‚Â±17.26. The bivariate analyses showed that deliberate rumination was modestly positively correlated with PTG (r=0.557, p&lt;0.01), while intrusive rumination had a modest negative correlation with PTG (r=-0.413, p&lt;0.01). Multiple linear regression demonstrated that working years, self-confidence in frontline work, awareness of risk, psychological intervention or training during the epidemic and deliberate rumination were the main influencing factors of PTG among frontline nurses and accounted for 42.5% of the variance (F=31.626, p&lt;0.001). The PTG of frontline nurses was at a medium to high level and was influenced by working years, self-confidence in frontline work, awareness of risk, psychological intervention or training and deliberate rumination. It is necessary to strengthen psychological guidance and training for frontline nurses and promote their deliberate rumination on epidemic events to improve their PTG.","Cui, Wang, Wang, Ping, Wang, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1136/oemed-2020-106540","20201016","cross sectional studies; epidemiology; health care workers; mental health; rehabilitation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-20","",6227,""
"The effect of the severity COVID-19 infection on electrocardiography","Acute myocardial damage is detected in a significant portion of patients with coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) infection, with a reported prevalence of 7-28%. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between electrocardiographic findings and the indicators of the severity of COVID-19 detected on electrocardiography (ECG). A total of 219 patients that were hospitalized due to COVID-19 between April 15 and May 5, 2020 were enrolled in this study. Patients were divided into two groups according to the severity of COVID-19 infection: severe (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 95) and non-severe (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 124). ECG findings at the time of admission were recorded for each patient. Clinical characteristics and laboratory findings were retrieved from electronic medical records. Mean age was 65.2Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 13.8Ã‚Â years in the severe group and was 57.9Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 16.0Ã‚Â years in the non-severe group. ST depression (28% vs. 14%), T-wave inversion (29% vs. 16%), ST-T changes (36% vs. 21%), and the presence of fragmented QRS (fQRS) (17% vs. 7%) were more frequent in the severe group compared to the non-severe group. Multivariate analysis revealed that hypertension (odds ratio [OR]: 2.42, 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.03-5.67; pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.041), the severity of COVID-19 infection (OR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.09-2.65; pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.026), presence of cardiac injury (OR: 3.32, 95% CI: 1.45-7.60; pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.004), and d-dimer (OR: 3.60, 95% CI: 1.29-10.06; pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.014) were independent predictors of ST-T changes on ECG. ST depression, T-wave inversion, ST-T changes, and the presence of fQRS on admission ECG are closely associated with the severity of COVID-19 infection.","Barman, Atici, Alici, Sit, Tugrul, Gungor, Okuyan, Sahin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.10.005","20201016","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-20","",6228,""
"[COV IMPACT: Stress exposure analysis among hospital staff in 2Ã‚Â hospitals in France during the COVID-19Ã‚Â pandemic]","The COVID-19Ã‚Â pandemic has swept through our hospitals which have had to adapt as a matter of urgency. We are aware that a health crisis of this magnitude is likely to generate mental disorders particularly affecting exposed healthcare workers. Being so brutal and global, this one-of the kind pandemic has been impacting the staff in their professional sphere but also within their private circle. The COV IMPACT study is an early assessment survey conducted for 2 weeks in May 2020, of the perception by all hospital workers of the changes induced in their professional activity by the pandemic. The study was carried out by a survey sent to the hospital staff of BÃƒÂ©ziers and Montfermeil. The readjusted working conditions were source of increased physical fatigue for 62 % of the respondents. Moral exhaustion was reported by 36 %. It was related to the stress of contracting the infection (72 %) but above all of transmitting it to relatives (89 %) with a broad perception of a vital risk (41 %). This stress affected all socio-professional categories (CSP) and was independent of exposure to COVID. Change in organisation, lack of information and protective gear and equipment were major factors of insecurity at the start of the epidemic. Work on supportive measures is necessary. It should focus on the spread of information, particularly towards the youngest, as well as bringing more psychological support and a larger amount of medical equipment, beyond healthcare workers and the COVID sectors.","Georger, Dos Santos, Gazagne, BerdaguÃƒÂ©, Saib, Nahon, Piquet, Amara","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ancard.2020.09.005","20201016","Anxiety; AnxiÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ©; COVID-19; Health professionals; Mental health; Post-traumatic stress disorder; Professionnels de santÃƒÂ©; SARS-COV-2; SantÃƒÂ© mentale; Stress; Trouble de stress post-traumatique","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-20","",6229,""
"Glitches in the utilization of telehealth in pediatric rheumatology patients during the COVID-19 pandemic","Telehealth is an extraordinary advancement of modern medicine. It has increased access to care for underserved populations and, in the case of pediatric rheumatology, has expanded the reach of a limited work force. During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, telehealth has radically changed the way healthcare workers have been able to deliver care while maintaining social distance. In addition to the infectious havoc of COVID-19, the pandemic has further altered the psychosocial milleu of our society which directly impacts the wellness and safety of our pediatric rheumatology patients. These psychosocial factors may be difficult to assess and triage solely using telehealth.

"Cardiac Complications Attributed to Hydroxychloroquine: A systematic review of the Literature Pre-COVID-19","Hydroxychloroquine has been used for rheumatological diseases for many decades and is considered a safe medication. With the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been an increase in reports associating cardiotoxicity with hydroxychloroquine. It is unclear if cardiotoxic profile of hydroxychloroquine is previously underreported in the literature, or a new manifestation of COVID-19 and therapeutic interventions. This manuscript evaluates the incidence of cardiotoxicity associated with hydroxychloroquine prior to onset of COVID-19. PubMED, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched for keywords derived from MeSH terms, prior to 4/9/2020. Inclusion eligibility was based on appropriate reporting of cardiac conditions and study design. Sixty-nine articles were identified (58 case reports, 11 case series). Majority (84%) of patients were female, with a median age of 49.2(range 16-92) years. Fifteen of 185 patients with cardiotoxic events were in the setting of acute intentional overdose. In acute overdose, the median ingestion was 17,857 Ã¯â€šÂ± 14,873 mg. Two of 15 patients died after acute intoxication. In patients with long-term hydroxychloroquine use (10.5 Ã‚Â± 8.9 years), new onset systolic heart failure occurred in 54 of 155 patients (35%) with median cumulative ingestion of 1,493,800 Ã‚Â± 995,517 mg. The majority of patients improved with withdrawal of hydroxychloroquine and standard therapy. Millions of hydroxychloroquine doses are prescribed annually. Prior to COVID-19 pandemic, cardiac complications attributed to hydroxychloroquine were uncommon. Further studies are needed to understand the impact of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system to understand presence or absence of potential medication interactions with hydroxychloroquine in this new pathophysiological state.","Fram, Wang, Malette, Villablanca, Kang, So, Basir, Khan, McKinnon, Zervos, O'Neill","https://doi.org/10.2174/1573403X16666201014144022","20201016","Clinical cardiology; SLE.; cardiac complications; covid-19; hydroxychloroquine; infectious disease","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-20","",6231,""
"Regional differences in access to the outdoors and outdoor play of Canadian children and youth during the COVID-19 outbreak","To reduce the spread of COVID-19, public health authorities across the country have recommended that Canadians keep their distance, wash their hands, and stay home. To enforce these measures, restrictions on outdoor behaviour have been implemented, limiting access to parks and recreational outdoor spaces. New evidence shows that COVID-19 restrictions are associated with an overall lower amount of time spent in outdoor play among Canadian children and youth. This is concerning, as outdoor play is important for children's physical and mental health and helps provide them with a sense of control during times of uncertainty and stress. As policies on access to the outdoors during the COVID-19 outbreak vary by province, it is possible that policy differences have led to regional differences in changes in outdoor play among children and youth. In this commentary, we examine regional differences in outdoor play among children and youth across Canada, and the association between provincial policies related to COVID-19 and outdoor play. We argue that through the recovery process, in the event of a second wave of infections, and in preparing for future public health challenges, policy decisions should consider ways to preserve outdoor play for Canadian children and youth.","de Lannoy, Rhodes, Moore, Faulkner, Tremblay","https://doi.org/10.17269/s41997-020-00412-4","20201015","COVID-19; Children and youth; Health; Outdoor play; Policy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-20","",6232,""
"[The COVID-19 psychological helpline of the Spanish Ministry of Health and Spanish Psychological Association: characteristics and demand]","Between March and May 2020, the Spanish Ministry of Health and the Spanish Psychological Association created the Psychological First Care Service (Servicio de Primera Ayuda PsicolÃƒÂ³gica-SPAP), a national helpline designed to provide early psychological intervention to those people affected by COVID-19. This service attended more than 15,000 calls and carried out more than 11,000 interventions and 9,500 follow-ups with the general population, healthcare and other essential professionals and the patients and relatives of the sick or deceased. Results show that the majority of calls (45.7%) came from the Autonomous Community of Madrid, that women significantly used this service in a higher proportion than men (73.5%) and that the commonest age range among users was 40-59. 75.9% of consultations were related to psychological problems linked to anxiety and depressive symptoms. However, grief symptoms also stood out among the patients or relatives of the sick and deceased and, to a lesser extent, stress symptoms were prevalent in the group of professionals. These data show the usefulness of this early psychological care service and the need for similar resources to be implemented in coordination with or within the National Health System. Entre marzo y mayo de 2020, el Ministerio de Sanidad y el Consejo General de la PsicologÃƒÂ­a de EspaÃƒÂ±a, pusieron en marcha el Servicio de Primera Ayuda PsicolÃƒÂ³gica (SPAP), un servicio telefÃƒÂ³nico para toda EspaÃƒÂ±a, diseÃƒÂ±ado para proveer atenciÃƒÂ³n psicolÃƒÂ³gica temprana a las personas afectadas por la COVID-19.

"Recovery of individual Service personnel in the COVID-19 recovery phase","To deny the SARS-CoV-2 virus easy options for sustained transmission, commanders should model adherence to, and ensure implementation of, social mitigation measures. While some measures can be achieved at the organisational level through policy, every Service person's experience of the COVID-19 pandemic will have differed, affected by a range of personal, occupational and geographical factors. A successful recovery phase for each Service personnel (SP) therefore relies on localised assessments and individualised support plans. The return of SP to the physical environment must be safe, and the financial needs of their whole family must be considered. Commanders must understand the need for balance in supporting social reconnection both personally and in the workplace. Commanders have an important role in the development of SPs' mental resilience; supporting mental well-being, early recognition of deteriorating mental health and signposting, and compassionate understanding of the needs of SP deployed or bereaved. Disruptions to healthcare service provision will impact the duration of medical downgrading, workforce capacity and operational effectiveness according to extant parameters, which must be understood by commanders. Likewise, functional fitness may have been adversely affected. Physical health and fitness recovery can be supported by time-based extensions to occupational health policy and graduated return to work physical training programmes.","Taylor, Quantick, Ross","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjmilitary-2020-001603","20201015","infectious diseases; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-20","",6234,""
"May Mangafodipir or Other SOD Mimetics Contribute to Better Care in COVID-19 Patients?","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is characterized by massive inflammation of the arterial endothelium accompanied by vasoconstriction and widespread pulmonary micro thrombi. As a result, due to the destruction of nitric oxide (<sup>Ã¢â‚¬Â¢</sup>NO) by inflammatory superoxide (O<sub>2</sub><sup>Ã¢â‚¬Â¢-</sup>), pulmonary <sup>Ã¢â‚¬Â¢</sup>NO concentration ceases, resulting in uncontrolled platelet aggregation and massive thrombosis, which kills the patients. Introducing <sup>Ã¢â‚¬Â¢</sup>NO by inhalation (INO) may replace the loss of endothelium-derived <sup>Ã¢â‚¬Â¢</sup>NO. The first results from clinical trials with INO in SARS-CoV-2 patients show a rapid and sustained improvement in cardiopulmonary function and decreased inflammation. An ongoing phase III study is expected to confirm the method's efficacy. INO may hence become a first line treatment in SARS-CoV-2 patients. However, due to the rapid inactivation of <sup>Ã¢â‚¬Â¢</sup>NO by deoxyhemoglobin to nitrate, pulmonary administration of <sup>Ã¢â‚¬Â¢</sup>NO will not protect remote organs. Another INO-related pharmacological approach to protect SARS-CoV-2 patients from developing life-threatening disease is to inhibit the O<sub>2</sub><sup>Ã¢â‚¬Â¢-</sup>-driven destruction of <sup>Ã¢â‚¬Â¢</sup>NO by neutralizing inflammatory O<sub>2</sub><sup>Ã¢â‚¬Â¢-</sup>. By making use of low molecular weight compounds that mimic the action of the enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). The MnSOD mimetics of the so-called porphyrin type (e.g., AEOL 10150), salen type (e.g., EUK-8) and cyclic polyamine type (e.g., M40419, today known as GC4419 and avasopasem manganese) have all been shown to positively affect the inflammatory response in lung epithelial cells in preclinical models of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The Manganese diPyridoxyL EthylDiamine (MnPLED)-type mangafodipir (manganese dipyridoxyl diphosphate-MnDPDP), a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent that possesses MnSOD mimetic activity, has shown promising results in various forms of inflammation, in preclinical as well as clinical settings. Intravenously administration of mangafodipir will, in contrast to INO, reach remote organs and may hence become an important supplement to INO. From the authors' viewpoint, it appears logical to test mangafodipr in COVID-19 patients at risk of developing life-threatening SARS-CoV-2. Five days after submission of the current manuscript, Galera Pharmaceuticals Inc. announced the dosing of the first patient in a randomized, double-blind pilot phase II clinical trial with GC4419 for COVID-19. The study was first posted on ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT04555096) 18 September 2020.","Karlsson, Jynge, Ignarro","https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox9100971","20201014","COVID-19; MnSOD-mimetic; SARS-CoV-2; inflammation; mangafodipir; nitric oxide; superoxide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-20","",6235,""
"Increase in prevalence of current mental disorders in the context of COVID-19: analysis of repeated nationwide cross-sectional surveys","The United Nations warned of COVID-19-related mental health crisis; however, it is unknown whether there is an increase in the prevalence of mental disorders as existing studies lack a reliable baseline analysis or they did not use a diagnostic measure. We aimed to analyse trends in the prevalence of mental disorders prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We analysed data from repeated cross-sectional surveys on a representative sample of non-institutionalised Czech adults (18+ years) from both November 2017 (n = 3306; 54% females) and May 2020 (n = 3021; 52% females). We used Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) as the main screening instrument. We calculated descriptive statistics and compared the prevalence of current mood and anxiety disorders, suicide risk and alcohol-related disorders at baseline and right after the first peak of COVID-19 when related lockdown was still in place in CZ. In addition, using logistic regression, we assessed the association between COVID-19-related worries and the presence of mental disorders. The prevalence of those experiencing symptoms of at least one current mental disorder rose from a baseline of 20.02 (95% CI = 18.64; 21.39) in 2017 to 29.63 (95% CI = 27.9; 31.37) in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. The prevalence of both major depressive disorder (3.96, 95% CI = 3.28; 4.62 v. 11.77, 95% CI = 10.56; 12.99); and suicide risk (3.88, 95% CI = 3.21; 4.52 v. 11.88, 95% CI = 10.64; 13.07) tripled and current anxiety disorders almost doubled (7.79, 95% CI = 6.87; 8.7 v. 12.84, 95% CI = 11.6; 14.05). The prevalence of alcohol use disorders in 2020 was approximately the same as in 2017 (10.84, 95% CI = 9.78; 11.89 v. 9.88, 95% CI = 8.74; 10.98); however, there was a significant increase in weekly binge drinking behaviours (4.07% v. 6.39%). Strong worries about both, health or economic consequences of COVID-19, were associated with an increased odds of having a mental disorder (1.63, 95% CI = 1.4; 1.89 and 1.42, 95% CI = 1.23; 1.63 respectively). This study provides evidence matching concerns that COVID-19-related mental health problems pose a major threat to populations, particularly considering the barriers in service provision posed during lockdown. This finding emphasises an urgent need to scale up mental health promotion and prevention globally.","Winkler, Formanek, Mlada, Kagstrom, Mohrova, Mohr, Csemy","https://doi.org/10.1017/S2045796020000888","20201019","Anxiety; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; depression; mental disorders; prevalence; suicide risk","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-20","",6236,""
"Old age mental health services in Southern Balkans: Features, geospatial distribution, current needs, and future perspectives","Healthcare services are increasingly confronted with challenges related to old age mental disorders. The survey aimed to provide an overview of existing psychogeriatric services in Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, and North Macedonia. After identification of psychogeriatric units across the four countries, their head physicians were asked to provide data on their clinical, teaching, and research activity, as well as staff composition. Moreover, the attitudes of head physicians to current needs and future service development were explored. A total of 15 psychogeriatric units were identified (3 in Bulgaria, 8 in Greece, and 4 in North Macedonia). Results show wide variation regarding the location, team size and composition, service availability, numbers of patients attending, and inpatient treatment length. Most head physicians underscored the urgent need for breakthroughs in the graduate and postgraduate education in psychogeriatrics of medical and nonmedical professionals, as well as in the interconnection of their units with community primary healthcare services and long-term care facilities for seniors via telemedicine. They would welcome the development of national standards for psychogeriatric units, potentially embodying clear pointers for action. A number of head physicians advocated the development of nationwide old age mental health registries. Regional disparities in resources and services for seniors' mental health services were unveiled. These data may enrich the dialogue on optimizing psychogeriatric services through planning future cross-border collaborations mainly based on telemedicine services, especially in the era of the novel coronavirus pandemic, and training/education in psychogeriatrics of mental health professionals.","Alexopoulos, Novotni, Novotni, Vorvolakos, Vratsista, Konsta, Kaprinis, Konstantinou, Bonotis, Katirtzoglou, Siarkos, Bekri, Kokkoris, Como, Gournellis, Stoyanov, Politis","https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2020.85","20201014","in- and outpatient psychogeriatric services; liaison; research and didactic activity; telepsychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-20","",6237,""
"Panique et pandÃ©mie: revue de la littÃ©rature sur les liens entre le trouble panique et l'Ã©pidÃ©mie Ã  SARS-CoV-2","RÃ©sumÃ© Lâ€™Ã©tat de panique associÃ© Ã  la pandÃ©mie liÃ©e au SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) incite Ã  sâ€™interroger sur les troubles anxieux que cette situation pourrait gÃ©nÃ©rer ou aggraver.

Lâ€™hypokaliÃ©mie est associÃ©e Ã  un risque accru de torsade de pointe, il convient donc Ã©galement dâ€™Ãªtre prudent en matiÃ¨re de prescription de psychotropes Ã  risque : comme avec le citalopram et lâ€™escitalopram, des antidÃ©presseurs indiquÃ©s dans le trouble panique, ou encore lâ€™hydroxyzine, Ã  visÃ©e anxiolytique. Ces donnÃ©es sont de nature Ã  resituer lâ€™importance de la prise en considÃ©ration du trouble panique dans le cadre de la pandÃ©mie en cours. Abstract Although the â€˜panicâ€™ word has been abundantly linked to the SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) pandemic in the press, in the scientific literature very few studies have considered whether the current epidemic could predispose to the onset or the aggravation of panic attacks or panic disorder. Indeed, most studies thus far have focused on the risk of increase and aggravation of other psychiatric disorders as a consequence of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Yet, risk of onset or aggravation of panic disorder, especially the subtype with prominent respiratory symptoms, which is characterized by a fear response conditioning to interoceptive sensations (e.g., respiratory), and hypervigilance to these interoceptive signals, could be expected in the current situation. Indeed, respiratory symptoms, such as coughs and dyspnea, are among the most commonly associated with the SARS-CoV-2 (59-82 % and 31-55 %, respectively), and respiratory symptoms are associated with a poor illness prognosis. Hence given that some etiological and maintenance factors associated with panic disorder â€“ i.e., fear conditioning to abnormal breathing patterns attributable or not to the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), as well as hypervigilance towards breathing abnormalities â€“ are supposedly more prevalent, one could expect an increased risk of panic disorder onset or aggravation following the COVID-19 epidemic in people who were affected by the virus, but also those who were not. In people with the comorbidity (i.e., panic disorder or panic attacks and the COVID-19), it is particularly important to be aware of the risk of hypokalemia in specific at-risk situations or prescriptions. For instance, in the case of salbutamol prescription, which might be overly used in patients with anxiety disorders and COVID-19, or in patients presenting with diarrhea and vomiting. Hypokalemia is associated with an increased risk of torsade de pointe, thus caution is required when prescribing specific psychotropic drugs, such as the antidepressants citalopram and escitalopram, which are first-line treatments for panic disorder, but also hydroxyzine, aiming at anxiety reduction. The results reviewed here highlight the importance of considering and further investigating the impact of the current pandemic on the diagnosis and treatment of panic disorder (alone or comorbid with the COVID-19).","Javelot, H; Weiner, L","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.05.010","20200521","","Elsevier; PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-20","",6238,""
