"Acute Hepatitis due to Hepatic Glycogenosis After Insulin Overdose and Oral Glucose Administration in an Adolescent","Background: Hepatic glycogenosis (HG) has been reported after intravenous (IV) dextrose administration to treat insulin overdose. We describe a case of HG in a patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) due to insulin overdose treated with oral glucose administration. Case Presentation: An adolescent boy with T1DM on a basal bolus insulin regimen presented with abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, and hypoglycemia of a few hours. His glucose was 71 mg/dL, aspartate transaminase (AST) 119 U/L, and alanine transaminase (ALT) 65 U/L. Hypoglycemia was treated with juice, and 12 hours later AST and ALT were 979 U/L and 700 U/L, respectively. Workup for infectious, autoimmune, metabolic, and toxic causes of hepatitis was negative. The transaminases improved by the next day and normalized within 3 weeks. Two weeks after discharge the patient returned with hypoglycemia, nausea, and right-sided abdominal pain of 13 hours. Hypoglycemia persisted despite multiple courses of glucose tablets and juice. Laboratory studies showed glucose of 58 mg/dL, AST of 776 U/L, ALT of 496 U/L, negative toxicology studies, and normal abdominal ultrasound. His serum insulin level was 249.7 mU/L and, C-peptide was less than 0.1 ng/mL, consistent with insulin overdose. He received IV fluids with dextrose, and insulin was held. Transaminases improved by the following day. Repeat serum insulin while on home regimen was normal. Conclusion: Along with other diagnoses, HG should be considered in patients treated with insulin who present with hypoglycemia and acute hepatitis. HG can occur in cases of insulin overdose treated with repeated oral glucose administration.","Sasidharan Pillai, Sabitha; Quintos, Jose Bernardo; Topor, Lisa Swartz","https://dx.doi.org/10.1210/jendso/bvab142","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Endocr Soc;5(11): bvab142, 2021 Nov 01.; Publication details: J Endocr Soc;5(11): bvab142, 2021 Nov 01.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-18","",22136,""
"Social Media Sharing of Articles About Measles in a European Context: Text Analysis Study","BACKGROUND: Despite the existence of an effective vaccine, measles still threatens the health and lives of many Europeans. Notably, during the COVID-19 pandemic, measles vaccine uptake declined; as a result, after the pandemic, European countries will have to increase vaccination rates to restore the extent of vaccination coverage among the population. Because information obtained from social media are one of the main causes of vaccine hesitancy, knowledge of the nature of information pertaining to measles that is shared on social media may help create educational campaigns. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aim to define the characteristics of European news about measles shared on social media platforms (ie, Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest) from 2017 to 2019. METHODS: We downloaded and translated (into English) 10,305 articles on measles published in European Union countries. Using latent Dirichlet allocation, we identified main topics and estimated the sentiments expressed in these articles. Furthermore, we used linear regression to determine factors related to the number of times a given article was shared on social media. RESULTS: We found that, in most European social media posts, measles is only discussed in the context of local European events. Articles containing educational information and describing world outbreaks appeared less frequently. The most common emotions identified from the study's news data set were fear and trust. Yet, it was found that readers were more likely to share information on educational topics and the situation in Germany, Ukraine, Italy, and Samoa. A high amount of anger, joy, and sadness expressed within the text was also associated with a higher number of shares. CONCLUSIONS: We identified which features of news articles were related to increased social media shares. We found that social media users prefer sharing educational news to sharing informational news. Appropriate emotional content can also increase the willingness of social media users to share an article. Effective media content that promotes measles vaccinations should contain educational or scientific information, as well as specific emotions (such as anger, joy, or sadness). Articles with this type of content may offer the best chance of disseminating vital messages to a broad social media audience.","Wawrzuta, Dominik; Jaworski, Mariusz; Gotlib, Joanna; Panczyk, Mariusz","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/30150","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;23(11): e30150, 2021 Nov 08.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;23(11): e30150, 2021 Nov 08.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-18","",22137,""
"Development of RESTORE: an online intervention to improve mental health symptoms associated with COVID-19-related traumatic and extreme stressors","Background: Frontline healthcare workers, recovered COVID+ patients who had severe illness, and close others of COVID+ patients who have recovered or died are at risk for clinical levels of mental health symptoms in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESTORE (Recovering from Extreme Stressors Through Online Resources and E-health) was specifically designed for this context. RESTORE is a transdiagnostic guided online intervention adapted from evidence-based cognitive-behavioural therapies. Objectives: RESTORE was designed to address depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms associated with exposure to COVID-19-related traumatic and extreme stressors, and to overcome multiple barriers to accessing psychotherapies. Method: This paper describes the intervention components and platform, as well as the principles used to develop RESTORE. Current research and future directions in developing and testing RESTORE are outlined. Results: Preliminary data from an initial uncontrolled trial evaluating RESTORE in frontline healthcare workers is highly promising. Conclusion: We believe RESTORE has great potential to provide accessible, evidence-based psychological intervention to those in great need.","Trottier, Kathryn; Monson, Candice M; Kaysen, Debra; Wagner, Anne C; Pun, Carson; Abbey, Susan E","https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20008198.2021.1984049","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Eur J Psychotraumatol;12(1): 1984049, 2021.; Publication details: Eur J Psychotraumatol;12(1): 1984049, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-18","",22138,""

After the worldwide spread of COVID-19, common symptoms are already well known as fever, coughing, shortness of breath, pneumonia, abdominal pain and diarrhea, either loss of olfaction or sense of taste. Neurological complications are perhaps less known as headache, dizziness, agitation, executive dysfunction or, in particular cases, viral encephalitis and acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalitis may also occur. In COVID-19 patients, ischemic stroke or cerebral vein thrombosis are also more commonly related to the increased risk of thrombosis. In the long term, so called post-COVID syndrome can emerge in the form of fatigue, depression or many other mental disorders. The most common disease of the peripheral nervous system is Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome. This chapter reviews a case of a 41-year-old man presented to the Department of Neurology with facial diplegia, dysarthria and intermittent paresthesia of the upper and lower extremities. 10-14 days before the onset of neurological symptoms, he has gone through COVID-19 infection that involved fever and upper respiratory tract symptoms. Electrophysiology and liquor samples showed typical signs of a rare Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome subtype - bifacial weakness with paresthesias. We are reviewing the neurological complications of the virus due to the expected increase of case numbers.

"Short-term effects of a social media-based intervention on the physical and mental health of remotely working young software professionals: A randomised controlled trial","The present study aimed to explore the short term effects of a social media-based intervention on the physical and mental health of the software professionals working remotely during the pandemic. Sixty software professionals with poor physical and mental health were randomised to Facebook-based intervention (FIIT) and a control (CONT) group for 2 months. Forty-six remote workers (26.25 Â± 3.49 years) completed the study (FIIT = 22; CONT = 26). All the respondents had the median sitting time (7.07 Â± 2.30 h/day) during office hours on workdays. We found a significant difference in the sitting time during office hours in workday within the subjects (F1,46  = 4.66; p < .004; ÃŽÂ·p 2 Â = .048) and between the subjects (F1,46  = 3.81; p < .004; ÃŽÂ·p 2 Â = .040). Post hoc analysis revealed participants in the FIIT group reduced their sitting time by 58 min during office hours during a typical workday compared with the control group. Nevertheless, we found a significant difference in the scores of stress, anxiety and depression within and between the groups. Short-term social media-based physical and mental health intervention may improve physical and mental health scores in the desk-based office workers working remotely.","Muniswamy, Prabhu; Gorhe, Varadayini; Parashivakumar, Lavanya; Chandrasekaran, Baskaran","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aphw.12318","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Appl Psychol Health Well Being;2021 Nov 08.; Publication details: Appl Psychol Health Well Being;2021 Nov 08.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-18","",22140,""
"COVID-19 Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices Among People in Bangladesh: Telephone-Based Cross-sectional Survey","BACKGROUND: The world has been grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic, a dire public health crisis, since December 2019. Preventive and control measures have been adopted to reduce the spread of COVID-19. To date, the public's knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding COVID-19 across Bangladesh have been poorly understood. Therefore, it is important to assess people's knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) toward the disease and suggest appropriate strategies to combat COVID-19 effectively. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the KAP of Bangladeshi people toward COVID-19 and to identify their determinants. METHODS: We conducted a country-wide cross-sectional telephonic survey from May 7 to 29, 2020. A purposive sampling method was applied, and adult Bangladeshi citizens who have mobile phones were approached to participate in the survey. Interviews were conducted based on verbal consent. Multiple logistic regression analyses and several tests were performed to identify the factors associated with KAP related to COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 492 of 576 Bangladeshi adults aged 18 years and above completed the interview, with a response rate of 85.4% (492/576). Of the 492 participants, 321 (65.2%) were male, and 304 (61.8%) lived in a rural area. Mean scores for knowledge, attitudes, and practices were 10.56 (SD 2.86), 1.24 (SD 0.83), and 3.17 (SD 1.5), respectively. Among the 492 respondents, 273 (55.5%) had poor knowledge, and 251 (49%) expressed a negative attitude; 192 out of 359 respondents (53.5%) had poor practices toward COVID-19. Mean scores of knowledge, attitudes, and practices differed significantly across various demographic and socioeconomic groups. Rural residents had lower mean scores of knowledge (mean 9.8, SD 3.1, P<.001) and adherence to appropriate practice measures (mean 4, SD 1.4, P<.001) compared to their urban counterparts. Positive and statistically strong correlations between knowledge and attitudes (r=0.21, P<.001), knowledge and practices (r=0.45, P<.001), and attitudes and practices (r=0.27, P<.001) were observed. Television (53.7%) was identified as the major source of knowledge regarding COVID-19. Almost three-quarters of the respondents (359/492, 73%) went outside the home during the lockdown period. Furthermore, the study found that good knowledge (odds ratio [OR] 3.13, 95% CI 2.03-4.83, and adjusted OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.16-4.68) and a positive attitude (OR 2.43, 95% CI 1.59-3.72, and adjusted OR 3.87, 95% CI 1.95-7.68) are significantly associated with better practice of COVID-19 health measures. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence-informed and context-specific risk communication and community engagement, and a social and behavior change communication strategy against COVID-19 should be developed in Bangladesh based on the findings of this study, targeting different socioeconomic groups.","Rabbani, Md Golam; Akter, Orin; Hasan, Md Zahid; Samad, Nandeeta; Mahmood, Shehrin Shaila; Joarder, Taufique","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/28344","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;5(11): e28344, 2021 Nov 05.; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;5(11): e28344, 2021 Nov 05.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-18","",22141,""
"Psychosocial and Behavioral Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the Indian Population: Protocol for a Cross-sectional Study","BACKGROUND: During the year 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic spread from China to the rest of the world, which prompted the world to implement a widespread mandated quarantine or social isolation. The impending uncertainty of the pandemic must have resulted in a variety of widespread mental health maladies. There has been documentation in the literature about a lot of these in small populations of the world but limited studies have been conducted in India, leading to limited evidence in the literature. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of our study is to investigate the mental health effects that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the general population in India both quantitatively and qualitatively. These results will help contribute to reducing the knowledge gap that is recognized in the literature, which is the result of the unprecedented and novel nature of the pandemic. METHODS: We designed and validated our own questionnaire and used the method of circulating the questionnaire via WhatsApp (Facebook Inc). WhatsApp is a social media app that is very popularly used in India; hence, it turned out to be an effective medium for gathering pilot data. We analyzed the pilot data and used them to validate the questionnaire. This was done with the expertise of our mentor, Nilima Shah, MD (psychiatry). We gathered pilot data on 545 subjects and used the results to determine the changes that were needed for the questionnaire while simultaneously validating the questionnaire. RESULTS: The study protocol was approved in September 2020 by the institutional review board at Vadilal Sarabhai General Hospital, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. CONCLUSIONS: The following preliminary assumptions can be made about the study based on the pilot data: the majority of the survey respondents were male (289/545, 53%), most of them were educated and employed as health care workers (199/545, 36.5%). The majority of the responders were self-employed (185/545, 33.9%), single (297/545, 54.5%), and stayed with their families (427/541, 79%) for the lockdown, which helped them psychologically. Findings that are specific to mental health have been elaborated upon in the manuscript. It is evident from the data collected in previous literature that the pandemic has had significant detrimental effects on the mental health of a vast proportion of the Indian population.

"[Increase of depressive symptoms among adolescents during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Germany : Results from the German family panel pairfam]; Anstieg depressiver Symptome bei Jugendlichen und jungen Erwachsenen wÃ¤hrend des ersten Lockdowns in Deutschland : Ergebnisse des Beziehungs- und Familienpanels pairfam","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed social life within aÂ very short time. Lockdown policies often consider the tradeoff between containing the spread of the pandemic and negative consequences for the economy. Policymakers should pay more attention to the psychological and social impacts of the lockdown. RESEARCH QUESTION: How did the mental health of adolescents in Germany change during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown? MATERIALS AND METHODS: Analyses are based on longitudinal data from nationwide randomly selected anchors of the German family panel pairfam. The age group considered here, born between 2001 and 2003, was surveyed for the first time in 2018/2019 in the course of aÂ refreshment sample, and 854 of these adolescents and young adults aged 16-19 also participated in the COVID-19 supplementary survey from May to July 2020 (first lockdown). Depressiveness is assessed with the State-Trait Depression Scale. RESULTS: During the first lockdown, adolescents show aÂ significant increase in depressive symptoms. Prior to the lockdown, 10.4% had clinically relevant depressive symptoms [95% CI: 8.4; 12.5]. In spring 2020, the prevalence increased to 25.3% [95% CI: 22.4; 28.2]. Young women have aÂ significantly higher risk of developing depressive symptoms than men of the same age. Immigrant background is an equally strong risk factor. The prevalence of depressive symptoms among adolescents with an immigrant background increased from 11% to 33%. DISCUSSION: To address this increased mental health risk and the inequalities, policymakers and society should ensure access and availability of target-group-specific and low-threshold prevention and counselling.","Naumann, Elias; von den Driesch, Ellen; Schumann, Almut; ThÃ¶nnissen, Carolin","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00103-021-03451-5","","Country: DE; ALEMANHA; GERMANY; ALEMANIA; DEUSTCHLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz;2021 Nov 03.; Publication details: Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz;2021 Nov 03.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-18","",22143,""
"[Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among children and adolescents in Germany-an overview]; SARS-CoV-2-SeroprÃ¤valenz bei Kindern und Jugendlichen in DeutschlandÂ Â­ ein Ãœberblick","BACKGROUND: SARS-CoVÂ­2 serologic studies complement and expand findings from confirmed COVID-19Â cases through identification of undetected cases. OBJECTIVES: This article summarizes previous results on SARS-CoVÂ­2 prevalence from seroepidemiological studies in Germany focusing on children and adolescents and complements the already existing overview on seroprevalence in adults from general population samples and especially blood donors in Germany. METHODS: The results are based on an ongoing systematic search in study registries, in literature databases, of preprint publications, and of media reports of seroepidemiological studies in Germany and their results. RESULTS: As of 17 September 2021, we are aware of 16Â German seroepidemiological studies focusing on children and adolescents. Results are available for nine of these studies. For almost all settings studied, SARS-CoVÂ­2 seroprevalence was well below 1% for preschool and elementary school children in the first COVID-19 wave and below 2% for adolescents. As the pandemic progressed, higher seroprevalences of up to 8% were found in elementary school children. DISCUSSION: Results of SARS-CoVÂ­2 antibody studies in children and adolescents in Germany are scarce so far and are based on non-representative samples at local or regional level. In future studies, it is necessary on the one hand to estimate which proportion of children and adolescents has already either had an infection or has been vaccinated. On the other hand, it is important to investigate physical and mental health impairments that occur after an infection.","Thamm, Roma; Buttmann-Schweiger, Nina; Fiebig, Julia; Poethko-MÃ¼ller, Christina; PrÃ¼tz, Franziska; Sarganas, Giselle; Neuhauser, Hannelore","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00103-021-03448-0","","Country: DE; ALEMANHA; GERMANY; ALEMANIA; DEUSTCHLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz;2021 Nov 03.; Publication details: Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz;2021 Nov 03.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-18","",22144,""
"Attitudes and Intentions of US Veterans Regarding COVID-19 Vaccination","Importance: Compared with the general population, veterans are at high risk for COVID-19 and have a complex relationship with the government. This potentially affects their attitudes toward receiving COVID-19 vaccines. Objective: To assess veterans' attitudes toward and intentions to receive COVID-19 vaccines. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional web-based survey study used data from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Survey of Healthcare Experiences of Patients' Veterans Insight Panel, fielded between March 12 and 28, 2021. Of 3420 veterans who were sent a link to complete a 58-item web-based survey, 1178 veterans (34%) completed the survey. Data were analyzed from April 1 to August 25, 2021. Exposures: Veterans eligible for COVID-19 vaccines. Main Outcomes and Measures: The outcomes of interest were veterans' experiences with COVID-19, vaccination status and intention groups, reasons for receiving or not receiving a vaccine, self-reported health status, and trusted and preferred sources of information about COVID-19 vaccines. Reasons for not getting vaccinated were classified into categories of vaccine deliberation, dissent, distrust, indifference, skepticism, and policy and processes. Results: Among 1178 respondents, 974 (83%) were men, 130 (11%) were women, and 141 (12%) were transgender or nonbinary; 58 respondents (5%) were Black, 54 veterans (5%) were Hispanic or Latino, and 987 veterans (84%) were non-Hispanic White. The mean (SD) age of respondents was 66.7 (10.1) years. A total of 817 respondents (71%) self-reported being vaccinated against COVID-19. Of 339 respondents (29%) who were not vaccinated, those unsure of getting vaccinated were more likely to report fair or poor overall health (32 respondents [43%]) and mental health (33 respondents [44%]) than other nonvaccinated groups (overall health: range, 20%-32%; mental health: range, 18%-40%). Top reasons for not being vaccinated were skepticism (120 respondents [36%] were concerned about side effects; 65 respondents [20%] preferred using few medications; 63 respondents [19%] preferred gaining natural immunity), deliberation (74 respondents [22%] preferred to wait because vaccine is new), and distrust (61 respondents [18%] did not trust the health care system). Among respondents who were vaccinated, preventing oneself from getting sick (462 respondents [57%]) and contributing to the end of the COVID-19 pandemic (453 respondents [56%]) were top reasons for getting vaccinated. All veterans reported the VA as 1 of their top trusted sources of information. The proportion of respondents trusting their VA health care practitioner as a source of vaccine information was higher among those unsure about vaccination compared with those who indicated they would definitely not or probably not get vaccinated (18 respondents [26%] vs 15 respondents [15%]). There were no significant associations between vaccine intention groups and age (&#967;24 = 5.90; P = .21) or gender (&#967;22 = 3.99; P = .14). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings provide information needed to develop trusted messages used in conversations between VA health care practitioners and veterans addressing specific vaccine hesitancy reasons, as well as those in worse health. Conversations need to emphasize societal reasons for getting vaccinated and benefits to one's own health.","Jasuja, Guneet K; Meterko, Mark; Bradshaw, Ledjona D; Carbonaro, Richard; Clayman, Marla L; LoBrutto, Lara; Miano, Danielle; Maguire, Elizabeth M; Midboe, Amanda M; Asch, Steven M; Gifford, Allen L; McInnes, D Keith; Elwy, A Rani","https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.32548","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JAMA Netw Open;4(11): e2132548, 2021 11 01.; Publication details: JAMA Netw Open;4(11): e2132548, 2021 11 01.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-18","",22145,""

"From ""The Interpersonal Theory of Suicide"" to ""The Interpersonal Trust"": an unexpected and effective resource to mitigate economic crisis-related suicide risk in times of Covid-19?","Suicide risk and resilience strategies during the different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic are of great interest to researchers. At the pandemic onset, a dramatic suicides exacerbation was feared. Some authoritative authors warned the scientific and clinical community about this risk by pointing out that especially psychiatric, psychological, and social factors could interact with each other to create a vicious cycle. While worldwide case-reports and studies conducted at emergency departments did indeed find an increase in suicidal behavior, recent systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and time-series analyses could not confirm this for the first COVID-19 wave. Instead, it appears that the increased suicide risk outlasted the acute phase of the pandemic and thus affected people more during the pandemic following phases. One possible reason for this phenomenon may be a persistent state of insecurity regarding the economic crisis evolution with serious financial stressors in terms of income decrease, unemployment, repaying debts difficulty, home loss, one's social status derive, social hierarchy drop, and poverty. During the COVID-19 first wave, with particular regard to vulnerable populations, one of the postulated theories unifying different risk factors under a single frame was the ""Interpersonal Theory of Suicide"". Conversely, the ""Interpersonal Trust"" theory emerged as a protective factor even during an economic crisis. In a possible mirroring of the two theories, it seems to be feasible to find common themes between them and, above all, to gain relevant insights to devise effective prevention and supportive strategies for dealing with suicide risk challenges that COVID-19 will continue to pose in the foreseeable future.

"[Psychological impact of involvement of medical and psychological emergency unit professionals in the medical and psychological care system of the COVID-19Â epidemic]; Impact psychologique de l'implication des professionnels des CUMP dans le dispositif de soins mÃ©dico-psychologique face Ã  l'Ã©pidÃ©mie COVID-19","Objectives: COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences have put into great difficulty health professionals, and the general population, fostering the emergence of various psychological and psychiatric disorders. Medical and psychological emergency units' mission is the medical and psychological emergency care of people impacted during a traumatic event. Given their expertise in crisis management, they set up an important medical and psychological support system adapted to the health crisis' characteristics. The unusual modalities of intervention, the specific clinic that these professionals faced in this context of great tension may have unsettled workers and generate a psychological impact. This study aims to assess the existence of such repercussions among medical and psychological emergency unit professionals involved in this new system. Method: In all, 313 medical and psychological emergency unit professionals agreed to participate at the online survey. They filled surveys and visual analog scales assessing the difficulties encountered in the system, as well as their level of satisfaction, post-traumatic stress, burnout, level of anxiety and depression and coping strategies put in place. Results: Results show few significant emotional difficulties. However higher scores are found among women, among professionals who felt a negative impact on their personal lives, as well as for those who thought they had been infected with COVID-19. The establishment of coping strategies such as active coping, planning, expressing feelings, positive reinterpretation and acceptance helped to decrease the level of emotional complexities and brought more compassionate satisfaction. We note that participants with more medical and psychological emergency unit experience tend to show less emotional hardship and more compassionate satisfaction. It appears that older as well as younger professionals have lower burnout scores, as do workers who conducted more interviews for the same person. Likewise, participants who were satisfied of the system organization and of the support -Â a majority in this studyÂ - report less emotional challenges and more compassionate satisfaction. Conclusion: Psychological impact in this new system among medical and psychological emergency unit professionals is overall low. It appears that some coping strategies, perceived usefulness, satisfaction with the organization and the received support are associated with a lower level of emotional difficulties. A supportive framework and an operative organization of the medical and psychological emergency unit system in times of crisis has a protective effect on the participants.","Neff, Ã‰lise; Vancappel, Alexis; Moioli, Laura; Ducrocq, FranÃ§ois; El-Hage, Wissam; Prieto, Nathalie; Abgrall, GaÃ«lle","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2021.10.006","","Country: FR; FRANÃ‡A; FRANCE; FRANCIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Ann Med Psychol (Paris);2021 Oct 12.; Publication details: Ann Med Psychol (Paris);2021 Oct 12.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-18","",22148,""
"Adapting a Mental Health Intervention for Adolescents During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Web-Based Synchronous Focus Group Study","BACKGROUND: Although focus groups are a valuable qualitative research tool, face-to-face meetings may be difficult to arrange and time consuming. This challenge has been further compounded by the global COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown and physical distancing measures implemented, which caused exceptional challenges to human activities. Online focus groups (OFGs) are an example of an alternative strategy and require further study. At present, OFGs have mostly been studied and used in high-income countries, with little information relating to their implementation in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to share our experiences of conducting OFGs through a web conferencing service and provide recommendations for future research. METHODS: As part of a broader study, OFGs were developed with adults and adolescents in Colombia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through a convenience sampling method, we invited eligible participants via email in two different cities of Colombia to participate in OFGs conducted via Microsoft Teams. Researcher notes and discussion were used to capture participant and facilitator experiences, as well as practical considerations. RESULTS: Technical issues were encountered, but various measures were taken to minimize them, such as using a web conferencing service that was familiar to participants, sending written instructions, and performing a trial meeting prior to the OFG. Adolescent participants, unlike their adult counterparts, were fluent in using web conferencing platforms and did not encounter technical challenges. CONCLUSIONS: OFGs have great potential in research settings, especially during the current and any future public health emergencies. It is important to keep in mind that even with the advantages that they offer, technical issues (ie, internet speed and access to technology) are major obstacles in LMICs. Further research is required and should carefully consider the appropriateness of OFGs in different settings.","Calvo-Valderrama, Maria Gabriela; MarroquÃ­n-Rivera, Arturo; Burn, Erin; Ospina-Pinillos, Laura; Bird, Victoria; GÃ³mez-Restrepo, Carlos","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/30293","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;5(11): e30293, 2021 Nov 03.; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;5(11): e30293, 2021 Nov 03.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-18","",22149,""

"Challenges and Potential Solutions for Physician's Suicide risk factors in the COVID-19 Era: Psychiatric Comorbidities, Medicine Judicialization, and Burnout","Suicide in physicians outlines a public health problem that deserves more consideration. A recently performed meta-analysis and systematic review evaluated suicide mortality in physicians by gender and investigated several related risk factors. It showed a post-1980 suicide mortality ratio 46% higher in female physicians than women in the general population and a 33% lower risk in male physicians than men in general, despite an overall contraction in physicians' mortality rates in both genders. This narrative review was conducted through a search and analysis of relevant articles/databases to address questions raised by the meta-analysis, and how they may be affected by COVID-19. The process included unstructured searches on physician suicide, burnout, medicine judicialization, healthcare organization and COVID-19 on Pubmed, and Google searches for relevant databases, medical society, expert and media commentaries on these topics. We focus on three factors critical to address physician suicides: epidemiological data limitations, psychiatric comorbidities, and professional overload. We found relevant articles on suicide reporting, physician mental health, effects of healthcare judicialization and organization on physician and patient health, and how COVID-19 may impact such factors. This review addresses information sources, underreporting/misreporting of physicians' suicide rates, inadequate diagnosis and management of psychiatric comorbidities and chronic effects on physicians' work capacity, and finally, medicine judicialization and organization failure increasing physician ""burnout"". We discuss these factors in general and in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. We describe an overview of the above factors, discuss possible solutions, and specifically address how COVID-19 may impact such factors.","Duarte, El-Hagarassy, Couto, Gurgel, Minuzzi, Saperson, CorrÃƒÂªa","https://doi.org/10.47626/2237-6089-2021-0293","20211117","COVID-19; burnout; depression; healthcare organization; medicine judicialization; physician suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-18","",22152,""
"School reopening and risks accelerating the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis protocol","One of the most recent concerns of this pandemic regards the role of schools reopening in disease transmission, as well as the impact of keeping schools closed. While school reopening seems critical for the education and mental health of children, adolescents, and adults, so far the literature has not systematically reached a consensus whether to recommend the return to schools in a way that would be safe for students and staff. To synthesize and critically evaluate the scientific evidence on the potential risk of accelerating the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic among children, adolescents, young adults, and adults with school reopening. This systematic review and meta-analysis protocol was elaborated following the PRISMA-P. We will include all observational study designs, which report on the potential risk of accelerating the COVID-2019 pandemic with school reopening. Electronic databases included were MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, SCOPUS and CNKI. Additional sources will be also retrieved, including Clinical trials.gov-NIH, The British Library, Pro Quest Dissertations Database, Public Health Gray Literature Sources and Health Evidence, Google Scholar, and pre-prints [medRXiv]. No restriction to language or date will be used as search strategy. In an independently manner, two investigators will select studies, perform data extraction, as well as perform a critical appraisal of the risk of bias and overall quality of the selected observational studies, based on their designs. The heterogeneity among the studies will be assessed using the I2 statistic test. According to the results of this test, we will verify whether a meta-analysis is feasible. If feasibility is confirmed, a random-effect model analysis will be carried out. For data analysis, the calculation of the pooled effect estimates will consider a 95% CI and alpha will be set in 0.05 using the R statistical software, v.4.0.4. In addition, we will rate the certainty of evidence based on Cochrane methods and in accordance with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). This systematic review and meta-analysis will provide better insights into safety in the return to school in the context of the COVID-2019 pandemic, at a time when vaccination advances unevenly in several countries around the world. Hence, consistent data and robust evidence will be provided to help decision-makers and stakeholders in the current pandemic scenario.

"Individual determinants of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy","Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine hesitancy is a barrier to achieving herd immunity, and thus, a prominent public health concern. This study aimed to identify the determinants of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy based on the World Health Organization's '3Cs' model (i.e., confidence, complacency, and convenience) in the United States (U.S.) and Canada. Data from 7678 adults ages 18 or older were collected from the four most populous U.S. States, specifically New York, California, Florida, and Texas, and from English-speaking Canada at three timepoints, in May and July 2020, and March 2021 using a web-based survey (www.covid19-database.com). Sociodemographic information was collected, and comprehensive psychological assessments were administered. Univariate analyses were performed to identify the individual determinants of vaccine hesitancy, which were categorized as: 1) vaccine confidence, 2) vaccine complacency, 3) sociodemographic, and 4) other psychological factors. A series of models were computed using these categorizations. Mistrust of vaccine benefit (ÃŽÂ²(SE) = 0.67(0.01), p&lt;0.001, partial ÃŽÂ·2 = 0.26) and lower perceived seriousness of COVID-19 (ÃŽÂ²(SE) = 0.68(0.02), p&lt;0.001, partial ÃŽÂ·2 = 0.12) were the principal determinants of vaccine hesitancy. Right-wing political affiliation (ÃŽÂ²(SE) = 0.32(0.02), p&lt;0.001, partial ÃŽÂ·2 = 0.03), higher risk propensity (ÃŽÂ²(SE) = 0.24(0.02), p&lt;0.001, partial ÃŽÂ·2 = 0.03), and less negative mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic (ÃŽÂ²(SE) = 0.20(0.01), p&lt;0.001, partial ÃŽÂ·2 = 0.03) were the main sociodemographic and psychological determinants. Other sociodemographic determinants included younger age, women, race, and employment status. Lack of vaccine confidence and complacency explained 38% and 21% of the variance in vaccine hesitancy, respectively; whereas, sociodemographic and psychological determinants explained 13% and 11% of the variance in vaccine hesitancy, respectively. Targeted and tailored public health interventions that enhance the public's confidence in vaccines and emphasize the risk and seriousness of COVID-19 may address COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Efforts directed toward specific marginalized and underserved groups may be required to promote vaccine confidence.","Gerretsen, Kim, Caravaggio, Quilty, Sanches, Wells, Brown, Agic, Pollock, Graff-Guerrero","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0258462","20211117","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-18","",22154,""
"Zoster Cranial Polyneuropathy in a COVID-19 Patient","BACKGROUND Ramsay Hunt syndrome is a rare form of herpes zoster caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus in the geniculate ganglion. The main clinical manifestations are peripheral facial palsy, vesicular rash in the ear, and ipsilateral auricular pain, and sometimes vertigo. COVID-19 is a new multisystemic infectious disease that, in addition to common respiratory manifestations, it is known to affect the immune system, primarily depressing cellular immunity. CASE REPORT A 54-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with an acute vestibular syndrome and diplopia. She had been diagnosed 3 years prior with interstitial lung disease for which she was taking methylprednisolone. At admission, she tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In the following days, she developed a sixth nerve palsy on the left side and a right peripheral facial palsy on the right side, followed by a typical zoster rash on the ipsilateral ear. One month later, she developed acute severe hearing loss on the right side. There were no COVID-19 symptoms during her stay in our hospital. The MRI showed Gd enhancement of both facial nerves. Under antiviral and corticoid treatment, the evolution was favorable, with marked improvement at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 increases the risk for herpes zoster infection, probably through induced depression of the cellular immunity. Our case suggests Ramsay Hunt syndrome can be the presenting symptom and sometimes the only symptom of COVID-19. This also seems to be true for other cranial neuropathies, and we recommend testing these patients even if there are no other manifestations.","Antonescu, Butnariu, Cojocaru, Anghel, Mihai, TuÃˆâ€ºÃ„Æ’","https://doi.org/10.12659/AJCR.934658","20211117","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-18","",22155,""

"Assessment of dental anxiety levels among dental emergency patients during the COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜19 pandemic through the Modified Dental Anxiety Scale","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜19) continues to affect dental emergency services worldwide. Dental anxiety (DA) is described as a common and distressing problem in terms of oral health maintenance. The present study aimed to evaluate DA levels as well as the COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜19 fear and perception of control (COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜19 FPC) in patients attending dental emergency clinics during the COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜19 pandemic. Sociodemographic, dental and medical data was obtained from the participants. A face-to-face questionnaire with questions referring to the reasons for the emergency dental visit, the visual pain scale, the Modified Dental Anxiety Scale (MDAS), and the COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜19 Fear and Perception of Control Scale (COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜19 FPCS) as well as additional questions concerning bruxism and a previous diagnosis of anxiety/panic attacks or depression was administered. The Ãâ€¡2 test was used to analyze the data. A total of 1,439 patients were included in the study. The most common reason for the dental visit was pain (47.5%). The prevalence of DA was 5.1% (74/1,439). A significant association was found between DA and gender (p = 0.020). The incidence of severe pain was higher in patients with DA than in those without DA (p = 0.002). No significant differences in the MDAS scores were found between patients with and without a chronic disease (p = 0.804), with regard to the educational status (p = 0.364), or between the age groups (p = 0.600). The prevalence of a 'strongly agree' response to all questions in COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜19 FPCS was higher in patients with DA as compared to those without DA. Females and patients with severe pain were more likely to exhibit DA. In general, patients with DA strongly agreed with the statements of COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜19 FPCS, which may indicate a correlation between the 2 scales.","BerberoÃ„Å¸lu, KoÃƒÂ§, Boyacioglu, AkÃƒÂ§iÃƒÂ§ek, Ã„Â°riaÃ„Å¸aÃƒÂ§, DoÃ„Å¸an, Ãƒâ€“zgÃƒÂ¼ven, Zengin, Dural, Avcu","https://doi.org/10.17219/dmp/139042","20211117","SARS-CoV-2; Turkey; coronavirus; dental care; fear; visual pain scale","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-18","",22157,""

Methods This cross-sectional study gathered 2018 adolescents throughout Indonesia from April 22nd-28th 2020. The questionnaire was spread through social media and included Kessler-10 Psychological Distress scale and closed-ended questions about the risk and protective factors. The results were analyzed using Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Logistic Regression. Results The participants were mostly males (91.8%) with a median age of 19. The results showed 54.1% experienced varying degrees of distress. All variables were significantly related with psychological distress during Mann-Whitney-U and Kruskal-Wallis test.

"Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Among Nurses During the COVID-19 Wave III: Results of a Cross-Sectional Assessment","The current study was aimed to evaluate depression, anxiety, and stress among nurses during the COVID-19 (wave III) at a public hospital in Quetta city, Pakistan. By using the validated Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale - 21, three hundred and twenty-five nurses practicing at the Sandeman Provincial Hospital, Quetta were approached for data collection. Through SPSS, both descriptive and inferential statistics were used during data analysis. Chi-square test was used to assess the goodness-of-fit between observed values and demographic variables. The factors that were significantly associated with depression, anxiety, and stress were further assessed by binary logistic regression analysis. The statistical significance was set at 0.05. Out of the 325 nurses, 297 participated in the study with a response rate of 91.3%. Mild depression and stress were reported in the current cohort of nurses (6.00 Ã‚Â± 5.30 and 8.01 Ã‚Â± 4.47), respectively. The mean anxiety score was 6.68 Ã‚Â± 4.86 indicating moderate anxiety among the study respondents. Marital status, working department, and job experience were significantly associated with depression, anxiety, and stress with moderate effect size (&gt;0.3). The logistic regression reported department in which nurses were stationed (adjusted OR = 2.54, 95% CI = 1.118-1.415, p &lt; 0.001) and job experience (adjusted OR = 1.004, 95% CI = 1.001-1.215, p = 0.002) as significant predictors of depression, anxiety and stress. Nurses working in the corona ward were more likely to develop depression, anxiety and stress by a factor of 2.54 and married nurses with a factor of 1.004 provided controlling other confounding factors. Moderate depression, anxiety, and stress were observed among nurses and it calls for hospital management to consider interventions for all nurses irrespective of their present working departments. Facilitating continuous and comprehensive support mechanisms aimed at protecting nurses' mental health is of great importance during pandemics. The findings of the study have some clear suggestions for mental health advocacy among nurses that are essential for improving the quality of services and patients' safety.","Nadeem, Sadiq, Raziq, Iqbal, Haider, Saleem, Bashaar","https://doi.org/10.2147/JMDH.S338104","20211117","COVID wave III; anxiety; cross-sectional analysis; depression; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-18","",22159,""
"Association of Conflict-Affected Environment on Ethiopian Students' Mental Health and Its Correlates During COVID-19 Era","Ethiopia has seen the largest number of conflict-induced displacement. Mental disturbance has been identified as a major public health concern among conflict-affected people, including students. Due to the effect of continuous unfold of the COVID-19 epidemic in the conflicted affected setting, the mental health problem tends to be increased. This creates a double burden for students from conflict affected setting after school re-opening. As a result, the goal of this research was to evaluate the mental health impact and its correlates in students from conflict affected setting, Ethiopia. To assess the association of conflict-affected environment on Ethiopian students' mental health and its correlates during COVID-19 era. From April 1 to 30, 2021, an institutional-based cross-sectional survey was undertaken. A total sample of 795 students were participated through a systematic random sampling technique. The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale was used to assess mental distress (K10). The correlation between outcome and explanatory variables was investigated using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. A total of 795 people were examined, with a 100% response rate. Mental distress was reported about 59.4% with a 95% CI of 57% to 62.9%. Conflicted related sexual abuse (AOR = 4.1, 95% CI 2.37 to 6.94), witnessed shooting (AOR = 3.49, 95% CI 2.7 to 5.89), threat to security and safety (AOR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.29 to 3.87), being female (AOR = 3.01, 95% CI 1.61 to 5.44), and poor academic performance (AOR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.08 to 4.08) were found to be substantially correlated. Students from conflict-affected areas are at high risk of mental distress. Therefore, the ministry of health, ministry of education of Ethiopia and humanitarian organizations should work collaboratively in providing consistent school-based psychosocial support and appropriate intervention for students.","Madoro, Mengistu, Molla","https://doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S338073","20211117","COVID 19; Ethiopia; conflict affected setting; mental health; student","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-18","",22160,""
"Unexplained mortality during the US COVID-19 pandemic: retrospective analysis of death certificate data and critical assessment of excess death calculations","Cause-of-death discrepancies are common in respiratory illness-related mortality. A standard epidemiological metric, excess all-cause death, is unaffected by these discrepancies but provides no actionable policy information when increased all-cause mortality is unexplained by reported specific causes. To assess the contribution of unexplained mortality to the excess death metric, we parsed excess deaths in the COVID-19 pandemic into changes in explained versus unexplained (unreported or unspecified) causes. Retrospective repeated cross-sectional analysis, US death certificate data for six influenza seasons beginning October 2014, comparing population-adjusted historical benchmarks from the previous two, three and five seasons with 2019-2020. 48 of 50 states with complete data. 16.3Ã¢â‚¬â€°million deaths in 312 weeks, reported in categories-all causes, top eight natural causes and respiratory causes including COVID-19. Change in population-adjusted counts of deaths from seasonal benchmarks to 2019-2020, from all causes (ie, total excess deaths) and from explained versus unexplained causes, reported for the season overall and for time periods defined a priori: pandemic awareness (19 January through 28 March); initial pandemic peak (29 March through 30 May) and pandemic post-peak (31 May through 26 September). Depending on seasonal benchmark, 287Ã¢â‚¬â€°957-306Ã¢â‚¬â€°267 excess deaths occurred through September 2020: 179Ã¢â‚¬â€°903 (58.7%-62.5%) attributed to COVID-19; 44Ã¢â‚¬â€°022-49 311 (15.2%-16.1%) to other reported causes; 64Ã¢â‚¬â€°032-77 054 (22.2%-25.2%) unexplained (unspecified or unreported cause). Unexplained deaths constituted 65.2%-72.5% of excess deaths from 19 January to 28 March and 14.1%-16.1% from 29 March through 30 May. Unexplained mortality contributed substantially to US pandemic period excess deaths. Onset of unexplained mortality in February 2020 coincided with previously reported increases in psychotropic use, suggesting possible psychiatric or injurious causes. Because underlying causes of unexplained deaths may vary by group or region, results suggest excess death calculations provide limited actionable information, supporting previous calls for improved cause-of-death data to support evidence-based policy.","Fairman, Goodlet, Rucker, Zawadzki","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-050361","20211117","COVID-19; epidemiology; health informatics; mental health; public health; statistics &amp; research methods","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-18","",22161,""
"Epidemiology, management and the associated burden of mental health illness, atopic and autoimmune conditions, and common infections in alopecia areata: protocol for an observational study series","Alopecia areata (AA) is a common cause of immune-mediated non-scarring hair loss. Links between AA and common mental health, autoimmune and atopic conditions, and common infections have previously been described but remain incompletely elucidated and contemporary descriptions of the epidemiology of AA in the UK are lacking. Retrospective study series using a large population-based cohort (5.2 million) from the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) database, exploring four themes: AA epidemiology, mental health comorbidities, autoimmune/atopic associations and common infections.In the epidemiology theme, we will describe the incidence and point prevalence of AA overall and by age, sex and sociodemographic factors. Healthcare utilisation (primary care visits and secondary care referrals) and treatments for AA will also be assessed. In the mental health theme, we will explore the prevalence and incidence of mental health conditions (anxiety, depressive episodes, recurrent depressive disorder, adjustment disorder, agoraphobia, self-harm and parasuicide) in people with AA compared with matched controls. We will also explore the mental health treatment patterns (medication and psychological interventions), time off work and unemployment rates. Within the autoimmune/atopic associations theme, we will examine the prevalence of atopic (atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, asthma) and autoimmune conditions (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, coeliac disease, type 1 diabetes, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Graves' disease, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), polymyalgia rheumatica, SjÃƒÂ¶gren's syndrome, psoriasis, vitiligo, multiple sclerosis, pernicious anaemia) in people with AA compared with matched controls. We will also estimate the incidence of new-onset atopic and autoimmune conditions after AA diagnosis. Within the common infections theme, we will examine the incidence of common infections (respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, acute bronchitis, influenza, skin infection, urinary tract infection, genital infections, gastrointestinal infection, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, meningitis, COVID-19) in people with AA compared with matched controls.

"The mental well-being and coping strategies of Canadian adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative, cross-sectional study","Qualitative research is lacking on the mental well-being of adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to explore the feelings and emotions adolescents experienced during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and the coping strategies they identified and employed to manage those emotions. Participants living in Canada aged 13-19 years were recruited through social media platforms and youth-serving organizations. Qualitative data were gathered from 2 open-ended questions included in a youth-informed cross-sectional online survey: ""What feelings and emotions have you experienced around the pandemic?"" and ""What coping strategies have you used during the pandemic?"" We collected data from June 2020 to September 2020. A summative content analysis was undertaken to analyze survey responses inductively. A total of 1164 open-ended responses from Canadian adolescents (<i>n</i> = 851; mean age 15.6, standard deviation 1.7, yr) were analyzed. We identified 3 major themes within the category of feelings and emotions associated with the pandemic: sociospatial and temporal disconnections, emotional toll of the pandemic and positives amid the pandemic. Within the category of coping strategies used during the pandemic, 2 major themes were identified: connecting online and outdoors, and leisure and health-promoting activities. Although the emotional toll of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic is evident, participants in our study adopted various positive coping strategies to mitigate their distress, including physical activity, safe peer interactions and hobbies. The results have important implications for public health policy and practice during pandemic times, emphasizing the importance of accessible mental health resources for those experiencing psychological distress.","Ferguson, Coen, Tobin, Martin, Seabrook, Gilliland","https://doi.org/10.9778/cmajo.20210042","20211117","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-18","",22163,""
"Acute mental health service use following onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario, Canada: a trend analysis","The extent to which heightened distress during the COVID-19 pandemic translated to increases in severe mental health outcomes is unknown. We examined trends in psychiatric presentations to acute care settings in the first 12 months after onset of the pandemic. This was a trends analysis of administrative population data in Ontario, Canada. We examined rates of hospitalizations and emergency department visits for mental health diagnoses overall and stratified by sex, age and diagnostic grouping (e.g., mood disorders, anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders), as well as visits for intentional self-injury for people aged 10 to 105 years, from January 2019 to March 2021. We used Joinpoint regression to identify significant inflection points after the onset of the pandemic in March 2020. Among the 12 968 100 people included in our analysis, rates of mental health-related hospitalizations and emergency department visits declined immediately after the onset of the pandemic (peak overall decline of 30% [hospitalizations] and 37% [emergency department visits] compared to April 2019) and returned to near prepandemic levels by March 2021. Compared to April 2019, visits for intentional self-injury declined by 33% and remained below prepandemic levels until March 2021. We observed the largest declines in service use among adolescents aged 14 to 17 years (55% decline in hospitalizations, 58% decline in emergency department visits) and 10 to 13 years (56% decline in self-injury), and for those with substance-related disorders (33% decline in emergency department visits) and anxiety disorders (61% decline in hospitalizations). Contrary to expectations, the abrupt decline in acute mental health service use immediately after the onset of the pandemic and the return to near prepandemic levels that we observed suggest that changes and stressors in the first 12 months of the pandemic did not translate to increased service use. Continued surveillance of acute mental health service use is warranted.","Saunders, Toulany, Deb, Strauss, Vigod, Guttmann, Chiu, Huang, Fung, Chen, Kurdyak","https://doi.org/10.9778/cmajo.20210100","20211117","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-18","",22164,""
"Impact of the first COVID-19 outbreak on mental health service utilisation at a Dutch mental health centre: retrospective observational study","Previous studies into mental health service utilisation during the COVID-19 pandemic are limited to a few countries or specific type of service. In addition, data on changes in telepsychiatry are currently lacking. We aimed to investigate whether the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with changes in mental health service utilisation, including telepsychiatry, and how these changes were distributed among patients with mental illness during the first COVID-19 outbreak. This retrospective study obtained routinely assessed healthcare data from a large Dutch mental healthcare institute. Data from the second quarter of 2020 (the first COVID-19 outbreak period) were compared with the pre-pandemic period between January 2018 and March 2020. Time-series analyses were performed with the quasi-Poisson generalised linear model, to examine the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown and the overall trend of mental health service utilisation per communication modality and diagnostic category. We analysed 204 808 care contacts of 28 038 patients. The overall number of care contacts in the second quarter of 2020 remained the same as in the previous 2 years, because the number of video consultations significantly increased (B = 2.17, P = 0.488 Ãƒâ€” 10-3) as the number of face-to-face out-patient contacts significantly decreased (B = -0.98, P = 0.011). This was true for all different diagnostic categories, although this change was less pronounced in patients with psychotic disorders. Diminished face-to-face out-patient contacts were well-compensated by the substantial increase of video consultations during the first COVID-19 outbreak in The Netherlands. This increase was less pronounced for psychotic disorders. Further research should elucidate the need for disorder-specific digital mental healthcare delivery.","Chow, Noorthoorn, Wierdsma, van der Horst, de Boer, Guloksuz, Luykx","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.1049","20211117","COVID-19; Psychotic disorders; face-to-face out-patient contact; mental health service utilisation; telepsychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-18","",22165,""
"'Dove Confident Me Indonesia: Single Session': study protocol for a randomised controlled trial to evaluate a school-based body image intervention among Indonesian adolescents","Due to the prevalence and associated adverse health consequences of negative body image among adolescents globally, there is a need to develop acceptable, effective, and scalable interventions. School-based body image interventions delivered by trained teachers show promise in reducing negative body image in adolescents. However, there is currently a lack of evidenced-based body image interventions for use in low-Ã‚Â and middle-income countries (LMICs). This paper outlines a protocol for the development and evaluation of Dove Confident MeÃ‚Â Indonesia: Single Session, a single-session, teacher-led body image intervention for Indonesian adolescents. The effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated using a cluster randomised controlled trial design. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the trial will be conducted online. Trained teachers or school guidance counsellors will deliver the intervention. Self-report questionnaires will be collected at three time points: baseline, post-intervention, and two-month follow-up. The primary outcome is body esteem. Secondary outcomes are internalisation of appearance ideals, mood, engagement in life activities, tendency to engage in appearance comparisons, and skin shade satisfaction. A minimum of 1000 participants will provide 95% power to detect small-to-medium intervention effects. To account for attrition and potential internet issues, the sample will comprise of 2000 Indonesian adolescents in grades 7-9, attending state junior high schools in Surabaya, East Java. Quantitative and qualitative data on acceptability of the intervention will also be collected from teachers and students. Additionally, fidelity of lesson implementation will be assessed. This project received ethical approval from the Universitas Indonesia and the University of the West of England. The intervention will be disseminated in junior high schools throughout Indonesia via UNICEF's Life Skills Education (LSE) programme, which will be freely available for teachers to download. This paper presents Dove Confident MeÃ‚Â Indonesia: Single Session, a culturally adapted school-based intervention designed to improve Indonesian adolescents' body image. It details the plan for evaluation, highlighting the strengths and limitations of the proposed study design.

People worldwide are experiencing increased stress, negative affect, and posttraumatic stress symptoms, which may lead to eating problems. The purpose of this study was to explore the impact of the perceived severity of COVID-19 on eating problems and the mediating effects of stress/negative affect/posttraumatic stress symptoms both at the personal level and interpersonal level. <b>Methods:</b> During the COVID-19 outbreak, a total of 108 college students were recruited to report their perceived severity of COVID-19, stress, negative affect, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and eating problems three times a day for seven consecutive days using Ecological Momentary Assessment. <b>Results:</b> State perceived severity of COVID-19 predicted fewer subsequent eating problems in daily life at the personal level. Both state negative affect and posttraumatic stress symptoms were positively associated with eating problems in daily life. At the interpersonal level, trait-like perceived severity of COVID-19, stress, negative affect, and posttraumatic stress symptoms were positively associated with overall eating problems. There were no mediating effects of stress/negative affect/posttraumatic stress symptoms on the relations between perceived severity of COVID-19 and eating problems at the personal/interpersonal level. <b>Conclusions:</b> The perceived severity of COVID-19, stress, negative affect, and posttraumatic stress symptoms might increase the risk of eating problems.","Sheng, Yang, Zhou, Liu, Xu","https://doi.org/10.1177/00332941211045315","20211117","COVID-19; Ecological Momentary Assessment; eating problems; negative affect; posttraumatic stress symptoms; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-18","",22167,""
