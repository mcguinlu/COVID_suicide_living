"Understanding mental health trends during COVID-19 pandemic in the United States using network analysis","The emergence of COVID-19 in the United States resulted in a series of federal and state-level lock-downs and COVID-19 related health mandates to manage the spread of the virus. These policies may negatively impact the mental health state of the population. This study focused on the trends in mental health indicators following the COVID-19 pandemic amongst four United States geographical regions, and political party preferences. Indicators of interest included feeling anxious, feeling depressed, and worried about finances. Survey data from Delphi Group in Carnegie Mellon University were analyzed using clustering algorithms and dynamic connectome obtained from sliding window analysis. United States maps were generated to observe spatial trends and identify communities with similar mental health and COVID-19 trends. Between March 3rd, 2021 and January 10th, 2022, states in the south geographic region showed similar trends for reported values of feeling anxious and worried about finances. There were no identifiable communities resembling geographical regions or political party affiliation for the feeling depressed indicator. We observed a high degree of correlation among southern states as well as within republican states, where the highest correlation values from the dynamic connectome analysis for feeling anxious and feeling depressed variables seemingly overlapped with an increase in COVID-19 related cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and rapid spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant.","Hiroko Kobayashi; Raul Saenz-Escarcega; Alexander Fulk; Folashade Agusto","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.10.10.22280933","20221013","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-14","",39102,""
"The effects of the 2019 coronavirus on the mental health of healthcare workers in nursing home settings","The research project utilized an explorative, descriptive method that required the administration of a Pre-COVID Employee Wellness Questionnaire, a Present Employee Wellness Questionnaire to assess the health care workers feelings before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, the Administration Questionnaire measured each facility's challenges from a financial, work environment, and staffing perspective. The use of the Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale (PHQ8), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and the Generalize Anxiety Disorder Screener (GAD-7) assessed symptoms of depression, insomnia, and anxiety in health care workers that have treated COVID-19 patients in a nursing home settings.

"A single case study of an alternative school: School-based professionals supporting adolescents with anxiety through the COVID-19 pandemic","Due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, the shift from in person to remote learning happened abruptly for both educators and students requiring an adjustment in education. Both teachers and school-based mental health professionals were uncertain how to support the various needs of students. The current study examined the remote supports provided to adolescent students with anxiety in a therapeutic day school through interviews with educators regarding their opinions on remote-based supports through the COVD-19 pandemic. Staff's recognition of anxiety, remote learning challenges experienced by students and teachers, necessary supports through remote learning that were unable to be provided, and faculty's response to remote learning and supporting families were explored as well. A total of 12 school staff were participants in this research. Data were collected by conducting remote-based interviews through Zoom with each staff member. The results revealed that while staff were supporting and accommodating adolescent students with anxiety along with providing interventions, there was still the desire for training on remote-based supports for students. In addition, results indicated that there were several circumstances in the home setting, which teachers and school-based professionals were unable to control. This had an impact on both students and educators throughout remote learning. Professional development and consistent and clear communication were needed for school-based professionals to feel supported and prepared to provide supports to their adolescent students with anxiety. However, several benefits of remote learning were highlighted by educators indicating that there were positive outcomes. The findings extended previous research on remote learning and the challenges experienced by educators and students. Results provided valuable evidence on how to support adolescent students with anxiety in a remote setting.

"The effects of the covid 19 pandemic on the elderly with depression","Introduction Depression, as a psychiatric entity, has a number of emotional components. These are mainly known among patients over the age of 65: sadness, physical and mental exhaustion, irritability, feeling of emptiness and loneliness. Objectives The main objective of this study is to detect if the effects of the Covid 19 pandemic over 65 years of age such as fear, excessive anxiety, lack of motivation, uncertainty and environmental changes, isolation (resulting in sleep disorders, appetite and attention) caused the exacerbation of depression. Methods This study included a total number of 126 patients, each over 65, hospitalized at the Psychiatric Hospital â€œElisabeta Doamnaâ€ in Galati in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. They were diagnosed with depression, according to ICD-10 and the Hamilton scale. Results All data obtained were centralized and used to detect whether, in Gala<U+021B>i, the lockdown impacted the number of admissions of people over 65, diagnosed with depression, with an average age of 68,62. There is an increased incidence of female patients (75%), thus reporting an odds ratio of 3:1. The incidence of cases reported during the months of presentation is as follows: January (24%), February (28.8%), March (14.4%), April (3.2%), May (5.6%), June (23.2%). Conclusions Environmental factors, unique in this situation, isolation, social distancing and changes in the daily routine, each associated with this global epidemiological crisis determinated a decrease of the number of depressive elderly admissions between March 15th and May 15th.","Radulescu, I.

"Insomnia and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic a retrospective study on anxiety and sleep disorders among psychiatric patients admitted at â€želisabeta doamnaâ€ hospital galati, romania","Introduction In public mental health there are widespread concerns about the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on psychiatric patients. Anxiety and sleep disorders are the focal point in admissions for psychiatric care in individuals that are impacted by these changes. Objectives The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the prevalence of anxiety and sleep disorders among the patients admitted to our hospital. The state of pandemia was declared on the 11thÂ of March but it had already become a main stream media subject in our country at the beginning of the month. Methods A retrospective study was performed at the Psychiatric Hospital â€˜Elisabeta Doamnaâ€™ Galati, using the exact same period, between 01.03 and 30.09, in both 2019 and 2020. ICD-10 criteria were used and pacients with either F41.x or F51.x as discharge diagnosis were included. Results In total, 7638 cases were admitted during the period in 2019, of which 621 (8,13%) had anxiety disorders and 225 (2,94%) sleep disorders. In comparison in 2020 out of 4050 admitted patients, the number had risen to 1003 (24,76%) anxiety disorders and 388 (9,58%) sleep disorders. Conclusions Analysis of the data shows a three times increase in the percentage of both classes of disorders among our patients. Even considering the lower admition rates, there is a clear shift in the general profile of our average pacient and this has to be taken into consideration in the long and short term treatment of any psychiatric patient.","Radulescu, I.

"New mental health laws in bosnia and herzegovina- step towards in our practice","Introduction Establishing broad spectrum of new mental health services in whole Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) existing mental health laws in both entities needed to be upgrade according positive results of the mental health reform in the country. Previous laws were exclusivelly oriented on protection of rights of the people with mental health disorders in (mainly) psychiatric institutions and were progressive and new in the period of their implementation (2001-2004). Objectives Since 2010 main reform processes had direction to community mental health care and developed positive movement with implementing new services oriented to patients and their needs/continuity of care. For example case management and occupational therapy are part of daily work in whole country and standards established trough accreditation process lead to uniform approach in community work in the area of mental health. Methods Comparative analysis of laws in BH concerning mental health. Results Carefuly and good preparation for pronounce of new Mental Health Law both in Republic of Srpska and Federation of BH were supported from both entities (task forces, drafts and proposition of the law and public discussion) and they are formaly supported in both entities parliaments in 2020 (prolonged since COVID-19 situation). In both laws is more emphasised role of commnity services, prevention, and post-hospital rehabilitation as continuity of care.

"Perinatal depression and developmental risk of the infant: Analysis of a clinical sample and assessment of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction Studies on large samples agree on the negative impact of maternal perinatal depression (PD) on childâ€™s cognitive development. Early experience with insensitive maternal interactions appears to be predictive of poorer cognitive functioning. These children present a higher risk for the onset of socioemotional development, nutrition, growth and sleep disorders. Research on Covid-19 pandemic suggests that families, particularly mothers, may be at increased risk of psychological distress. Objectives This study evaluates the effect of perinatal depression on child development and the impact of distress caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods We designed a case-control study comparing, during Covid-19 pandemic, a group-A of children of mothers with PD (n=19), with a group-B of children of healthy mothers (n=21). The age of the children recruited was 4-35 months. Participating mothers underwent DP3-Interview and the socioemotional and adaptive-behavior Bayleyâ€™s scales by telephone and completed an online survey (IES-R). Results We found significantly lower scores on the Bayley socioemotional scale and in all the DP3-scales, in group-A. There is an inversely proportional correlation between the age of these children and overall development score of the DP3. On the IES-R scale, the medium scores in both groups show no psychological distress as a consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic, although mothers with PD show borderline total scores and higher hyperarousal scale values. Conclusions This study confirms that PD is a risk factor for the onset of disorders in all areas of the childâ€™s development. Mothers with PD are less likely to manage psychological distress secondary to the pandemic. Disclosure No significant relationships.","Pucci, C.; O. P, M.

"â€œYoung people are not invincibleâ€: What drives young peopleâ€™s health behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic in greece?","Introduction The illusion of invulnerability has been linked to lower perceived risk and increased engagement in risky behaviors among youth. Therefore, it has been purported to influence young peopleâ€™s poor adherence to public health measures aiming to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Concomitantly, beliefs about the virus and mental health may also shape public health behaviours. Objectives To investigate the role of beliefs, perceived invincibility and mental health status in explaining frequency of hand-washing and hours outside the house among youth in Greece Methods A total of 1.899 students, aged between 18-29 years old, were recruited from the main universities of the country. An online questionnaire entailing: (i) popular beliefs about COVID-19, (ii) the DASS-21, (iii) the Adolescent Invincibility Tool and (iv) queries about health behaviours, was distributed during the lockdown period. Results Most participants reported washing their hands rarely/never within a day (78.6%) and spending 2-6 hours outside the house (68.1%). Handwashing was largely influenced by mental health [OR = 0.94, 95%CI= 0.91 â€“ 0.98 for stress;OR = 0.96, 95%CI = 0.93-0.99 for anxiety and OR = 1.05, 95%CI= 1.02-1.08 for depression];while hours outside the house by perceptions that the virus is out of control [OR=0.76, 95%CI = 0.61-0.95], manufactured [OR=1.21, 95%CI = 1.53, 95%CI =1.21 â€“ 1.93] and airborne [OR= 0.78, 95%CI = 0.64-0.95].

"Prejudice against and desired social distance from refugees, people with mental illness and patients with COVID-19 in athens","Introduction Stigma is omnipresent in human societies, both globally and historically;while it is also discerned in other primates. On these grounds, it has been suggested to be the product of natural selection and therefore to protect against threats to effective group functioning. Nonetheless, in contemporary society, stigma raises fundamental ethical concerns, while it actually impinges on public health Objectives To explore prejudicial attitudes and desired social distance from recovered COVID-19 patients, people with mental illness and refugees in Athens region. Methods A convenience sample of 360 residents of Athens region participated in the study, after being recruited from social media. The questionnaire was distributed online and encompassed: i) the Prejudicial Attitudes Survey, (ii) the Social Distance scale, (iii) the Interpersonal Reactivity Index and information about respondentsâ€™ socio-demographic characteristics and personal experience with the three population subgroups. The stigma measures were included three times, one for each out-group. Results Repeated ANOVA revealed that negative attitudes were predominantly expressed for refugees. On the contrary, positive attitudes were predominantly expressed for people with mental illness. Interestingly, desired social distance was greater from people with mental illness (mean = 32.37) compared to refugees (mean = 25.47) and recovered COVID-19 patients (mean = 24.17). Conclusions Stigma towards people with mental illness and refugees is still prevalent in Greece. Anti-stigma efforts should target prejudices in the case of refugees and social distance in the case of mental illness.

"Insights from electronic health record data to improve mental health service delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background Remote consultation technology has been rapidly adopted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, some healthcare settings have faced barriers in implementation. We present a study to investigate changes in rates of remote consultation during the pandemic using a large electronic health record (EHR) dataset. Methods The Clinical Record Interactive Search tool (CRIS) was used to examine de-identified EHR data of people receiving mental healthcare in South London, UK. Data from around 37,500 patients were analysed for each week from 7thÂ January 2019 and 20thÂ September 2020 using linear regression and locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) to investigate changes in the number of clinical contacts (in-person, remote or non-attended) with mental healthcare professionals and prescribing of antipsychotics and mood stabilisers. The data are presented in an interactive dashboard: http://rpatel.co.uk/TelepsychiatryDashboard. Results The frequency of in-person contacts was substantially reduced following the onset of the pandemic (ÃŸ coefficient: -5829.6 contacts, 95% CI -6919.5 to -4739.6, p&lt;0.001), while the frequency of remote contacts increased significantly (ÃŸ coefficient: 3338.5 contacts, 95% CI 3074.4 to 3602.7, p&lt;0.001). Rates of remote consultation were lower in older adults than in working age adults, children and adolescents. Despite the increase in remote contact, antipsychotic and mood stabiliser prescribing remained at similar levels. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with a marked increase in remote consultation, particularly among younger patients. However, there was no evidence that this has led to changes in prescribing. Further work is needed to support older patients in accessing remote mental healthcare.

"Clinical profile of patients admitted in an acute psychiatric ward before and during the COVID-19 lockdown","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic entailed several changes in health and medical assistance, economy, and lifestyle. In the Acute Psychiatric Ward of the Hospital ClÃ­nic of Barcelona, the implementation of restrictive measures was necessary in order to ensure patientsâ€™ safety. Objectives To compare clinical profiles and course of hospitalization of patients admitted before and during the COVID-19 lockdown in our Acute Psychiatric Ward. Methods All patients admitted from January 7thÂ to February 25thÂ and from March 19thÂ to May 7thÂ of 2020 in the Acute Psychiatric Hospitalization Unit of Hospital ClÃ­nic of Barcelona, Spain, were retrospectively included for analysis and divided into two groups according to the period when they were admitted. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, 23.0 version. Results A total of 117 inpatients were included (73 admitted before lockdown and 44 during lockdown), being 50.4% male, with a mean age of 42.4 (SD 15.73). Patients from the first group presented a significantly higher proportion of antidepressants prescription at discharge (p&lt;0.05) and more substance use disorders (p&lt;0.05). Regarding the lockdown group, 51% of patients manifested COVID-19-related stress. Time of hospitalization was significantly lower in the lockdown group (p&lt;0.05), even though a significantly higher proportion of patients were discharged at home (p&lt;0.05) compared with the first group. Conclusions The situation of lockdown led to a series of changes in our unit and also in the profile of patients admitted, having shorter admissions, lower prescription of antidepressants, and often COVID-related stress.

"On the continuity of rehabilitation and meeting the patientsâ€™ needs: Online psychosocial treatment during the COVID-19 outbreak","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged our model of face-to-face psychosocial treatment and rehabilitation format. To adapt to the current situation, as professionals, we have decided to transform the format into a virtual one that will offer the continuity of rehabilitation and therapy. Two clinical psychologists held online sessions and a special chat created in the IM messenger where patients could safely interact with each other. Objectives This pilot study aimed to evaluate the effect of online sessions in a sample of outpatients engaged in rehabilitation programs. Methods Data from 50 patients (F20-F25, aged from 25 to 45) treated with a new online psychosocial program, including i. psychoeducation, ii. learning skills of the behavior under the circumstances of isolation, iii. training skills of effective communication and emotional regulation, and assessed for depression, anxiety, hopelessness, hostility (BDI, STAI, BHS, BDHI), and self-esteem, were analyzed for this study. Motivational enhancement techniques were also used to engage the patients in this new treatment format. Results According to the preliminary data, we point out a statistically meaningful reduction in depression (p=0,003), anxiety (p=0,001), and hostility (<U+0440>=0,001);self-esteem, evaluated with the Dembo-Rubinstein method, was improved (p=0,002);the T Wilcoxon criterion used for rating the magnitude.

"Self-reported mental health among individuals with mental disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background Individuals with mental illness may be particularly vulnerable to the negative impact that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic seems to have on mental health. Most prior studies on this topic are however limited by non-random sampling, lack of information on non-respondents, and self-reported diagnoses. Here, we aimed at overcoming these limitations by means of random sampling in a population of clinically diagnosed patients, acquisition of clinical and socio-demographic data on non-respondents, and weighting of results informed by attrition. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional questionnaire-based online survey inviting six-thousand randomly drawn patients from the psychiatric services of the Central Denmark Region. They survey data were merged with sociodemographic- and clinical data from medical records on all invitees, which enabled analysis of attrition and weighting of results. The questionnaire included the 18-item Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-18), the 5-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5), and 14 questions evaluating the perceived severity of symptoms during the four-week nationwide lockdown of Denmark in March/April 2020 â€“ using the pre-pandemic period as reference. Reasons for worsening or improvement in mental health during lockdown were also reported. Results The preliminary results are as follows: The response rate was Ëœ20%. Approximately half the respondents reported that their mental health had deteriorated during lockdown, while the other half reported either no change (Ëœ33%) or improvement (Ëœ16%). The most commonly reported reasons for deterioration in mental health were disruption of routines and loneliness. Conclusion The final results will be shown at the conference.

"Early findings from periscope (Pan-European response to the impacts of COVID-19 and future pandemics and epidemics)","Body The H2020/PERISCOPE project, including 32 partners from European universities & agencies, began 1st November 2020 and will last 36 months. The overarching objectives of PERISCOPE are to map and analyse the unintended impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak;develop solutions and guidance for policymakers and health authorities on how to mitigate the impact of the outbreak;enhance Europeâ€™s preparedness for future similar events;and reflect on the future multi-level governance in the health as well as other domains affected by the outbreak. During this session we will report about early lessons learnt from the mapping and assessments of the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on mental health at national and subnational level in the EU with respect to individuals, communities and societies. Further, we will comment on their comparability. The aim is to explore differences between countries regarding the occurrence of mental ill health, and especially the impact on vulnerable groups, and how this is related to exposure to SARS-CoV-2, differences in policies over time, and effects on the economy. We will reflect on the short- and long-term consequences on mental health and health inequalities, report on the ongoing development of holistic policy guidelines for health authorities & other authorities, and from the analysis of multilevel governance, at local, regional and national level, memberstate â€“ EU-level, and EU - global governance level. PERISCOPE will continue collecting data and updating a common data â€Atlasâ€, which would lead the consortium to engage in modelling and experiments to provide â€œcontinuous nowcastingâ€ of the outbreak.

"The coronavirus pandemic impact on involuntary hospitalization","Introduction Compulsory admission is the last line of intervention in individuals who suffer from severe mental disorders, based on the principles of therapeutic need and social protection. In Portugal, the law configures this measure as a hospitalization by court order. The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is a global public health emergency, with multifaceted consequences for peopleâ€™s lives and health. Several studies are showing a great impact of the pandemic on the overall mental health. Objectives The aim is to assess the impact of the pandemic on the number of involuntary hospitalizations, their socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, and study the differences between 2019 and 2020. Methods Consultation of all patientâ€™s clinical files that were involuntarily admitted in Hospital MagalhÃ£es Lemos during 2019 and 2020. Statistical analysis of data. Results The authors claim to investigate the impact of the pandemic on involuntary hospitalizations, the factors of admission and decompensation and other clinical characteristics, by comparing the involuntary hospitalizations during 2019 and 2020. The authors believe that the number of compulsory admissions increased significantly with the pandemic. They also believe that factors such as increased or relapsed consumption of alcohol and drugs, suicide attempts, missed appointments and long-term injectable medication are at the root of this increase in 2020. Conclusions This study helps to analyze the impact of the new coronavirus on compulsory hospitalizations and allows to understand the main factors that aggravate the underlying pathologies. Thus, understanding the targets of greater attention from psychiatrists to avoid the decompensation of patients in times of pandemic in which we currently live.

"Use of brisk walking intervention to reduce stress among adults","Stress is a rampant healthcare problem affecting many adults in the United States. Common stressors entail challenges and pressures in work, family, and daily commitments. Recently, several studies have faulted the COVID-19 pandemic in increasing stress levels and associated comorbidities among healthcare workers and the public. Exposure to significant or chronic stress results in pathologic and deleterious health impacts such as mental health deterioration and acute exacerbations of chronic diseases such as hypertension. However, exercise interventions have emerged as a potential intervention for promoting mental wellness. However, literature is limited on the efficacy of the brisk walking intervention in promoting mental health by reducing stress outcomes. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to use brisk walking intervention to reduce stress among adults. The study utilized a quantitative quasi-experimental study, and the participants were recruited through convenience sampling. The interventional period was 30 days, and the main outcome was stress levels which were measured using a perceived stress scale questionnaire. The outcomes of the study revealed statistically significant reductions in stress outcomes after implementation of brisk walking (t (29) = 35.01, p &lt; .001). Therefore, brisk walking intervention can assist patients with stress to regain psychological wellness by promoting a significant recovery from stress outcomes.

"Alcohol consumption during COVID-19 pandemic: What have we learnt so far?","Introduction The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has many implications, one of them being alcohol consumption. The impact of long-term distancing measures in terms of alcohol use and misuse is yet unknown. Any increase, would not only add to the usual disease burden associated with alcohol, but also add to the COVID-19 load, given that alcohol use may weaken the immune response. Objectives To characterize and compare the pattern of alcohol consumption throughout the pandemic in patients with the diagnosis of Alcohol Use Disorder;to identify factors considered as most relevant in the increase of alcohol consumption. Methods We conducted a observational study in an outpatient population in Centro Hospitalar PsiquiÃ¡trico de Lisboa (Portugal) with diagnosis of Alcohol Use Disorder, 6 months after the pandemic lockdown. We characterized our sample regarding social, demographic and clinical categories. We applied auto-filled questionnaires, particularly: Mental Health Inventory (MHI), Positive Mental Health Scale (PMHS) and Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire (SADQ-C). Results A total of 65 patients were included. More than 30% changed their drinking habits because of the pandemic. Nearly half of these increased consumption, and half decreased (16% vs 14%). The increase affected particularly men, and was related with the severity of alcohol dependence, stress-related coping strategies and psycopathology;on the other hand, a lowered level of consumption based on the decrease of alcohol accessability and affordability. Conclusions The current situation is unique in terms of mass physical distancing and may trigger different behaviours that should be monitored.

"COVID-19 and psychiatric training: Results from the efpt country surveys","Introduction Several studies link COVID-19 and the associated lockdown and social-distancing measures to adverse mental health outcomes. In order to address this increase in mental health problems, adequate training of mental health care professionals is of the utmost importance. Objectives: To measure the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychiatric training in Europe and beyond. Methods: The European Federation of Psychiatric Trainees (EFPT) represents more than 20 000 trainees from over 30 European countries. Every year, country representatives, complete the â€˜Country Reportâ€™, which contains detailed information on psychiatric training in every (member) country. Results: In July 2020, representatives of 34 European and 9 non-European countries completed the survey. In 73% of countries, psychiatric trainees were assigned to COVID-19 wards, in 43% to emergency wards. In 25% of countries, trainees did not receive any training on COVID-19 prior to their assignment. Compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic, trainees reported a decrease in clinical supervision in 65% of countries. In 51% of countries, (parts of) formal psychiatric training was cancelled. Psychotherapy training was cancelled in 25% of countries. In the majority of countries both formal and psychotherapy training were given online, however in 56% trainees experienced difficulties to attend. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has had an extensive impact on psychiatric training in Europe and beyond. The EFPT calls upon policy makers and supervisors to minimize the impact of COVID-19 on psychiatric training in order to provide psychiatric trainees with adequate skills to deal with the mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"The psychological impact of COVID-19 and lockdown measures among a sample of italian patients with eating disorders: A longitudinal study","Introduction COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown greatly impact on mental health, especially on individuals with pre-existing psychiatric conditions. Objectives To explore the prevalence of specific psychiatric symptoms across a sample of patients with Eating Disorder (ED), compared to a group of healthy controls (HC), during the lockdown period in Italy, and to assess whether patientsâ€™ symptoms improved, persisted or worsened with the easing of the lockdown measures. Methods Study 1: 59 ED patients and 43 HC were recruited and completed, at the beginning of May 2020(t0), an online survey including: the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale â€“ 21 items (DASS-21), the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and few ad-hoc questions extracted from the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q). Study 2: 40 ED patients from Study 1 completed the same survey two months after t0 (t1). Results Study 1: ED patients scored significantly higher than HC at the DASS-21 (Total Score and subscales), the IES-R (Total Score and subscales) and the PSS. Moreover, they showed higher distress specifically related to food and their body. Study 2: at t1, levels of stress, anxiety and depression were not different than at t0, but symptoms related to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) improved, together with patientsâ€™ reported level of psychological wellbeing and specific ED symptomatology. Conclusions During lockdown, ED patients presented significantly higher levels of stress, anxiety, depression, PTSD-related symptoms, and ED-related symptoms than HC.

"Suicidal tendencies in university students during the COVID-19 outbreak","Introduction Suicidogenic effects COVID-19 pandemic are expected to reveal themselves not immediately, but within a longer period. Objectives To evaluate the prevalence of suicidal tendencies in university students during the COVID-19 outbreak and specify the psychosocial characteristics of the students with a low anti-suicidal barrier to mitigate their suicide risks. Methods The research was done via an on-line survey, which covered 536 students of both sexes (aged 21.46Â±2.95), who studied in Russian universities and who filled in a structured questionnaire during their distance learning due to COVID-19 outbreak. Results We revealed that 11.38% of the respondents (57.47% of whom are males) with a low anti-suicidal barrier showed suicidal tendencies by allowing the possibility of committing a suicide in a certain situation. Among them were more Russian students than international ones (p=.0272). They also certainly exceeded the students with the developed anti-suicidal barrier in taking alcohol (p=.0126), in underestimating their own health (p=.0053), in expressing happiness (p=.0001), and in degree of religious belief (p=.0001). They perceived the situation associated with the COVID-19 outbreak with a more strongly manifested anxiety due to the fear of their own infection with coronavirus (p=0.0347). At the same time, they acted less responsibly in following personal restrictive measures aimed to reduce the risk of infection (p=.0002). Conclusions Students with suicidal tendencies during the COVID-19 outbreak present a risk group in COVID-19 spread and infection.

"Prevalence and correlates of COVID-19 related anxiety among university students","Introduction COVID-19 is a disease with insufficiently studied diagnosis, therapy, and prevention that causes anxiety disorders in population. Objectives To evaluate prevalence and correlates of COVID-19-related anxiety in university students during the period of their distant learning due to COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The on-line survey of May 2020 covered 327 Russian university students aged 17-40. The questions concerned evaluation of threats, risks and acute problems faced by the students and their closest people in the situation of COVID-19 spread. We determined the anxiety level of the students by the degree of their concern about high risk of COVID-19 infection. Results We established that 17.1% of the students had maximal level of COVID-19-related anxiety that correlated with older age (r=.13), better academic performance (r=.12), expectation of higher COVID-19-related threat to their life (r=.57), to the closest peopleâ€™s health (r=.44), to the aged peopleâ€™s lives (r=.16). It correlated with a more serious approach to evaluating the COVID-19-related situation and dangers in the world (r=.19), in the country (r=.24), and in the region of their residence (r=.37). Students with a high anxiety level often saw in pandemic a threat to their way of life (r=.12), material wellbeing (r=.12), and plans for the future (r=.11). They more strictly obeyed the restrictions (r=.13) and they did not exclude a recurrence of COVID-19 type pandemics in the future (r=.17). Conclusions COVID-19 related anxiety is present in every sixth student and it correlates with older age and better academic performance.

"Comparison of psychiatric emergency service admission rates in an italian COVID-19 hospital during lockdown and last year","Introduction Italy has been one of the most affected countries by Covid-19 pandemic. Our University General Hospital, Policlinico of â€œTor Vergataâ€ (PTV) in Rome, has become a Covid Hub in order to manage the spread of the epidemic. Thus, our Psychiatric Emergency Service (PES)â€™s access has been partially limited. Direct indicators of PES activity, as admission rates, can be useful for evaluating the psychological impact of Covid epidemic. Objectives To assess psychiatric admittance rates to PES of PTV before and during Covid-19 global pandemic. Methods Data from our PES register have been obtained and analyzed. We compared all the psychiatric access during the trimester March â€“ May 2019 and 2020. All patients have been characterized according to clinical features. Results A marked reduction of the number of patients presenting to PES has been observed (76 patients) in the 57-day period (March 11â€“May 04, 2020) of lockdown compared to the same period in 2019 (266 patients). The cutback was visible for all diagnostic groups, except for â€œBorderline Personality Disorderâ€ diagnosis which have slightly increased. On the other hand, hospitalization rates in our psychiatric inpatients unit remained steady. Conclusions Although larger study are needed to understand the mental consequences of the lockdown experience, peopleâ€™s fear of potential infection might explain our results. Interestingly, personality disorder patients represent an exception to it, suggesting the importance of the clinical characteristics of fearless, engagement in dangerous behavior and detachment from reality. These findings might be helpful to improve psychosocial crisis interventions during the pandemic.","Nastro, F.

"â€œTelepsychiatry: Lessons from the COVID-19 pandemicâ€","Introduction Under the umbrella of e-Mental Health (eMH), Telepsychiatry (TP) keeps its place as the oldest and best-documented application. Legislative issues, and the concerns related to the quality of care and patient safety, have kept TP from broader adoption. COVID19 pandemic seems to be a turning point for TP as well as for the eMH in general. The use of TP has exploded as many regulatory barriers to its use have been temporarily lowered during the COVID-19 pandemic. What has to be done to sustain this momentum? Objectives -outline temporary changes in TP regulations made due to COVID19;-discuss which of these should be maintained, modified, or reversed;-suggest additional initiatives needed to facilitate patient and professional use of digital technology. Methods Examination of the use of digital technology in the light of regulatory, legislative, and other changes and initiatives made due to COVID 19. Results Among several policy changes, the most important is e.g. removal of the â€œoriginating siteâ€ rule so professionals can be paid for a remote appointment wherever the patient is, including in the patientâ€™s home. Further, professionals were allowed to serve patients through everyday communication technologies such as FaceTime, WhatsApp, Viber, or Skype, all compromising patient/data safety. Conclusions EPA is perfectly positioned to be the frontrunner for the required initiatives i.e. mandatory lectures related to eMH at medical educational institutions, launching of TP-competency training of mental health professionals, regulatory and statutory changes e.g. unified licensure regulations, etc that are crucial for modernizing mental health care delivery and preparation for future unprecedented events.

"Stress and anxiety among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in russia","Introduction Mental health of medical workers treating patients with COVID-19 is an issue of increasing concern worldwide, since previous epidemics have shown high levels of anxiety and stress in front-line healthcare professionals. The available data on stress and anxiety symptoms among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 are relatively limited and have not been evaluated in Russia yet. Objectives To evaluate stress and anxiety symptoms among healthcare workers directly involved in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with COVID-19 during the peak of disease outbreak in Russia. Methods The study was a cross-sectional hospital-based anonymous on-line survey in May 2020 of 1,090 healthcare workers practicing treatment of patients with COVID-19. Stress and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Russian versions of Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemic scale (SAVE-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scales. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the influence of different variables. Results The median scores on the GAD-7 and SAVE-9 were 5 and 14, respectively. 49.1% respondents had moderate and 21.9% had severe anxiety according to SAVE-9. 12.3% had severe anxiety, 13.2% had moderate according to GAD-7. Female gender and younger age were associated with higher level of anxiety according to regression model. Conclusions Our study has shown that healthcare workers in Russia practicing treatment of patients with COVID-19 reported high rates of stress and anxiety similar to other countries. Female gender, younger age and being a physician were associated with higher levels of anxiety.

"How COVID-19 related psycho-social stressors affect longevity","Introduction Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the literature on psychosocial stressors and psycho-social protective factors already clearly indicated that the two were linked in a multitude of ways to longevity. These ways include 1) directly through increased risk in suicides with respect to psycho-social stress or lack of connectivity 2) increased risk for psychopathologies such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and others, which in turn can decrease longevity in indirectly, and 3) a worse/healthier lifestyle that may be associated through decreased/improved social connectivity. With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ways in which these psychosocial factors could be impacted by policy came into focus. Attempting to quantify the potential future impact of such policies on longevity through psycho-social changes appeared necessary to allow better guidance of policy making. Objective: This presentation aims to leverage the experience gained from making a projection of the impact of pandemic mitigation strategies on longevity in the early advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results The authors model indicated the high need for measures that are protective of the general populationsâ€™ psychosocial health in the face of a pandemic and associated mitigation strategies. Discussion: This presentation will discuss issues concerning quantifications of the impact of COVID-19 related policy on psychosocial health. The assumptions necessary to arrive at projective models may be at odds with parts of the current culture in the field.

"Implementation and evaluation of a mindfulness based program for children in a school setting in france","Introduction Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) held within an academic context continue to develop at an international scale, and continue to show benefits for children, specifically on cognitive functioning and emotional regulation (Theurel, Gimbert, Gentaz, 2018). Objectives The aim of this study is to demonstrate the relevance of implementing MBIs within French elementary school settings, in order to promote mental health, positive pedagogy and quality of life. Methods This study utilizes the Belgian program â€œGestion des Ã©motions par la pratique de la Pleine Conscienceâ€ (Emotional regulation using Mindfulness practices) (Deplus, 2015) and compares an experimental group participating in 9 MBI sessions to a control group â€œwaiting listâ€. An interpretative phenomenological analysis at post-test investigates participantâ€™s perception on the effects of the intervention on familial and school climates. Results The results of this study have been highly impacted by COVID19 (confinement).Quantitative results reveal that 33% of the participants (n=6) show a decrease in depressive symptoms, 33% show no change and 33% show a slight increase, post-intervention (T2). Results also suggest a decrease in anhedonia in 50% of the participants. 50% of participants show an improvement with regards to worrying and hypersensitivity. Qualitative analysis puts forth perceived improvements on emotional regulation and mindfulness abilities of participants, which has shown to have positive effects on familial climate. Conclusions We estimate that the implementation of such a MBI in a school setting will favour the development of executive functions and emotional regulation, allowing children to develop resilience towards stress and anxious-depressive affects. We also expect the intervention to help develop socio-emotional abilities and well-being in French schools.","Monsillion, J.; Zebdi, R.; Romo, L.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Implementation+and+evaluation+of+a+mindfulness+based+program+for+children+in+a+school+setting+in+france","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists; 64(Suppl 1):S463-S463, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-14","",39130,""
"Childrenâ€™s mental health and the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction In the midst of a global pandemic with a rising death toll, the childrenÂ´s mental health can be easily overlooked in the countryâ€™s response. But this overlook would have devastating consequences for years to come. Objectives The objective of this research is to compare childrenâ€™s physical and mental development before, during and after the situation of social isolation caused by the pandemic of COVID-19. Methods The parents/guardians of 100 children aged between 0 and 5 years and 11 months old were asked to answer questions based on the ASQ-3 (Ages and Stages Questionnaire III), containing questions related to Communication, Gross Motor, Fine Motor, Problem Solving, and Personal-Social and ASQ- SE (Ages and Stages Questionnaires Social-Emotional) addressing issues of self-regulation, compliance, social-communication, adaptive functioning, autonomy, and affect. In addition, behavioral issues related to childrenâ€™s mental health will be included, such as: aggressiveness, insomnia, lack of appetite, apathy, sadness, tiredness, lack of interest, hyperactivity, manias, tantrum, morning among others. Child development data will be collected before and during quarantine / isolation and later, in a second stage, after the end of social isolation. Results The data will be analyzed in order to characterize child behavior before, during and after the period of social isolation, correlating the different areas of child development, especially mental health. Conclusions As argued, socially isolated children are at increased risk of health problems in adulthood. Furthermore, studies on social isolation have demonstrated that a lack of social relationships negatively impacts the development of the brainâ€™s structure.

"Experiences and projections for the future of research, training and other academic activities: Will it be the same?","The global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with subsequently imposed restrictions and lockdowns also radically disrupted academic life. Many research projects involving recruitment of human subjects were abruptly put on hold, educational activities have moved into online trainings, scientific meetings have been transformed into virtual events. Social distancing does not restrict only everyday human contact but also limits direct exchange of clinical, educational, and research experiences, professional and academic networking, sharing ideas. Besides all the drawbacks, does the current situation also bring any advantages? Every challenge results in new opportunities. Although the online congresses will most likely never fully replace real-life experience, it was found that many work meetings can be held more efficiently via online communication. Saving time, cutting costs of travel and accommodation, plus other expenses, may help to allocate limited resources where needed. Similarly, while practical medical education and training cannot be substituted for remote broadcasting, many theoretical presentations can. More importantly, epidemic of COVID-19 is a unique opportunity for mental health research, to study individual and population consequences of the virus, its impact on psychiatric patients.

"A study on the effects of stress and hopelessness in isolated COVID-19 patients in relation to severity of infection","Introduction In India, Coronavirus pandemic started in the month of march 2020 and is growing day by day. In view of India being one of the most populous countries, it is hard to follow social distancing and abide by the lockdown rules. Therefore, as of December 2020, total number of covid-19 cases has crossed the 10 million. But the recovery rate in India is high, so the fear due to Covid-19 has decreased in intensity. Objectives To assess level of perceived stress in isolated covid-19 patients To assess level of hopelessness in isolated covid-19 patients Methods 30 Patients of diagnosed Covid-19 positive,who were isolated in covid care setting in Uttar Pradesh(India),above 18yrs of age,of both sexes and willing to participate in the study were included, their socio-demographic data collected. Beckâ€™s hopelessness scale and Perceived stress scale were administered. Infection severity upto moderate was selected and ICU patients were excluded. Results were analysed using SPSS software. Results It was observed that level of hopelessness increased with increasing age and increasing severity of covid-19.Level of perceived stress also increased with increasing age and increasing covid severity. There was no relation seen between hopelessness level and perceived stress level and no difference was seen in the levels of hopelessness and perceived stress between the two sexes.

"Depression during the COVID-19 pandemic A retrospective study on depressive disorders among psychiatric patients admitted at â€œelisabeta doamnaâ€ hospital galati, romania","Introduction Isolation, life changes and increased stress lead to widespread concerns about the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on psychiatric patients. The rise in depressive disorders is one of the negative effects associated directly and indirectly to the pandemic. Objectives The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the prevalence of depressive disorders among the patients admitted to our hospital. The state of pandemia was declared on the 11th of March but it had already become a main stream media subject in our country at the beginning of the month with real life changes for our citizens. Methods A retrospective study was performed at the Psychiatric Hospital â€˜Elisabeta Doamnaâ€™ Galati, using the exact same period, between 01.03 and 30.09, in 2019 and 2020. ICD-10 criteria were used and pacients with either F32.x,F33.x or F38.x as discharge diagnosis were included. Results In total, 7638 cases were admitted during the period in 2019, of which 751 (9,83%) had depressive disorders. In comparison with 2020 where out of 4050 admitted patients, the number had risen to 1034 (25,53%) a net increase in total number of cases by 37.6%. Conclusions Analysis of the data shows a 2.5 times increase in the percentage of depressive disorders among our patients. Even taking in account the lower admition rates, we have seen a clear shift in the psychiatric profile of the average pacient and this has to be taken into consideration in the long and short term treatment of any psychiatric patient.","Mihailov, O.; Radulescu, I.

"Vns as alternative treatment for maintenance ect in a patient with treatment resistant depression - a case study","Introduction Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) is a neuromodulatory intervention which involves attaching an electrode to the vagus nerve. Studies investigating VNS as an acute treatment method for treatment resistent depression have shown very limited results, however there are data suggesting that VNS might have a beneficial effect on a longer term. There are also studies that suggest that a history of response to ECT might indicate a higher response rate to VNS. VNS was suggested as treatment for a patient who received maintenance ECT for treatment resistant unipolar depression during 9 years. 3 months after VNS was implanted, ECT was stopped due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In this case study we will review the patientâ€™s response to treatment with VNS and the sudden stop of long-term ECT treatment. Objectives To review the response to acute and maintenance ECT and VNS in this patient diagnosed with treatment resistant unipolar depression, and to compare this to the data suggesting VNS as an alternative treatment method for maintenance ECT in patients with treatment resistant depression. Methods Using the extensive data collected during the patientâ€™s treatment, we will review the clinical response and side-effect burden of this patient to acute and maintenance ECT and to VNS. Results The patient showed a vast improvement in depressive symptoms a few months after start of VNS treatment, while long-term maintenance ECT was stopped. Conclusions This patientâ€™s response to VNS supports the data suggesting VNS as an alternative treatment method for maintenance ECT in patients with treatment resistant depression.

"The effect of views on the COVID-19 pandemic on the development of depressive symptoms in a sample of the elderly","Introduction The covid-19 virus pandemic is another risk factor not only for the lives of older people, but also for their mental health, as the threat is immediate and intense. Objectives The aim of the study was to investigate depression during the pandemic in a population of elderly people over 65 years of age living in the Greek countryside. Methods The research was synchronous and was conducted in the autumn of 2020 in Crete. The sample of the study was random and consisted of 200 elderly users of services of the Health Center of the Municipality of Phaistos, Crete. The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) was used to conduct the study in combination with 24 questions related to pandemic perceptions. Results 40.5% of the sample were men and 59.5% were women. The mean age was 75.70 years (SD Â± 6.29). The mean value of GDS-15 was found to be 5.97 (SD, 3.07), while the comparison of depressive symptoms showed that women, lonely people and the elderly with chronic health problems are more vulnerable to the development of depressive symptoms. In relation to covid-19 and depressive symptoms, there was a positive correlation with twelve factors (p &lt;, 05) with the most important being the fear for their family health, sleep disorder, loneliness and inability to deal with the virus. Conclusions The research showed moderate depressive symptoms, while a clear effect of the pandemic due to Covid-19 was found on the emotional mood of the elderly, a fact that makes their psychosocial support necessary.

"Depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic in Russia","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic may bear serious consequences for mental health, such as the increase in psychopathological symptoms. Objectives Analysis of changes in depressive suicidal ideation symptoms and during the COVID-19. Depressive symptoms and suicidality were considered separately. Methods Internet survey 22.03.20â€“22.06.20 (908 responses), included SCL-90R, COPE, question about suicidal ideation. Results The analysis showed a positive correlation between suicidal thoughts and depression (Spearman .45;p&lt;.001), a growing trend in the depressive symptoms (Std.J-T=2.51, p=.012), and the increase in severity of suicidal thoughts (Fisherâ€™s Exact Test, 5.92, p=.046). Severity of depression positively correlates with the emergence of the virus in the city, contraction of disease among friends (Spearman .165;p&lt;.001), sick and die fears, an also is linked to more expressed seeking Â«emotional, social and instrumental helpÂ» (COPE). The intensity of suicidal ideation was not associated with these factors, but negatively correlated with Â«acceptanceÂ» and Â«planningÂ». Conclusions The increase in depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts is determined by different factors. Depressive symptoms is associated with various fears and mediated by non-constructive ways of coping, but there are also constructive coping-strategies as the search for help. The intensity of suicidal thoughts is associated with higher levels of stress, which cannot be explained by the Â«objectiveÂ» threat of contagion and fears, but is experienced as an Â«indefiniteÂ» anxiety, supposedly linked to the measures to counter the pandemic, such as restrictions on social interactions, loneliness and uncertainty.

"Clinical experiences in low-resource settings: Experience from Croatia","Croatian healthcare faced dramatic changes as a response to the ongoing pandemic, which further pressured financially loaded system. Besides, the capital of Croatia was hit by an earthquake that caused material damage and organizational difficulties. Contrary to the World Health Organizationâ€™s recommendations that mental health services are essential services to be maintained during the pandemic, there was severe disruption of utilization and accessibility to mental health services during the pandemic. In the beginning, the only services maintained were in-hospital and emergency services, while daily hospitals and ambulatory visits were disrupted. Psychiatric resources were not formally implemented in the treatment and management of COVID-19 and majority of mental health workers remained within the boundaries of psychiatric services. In the following period, some of the services reopened, with reorientation to online provision. However, the interference of services gradually occurred as the second wave started, with some psychiatric departments being repurposed for non-psychiatric use. Psychiatric care was organized in some of the COVID-19 departments as liaison service. Some of the psychiatric services offered consultation and prevention of burn-out for frontline personnel. Lastly, as the University hospital centre Zagreb was implementing the flexible assertive community treatment teams for persons with severe mental illness through the Large-scale implementation of community based mental health care for people with severe and enduring mental ill health in Europe (RECOVER-E) project in the period from 2018-2022, we investigated the effect of this service on the health outcomes during the pandemic and found it superior compared with the standard treatment.

"Protocol to maintain ECT in COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction Electroconvulsive therapy is a highly effective treatment for severe psychopharmacological resistant patients but it is also a procedure that involves open airway management and has been considered as an aerosol generating procedure. The COVID-19 pandemic, has resulted in reduction in ECT services internationally. The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically and rapidly transformed hospitals in heavily affected areas, decreasing mental health services. The need to locate critical patients in spaces intended for anesthesia, where we usually administered ECT, has forced us to decrease the number of procedures and be highly selective. In the same way, continuation and maintenance ECT (m-ECT) have also been dramatically reduced. The risk of contagion urged us to develop a protocol involving other areas of the hospital Objectives To create a safe circuit from admission to the hospital to the ECT including emergency room and psychiatric Ward Methods Review of the tliterature and published protocols Workshops with Preventive Medicine, Anaesthesia and Emergency Service to elaborate a protocol Submission of the protocol to Management of the Hospital Results The protocol (Figure 1) began with the screening for COVID-19 in every patient. If the PCR was (+) the patient was not excluded. We moved treatment from the PACU into the OR and if a patient tested positive It was determined that the ECT was administered in the OR That was provided with negative pressure. Circuits were established within the Psychiatric Ward and in the areas of the hospital involved to reduce risks and patients remained isolated until negative test was confirmed The number of persons present in the treatment room was kept to the absolute minimum required and appropriate personal protective equipment was used, as prescribed by the WHO Conclusions We must keep in mind treating the most vulnerable of our patients.

"Changes in the utilisation of acute hospital care in Ireland during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 [version 2;peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]","Background: Reduced and delayed presentations for non-COVID-19 illness during the COVID-19 pandemic have implications for population health and health systems. The aim of this study is to quantify and characterise changes in acute hospital healthcare utilisation in Ireland during the first wave of COVID-19 to inform healthcare system planning and recovery. Methods: A retrospective, population-based, observational study was conducted using two national datasets, Patient Experience Time (PET) and Hospital In-Patient Enquiry (HIPE). The study period was 6th January to 5th July 2020. Results: Comparison between time periods pre- and post-onset of the COVID-19 pandemic within 2020 showed there were 81,712 fewer Emergency Department (ED) presentations (-18.8%), 19,692 fewer admissions from ED (-17.4%) and 210,357 fewer non-COVID-19 hospital admissions (-35.0%) than expected based on pre-COVID-19 activity. Reductions were greatest at the peak of population-level restrictions, at extremes of age and for elective admissions. In the period immediately following the first wave, acute hospital healthcare utilisation remained below pre-COVID-19 levels, however, there were increases in emergency alcohol-related admissions (Rate Ratio 1.22, 95% CI 1.03, 1.43, p-value 0.016), admissions with self-harm (Rate Ratio 1.39, 95% CI 1.01, 1.91, p-value 0.043) and mental health admissions (Rate Ratio 1.28, 95% CI 1.03, 1.60, p-value 0.028). Discussion: While public health implications of delayed and lost care will only become fully apparent over time, recovery planning must begin immediately. In the short-term, backlogs in care need to be managed and population health impacts of COVID-19 and associated restrictions, particularly in relation to mental health and alcohol, need to be addressed through strong public health and health system responses. In the long-term, COVID-19 highlights health system weakness and is an opportunity to progress health system reform to deliver a universal, high-quality, sustainable and resilient health system, capable of meeting population health needs and responding to future pandemics.","Marron, Louise, Burke, Sara, Kavanagh, Paul","https://www.google.com/search?q=Changes+in+the+utilisation+of+acute+hospital+care+in+Ireland+during+the+first+wave+of+the+COVID-19+pandemic+in+2020+[version+2;peer+review:+1+approved,+2+approved+with+reservations]","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: HRB open research; 4, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-14","",39142,""

Assessments covered psychological outcomes assessed before and during COVID-19 crisis (depression, perceived stress and sleep quality), and assessed during the crisis (fear, isolation and COVID-19 psychological trauma), socioeconomic status (relative financial status and difficulty to pay bills) before the crisis and changes in work situation (unemployment, home-office). Results About a fifth of the sample were in partial unemployment or lost their job during COVID-19 crisis. Those in partial or full unemployment, those mostly working from home and those with a lower socioeconomic status already prior to the crisis showed overall higher levels of depression, stress, psychological trauma, fear and isolation. Conclusions Even in a country with high social security such as Switzerland, the COVID-19 crisis had a higher psychological impact on those who were already disadvantaged before the crisis or experienced deteriorations in their work situation. Supporting disadvantaged subpopulations during the crisis may help to prevent an amplification of pre-existing inequalities.

"Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health - what do we know so far?","Introduction The devastating effects of the current pandemic are profoundly affecting peoplesâ€™s physical and psychological health. Numerous studies on the effects of previous infectious outbreaks have been published. Similarly, an increasingly growing body of research on COVID-19 has been developed and released, reporting a substancial psychological impact of both the outbreak and the response, suggesting that the population may express high levels of psychological symptoms. Objectives This presentation aims to synthesize existent literature that reports on the effects of COVID-19 on psychological outcomes of the general population, groups with higher vulnerability and its associated risk factors. Methods Bibliographic research was made through scientific databases such as PubMed and EMBASE. No time limit was used. Pertinent articles were carefully reviewed for additional relevant citations. Results Generally, there is a higher prevalence of symptoms of adverse psychiatric outcomes among the public when compared to the prevalence before the pandemic. Psychological reactions to pandemics include maladaptive behaviours, emotional distress and symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression, and avoidance behaviors. The groups known to be at higher risk for mental health problems during the pandemic are: women, healthcare workers, people under 40 years old and with chronic diseases. Other risk factors are: frequent exposure to social media/news relating to COVID-19, poor economic status, lower education level, and unemployment. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic represents an unprecedented threat to mental health. In addition to flattening the curve of viral transmission, special attention needs to be paid to the challenges it poses to the mental health of the population at a global scale.","Marguilho, M.; Nobre, A.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Effects+of+the+COVID-19+pandemic+on+mental+health+-+what+do+we+know+so+far?","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists; 64(Suppl 1):S312-S312, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-14","",39144,""

"Pending challenges to e-mental health in the COVID-19 era: Acceptability of a smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment application among patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders","Introduction Concerns have been raised about ecological momentary assessment (EMA) acceptability among patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD), which is of major relevance during the e-Mental health-focused COVID-19 pandemic. Objectives To investigate i) the levels of adherence to a passive smartphone-based EMA tool, the Evidence-Based Behavior (eB2), among SSD patients;and ii) putative predictors of this. Methods Sample: SSD (F20-29-ICD10) outpatients, age 18-64, without financial incentives, recruited over 17/06/2019-11/03/2020 at the Hospital Universitario FundaciÃ³n JimÃ©nez DÃ­az (Madrid, Spain).

"Mental health and wellness during COVID-19: Impact on healthy population","Introduction Pandemic outbreak brings multiple challenges into everyday life, with high potential to affect all aspects of health. It was previously demonstrated that epidemic is harmful to mental health (MH) of a whole population producing long-lasting and significant burden for the person and the society. However, such an impact was less investigated in COVID-19 pandemic. Objectives Investigate aspects of MH among healthy population during Spring 2020 lockdown due to COVID-19;detect factors affecting MH and their cumulative effect on health-related quality of life (QOL). Methods 571 healthy volunteers completed electronic survey distributed through social networks. The survey contained standard tools for evaluation of (1) levels of stress, anxiety and depression, (2) objective and subjective parameters of participation in daily-life activities, (3) daily routines, (5) loneliness, (6) social connectedness, (7) self-efficacy and (8) quality of life. Results We found high levels of stress, anxiety and depression among healthy population and low QOL in physical, psychological and social relationship domains. Employment, keeping daily routines, social connectedness, self-efficacy, enjoyment, satisfaction and meaning in daily-life activities were associated with better MH. All the aforementioned factors contributed significantly to QOL. Conclusions COVID-19 outbreak rise multiple health issues, among them affected MH of the healthy, not infected population. Public health strategies should be implemented to mitigate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on MH given its personal and social burden and its contribution to QOL. Addressing participation in daily life activities can be a useful tool to cope with impact of COVID-19 on MH.","Lipskaya-Velikovsky, L.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Mental+health+and+wellness+during+COVID-19:+Impact+on+healthy+population","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists; 64(Suppl 1):S278-S278, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-14","",39147,""
"Telecommuting and employeesâ€™ mental health","Introduction Telecommuting is defined as â€œa work practice that involves members of an organization substituting a portion of their typical work hours to work away from a central workplace, using technology to interact with others as needed to conduct work tasksâ€. The prevalence rate of telecommuting in Sapin in 2019 was 5%, while this rate grew up to 34% during de COVID-19 pandemic. Objectives The purpose of this poster is to make a review about how telecommuting affects the employeesâ€™ mental health. Methods A review os the available literature on employeesâ€™ menthal health. Results Most employers who offer telecommuting consider it a strategic decision for their businesses: it could reduce the expenses of physically accommodating the employees, and it might help employers to contact their subordinates anytime, if needed. Many articles in the popular press about telecommuting extol the benefits of this practice on employeesâ€™ health (work-life balance, reduction of travel expenses). However, only a handful of empirical studies substantiate these claims (job satisfaction, quality of life, and role-related stress). Less discussed is the potential of telecommuting to have a negative impact on employeesâ€™ health. It may increase both social and professional isolation, which in turn is associated with higher levels of emotional exhaustion, cynicism, cognitive stress complaints and lower levels of work engagement. Conclusions Finally, although it is not as effective as personal contact, organizations may stimulate qualitative virtual interaction with coworkers by providing robust online meeting tools and infrastructure, so users can seamlessly collaborate regardless of their physical location.","Lietor, M.

"Sociodemographic and mental health characteristics associated with changes in movement behaviours due to the COVID-19 pandemic in adolescents","Objectives Control measures enacted to control the spread of COVID-19 appear to have impacted adolescent movement behaviours. It remains unclear how these changes relate to sociodemographic characteristics and indicators of mental health. Understanding these relationships can contribute to informing health promotion efforts. The purpose of this study is to examine sociodemographic and mental health characteristics associated with changes in movement behaviours (physical activity, screen time, sleep duration) due to the COVID-19 pandemic among adolescents. Methods This cross-sectional study used Mayâ€“June 2020 survey data and included 7349 students from Quebec, Ontario, and British Columbia (Canada). ANOVA, <U+03C7>2 tests, and estimation of effect sizes using Cohenâ€™s d and h tests were performed between self-reported perceived changes (increase;decrease;no change) to physical activity, TV watching, social media use, and sleep duration as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and gender, age, race/ethnicity, income, depression and anxiety symptoms, flourishing-languishing, and self-rated mental health. Results Over half of students reported increases in TV viewing and social media use and approximately 40% reported decrease in physical activity and increase in sleep duration due to the COVID-19 pandemic. More females (68.9%) than males (54.3%) reported increase in social media use (Cohenâ€™s h = 0.2â€“0.5). No change from pre-COVID-19 social media use and sleep duration were associated with fewer depression and anxiety symptoms and better self-rated mental health compared to reports of an increase or decrease. These effect sizes ranged from small-to-moderate to moderate-to-large (Cohenâ€™s d/h = 0.2â€“0.8). Decreased physical activity and sleep duration were associated with better psychological functioning with effects sizes of small-to-moderate. Compared to an increase or no change, decreased sleep had the largest effect size of less frequent depression symptoms (Cohenâ€™s d = 0.5â€“0.8). Conclusion Maintaining pre-COVID-19 screen time and sleep duration during early stages of the COVID-19 lockdown was generally beneficial to mental health, with sleep being particularly important in regards to symptoms of depression. Psychological functioning was more related to physical activity and sleep than screen time during the pandemic.","Lien, Amanda, Sampasa-Kanyinga, Hugues, Patte, Karen A.; Leatherdale, Scott T.; Chaput, Jean-Philippe","https://www.google.com/search?q=Sociodemographic+and+mental+health+characteristics+associated+with+changes+in+movement+behaviours+due+to+the+COVID-19+pandemic+in+adolescents","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Activity, Sedentary and Sleep Behaviors; 1(1), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-14","",39149,""

"Mental health in time of pandemics: Study protocol to incorporate risk and protective factors contributing to psychological stress among portuguese and swiss higher education students","Introduction The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is inducing fear, and a timely understanding of mental health status is urgently needed for society. Previous research has revealed a profound and wide range of psychosocial impacts on people at the individual, community, and international levels. On an individual level, people are likely to experience fear of falling sick or dying themselves, feelings of helplessness, and stigma. Currently, there is little understanding of mental well-being assessment under scenarios of pandemics that oblige to social isolation and quarantine. Objectives This study aims to: a) establish the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms;b) identify risk and protective factors contributing to psychological stress;and c) identify coping strategies to promote better adjustment during and after the pandemic crisis. Methods We will adopt a mixed-method approach, firstly with a cross-sectional survey design (in both Portugal and Swiss context) to assess the higher education studentâ€™s psychosocial response during and after the pandemic, by using an anonymous online questionnaire. In a 2nd phase, and in order to gain more insight into the psychological stress faced by the students as a result of pandemic, a qualitative approach was chosen, focusing on the experiences of the participants. Results This study has received ethical approval from both international and local institutional review boards. Data collection will start in November 2020 and will be completed at February 2021.

"The COVID-19 pandemic in Russia: Effects on clinicians and mental health services","Since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, it has had different infection rates across the world. Russia had one of the largest numbers of infected cases during 2020, but with a lower overall fatality rate. Nevertheless, as in other countries, clinical practice within the mental health care system has faced many stresses and challenges. This concerned the need to organize a treatment of COVID-19 in psychiatric hospitals, as well as a transformation of outpatient care, including psychotherapy, which has largely switched to a remote format. To better understand the effects of the pandemic on mental health professionals, a large-scale study has been implemented through the Global Clinical Practice Network, one of the largest professional communities, which includes 969 members from Russia. The study assessed how COVID-19 affected clinical practice and well-being of clinicians. The first of three surveys was launched in June 2020, in six languages including Russian. Over 2,500 global mental health professionals participated in the study, including 205 clinicians from Russia. Current work circumstances, work-related stressors, and use of telehealth were evaluated. In Russia, the data collection period was characterized by generally improvement in the overall pandemic situation. Results to be presented include the proportion of clinicians that continued working, what kinds of services they provided, their well-being strategies, telehealth modalities and areas in which they had particular concerns about assessment, treatment, or monitoring of patients with mental disorders using remote technologies.

"Face tuning in female and male individuals with depression","Introduction The current COVID-19 pandemic brings social isolation to our daily lives that may elevate depression. The impact of major depressive disorder (MDD) on social cognitive functioning is far from understood, but essential for prevention and treatment of this neuropsychiatric condition. Objectives Our aim was to examine (i) whether face tuning is lower in depression;and (ii) how it is related to other cognitive abilities (such as perceptional organization). Furthermore, we intended to clarify gender impact on face tuning in MDD, as twice more females are affected. Methods Using a recently developed paradigm, the Face-n-Food task, we examined face tuning in 26 patients with MDD and 26 person-by-person matched controls. The advantage of non-face images is that its single elements do not promote face processing. Results Strikingly, MDD individuals showed intact face tuning. As sex ratio in our patient sample was about 2:1 (as in MDD population in general), we recruited additional male patients and found that MDD male patients were as good as female patients. Yet, while face tuning in MDD patients showed a significant correlation with perceptual organization abilities, in controls, it was linked with social cognition. Conclusions The outcome suggests that the origins of aberrant social functioning in MDD lie in maladaptive cognitive schemas rather than in a lack of sensitivity towards social signals per se. To elucidate neural circuits involved in face tuning in MDD, a magnetoencephalography (MEG) study with the Face-n-Food images is currently under progress.

"Experience of organization of mental health monitoring in university clinic of Kharkiv national medical university","Introduction The mental health care system in Ukraine is centralized and largely focuses on capacity for inpatient psychiatric treatment with 90% of funding allocated to inpatient psychiatric care at hospitals, much higher than countries who already have more decentralized care. Community-based mental health care options, including mental health provided at the primary health care level are currently limited or absent in the mental health system. Psychosocial support, as well as self-care and mental health promotion are also insufficiently developed. Covid-19 pandemic is serious challenge for health care system, especially for consultation liaison psychiatry. Objectives Mental health monitoring and psychological support in University Clinic of Kharkiv National Medical University, Ukraine during COVID-19 epidemic.

"Changes in pornography use and sexual behaviour during lockdown","COVID-19 pandemic and the related restrictions had a significant impact on the living and working conditions as well as the everyday behavior and mental health condition. Aim of the current analysis was to examine the impact of the input-deprived circumstances on the sexual life characteristics. An online survey carried out after a few weeks of the first nation-wide lockdown was enacted in Hungary. 1,755 persons participated in the first wave (50.4% males). Relationship and sexual life satisfaction, sexual intercourse and masturbation frequency were assessed with additional single-item questions about the subjective change (5-pont Likert scale;1=â€œdecreased significantlyâ€;5=â€œincreased significantly) in these characetristics since the epidemiological restrictions had been introduced. Furthermore, several potential protective and risk factors were measured (depressive symptoms, perceived stress, loneliness, general well being, intolerance of uncertainty, sensation seeking, and COVID-19 related health anxiety). Linear regression models were calculated to assess which of the former variables predict the subjective changes of oneâ€™s sexual life. The analyses resulted in weak standardized coefficients. The subjective change in relationship satisfaction (mean 3.20, SD 0.94) and sexual satisfaction (mean 2.82, SD 0.73) were predicted positively by general well-being (ÃŸ=.11â€“0.25, p&lt;.01), and negatively by loneliness (ÃŸ=-.14-0.19, p&lt;0.01). Loneliness predicted negatively the subjective change in sexual intercourses (mean 2.75, SD 0.89) and masturbation frequency (mean 2.89, SD 0.84) (ÃŸ=- .10â€“.12, p&lt;.01), while sensation seeking had no effect (ÃŸ=-.09, p&lt;.01).

"The impact of COVID-19 on young peopleâ€™s mental health in latvia","Introduction There is an ongoing debate about the impact on mental health associated with Covid-19 pandemics. Some studies have shown an increase in depressive and anxious symptomatology in general population. It has been noted that young people might be among the highest risk populations due to various enviorenmental and developmental influences. Objectives To estimate the impact of Covid-19 related restrictions on mental health measures among Latvian adolescents and young adults (14-24). Methods We conduct a survey on social media, recruiting 500 participants among the 14-24 age gropup. The survey consists of three parts: 1) sociodemographics;2) quantitative mental health self-evaluation form;3) open ended questionaire about the needs and expectations. For statistical analysis we use Excel software and use a regression analysis. Results 483 participants participated in our survey. The average age was 17.2, 62% was female, 36% male, 2% identified as trans. 52.3% reported decline in their mental functioning and wellbeing in one or several mental health domains (depression, anxiety, addictive behaviours) out of which 13.4% reported significant impairment in a major life area. The support and needs defined by respondents can be divided in three clusters: socialising outside immediate family, psychosocial services, recreational needs. Conclusions Confirming to findings in other EU countries, majority of adolescents and young people in Latvia have experienced clinically significant mental health decline during the Covid-19 pandemic. These results can help policy makers in establishing appropriate, needs oriented support in tackling this problem.","Konstantinovs, N.; Lapa, J.","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+impact+of+COVID-19+on+young+peopleâ€™s+mental+health+in+latvia","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists; 64(Suppl 1):S296-S296, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-14","",39157,""
"Psychopathological symptoms among the russian population during the COVID-19 pandemic in the spring of 2020","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the lifestyle and psychological well-being of millions of people. Objectives The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of psychopathological symptoms in the Russian population in the COVID- 19 pandemic context. Methods We used a socio-demographic questionnaire (20 questions) and a Short Scale for Psychopathological Symptom Checklist (SCL -32) (Derogatis 1977;Mitina, Gorbunova, 2011). 582 Russian residents (496 women and 86 men) aged 18-64 years participated in the online survey in May 2020. Results Women were significantly more likely than men to have somatic dysfunctions (5.6Â±2.54vs4.8Â±1.9;p=0.001), interpersonal problems (6.97Â±2.9vs6.0Â±2.8;p=0.005), depression signs (6.9Â±3.2vs5.7Â±2.9;p=0.001) and anxiety disorders (6.8Â±2.8vs5.2 Â±2.1;p=0.000), as well as sleep disorders (6.4Â±2.8vs5.9Â±2.1;p=0.049) and suicidal thoughts (4.2Â±1.8vs3.7Â±1.8;p=0.032). In addition, women are more hostile than men are (6.3Â±2.7 vs 5.1Â±2.3;p=0.000). Respondents under the age of 30 are more likely than older people to have interpersonal problems (p=0.286, p=0.000), as well as signs of depression (p=0.216, p=0.000), hostility (p=0.226, p=0.000) and psychoticism (p=0.203, p=0.000). Respondentsâ€™ low income is statistically associated with interpersonal problems (p=0.139,p=0.001), anxiety (p=0.131, p=0.002), hostility (p=0.156, p=0.000), psychoticism (p=0.137, p=0.001), and suicidal intentions (p=0.152,p=0.000). Among respondents whose relatives had COVID-19, signs of anxiety disorders (7.2Â±3vs3.5Â±2.9;p=0.027) and obsessive disorders (8.1Â±3.2 vs 7.3Â±2.6;p=0.029) were significantly more common than in the whole sample. Conclusions The study highlights socio-demographic factors of vulnerability to psychopathological symptoms in the COVID-19 pandemic context, which should be taken into account when organizing medical and psychological assistance to the population.","Koniukhovskaia, J.; Pervichko, E.; Stepanova, O.; Dorokhov, E.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Psychopathological+symptoms+among+the+russian+population+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic+in+the+spring+of+2020","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists; 64(Suppl 1):S305-S305, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-14","",39158,""
"Practical observations - the COVID-19 influence on latvian early intervention work with first episode psychosis (FEP) patients","Introduction COVID-19 is a very stressful experience for people with FEP and changed the work routine of the mental health services they have used. Objectives In this work, we aim to explore how the restrictions influenced the out-patient visits and rehospitalization rates. Methods The Latvian Early intervention programme (Berze et al.,2019) for patients with FEP had started on 1stÂ January, 2019. The 1stÂ group of patients (n=28) finished the programme on 31stÂ December, 2019. The 2nd group of patients were enrolled in programme on 1stÂ January, 2020 (n=12). When on 12th of March in Latvia health care restriction started due the COVID-19 situation, we were forced to change our structure of LAT-EIP. Results The average patient age of patients was 29.9 (SDÂ±7.1) years in the 1stÂ group, in 2ndÂ group average age is 26.2 (SDÂ±5.9) accordingly in years. In the 1stÂ group 60.7% of patients visited the psychiatrist 6-10 times vs 8.33% in 2ndÂ group, in the 1stÂ group 32.1 % of patients had 2-5 visits with psychiatrist vs 75% in 2ndÂ group. There were 72 family sessions in 1stÂ group, whereas in 2ndÂ group the family sessions were excluded. During the programme 7% (n=2) of patients in the 1stÂ group were rehospitalized vs 25% (n=3). Conclusions The structure of LAT-EIP had change at the time of COVID-19 restrictions, unfortunately our work lack the statistical power. From the descriptive statistics, we can speculate that the rehospitalization rate is higher because of the lack of regular contact with psychiatrist and the lack of psychoeducation with families.","Kokina, N.; Sile, L.; Butorins, B.; Pocopko, A.; Lesina, A.; Kikuste, S.; Sapele, I.; Rancans, E.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Practical+observations+-+the+COVID-19+influence+on+latvian+early+intervention+work+with+first+episode+psychosis+(FEP)+patients","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists; 64(Suppl 1):S296-S296, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-14","",39159,""
"Longitudinal Smartphone-Based Post-hospitalisation Symptom Monitoring in SARS-CoV-2 Associated Respiratory Failure: A Multi-Centre Observational Study","Background: We aimed to longitudinally monitor the recovery in breathlessness, symptom burden, health-related quality-of-life, and mental health status in individuals hospitalised due to SARS-CoV-2 associated respiratory failure. Methods: Individuals hospitalised due to SARS-CoV-2 associated respiratory failure were recruited at hospital discharge in three participating centres. During the 90 day follow-up, European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-5 Levels Instrument (EQ-5D-5L), modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnoea Scale, COPD Assessment Test (CAT), and weekly Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaires were assessed using a smartphone application. The results were presented using descriptive statistics and graphics. Linear mixed models with random intercept were fitted to analyse differences of intensive-care unit status on the recovery course in each outcome. Results: We included 58 participants, 40 completed the study. From hospital discharge until 90 days post-discharge, EQ-5D-5L index changed from 0.83 (0.66, 0.92) to 0.96 (0.82, 1.0), VAS rating on general health status changed from 62 (50, 75) % to 80 (74, 94) %, CAT changed from 13 (10, 21) to 7 (3, 11) points, mMRC changed from 1 (0, 2) to 0 (0, 1) points, HADS depression subscale changed from 6 (4, 9) to 5 (1, 6) points, HADS anxiety subscale changed from 7 (3, 9) to 2 (1, 8) points. Differences in the recovery courses were observed between intensive-care and ward participants. Participants that were admitted to an intensive-care unit during their hospitalisation (n = 16) showed increases in CAT, mMRC, HADS scores, and decreases in EQ-5D-5L 30 days after hospital discharge. Conclusion: Being admitted to an ICU led to statistically significant reductions in recovery in the EQ-5D-5L and the CAT. Furthermore, the flare-up in symptom burden and depression scores, accompanied by an attenuated recovery in HrQoL and general health status in the ICU-group suggests that a clinical follow-up 1 month after hospital discharge can be recommended, evaluating further treatments.

"Environment and Health: Need to Rebuild and Maintain Balance","Adaptation is one of the most important virtues for the survival of any organism, including humans. During the past few decades, the issue of climate change has been considered one of the most significant problems faced by humanity and has been debated extensively. The surge of pandemic COVID-19 affected virtually every aspect of our life, including the world economy, education, development, etc. to an apparent standstill. It took the life of our near and dear and left several with irreversible damage. COVID-19 reminds us of lessons about responding to climate change and behavioral responses to global challenges. The re-emergence and increasing burden of human Monkeypox cases are also getting global attention. Every disease has its remedy;we just have to decode it. If we want to reverse the degradation of our environment, we must take some difficult actions and modify our habits and behaviors. The required personal changes are at times difficult and sometimes manageable and straightforward. Through proper environmental health engineering, we must concentrate on a different level of prevention. When the environments where we live, work, and play are safe and free of risks that might harm people's health, we are said to be living in good environmental health.","Khan, Imran Ahmed, Bashri, Gausiya","https://www.google.com/search?q=Environment+and+Health:+Need+to+Rebuild+and+Maintain+Balance","","Database: CINAHL; Publication type: article; Publication details: Indian Practitioner; 75(9):28-29, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-14","",39161,""
"Domestic violence against women during COVID-19 pandemic restrictions","Introduction In the United Kingdom(1) and internationally(2), help-seeking for domestic violence (DV) and domestic homicides have increased(3) during COVID-19 lockdown periods. Suspension and remote delivery of face-to-face clinical services, continuing healthcare and other support services limits opportunities for DV detection and disclosure. Methods This presentation will summarise changes in DV incidence and help-seeking during COVID-19, their impacts on health and wellbeing, and present guidance for clinicians assessing and supporting survivors. Results World Health Organisation recommendations to Listen, Inquire, Validate, Enhance safety and Support (â€™LIVESâ€™) survivors of DV remain the cornerstone of first-line support (4). Urgently-issued guidelines on safeguarding(5) and responding to DV during COVID-19(6) make a range of recommendations for clinicians supporting people experiencing DV. Conclusions DV is an important social determinant of physical and mental health, with a range of potential fatal and non-fatal consequences. Despite the constraints of healthcare during a pandemic, attention to patientsâ€™ risk of DV and its consequences is a crucial part of bio-psycho-social assessment and management planning.

"Telehealth and mindfulness-based interventions (MBIS) in the era of COVID-19","Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have increased in popularity, resulting in an increase in RCTs assessing MBI treatment outcomes (Keng et al., 2011). While this dissertation was in development, COVID-19 was discovered and declared a pandemic by the Director of the World Health Organization in March of 2020 due to the rapid spread of the virus (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2021;World Health Organization [WHO], 2020). A mental health crisis was declared by the United Nations (2020), and they urged access to mental health care through accessible means such as telehealth. An abbreviated four-week mindfulness-based intervention program via telehealth was provided to individuals with an anxiety or depressive disorder from a community mental health center. It was hypothesized that individuals receiving MBI+TAU via telehealth would show a higher rate of improved treatment outcomes in comparison to the individuals receiving TAU-only as indicated via PHQ-9, GAD-7, and MAAS scores with the MBI+TAU participants also providing subjective experience reports via a 5-point Likert Scale at post-intervention. Results indicate that when comparing MBI+TAU to the TAU-only group there was not an overall group effect for the PHQ-9 (F=0.16, p=.85) or the GAD-7 (F=0.01, p=.91). Follow-up contrast analyses confirms that the main significant effect for GAD-7 is among pre-treatment and follow- up of the TAU-only sample (p=.05), and a slight effect between pre and post treatment for the MBI+TAU group (p=.08). For PHQ-9, the TAU-only showed no effects across time points, while the MBI+TAU showed a significant difference over time (F=8.7, p&lt;.01) with follow-up t-tests indicating a significant difference between pre & post PHQ- 9 means (p&lt;.001), as well as between post & follow-up (p=.02). MBI+TAU participants identified an overall positive view of improvements in their anxiety and depression symptoms and mindful awareness skills via self-report (Likert scale). These results support other empirical findings that MBIs reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety from pre to post intervention but not at the follow-up time point (Elices et al., 2017, Khoury et al., 2013;Wang et al., 2018) and may be most effective used in conjunction with TAU (Strauss et al., 2014;Toneatto & Nguyen, 2007).

"Emergency psychiatry services in pandemia: Is it different than before?","Introduction After World Health Organization declared that COVID-19 disease became a pandemic;like most, people in Turkey were affected by the emotionally challenging atmosphere. Previous outbreaks negatively effected mental health, increased suicide attempts and completed suicides. Objectives Our study aimed to investigate psychiatry consultations from emergency service in a university hospital, to determine differencies in pandemia. Methods We conducted a monocenter retrospective study by examining the patients who applied to emergency servise and consulted to psychiatry department in three periods: between 11 March- 11 July, in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Patientâ€™s sociodemographic and clinical variables were assessed. Results There were no difference in distributions of applicantsâ€™ following variables between periods;age, sex, marital status, experiencing a first attack or an exacerbation, or outcome treatment. Among applicants with suicide attempts, there were no difference between periods in terms of the presence of recurrent suicide attempt (<U+03C7>Â² = 0.297 p = 0.862). While emergency admissions with behavioral disorders increased, admissions with depressive symptoms decreased. Admissions with suicide attempts were statistically significantly higher in 2020 (Table 1).

"Mental disorders and psychological problems of women-victims of domestic violence during self-isolation in the covid 19 pandemic","Introduction Domestic violence is a troubling problem, but it has acquired a new, previously unknown significance during the COVID 19 pandemic. According to WHO, the number of calls from victims of domestic violence to hotlines during quarantine in many countries has increased by an average of 5 times. Objectives The purpose of this study was to find out the consequences of domestic violence against women and to identify psychological problems and mental disorders. Attention was paid to the mental health of victims of violence in self - isolation during COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We analyzed the psychological problems and mental disorders of women who applied to the newly created hotline for women at the Serbsky Center in Moscow during the COVID 19 pandemic. Results The situation caused by restrictive quarantine measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic provokes aggressiveness and all forms of domestic violence.Clinical interview has revealed depression, anxiety, fear, low self-esteem, self-harm behavior, which formed the clinical picture of adaptation disorders, acute stress disorders, PTSR, psychosomatic disorders, substance abuse), sexual dysfunctions, eating disorders in the form of bulimia and anorexia. Conclusions The study requires taking into account social, economic and gender characteristics. In all types of emergencies, including epidemics, violence against women tends to increase.

"Prevalence of health anxiety in indian ophthalmologists during COVID-19: a survey","Introduction Mental health concerns are common in health care workers during pandemic. There are no studies of the prevalence of health anxiety in ophthalmologists in India. Objectives To estimate the prevalence of health anxiety in ophthalmologists practicing in India during the ongoing pandemic. Methods A questionnaire-based online survey on the â€œchanges and challenges during COVID-19â€ using Google forms was sent to all members of the All India Ophthalmological Society. Besides demographics, the survey had questions to assess the general mental and medical health status of the ophthalmologists. Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI) was used to assess health anxiety. Results 1027 ophthalmologists responded to the study. Higher stress was experience by 83.1% compared to pre-COVID while examining patients closely (35.9%) or during surgery due to the risk of aerosol generation (29.3%).

"COVID-19 mental health helpline: A tool for a rural population","Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a negative impact for mental health. ULS-Guarda in cooperation with Portugal National Health Service, provided the population of the district of Guarda with a mental health helpline (MHHL). Objectives Provide a descriptive data analysis of the MHHL calls received between April 1stÂ and September 20thÂ of 2020. Methods The data was obtained through the filling out of questionnaires. It included fields for gender, age, the type of service provided, relation to COVID-19, symptoms displayed and the number calls made per patient. For the statistical analysis, Microsoft ExcelÂ TMÂ was utilized. Results MHHL received 191 calls. The largest volume was received during April, which saw 116 instances of patients seeking the MHHL. The number of calls then tapered progressively throughout the following months. The services provided were split between psychiatric assistance, psychologic assistance, and the renovation of medical prescriptions, in 44%, 31% and 19% of the cases, respectively. The 101 patients who resorted to the MHHL were unevenly distributed in gender, being 74 female and 27 male individuals. Their ages were mostly between 50 and 69 years old. The most common symptoms were anxiety, depressed humor and insomnia, in 35%, 16% and 11% of the cases, respectively. Conclusions The largest influx of calls coincides with the home confinement period, and decreased alongside the relaxation of the confinement measures held. The MHHL had enough adherence to warrant consideration of it being an alternative means of healthcare access, especially in situations where physical access to healthcare is restricted.","Jesus, B.; Ramos, S.

"Predictors of the perceived risk of COVID-19 and adherence to confinement guidelines in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction Complete adherence to public health guidelines is essential to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Studies on the factors associated with increased/decreased adherence to these measures have the potential to inform public policies directed at increasing adherence, and thus helping to control the spread of the current pandemic. Objectives This study aimed at assessing the demographic and psychosocial predictors of the perceived risk of the COVID-19 and adherence to confinement guidelines during the first mandatory lockdown in Portugal. Methods A convenience sample of 430 adults living in Portugal between March 19thÂ and May 2nd,Â 2020 completed an online survey asking participants about the perceived risk of the COVID-19 and adherence to confinement guidelines. Participants also completed a sociodemographic questionnaire and measures of psychological function. Multiple regression analysis was performed. Results Teleworking and Risk and COVID-19 controllability were significant predictors of the perceived risk of COVID-19 as measured by the perceived risk of being infected with COVID-19. Teleworking participants and those perceiving COVID-19 as less controllable reported a higher perceived risk of being infected with COVID-19 than those who were not in telework and perceived COVID-19 as a controllable condition. Adherence to confinement guidelines was predicted by the mental health status and perceived risk of COVID-19.

"How are the portuguese coping with the mandatory confinement by COVID-19? Association between mental health and coping strategies","Introduction The global COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented effect on human behaviour and wellbeing. However, researchers have not yet considered how coping responses to stress related to COVID-19 could influence mental health. Objectives This study aims to evaluate the mental health status of Portuguese during the national lockdown;examine how study participants cope with stress during the national lockdown;and assess the association between coping and mental health status. Methods We cross sectionally analysed data from a convenience sample of 430 adults living in Portugal. Mental health was measured using the five-item Mental Health Inventory. Coping strategies were assessed using the Brief COPE. We examine the univariate associations between mental health status and coping responses. We performed a multiple hierarchical regression analysis controlling for sex and age, to test the predictive importance of coping responses on mental health status. Results Participantsâ€™ mental health was lower than the cut-off point for poor mental health (p&lt;.001). The use of instrumental support, emotional support, self-blame, venting, denial, behavioral disengagement, and substance use were positively significantly associated with mental health, while active coping, positive reframing, acceptance, and humor were negatively significantly associated with mental health. The multiple hierarchical regression analyses showed that sex and age accounted for 6% of the variance of mental health. Coping strategies accounted for an additional and statistically significant 30% of the variance of mental health. Conclusions The findings provide support for the impact of the coping strategies on mental health. We encourage future research on the present topic.","Jarego, M.; Pimenta, F.; Pais-Ribeiro, J.; Costa, R.; PatrÃ£o, I.; Coelho, L.; Ferreira-Valente, A.","https://www.google.com/search?q=How+are+the+portuguese+coping+with+the+mandatory+confinement+by+COVID-19?+Association+between+mental+health+and+coping+strategies","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists; 64(Suppl 1):S297-S298, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-14","",39170,""
"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) & COVID-19: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: Consequences of the 1st wave","Introduction In times of pandemic as Covid-19, as in disaster situations, there is an increased risk of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Depression, and Anxiety (Kaufman et al., 1997;Douglas, Douglas, Harrigan, & Douglas, 2009;Guessoum et al., 2020). The measures taken have affected individual freedoms for the benefit of community health by seeking to reduce the spread of the virus, although the side effects can cause profound damage to society, especially in those most vulnerable populations such as children and adolescents with ADHD. Objectives This study aims to assess the psychopathological state and possible consequences of the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods This study is part of the Kids Corona, an institutional research project of the Hospital de Sant Joan de DÃ©u and the FundaciÃ³ de Sant Joan de DÃ©u to provide a social and research response to the Covid-19 Pandemic. To assess the impact of Covid on children and adolescents with ADHD a cross-sectional study was conducted between 20 and 30 July 2020 with a battery of questionnaires. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC), the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED), the Childrenâ€™s Depression Inventory (CDI) were used. Results 70% of children and adolescents aged 7 to 12 years with ADHD had sleep disorders, the 54% had anxiety symptoms and 9% had a depressive disorder.

"Scope: A new service supporting family doctors dealing with psychiatric patients in the community: Current utilization and quality improvement implementation protocol in the covid era","Introduction Seamless Care-Optimizing Patients Experience-Mental Health (SCOPE-MH) is a hub-based integrative case management and psychiatric care program supporting family physicians (FPs). SCOPE-MH provides patient resource navigation, social support, counselling, psychiatric consults, and short-term follow-up. Due to COVID-19, SCOPE-MH pivoted to serve patients completely online. Objectives To assess current utilization and evaluate patientsâ€™ and FPsâ€™ experiences using SCOPE-MH as an online service before and during COVID-19. Methods This evaluation was developed under the RE-AIM framework (Reach, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance). Two surveys, one for Patient Reported Experience Measures (PREMS), and one seeking FPs perspective on the service, will complement the evaluation. Results Past data showed that 66.4% of referrals to SCOPE-MH were women (ages 14-97), and 33.6% were men (ages 14-91). The most common diagnoses were anxiety and depression, followed by adjustment reaction and PTSD. 72% of referred patients had more than one psychiatric diagnosis. 35.4% of the referrals were resource navigation and brief coordination of care. 39.2% required long term involvement. The main recommendations provided were counselling resources in the community and referral to local community mental health teams. Data on patient and FP experiences using SCOPE-MH, and perspectives on unique needs for psychiatric care in COVID-19, is still being collected. Surveys will be sent within 6 months. Conclusions SCOPE-MH is an effective model to support FPâ€™s addressing patientsâ€™ psychiatric needs. The information obtained from the evaluation will be used to modify the online service to address unmet needs during COVID-19 and optimize current resources to serve more patients.","Hytman, L.; Bolea-AlamaÃ±ac, B.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Scope:+A+new+service+supporting+family+doctors+dealing+with+psychiatric+patients+in+the+community:+Current+utilization+and+quality+improvement+implementation+protocol+in+the+covid+era","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists; 64(Suppl 1):S391-S391, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-14","",39172,""
"I-mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (i-MBCT) in the treatment of COVID-19 related adjustment disorder a RCT study with active control group","Introduction Adjustment disorder (AD) is described as a maladaptive reaction to an identifiable psychosocial stressor/s that usually emerges within a month after the onset of the stressor. With all uncertainty, fears and disorientation, itâ€™s no surprise that many people have developed an AD linked to the sudden changes brought about by COVID-19, such as threat to life, imposed restrictions, and the associated changes. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) has been found to be effective for depression and anxiety problems, little is known, however, about its efficacy for adjustment disorder. Objectives The aim of the current research was to evaluate if 4 weeks long, modified internet-delivered MBCT can reduce symptoms of Covid-19 related AD. Methods 438 individuals with a diagnosis of AD were recruited to take part in the study. They were randomly assigned to i-MBCT, i-progressive muscle relaxation training (i-PMR), and Waiting List (WL). Assessments with questionnaires evaluating AD (ADMN-20), depression (PHQ-9, HADS-D), and anxiety (HADS-A, GAD-7) were filled at baseline, 4-week, and 1-month post-randomization. 142 individuals completed baseline and 4 week assessment (i-MBCT, n= 34;i-PMR, n= 36 and WL, n=72). Results We found a significant reduction in AD symptoms following the i-MBCT group, whereas no change was found in both control conditions. While a decrease in depressive and anxiety was found in both i-MBCT and i-PMR groups, the greatest reduction has been observed in i-MBCT. Conclusions These preliminary findings suggest that i-MBCT can be an effective intervention in treating Covid-19 related AD, but more studies are needed.

"Analyzing the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among turkish immigrants treated at the neuro-psychiatric center riem Munich","Introduction Infectious diseases have been humanityâ€™s constant problem throughout history and they have shown how vulnerable we remain. COVID-19, commonly known as coronavirus pandemic, has already triggered a variety of psychological problems including fear, anxiety, and suicidal attempts. It has been hypothesized that immigrants who lost their job and have lower income or lower education level are more worried and fearful. Objectives This paper aims to investigate the psychological conditions and stress level of immigrants in the NPZR. Moreover, the parameters influencing stress levels of the immigrants were analyzed. Methods Demographics, level of stress and current psychological conditions of participants were gathered and analyzed through a structured survey. Besides, in-person interviews were conducted to explore the responses of the participants to receive more and deeper information. Results The sample consists of 110 responders (45.3 % males;51.8 % females). The findings of the study illustrated that while there was no relationship between gender of the immigrants and the level of stress, participants with low income (27.5 %) and unemployed immigrants (24.2 %) felt more worried and anxious. As time passes, the anxiety level of the participants decreased by 49.1 % but 40.9 % of the participants still experience severe anxiety. Conclusions The findings demonstrate that having low income or being unemployed as well as the cancellation of travel plans, are positively related with the depression level of the participants. The result of this paper show that more attention has to be given towards immigrants with low income as they are more vulnerable during the COVID-19 Pandemic.

"Examining the relationship among physical activity, stress, depression, and anxiety in college students","Mental health challenges have been steadily increasing around college campuses, with consistent findings pointing to ethnic minorities and low socioeconomic groups adversely affected and needing more support than their counterparts. On the other end, physical activity (PA) has consistently been associated with positive mental health outcomes. Therefore, further understanding the relationship among race, socioeconomic status, and PA, as well as college students personal experiences on campuses, is of great importance to improve college student well-being. This two-study dissertation sought to address these relationships. Study 1 evaluated differences in mental health across race, parental education (proxy for SES) and PA. Student obstacles to using on-campus mental health and PA resources were examined in a mixed methods design. Most of the data was collected prior to the establishment of COVID-19 restrictions at a large Midwest university. Mental health levels were anticipated to vary between the variables of race, parental education, and PA, which was partially supported. Results showed that low SES participants had significantly higher levels of depression, while PA was associated with lower levels of anxiety and stress.Study 2 sought to replicate findings of study 1 and test the relationships within the context of a diathesis-stress model that includes PA using an expanded sample of students drawn from a large Midwest university and a smaller East Coast university. In addition to replicating study 1 findings, study 2 yielded several themes that revealed common obstacles of college students and how they overcome those obstacles. The hypothesized relationship among race, SES, PA and mental health was partially supported. Specifically, participants whose parents or guardians had lower levels of education reported higher levels of anxiety, while there were significant differences in mental health across different levels of PA. The other goal of this study was to map the above relationship onto a PA moderating model, including variables of race, parental education, depression, stress, and anxiety, based on an adapted diathesis-stress model. This relationship was not supported by the data. Free response answers revealed interesting themes related to the college student experience and campus resources. Focus groups added to this through discussions on topics like the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health, and advice for future students. Data from study 2 was collected while COVID-19 pandemic restrictions were in place. Overall results expanded knowledge on the experience of COVID-19 on college campus and the interconnection between race, parental education, PA, and mental health. Further social relations were important for student wellbeing. Students' also shared obstacles they faced with the use of on campus mental health and other resources.

"Impact of Covid-19 on lung cancer and Mesothelioma specialist nurses: A survey of experiences and perceptions","Purpose The covid-19 global pandemic has impacted on nurses who have rapidly adapted to new ways of working, and experienced negative impacts due to over-stretched services. Two surveys captured the experiences of lung cancer and mesothelioma specialist nurses in the United Kingdom (UK) in 2020, but the impact of later stages of the pandemic was unknown. This study aimed to explore the impact of covid-19 on lung Cancer and mesothelioma nurses since January 2021, the second wave of the pandemic. Methods An online cross-sectional survey with both open and closed questions explored the impact of covid-19 on ways of working and workload, quality of care, and health and wellbeing. The survey was open to UK based lung cancer and mesothelioma advanced or specialist nurses. Results 85 nurses responded to the survey. The majority were Clinical Nurse Specialists, based in England. Respondents reported changes in ways of working due to redeployment, staff shortages, and home working. Widespread adoption of virtual working practices led to concerns of negative impacts. Perceived excessive workload impacted on care with two-thirds of the sample (57, 67%) reporting they had been unable to provide the same quality of care to patients. Impacts on nursesâ€™ health and wellbeing were reported with two-thirds of the sample (56, 66%) reporting a deterioration in emotional wellbeing and mental health. Coping mechanisms employed included online team support to share experiences and increased uptake of exercise;however, impacts on lifestyle and access to coping mechanisms varied. Conclusion Nurses have stepped up to the challenges of the pandemic with teamwork and innovation, but pressure arising from the pandemic and high workloads led to negative impacts on wellbeing. The authors have provided recommendations to improve patient care and support the wellbeing of nurses, which will be key to a resilient workforce living with covid-19. Whilst this study focussed on lung cancer and mesothelioma specialists, the findings have wider implications for other cancer specialties.","Hargreaves, Sarah, Clayton, Karen, Creech, Lorraine, Darlison, Liz, Ejegi-Memeh, Stephanie, Fenemore, Jackie, Gardiner, Clare, Taylor, Bethany, Tod, Angela","https://www.google.com/search?q=Impact+of+Covid-19+on+lung+cancer+and+Mesothelioma+specialist+nurses:+A+survey+of+experiences+and+perceptions","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of oncology nursing : the official journal of European Oncology Nursing Society;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-14","",39176,""
"Social medias in increasing anxiety around COVID-19 in Morocco","Introduction Discovered in December 2019, COVID has affected the entire planet, through direct exposure to its virus;SARS-COV-2, or indirectly through the media, Indeed, on January 20, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be â€œa public health emergency of international concern.â€ Along with other public health crises and other collective trauma (terrorism, H1N1 epidemic or SARS-COV), exposure to publicized information on this virus generates psychiatric disorders, in particular anxiety and absence of well-being.

"The impact of telemedicine availability on fatal opioid overdose rates in Texas, 2020","Substance use disorders (SUDs) and fatal overdoses are a significant problem in the United States. A viable and effective method for treating SUDs is through telemedicine (tele-SUD) visits. Tele-SUD visits are an effective means of meeting with patients virtually, especially in the post-COVID-19 environment;however, a problem in health care exists concerning the availability of tele-SUD services in middle America. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of tele-SUD availability on rates of opioid overdose deaths in the state of Texas. Donabedian's model of health care quality evaluation was used as the theoretical framework. A quantitative, independent samples, t-test analysis was used to investigate the relationship between telemedicine services and opioid overdose deaths in 254 counties in Texas in 2020. A regression analysis was conducted to determine if the amount of telemedicine availability per capita made a difference in fatal overdoses in each county of Texas. Data were collected from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the University of Wisconsin's County Health Rankings and Roadmaps. The independent variable was availability of tele-SUD, and the dependent variable was rates of countywide opioid overdose deaths in 2020. The results of the analysis revealed no statistically significant connection between the presence of telemedicine in a given county and its opioid overdose death rate. Findings from this study may be used for positive social change by tele-SUD administrators in designing their programs.

"Bipolar disorder, pregnancy, COVID-19: Electroconvulsive therapy is needed!","Introduction Treating pregnant women with bipolar disorder is among the most challenging clinical endeavors. Patients and clinicians are faced with difficult choices at every turn, and no approach is without risk. Many primary mood stabilizers have been associated with risk of congenital malformations. In the last 15 years, there has been an increase of antepartum use of atypical antipsychotic drugs, many of which could be viable alternatives to mood stabilizers. Electroconvulsive therapy has been recommended as a safe and efficacious treatment of bipolar depressive and manic episodes in pregnant women. Objectives This case presents a 24-year-old woman, with COVID-19 infection, that underwent an acute manic episode at her 20-weeks-pregnancy. The goal was to stabilize the patient by the use of electroconvulsive therapy. Methods The patient was admitted in isolation in the psychiatric ward. Treatment was started with olanzapine 20mg/d and lorazepam 4mg/d. The patient maintained psychotic agitation that required higher dosage, while on the second week of isolation the PCR test was negative. After six weeks of treatment severe manic symptoms continued and electroconvulsive therapy was started. Results She received 10 electroconvulsive therapy sessions. The patient showed a substantial clinical improvement after the seventh administration. She gave birth at 37 weeks, with no complications during labor (Apgar 9/10).

"Thatâ€™s not my family: The undercover bipolar patient","Introduction Bipolar disorder is a serious psychiatric condition based on depressive, manic, and mixed phases. Bipolar disorder has been usually divided into type I (manic phases and depressive phases) and type II (hypomanic and depressive phases). Furthermore, subsequent classifications have been developed based on subtypes complexity. Objectives A case of a 52-year-old man is presented. The patient had suffered depressive symptoms and self-destructive ideation. He had sold his house to pay for drugs and prostitution, even though he was in quarantine for COVID-19. The patient had a history of depressive episodes with milder manic episodes which had been treated with antidepressants. Methods Analytical and imaging tests were performed without findings. Mood stabilizing treatment was started based on lithium salts. He became perplexed and suspicious of the medication. Auditory hallucinations appeared congruent with the mood and he began to think that his relatives were dead;the patient started to communicate via telephone with actors. A treatment based on olanzapine 30mg/d was started. Results The clinic was resolved with antipsychotic treatment. The diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder has been made in youth;however, some patients symptoms could be camouflaged and allow a functional life. Depressive episodes could present with psychotic symptoms and predispose more to suicide attempts than manic phases.

"Housing and youth mental health during a COVID-19 lockdown","Introduction Declines in mental health among youth in the COVID-19 pandemic have been observed, yet longitudinal studies on how housing may impact these declines are lacking. Objectives Our aim was to determine whether changes in mental health among Danish youth were dependent on their housing conditions. Methods Young participants from the Danish National Birth Cohort, who had responded to an online questionnaire at 18 years of age, and later during the initial national Danish lockdown, were included. Associations between housing conditions (direct access to outdoor spaces, urbanicity, household density, and household composition) and changes in mental health (mental well-being, quality of life (QoL) and loneliness) were examined in multivariate linear and logistic regression analyses. Results We included 7455 participants. Greater decreases in mental well-being were observed for youth with no access to direct outdoor spaces and those living in denser households (mean difference -0.83 [95 % CI -1.19, -0.48], -0.30 [-0.43, -0.18], respectively). Onset of low mental well-being was associated with no access and living alone (odds ratios (OR) 1.68 [1.15, 2.47] and OR 1.47 [1.05, 2.07], respectively). Household density was negatively associated with QoL (mean difference -0.21 [-0.30, -0.12]). Youth living alone experienced more loneliness (OR 2.12 [95 % CI 1.59, 2.82]). Conclusions How youthâ€™s mental health changed from before to during lockdown was associated with housing conditions. Among the Danish youth in our study, greater decreases in mental health during lockdown were observed among youth without access to outdoor spaces, living alone, or living in denser households.

"Fear of infection and optimism predict following stay-at-home recommendations during COVID-19 pandemic in russian young people","Introduction . Self-isolation regime is an effective measure to contain the pandemic (Alfano, Ercolano, 2020), but the psychological factors predicting compliance with stay-at-home recommendations (CSHR) are understudied. We hypothesized that 1) defensive optimism and constructive optimism will have opposite effects on CSHR, 2) the effect of defensive optimism will be mediated through a decrease of anxiety (fear of infection). Objectives . The purpose of this study was to assess the direct and indirect (through the fear of infection) effects of defensive optimism (belief that coronavirus problem is exaggerated) and constructive optimism (belief that peopleâ€™s efforts help to prevent infection and spread of the virus) on CSHR, controlling for dispositional optimism. Methods . A longitudinal study (from 10/4/2020 till 2/6/2020) was conducted on a sample of 306 university students (89% women, MA=21.20, SD=4.54) using a single-item measure of CSHR, LOT-R (Scheier et al., 1994), the scales of defensive and constructive optimism (Gordeeva, Sychev, 2020), and anxiety in a pandemic situation questionnaire (Tkhostov, Rasskazova, 2020). Results . During seven-week interval CSHR has decreased dramatically (Cohenâ€™s d=0.66, p&lt;0.001) while the other variables remained stable. Using SEM we have showed that CSHR at the end of study (T2) is predicted by the CSHR (T1) and through it by the defensive optimism (negative effect, p&lt;0.05) and constructive optimism (positive effect, p&lt;0.001).

"COVID-19 pandemic: Regarding alcohol consumption","Introduction On March, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. Social isolation, unemployment and financial difficulties can have an impact on mental health and trigger the use of alcohol as a form of coping. Since the beginning of this pandemic, the WHO had warned the general public of the potential risks of increased alcohol consumption, which might result in a higher incidence of alcohol use disorders (AUD) in future. Objectives The aim is to do a review of the literature of alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Non-systematic review of the literature with selection of scientific articles published in the last 7 months;by searching the Pubmed databases, the following MeSH terms were used: COVID-19;alcohol consumption. Results A recent article in The Lancet suggested that mental health and alcohol use during the pandemic, a major public health concern, are worthy of attention. Market research showed that alcohol sales increased in several countries compared to the same time last year. However, with the closure of several drinking places, sales are not in themselves reliable enough estimates of alcohol consumption. On the other hand, economic crises can lead to a reduction in alcohol consumption, due to financial problems or the risk of unemployment. Conclusions The present global circumstance is unique, and there is a need for further research on the relationship between alcohol consumption and COVID-19 to understand its long-term effects and develop specific prevention programs for this population.","GonÃ§alves, M.

Objectives The aim is to do a review of the literature of suicide prevention during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods Non-systematic review of the literature with selection of scientific articles published in the last 7 months;by searching the Pubmed databases, the following MeSH terms were used: Suicide prevention;COVID-19 Results In order to prevent suicide, urgent consideration must be extend beyond general mental health approaches. A wide-ranging interdisciplinary response that recognises how the pandemic might heighten risk is needed. The application of knowledge about effective suicide prevention is the key. Mental health services should develop clear remote assessment and care pathways, and staff training to support new ways of dealing with. Publications on mental health and psychological effects of COVID-19 outbreak provide important information and recommendations for all three levels of suicide prevention: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Conclusions The challenge of the COVID-19 outbreak might bring with it an opportunity to advance the field of suicide prevention and, thus, to save lives, which also represent a public health priority. The mental health community, backed by active vigilance and international collaboration, should be prepared and can use this challenging period to advance suicide prevention.","GonÃ§alves, M.

"Tracking emotions and emotion regulation strategies used in a hospital staff cohort during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction In response to collective life events, many people regulate their emotional states through social interactions to reduce cognitive tolls. During pandemics, physical distancing renders the social support strategy less viable, increasing mental health risks. Objectives The current work aims to understand the range of emotions and strategies used in a population of Mental Health staff. Methods We conducted an anonymous survey on staff from OMH facilities (n=211) to assess the impact of Covid-19. The current survey captures a host of social, affective, and demographic variables. Accompanied by scales on emotions, emotion regulation, risk, and perception. Results Work, family, and health-concerns were the primary contributors to mood. The most common strategy was â€œsituation-avoidance,â€ then â€œexercising.â€ When comparing depression scores against whether or not specific kinds of regulation strategies were utilized, only differences in the strategy of â€œemotion-suppressionâ€ and â€œauthority-seekingâ€ were substantially related to the CES-D scores. Specifically, participants who kept feelings to themselves tended to have higher CES-D scores than those who let their feelings show, while those who sought out authority scored lower on the CES-D, on average than those that did not seek authority. Conclusions Healthcare staff are under greater stress and pressure during national emergencies, and to regulate emotions during consistent high-stress, our preliminary data suggest that suppression and distraction strategies are dominant. Suggesting that staff prefer or have little choice but to focus on work. Alternatively, perhaps they are overwhelmed to the extent that avoidance and distraction are more accessible strategies. Further analysis of our data may help us understand more.","Goldring, A.; Silston, B.; Krueger, S.; Bendt, J.; Loguidice, M.; Wimberger, N.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Tracking+emotions+and+emotion+regulation+strategies+used+in+a+hospital+staff+cohort+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists; 64(Suppl 1):S291-S292, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-14","",39187,""
"Preliminary findings of a longitudinal follow-up study of the paediatric population and their families during and after the coronavirus pandemic and the confinement","Introduction Pandemic are known to generate traumatic events, such as job losses or violence [1]. Several studies have shown that epidemics and related health measures (quarantine, confinement) lead to an increase of acute stress disorders (ASD), post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD), anxiety and depression in the adult population [2]. In the pediatric population, few studies have been carried out on the psychiatric outcomes during and after epidemics and associated measures [3]. Objectives The aim of this study was to explore ASD symptoms during stay-at-home and Covid 19 pandemic and its impact on children and adolescent mental health. Methods Sixty participants (53% girls and 47% boys;mean age= 9 years 5 months) were included in this longitudinal study [4]. The measures consist in an emergency semi-directed interview designed to assess symptoms of ASD according to the age of children. Results Patientsâ€™ age modulated psychiatric outcomes. Children under the age of six shown more developmental regressions and more restlessness than older ones. Children from 6 to 12 years were characterized by more oppositional behaviors than adolescents. Finally, adolescents were characterized by more social isolation than younger ones. Other symptoms appear to be more stable across ages: sleep disturbance, fear behavior and somatization. Conclusions Young children experienced more externalized symptoms (opposition and agitation) and developmental regressions than older children [5]. Thus, it appears necessary during pandemic to take into account the psychiatric consequences of confinement to reduce psychosocial long-term outcomes in particular in younger patients who appeared to develop specific and age-related psychiatric disorders.","Gindt, M.; Fernandez, A.; Battista, M.; Richez, A.; Nachon, O.; Askenazy, F.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Preliminary+findings+of+a+longitudinal+follow-up+study+of+the+paediatric+population+and+their+families+during+and+after+the+coronavirus+pandemic+and+the+confinement","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists; 64(Suppl 1):S362-S363, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-14","",39188,""
"Mental health attendances in Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic: A telehealth success story?","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the delivery of mental health services globally. Within Australia, the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent containment measures have led to reduced face-to-face attendances. To maintain access to mental health consultations, new telehealth services were introduced by the Australian Government in late March 2020. Objectives We aimed to quantify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patterns of mental health attendances in Australia using an interrupted time series model. Methods To characterise patterns of mental health service utilisation, monthly mental health attendances between January 2016 and June 2020 were extracted from the Medicare database, stratified by clinician type: general practitioner (GP), psychiatrist, and allied health. We used triple exponential smoothing to model attendances between January 2017 and December 2019. Observed and predicted attendances between January and June 2020 were compared with 95% confidence (p&lt;0.05). Results Our models showed decreased mental health attendances in March and April, consistent with all healthcare services during this time. While uptake of telehealth was significant, it only partially covered the reduction in mental health attendances. Conclusions Our modelling highlights the significant impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health services in Australia, with telehealth only partially compensating for the reduction in face-to-face attendances. These results suggest that telehealth services may not be suitable for all individuals (e.g. those without reliable internet access).

Some studies have reported greater psychological impact in the younger population. To date, no previous study has focused on depressive disorder (DD) patients based on their age. Objectives To describe the psychological impact on DD according to age. Methods Cross-sectional study of an online survey available from 19 to 26 March 2020. Out of a total of 21207 respondents, 608 (2.9%) reported suffering from DD (mean age Â±SD = 41.2 yearsÂ±14.07 [18-82], 80.6% women). The subsample (608) was divided according to age, â€œyoungstersâ€ &lt;45 (57.4%)/ â€œeldersâ€ =45. DASS-21 and IES scales were employed. Statistical analyses: Chi-square, t-Student test.

"Research in mental health during the pandemic","Body The 2020 coronavirus pandemic sparked sudden change in all spheres of life, not least health services. Across Europe clinical research had to adapt. The virus peaked in different places at different times, with Londonâ€™s first wave in March-May. The National Institute for Health Research paused all face to face research at NHS and social care sites except for nationally prioritised Urgent Public Health (UHP) Covid-19 studies. The first UPH studies focused on acute Covid-19, largely in physical health settings. Research leaders quickly highlighted the need for high quality research data on the effects of the pandemic on the mental health of the general population, as well as the mental health and neuropsychiatric effects of the virus itself, to allow for the development and evaluation of mitigation strategies. The major UK research funders have resourced this. Once the first wave abated, paused research was restarted according to national prioritisation guidance. In Maudsley we worked closely with research teams to develop strategies to make our research programmes as Covid-19 adaptive as possible, maximising remote interaction with research participants, with robust infection prevention procedures if face to face meetings were necessary. Examples of innovative strategies will be shared. In January 2021 with the more transmissible variant of SARS CoV2, face to face research paused again, except where risk was outweighed by patient benefit in continuing. As patients benefit hugely from research and innovation and have better outcomes if treated in â€˜research-activeâ€™ hospitals, maintaining access to research opportunities without increasing risk of contracting Covid-19 will be key in coming months.

"The impact of protective face masks and coverings on patient-health provider communication","Introduction Amid the COVID-19 pandemic the trend points to universal use of protective face masks. The impact posed on verbal and non-verbal communication by masks is yet another challenge to be addressed in clinical care. Objectives To reflect on the consequences of face mask and covering use on communication in the clinical setting, including mental health settings. Methods Pubmed and Google Scholar literature search using terms face mask / face covering and communication / emotion. Results There is a lack of literature on the impact of protective face masks and coverings on communication in clinical settings. Face masks and coverings may have a significant impact on patient-healthcare professional relationship due to disruption of verbal (poorer quality of speech transmission) and non-verbal communication (emotional expression and recognition) with consequences on: 1) clarity of communication with potential for misunderstanding clinical information, advice and prescriptions posing safety issues, 2) emotion perception, expression and reciprocity, 4) perception of healthcare professionalsâ€™ empathy and therefore, 3) patient satisfaction, 4) quality of care, and 5) clinical outcomes. Difficulties in communication between the patientsÂ´family or other carers and healthcare providers and between healthcare professionals are likewise challenged. People with hearing impairment, children and people with mental illness may be especially vulnerable to these difficulties in communication. Conclusions Protective face masks and coverings are undoubtedly important in preventing spread of COVID-19, nonetheless mental healthcare professionals should take into account their significant impact on verbal and non-verbal communication in clinical care.

"Facial mask masking tardive dyskinesia","Introduction Facial covering and mask use is generally considered a preventive measure in reducing spread of infectious respiratory illnesses. With the COVID-19 pandemic, covering of the face, except the eyes, has become the norm for the first time for most people. Social interactions and clinical observation rely heavily on non-verbal communication of which facial expression is of utmost importance. While clinicians, especially in mental health settings, are acutely aware of the loss of information transmitted through the lower half of the face, signs of tardive dyskinesia may be forgotten in the list of potentially missed information. Objectives To reflect on possible failure to detect orobuccolingual movements of tardive dyskinesia due to use of facial masks. Methods Reflection on a clinical case of a patient with a treatment refractory psychosis who presents to an outpatient appointment with a facial mask. After the appointment, a family member transmitted having observed what appeared to be involuntary masticatory movements in the patient. Results Facial masks and coverings occult signs that may be visible on the lower half of the face. Conclusions Facial masks and coverings are essential in preventing COVID-19 contagion.

It is important to identify factors which are related to this increase. Objectives In present study we investigated how perceived value threat of Covid-19 is related to anxiety and depression symptoms in April â€“ May 2020 during the lockdown in Russia. Methods Three hundred and four participants were recruited online (Mage=33.18, SD=13.33, 108 males, 194 females). Participants completed the Short Schwartzâ€™s Value Survey (SSVS;Lindeman & Verkasalo, 2010). They were next asked to rate how likely their values could be threatened because of the Covid-19. They also completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger, 1983) and Beck Depression Inventory-II (Beck et al., 1996). Results A multiple linear regression model was built to assess how own values and values threatened by Covid-19 explain state anxiety during the lockdown. Threat to openness values was positively related to state anxiety (b=1.07, SE=.49, ÃŸ=.13, p=.032). Threat to conservation values was only marginally related to state anxiety (b=1.03, SE=.58, ÃŸ=.13, p=.074). The effects of self-enhancement and self-transcendence values were not significant. Conclusions When Covid-19 is perceived as a threat to openness to change values â€“ hedonism, stimulation and self-direction â€“ people experience higher level of anxiety symptoms. Interestingly, perceived threat of Covid-19 to security, conformity and tradition was only marginally related to anxiety. Future studies might explore how encouraging people to fulfill their openness to change values in a safe mode might decrease the level of anxiety.","Fyodorova, E.; Arina, G.; Iosifyan, M.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Perceived+value+threat+of+COVID-19+is+related+to+anxiety+symptoms","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists; 64(Suppl 1):S301-S301, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-14","",39197,""
"The role of Mediterranean Diet in mental health in pandemic times","Introduction In late 2019, an epidemic outbreak emerges in China caused by a new coronavirus with high transmission and human infection potential which in March 2020, was characterized by WHO as a pandemic. The lockdown has repercussions on the populationâ€™s well-being, reflected in their food choices. There is a tendency to increase the consumption of energy dense food, rich in fat and carbohydrates, which are related to an increased risk of depression. Objectives The main goal of this non-systematic literature review was to understand the impact of the Mediterranean Diet on Mental Health promotion in SARSCoV-2 pandemic. Methods Literature from Pubmed database were searched, with the following keywords: COVID-19, Depression, Anxiety, Mental Health and Mediterranean Diet. Results Studies indicate that a diet based on the Mediterranean Diet is associated with a decreased risk of developing depressive symptoms, especially when there is moderate to high adherence to this dietary pattern. High consumption of plant and fish foods, reduced consumption of sugary products, processed and red meats and the use of olive oil as a fat source, are principles of the Mediterranean diet, associated with an improvement in endothelial function, increased levels of eicosanoids and serotonin synthesis and regulation of serotonin which seem to explain this protective effect. Conclusions In addition to decreasing the risk of obesity, diabetes, and hypertension, comorbidities associated with the most serious disease of COVID-19, the Mediterranean Diet seems to play an important role in promoting mental health, with a decreased risk of developing depressive symptoms.

"PRO perspective","Body The COVID-19 pandemic has had a detrimental impact not only on the ordinary lives of people worldwide, but also on the access to mental health care system. In particular, in the first months of the global health emergency, a drastic reduction in the number of access to healthcare system has been recorded. In the â€œPhase 1â€ of the emergency, the fear for the contagion, the strict containment measures and the lack of adequate information regarding the virus have been listed as possible factors contributing to this phenomenon. In the â€œPhase 2â€, mental health care has been completely reorganized in order to compile with requirements for physical distancing and reducing overcrowding. The visits in outpatientsâ€™ units have been rescheduled, healthcare professionals have received information regarding the adequate use of protective personal equipment and patients have learnt how to protect themselves. Furthermore, telemental health approaches have been fostered worldwide, although several obstacles still persist such as the lack of adequate training for healthcare professionals for using telemental health instruments, the uncertainties regarding the legal implications of telemental health and the difficulties for older patients to access those systems. During this critical period, mental healthcare systems have been proven to be resilient. The pandemic has speed up the process of transformation of mental health care system and we are learning how to further improve the system in order to sustain these changes in the long-term.

"Is resilience a protective factor against the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health? Results from a national multicentric study","The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting on the mental health of the general population and its consequences will be long lasting. As already noted in previous epidemics, different factors can moderate the detrimental impact of a traumatogenic event on mental health. In particular, it has been found that people using problem-solving coping strategies, with an adequate social network and supported by family members, have good long-term outcomes and are able to adjust to the detrimental impact of the traumatic event. The COvid Mental hEalth Trial (COMET) network, including ten university Italian sites and the National Institute of Health, has promoted a national online survey in order to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of the Italian general population. In particular, the use of Internet and social media, the duration of the exposure to COVID-19 related containment measures, the different levels of post-traumatic growth and the variety of coping strategies adopted have been considered as possible mediators of the resilience styles adopted. In our sample, participants from the general population reported a good level of resilience compared with people with pre-existing mental or physical disorders.

"[Analysis of the stressors and mental status of civil aviation pilots under the background of the major infectious disease]","<b>Objective:</b> To study the stressors and mental status of civil aviation pilots under the background of major infectious disease. <b>Methods:</b> From January to March 2021, a cluster sampling method was used to select 143 airline pilots in service as the research objects. The self-made emotion and stress source questionnaire, Chinese version of stress perception scale (CPSS) , self rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and self rating Depression Scale (SDS) were used to investigate the airline pilot population. 136 valid questionnaires were collected, with an effective recovery rate of 95.1%. The measurement data conform to the normal distribution and are expressed by (<i>x</i>Ã‚Â±<i>s</i>) . T-test and analysis of variance are used for comparison between groups, and Pearson correlation is used for correlation analysis. The data that do not conform to the normal distribution are expressed by the median and quartile [<i>M</i> (<i>Q</i>(1), <i>Q</i>(3)) ], and the non parametric test is used for the comparison between groups. Multiple linear stepwise regression was used to analyze the influencing factors of pressure perception. In addition, Amos 23.0 software was used to construct structural equation models of stress perception and negative emotions. <b>Results:</b> Under the background of the epidemic, the main sources of stress for civil aviation pilots are: the risk of possible reduction in income, the risk of contracting COVID-19, the pressure at work, and the risk of possible slow progress of upgrading. Among them, the first co pilot was more worried about the possible reduction of income than the instructor (<i>P</i>=0.009) ; The first co pilot and the captain of the airline were more worried about the possible slowdown of the upgrade progress than the instructor (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001, <i>P</i>=0.014) . The mean pressure perception of pilots was higher than that of Chinese norm (<i>t</i>=3.11, <i>P</i>=0.002) . The standard scores of anxiety and depression were slightly higher than the standard scores of the Chinese norm under the non epidemic situation (<i>t</i>=7.00, 4.07, all <i>P</i>&lt;0.001) . The results of multiple linear stepwise regression analysis showed that stress perception was negatively correlated with good family relations (<i>t</i>=-8.50, <i>P</i>=0.000) , and positively correlated with worries about slow progress of upgrading, COVID-19 infection, lack of interpersonal communication and income reduction (<i>t</i>=3.31Ã£â‚¬Â3.86Ã£â‚¬Â2.88Ã£â‚¬Â2.06, <i>P</i>&lt;0.05) . Pressure perception was positively correlated with negative emotion (all <i>P</i>&lt;0.001) . The results of structural equation model show that stress perception affects pilots' negative emotions directly or indirectly, and its standardized total effects on anxiety, depression, hypochondriac, fear, compulsion and irritability are 0.719, 0.811, 0.403, 0.355, 0.295 and 0.244 respectively. <b>Conclusion:</b> Public health emergencies have an impact on the mental status of pilots. Should pay attention to the stressors and psychological conditions of pilots in time, and consider formulating measures to relieve the stress of pilots. <b>Ã§â€ºÂ®Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¯Â¼Å¡</b> Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¥Â¤Â§Ã¤Â¼Â Ã¦Å¸â€œÃ§â€”â€¦Ã¨Æ’Å’Ã¦â„¢Â¯Ã¤Â¸â€¹Ã¦Â°â€˜Ã¨Ë†ÂªÃ©Â£Å¾Ã¨Â¡Å’Ã¥â€˜ËœÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¦ÂºÂÃ¥ÂÅ Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã§Å Â¶Ã¥â€ ÂµÃ£â‚¬â€š <b>Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â³â€¢Ã¯Â¼Å¡</b> Ã¤ÂºÅ½2021Ã¥Â¹Â´1Ã¨â€¡Â³3Ã¦Å“Ë†Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â½Â¿Ã§â€Â¨Ã¦â€¢Â´Ã§Â¾Â¤Ã¦Å Â½Ã¦Â Â·Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â³â€¢Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¦Å Â½Ã¥Ââ€“Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¥Â½Â¹Ã§Å¡â€ž143Ã¥ÂÂÃ¦Â°â€˜Ã¨Ë†ÂªÃ©Â£Å¾Ã¨Â¡Å’Ã¥â€˜ËœÃ¤Â½Å“Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¨Â±Â¡Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã©â€¡â€¡Ã§â€Â¨Ã£â‚¬Å Ã¨â€¡ÂªÃ§Â¼â€“Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã§Â»ÂªÃ¤Â¸Å½Ã¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¦ÂºÂÃ©â€”Â®Ã¥ÂÂ·Ã£â‚¬â€¹Ã£â‚¬Å Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¦â€“â€¡Ã§â€°Ë†Ã¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ§Å¸Â¥Ã¨Â§â€°Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¡Â¨Ã£â‚¬â€¹Ã¯Â¼Ë†CPSSÃ¯Â¼â€°Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ£â‚¬Å Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¨â€¡ÂªÃ¨Â¯â€žÃ©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¡Â¨Ã£â‚¬â€¹Ã¯Â¼Ë†SASÃ¯Â¼â€°Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ£â‚¬Å Ã¦Å â€˜Ã©Æ’ÂÃ¨â€¡ÂªÃ¨Â¯â€žÃ©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¡Â¨Ã£â‚¬â€¹Ã¯Â¼Ë†SDSÃ¯Â¼â€°Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¨Ë†ÂªÃ§ÂºÂ¿Ã©Â£Å¾Ã¨Â¡Å’Ã¥â€˜ËœÃ§Â¾Â¤Ã¤Â½â€œÃ¨Â¿â€ºÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã¨Â°Æ’Ã¦Å¸Â¥Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥â€ºÅ¾Ã¦â€Â¶Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¦â€¢Ë†Ã©â€”Â®Ã¥ÂÂ·136Ã¤Â»Â½Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¦â€¢Ë†Ã¥â€ºÅ¾Ã¦â€Â¶Ã§Å½â€¡Ã¤Â¸Âº95.1%Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¨Â®Â¡Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¨Âµâ€žÃ¦â€“â„¢Ã§Â¬Â¦Ã¥ÂË†Ã¦Â­Â£Ã¦â‚¬ÂÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã¥Â¸Æ’Ã§â€Â¨Ã¯Â¼Ë†<i>x</i>Ã‚Â±<i>s</i>Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¨Â¡Â¨Ã§Â¤ÂºÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã§Â»â€žÃ©â€”Â´Ã¦Â¯â€Ã¨Â¾Æ’Ã¤Â½Â¿Ã§â€Â¨<i>t</i>Ã¦Â£â‚¬Ã©ÂªÅ’Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¥Â·Â®Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ¤Â½Â¿Ã§â€Â¨Ã§Å¡Â®Ã¥Â°â€Ã©â‚¬Å Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¤Â¸ÂÃ§Â¬Â¦Ã¥ÂË†Ã¦Â­Â£Ã¦â‚¬ÂÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã¥Â¸Æ’Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦â€¢Â°Ã¦ÂÂ®Ã¤Â½Â¿Ã§â€Â¨Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¤Â½ÂÃ¦â€¢Â°Ã¥ÂÅ Ã¥â€ºâ€ºÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã¤Â½ÂÃ¦â€¢Â°[<i>M</i>Ã¯Â¼Ë†<i>Q</i>(1)Ã¯Â¼Å’<i>Q</i>(3)Ã¯Â¼â€°]Ã¨Â¡Â¨Ã§Â¤ÂºÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã§Â»â€žÃ©â€”Â´Ã¦Â¯â€Ã¨Â¾Æ’Ã©â€¡â€¡Ã§â€Â¨Ã©ÂÅ¾Ã¥Ââ€šÃ¦â€¢Â°Ã¦Â£â‚¬Ã©ÂªÅ’Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¤Â½Â¿Ã§â€Â¨Ã¥Â¤Å¡Ã¥â€¦Æ’Ã§ÂºÂ¿Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã©â‚¬ÂÃ¦Â­Â¥Ã¥â€ºÅ¾Ã¥Â½â€™Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¦â€žÅ¸Ã§Å¸Â¥Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ§â€Â¨AMOS 23.0Ã¨Â½Â¯Ã¤Â»Â¶Ã¨Â¿â€ºÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¦â€žÅ¸Ã§Å¸Â¥Ã¥ÂÅ Ã¥Ââ€žÃ¨Â´Å¸Ã©ÂÂ¢Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã§Â»ÂªÃ§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾â€žÃ¦â€“Â¹Ã§Â¨â€¹Ã¦Â¨Â¡Ã¥Å¾â€¹Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦Å¾â€žÃ¥Â»ÂºÃ£â‚¬â€š <b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã¯Â¼Å¡</b> Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¨Æ’Å’Ã¦â„¢Â¯Ã¤Â¸â€¹Ã©Â£Å¾Ã¨Â¡Å’Ã¥â€˜ËœÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸Â»Ã¨Â¦ÂÃ¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¦ÂºÂÃ¤Â¸ÂºÃ¯Â¼Å¡Ã¦â€Â¶Ã¥â€¦Â¥Ã¥ÂÂ¯Ã¨Æ’Â½Ã¥â€¡ÂÃ¥Â°â€˜Ã§Å¡â€žÃ©Â£Å½Ã©â„¢Â©Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¦â€žÅ¸Ã¦Å¸â€œÃ¦â€“Â°Ã¥â€ Â Ã¨â€šÂºÃ§â€šÅ½Ã§Å¡â€žÃ©Â£Å½Ã©â„¢Â©Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¥Â·Â¥Ã¤Â½Å“Ã¦â€”Â¶Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ£â‚¬ÂÃ¥Ââ€¡Ã§ÂºÂ§Ã¨Â¿â€ºÃ¥ÂºÂ¦Ã¥ÂÂ¯Ã¨Æ’Â½Ã¥ÂËœÃ§Â¼â€œÃ§Å¡â€žÃ©Â£Å½Ã©â„¢Â©Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥â€¦Â¶Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã§Â¬Â¬Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¥â€°Â¯Ã©Â©Â¾Ã©Â©Â¶Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¤ÂºÅ½Ã¦â€Â¶Ã¥â€¦Â¥Ã¥ÂÂ¯Ã¨Æ’Â½Ã¥â€¡ÂÃ¥Â°â€˜Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦â€¹â€¦Ã¥Â¿Â§Ã©Â«ËœÃ¤ÂºÅ½Ã¦â€¢â„¢Ã¥â€˜ËœÃ¯Â¼Ë†<i>P</i>=0.009Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¯Â¼â€ºÃ§Â¬Â¬Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¥â€°Â¯Ã©Â©Â¾Ã©Â©Â¶Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¨Ë†ÂªÃ§ÂºÂ¿Ã¦Å“ÂºÃ©â€¢Â¿Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¤ÂºÅ½Ã¥Ââ€¡Ã§ÂºÂ§Ã¨Â¿â€ºÃ¥ÂºÂ¦Ã¥ÂÂ¯Ã¨Æ’Â½Ã¥ÂËœÃ§Â¼â€œÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¦â€¹â€¦Ã¥Â¿Â§Ã¥Ââ€¡Ã©Â«ËœÃ¤ÂºÅ½Ã¦â€¢â„¢Ã¥â€˜ËœÃ¯Â¼Ë†<i>P</i>&lt;0.001Ã£â‚¬Â<i>P</i>=0.014Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ©Â£Å¾Ã¨Â¡Å’Ã¥â€˜ËœÃ¨Â¢Â«Ã¨Â¯â€¢Ã¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¦â€žÅ¸Ã§Å¸Â¥Ã¥Ââ€¡Ã¥â‚¬Â¼Ã©Â«ËœÃ¤ÂºÅ½Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¥â€ºÂ½Ã¥Â¸Â¸Ã¦Â¨Â¡Ã¯Â¼Ë†<i>t</i>=3.11Ã¯Â¼Å’<i>P</i>=0.002Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥â€¦Â¶Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¦Å â€˜Ã©Æ’ÂÃ¦Â â€¡Ã¥â€¡â€ Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¥Ââ€¡Ã¥â‚¬Â¼Ã§â€¢Â¥Ã©Â«ËœÃ¤ÂºÅ½Ã©ÂÅ¾Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¤Â¸â€¹Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸Â­Ã¥â€ºÂ½Ã¥Â¸Â¸Ã¦Â¨Â¡Ã¦Â â€¡Ã¥â€¡â€ Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¯Â¼Ë†<i>t</i>=7.00Ã£â‚¬Â4.08Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Ââ€¡<i>P</i>&lt;0.001Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Â¤Å¡Ã¥â€¦Æ’Ã§ÂºÂ¿Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã©â‚¬ÂÃ¦Â­Â¥Ã¥â€ºÅ¾Ã¥Â½â€™Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã¦ËœÂ¾Ã§Â¤ÂºÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¦â€žÅ¸Ã§Å¸Â¥Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã¥Â®Â¶Ã¥ÂºÂ­Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã§Â³Â»Ã¨â€°Â¯Ã¥Â¥Â½Ã¥â€˜Ë†Ã§Å½Â°Ã¨Â´Å¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¨Ââ€Ã¯Â¼Ë†<i>t</i>=-8.50Ã¯Â¼Å’<i>P</i>=0.000Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã¥Ââ€¡Ã§ÂºÂ§Ã¨Â¿â€ºÃ¥ÂºÂ¦Ã¥ÂËœÃ§Â¼â€œÃ¦â€¹â€¦Ã¥Â¿Â§Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¦Ëœâ€œÃ¦â€žÅ¸Ã¦Å¸â€œÃ¦â€“Â°Ã¥â€ Â Ã¨â€šÂºÃ§â€šÅ½Ã¦â€¹â€¦Ã¥Â¿Â§Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¤ÂºÂºÃ©â„¢â€¦Ã¤ÂºÂ¤Ã¥Â¾â‚¬Ã§Â¼ÂºÃ¤Â¹ÂÃ¥ÂÅ Ã¦â€Â¶Ã¥â€¦Â¥Ã¥â€¡ÂÃ¥Â°â€˜Ã¦â€¹â€¦Ã¥Â¿Â§Ã¥â€˜Ë†Ã§Å½Â°Ã¦Â­Â£Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¨Ââ€Ã¯Â¼Ë†<i>t</i>=3.31Ã£â‚¬Â3.86Ã£â‚¬Â2.88Ã£â‚¬Â2.06Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Ââ€¡<i>P</i>&lt;0.05Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¦â€žÅ¸Ã§Å¸Â¥Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã¨Â´Å¸Ã©ÂÂ¢Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã§Â»ÂªÃ¥â€˜Ë†Ã¦Â­Â£Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¯Â¼Ë†Ã¥Ââ€¡<i>P</i>&lt;0.001Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾â€žÃ¦â€“Â¹Ã§Â¨â€¹Ã¦Â¨Â¡Ã¥Å¾â€¹Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã¦ËœÂ¾Ã§Â¤ÂºÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¦â€žÅ¸Ã§Å¸Â¥Ã©â‚¬Å¡Ã¨Â¿â€¡Ã§â€ºÂ´Ã¦Å½Â¥Ã¦Ë†â€“Ã©â€”Â´Ã¦Å½Â¥Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦â€“Â¹Ã¥Â¼ÂÃ¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ©Â£Å¾Ã¨Â¡Å’Ã¥â€˜ËœÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¨Â´Å¸Ã©ÂÂ¢Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã§Â»ÂªÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¦Å â€˜Ã©Æ’ÂÃ£â‚¬ÂÃ§â€“â€˜Ã§â€”â€¦Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¦ÂÂÃ¦Æ’Â§Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¥Â¼ÂºÃ¨Â¿Â«Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¦Ëœâ€œÃ¦â‚¬â€™Ã¦Â â€¡Ã¥â€¡â€ Ã¥Å’â€“Ã¦â‚¬Â»Ã¦â€¢Ë†Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¥Ë†Â«Ã¤Â¸Âº0.719Ã£â‚¬Â0.811Ã£â‚¬Â0.403Ã£â‚¬Â0.355Ã£â‚¬Â0.295Ã¥â€™Å’0.244Ã£â‚¬â€š <b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¨Â®ÂºÃ¯Â¼Å¡</b> Ã§ÂªÂÃ¥Ââ€˜Ã¥â€¦Â¬Ã¥â€¦Â±Ã¥ÂÂ«Ã§â€Å¸Ã¤Âºâ€¹Ã¤Â»Â¶Ã¤Â¼Å¡Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã©Â£Å¾Ã¨Â¡Å’Ã¥â€˜ËœÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã§Å Â¶Ã¥â€ ÂµÃ¤ÂºÂ§Ã§â€Å¸Ã¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¥ÂÅ Ã¦â€”Â¶Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¦Â³Â¨Ã©Â£Å¾Ã¨Â¡Å’Ã¥â€˜ËœÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¦ÂºÂÃ¥ÂÅ Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã§Å Â¶Ã¦â‚¬ÂÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã§Â§Â¯Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ¥Ë†Â¶Ã¥Â®Å¡Ã§Â¼â€œÃ¨Â§Â£Ã¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¦Å½ÂªÃ¦â€“Â½Ã£â‚¬â€š.","Wang, Zou, Li","https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn121094-20210802-00381","20221013","Civil aviation pilots;

"Post-acute sequelae of covid-19 six to 12 months after infection: population based study","To describe symptoms and symptom clusters of post-covid syndrome six to 12 months after acute infection, describe risk factors, and examine the association of symptom clusters with general health and working capacity. Population based, cross sectional study SETTING: Adults aged 18-65 years with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between October 2020 and March 2021 notified to health authorities in four geographically defined regions in southern Germany. 50Ã¢â‚¬â€°457 patients were invited to participate in the study, of whom 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°053 (24%) responded and 11Ã¢â‚¬â€°710 (58.8% (n=6881) female; mean age 44.1 years; 3.6% (412/11Ã¢â‚¬â€°602) previously admitted with covid-19; mean follow-up time 8.5 months) could be included in the analyses. Symptom frequencies (six to 12 months after versus before acute infection), symptom severity and clustering, risk factors, and associations with general health recovery and working capacity. The symptom clusters fatigue (37.2% (4213/11Ã¢â‚¬â€°312), 95% confidence interval 36.4% to 38.1%) and neurocognitive impairment (31.3% (3561/11Ã¢â‚¬â€°361), 30.5% to 32.2%) contributed most to reduced health recovery and working capacity, but chest symptoms, anxiety/depression, headache/dizziness, and pain syndromes were also prevalent and relevant for working capacity, with some differences according to sex and age. Considering new symptoms with at least moderate impairment of daily life and Ã¢â€°Â¤80% recovered general health or working capacity, the overall estimate for post-covid syndrome was 28.5% (3289/11Ã¢â‚¬â€°536, 27.7% to 29.3%) among participants or at least 6.5% (3289/50Ã¢â‚¬â€°457) in the infected adult population (assuming that all non-responders had completely recovered). The true value is likely to be between these estimates. Despite the limitation of a low response rate and possible selection and recall biases, this study suggests a considerable burden of self-reported post-acute symptom clusters and possible sequelae, notably fatigue and neurocognitive impairment, six to 12 months after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, even among young and middle aged adults after mild infection, with a substantial impact on general health and working capacity.

"Associations of connectedness and parental behaviors with adolescent physical activity and mental health during COVID-19: A mediation analysis using the 2021 adolescent behaviors and experiences survey","The purpose of this study was to examine the associations of connectedness and parental behaviors with adolescent physical activity (PA) and mental health during COVID-19. Participants were a representative sample of US high school students who completed the 2021 Adolescent Behaviors and Experiences Survey (ABES; NÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯7705; 50.4% female). ABES was completed online during the spring of 2021 and data were analyzed during the spring of 2022. Independent variables were items asking about perceived school and virtual connectedness, parental emotional abuse, and parental monitoring. Latent variables represented both PA and mental health. Two weighted structural equation models tested the associations between connectedness, parental behaviors, and mental health mediated through PA (Model 1) and between connectedness, parental behaviors, and PA mediated through mental health (Model 2) with indirect effect confidence intervals obtained using Monte Carlo simulations. School connectedness directly associated with better mental health in Model 1 (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.17, pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001) and with higher PA in Model 2 (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.19, pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001) while virtual connectedness directly associated with higher PA in Model 2 (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.08, pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001). Parental emotional abuse directly associated with poorer mental health in Model 1 (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯-0.43, pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001). Standardized indirect effects to better mental health mediated through higher PA were observed for school connectedness (IEÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.017, pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001) and virtual connectedness (IEÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.007, pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001) and indirect effects to lower PA mediated through poorer mental health were observed for parental emotional abuse (IEÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯-0.050, pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001). Perceptions of school and virtual connectedness and parental emotional abuse both directly and indirectly impacted adolescent PA and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Burns, Armstrong","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2022.107299","20221013","Adolescent; Exercise; Friends; Pandemics; Parents","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-14","",39208,""
"Inequitable distribution of excess mortality during the COVID-19 in South Korea, 2020","This study analyzed the inequities of excess mortality according to the region and socioeconomic division to explain the distribution of excess mortality in South Korea in 2020. We acquired weekly all-cause mortality data from Jan 2015 to Dec 2020: (i) the National Health Insurance Database and (ii) Vital Statistics. Excess mortality for 2020 was calculated by comparing the weekly observed deaths with expected deaths from the same period (2015-2019) using Quasi-Poisson regression. The inequitable distribution of excess mortality was also identified. The estimated excess mortality in South Korea was -29,112 (95% CI -29,832 to -28,391) and -55 per 100,000, and the ratio of observed deaths to expected deaths was 0.91. Negative excess mortality was observed except for women in the 0-14 age group. In the socioeconomic dimension, the male Medicaid beneficiary group showed positive excess mortality, while the non-disabled and disabled groups showed similar negative values. When the standardized mortality ratio was calculated for the top 10 causes of death, deaths from Alzheimer's disease and septicemia increased, whereas those from diabetes mellitus and cerebrovascular disease decreased. The decrease in mortality was primarily concentrated in older adults, and the mortality of young women increased due to increased intentional self-harm. This study adds essential evidence to the overall performance of South Korea. Inequalities according to various socioeconomic variables indicate that the results of strict measures to control COVID-19 are not distributed equitably. Efforts should be made to properly evaluate the current and future problems related to the pandemic.","Kim, Kim, Park, Kim","https://doi.org/10.4178/epih.e2022081","20221013","COVID-19; Equity; Excess mortality; Life expectancy; Republic of Korea","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-14","",39209,""
"Trends in eating disorder risk among US college students, 2013-2021","Despite concerns about rising rates of mental health problems among college students in recent years, little is known about trends in eating disorder (ED). This study examined data from the 2013-2020/2021 Healthy Minds Study (HMS), a large study of US college students (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 267,599). Students completed the SCOFF scale, a validated measure of ED symptoms. From 2013 to 2020/2021 the prevalence of ED risk increased significantly from 15% to 28% (13% increase, 95% CI, 12.2-13.9) with young, female, and Hispanic students experiencing the largest increases. ED risk increased significantly by 3 percentage points (95% CI, 1.7-4.2) during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Daly, Costigan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114882","20221013","COVID-19; College students; Eating disorder; Mental health; Pandemic; Prevalence trends; Sociodemographic characteristics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-14","",39210,""
"Students` Emotional Well-being and Academic Functioning Before, During, and After Lockdown in Germany: A Cohort Study","The COVID-19 lockdowns have led to social detriments and altered learning environments among university students. Recent research indicates that such ramifications may engender various impairments to students' mental health. Yet, such research has major limitations, such as the lack of a pre-pandemic control measure, the focus on singular well-being parameters, or the investigation of only the early phases of the pandemic. To address these research gaps, the present comprehensive and nationwide study compared three student cohorts (aged 17-48) in Germany: a pre-pandemic cohort (Jan-Feb 2020), a post-lockdown cohort (May-Jul 2020), and an intra-lockdown cohort (Jan-Feb 2021) regarding students' general emotional well-being and academic functioning. It was hypothesized that, due to rigorous lockdown-related restrictions, students in the intra-lockdown cohort would report diminished general emotional well-being compared to the other cohorts. Furthermore, due to ongoing remote learning since the beginning of the pandemic, it was expected that students' academic functioning would decrease across all three cohorts. The data collection was performed over three consecutive semesters (fall semester 2019/2020, spring semester 2020, and fall semester 2020/2021). Students were surveyed online on various aspects regarding their general emotional well-being (e.g., stress, general well-being) and academic functioning (e.g., concentration, study-related flow). Data analyses were performed using multivariate analyses of variance. A total of N = 787 students participated in this study. Results indicated higher general well-being in the post-lockdown cohort compared to the intra-lockdown cohort (P =.02). As for students' academic functioning, results revealed that students in the pre-pandemic cohort reported higher study-related flow (P = .007) and concentration (P = .001) compared to the intra-lockdown cohort. Also, students reported higher flow (P = .04) and concentration (P = .04) in the post-lockdown cohort compared to the intra-lockdown cohort. No cohort effects were revealed for other aspects of general emotional well-being (e.g., perceived stress) and academic functioning (e.g., procrastination).

"Psychotherapeutic and psychiatric intervention in COVID-19 patients and their relatives: the DigiCOVID trial protocol","The COVID-19 pandemic is negatively impacting the mental health of both COVID-19 patients and the general population. As current guidelines are limiting in-person contacts to reduce the spread of the virus, the development of a digital approach to implement in psychiatric and psychological consultation is needed. In this paper we present the DigiCOVID protocol, a digital approach to offer remote, personalized psychological and psychiatric support to former or current COVID-19 patients and/or their relatives. The main goal of this project is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and usability of the DigiCOVID protocol. Furthermore, we also aim to assess the impact of the abovementioned protocol by means of pre-post changes in psychological clinical variables. Participants undergo an initial telephonic screening to ensure inclusion criteria are met. Secondly, participants complete a video-assisted neuropsychological IQ test, and complete online self-reports of health and general wellbeing. Participants are then assigned to a psychotherapist who offers 8 tele-therapy sessions. At the end of the therapy cycle, the online questionnaires are administered for a post-treatment evaluation. As of April 2022, we enrolled a total of 122 subjects, of which 94 have completed neuropsychological tests and online questionnaires. Our study aims at testing the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of DigiCOVID, a remote tele-medicine protocol for the improvement of psychological and psychiatric health in COVID-19 patients and their relatives. To date, the approach used seems to be feasible and highly customizable to patients' needs, and thus the DigiCOVID protocol might pave the way for future tele-psychiatry-based interventions. This study was approved by our local Ethics Committee (IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico) on 28.10.2020. The trial is registered on clinicaltrials.gov with the following ID: NCT05231018.

"Mental wellbeing among Danish employees during the COVID-19 pandemic: results from a longitudinal study on the role of industry and working environment","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on working life. Previous studies have primarily focused on the mental health and wellbeing of healthcare workers and are mostly based on cross-sectional data from non-representative samples. The aim of this study was to investigate mental wellbeing trajectories among employees from different industries, and to longitudinally identify factors that affect mental wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic, including job insecurity, fear of COVID-19, working from home or being discharged with wage compensation and management quality. Baseline data were obtained from the Danish Health and Wellbeing Survey in 2019 (September-December), with follow-up in September-November 2020. We included 1995 respondents, who completed the questionnaire in both waves and were employed in 2020 and measured mental wellbeing using the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale. Mental wellbeing declined among employees in all industries. Employees working from home and employees unsatisfied with management experienced a greater decline in mental wellbeing. We found no differences in mental wellbeing trajectories in relation to fear of infecting others or contracting COVID-19, job insecurity and being discharged with wage compensation. Mental wellbeing declined among employees in all industries with no difference between industries. Employees working from home may have been particularly vulnerable, and the analyses show that managers play a key role in mitigating the negative consequences of the pandemic by ensuring adequate information and involvement of employees.","Nielsen, Ekholm, MÃƒÂ¸ller, ErsbÃƒÂ¸ll, Santini, GrÃƒÂ¸nbÃƒÂ¦k, Thygesen","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckac150","20221013","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-14","",39213,""
"Caregiving in a Pandemic: Health-Related Socioeconomic Vulnerabilities Among Women Caregivers Early in the COVID-19 Pandemic","Family and friends who provide regular care for a sick or dependent individual (""caregivers"") are at increased risk of health-related socioeconomic vulnerabilities (HRSVs). This study examined pre-pandemic prevalence of and early pandemic changes in HRSVs among women caregivers compared with non-caregivers. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in April 2020 (early pandemic) with 3,200 English-speaking US women aged 18 years or older, 30% of whom identified as caregivers. We modeled adjusted odds of self-reported HRSVs (financial strain, food/housing insecurity, interpersonal violence, transportation/utilities difficulties) before and changes during the early pandemic by caregiving status. Models were adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, income, number of people in household, number of children in household, physical and mental health, and number of comorbidities. Pre-pandemic, 63% of caregivers and 47% of non-caregivers reported 1 or more vulnerability (<i>P</i> &lt;.01); food insecurity was most prevalent (48% of caregivers vs 33% of non-caregivers, <i>P</i> &lt;.01). In the early pandemic, caregivers had higher odds than non-caregivers of financial strain, both incident (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.1; 95% CI, 1.6-2.7) and worsening (AOR = 2.0; 95% CI, 1.4-2.8); incident interpersonal violence (AOR = 2.0; 95% CI, 1.5-2.7); incident food insecurity (AOR = 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.1); incident transportation difficulties (AOR = 1.9; 95% CI, 1.3-2.6); and incident housing insecurity (AOR = 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.3). The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic increased risk of incident and worsening HRSVs for caregivers more than for non-caregivers.

"Forgone Health Care for Non-COVID-19-Related Needs Among Medicare Beneficiaries During the COVID-19 Pandemic, Summer 2020-Winter 2021","Forgone health care, defined as not using health care despite perceiving a need for it, is associated with poor health outcomes, especially among people with chronic conditions. The objective of our study was to examine how the pandemic affected forgone health care during 3 stages of the pandemic. We used the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey COVID-19 Rapid Response Questionnaire administered in summer 2020, fall 2020, and winter 2021 to examine sociodemographic characteristics, chronic diseases, COVID-19 vaccination status, and telehealth availability in relation to beneficiary reports of forgone health care. Of the 3 periods studied, the overall rate of forgone health care was highest in summer 2020 (20.8%), followed by fall 2020 (7.8%) and winter 2021 (6.5%). COVID-19 vaccination status, age, sex, race and ethnicity, US region, availability of primary care telehealth appointments, and chronic conditions (heart disease, arthritis, depression, osteoporosis or a broken hip, and diabetes or high blood glucose) were significantly related to forgone care. High rates of forgone care among Medicare participants varied over time and were significantly related to beneficiary characteristics.

"Impact of COVID-19 on Adolescents' Smartphone Addiction in South Korea","The outbreak of COVID-19 impacted numerous people globally, but most notably affected adolescents negatively by contributing to the increase in their use of media and smartphones and therefore their susceptibility to smartphone addiction. Based on the social-ecological model, this study seeks to identify the individual-, family-, and school-level factors of smartphone addiction through two groups of users: a first group whose smartphone usage time increased after the outbreak of COVID-19, and a second group whose usage time did not. Based on the data collected from 360 Korean adolescents aged 15 to 18, results reveal that personal-level factors (i.e., gender, depressive symptoms, self-control, and cyberbullying victimization) are associated with smartphone addiction. For the group whose smartphone usage time increased after the outbreak, economic status, academic performance, and academic year were related to smartphone addiction. Based on these findings, the study makes specific guidelines and suggestions on addressing the smartphone addiction among Korean adolescents.","Chun, Lee, Jeon, Kim, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1080/19371918.2022.2134252","20221013","COVID-19; South Korea; adolescents; pandemic; smartphone addiction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-14","",39216,""
"Adverse Childhood Experiences During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Associations with Poor Mental Health and Suicidal Behaviors Among High School Students - Adolescent Behaviors and Experiences Survey, United States, January-June 2021","Social and educational disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic have exacerbated concerns about adolescents' mental health and suicidal behavior. Data from the 2021 Adolescent Behaviors and Experiences Survey (ABES) indicate that 37.1% of U.S. high school students reported poor mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, with 19.9% considering and 9.0% attempting suicide in the preceding year (1). Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs)* are associated with poor mental health and suicidal behaviors (2,3), and high prevalence of some ACEs have been documented during the pandemic (4). ACEs are preventable, potentially traumatic events that occur in childhood (ages 0-17 years) such as neglect, experiencing or witnessing violence, or having a family member attempt or die by suicide. Also included are aspects of a child's environment that can undermine their sense of safety, stability, and bonding. Associations between ACEs occurring during the pandemic and mental health or suicidal behaviors among U.S. high school students were examined using ABES data. Experience of one to two ACEs was associated with poorer mental health and increased suicidal behaviors, and these deleterious outcomes increased with additional ACE exposure. After adjusting for demographic characteristics, adolescents who reported four or more ACEs during the pandemic had a prevalence of poor current mental health four times as high as, and a prevalence of past-year suicide attempts 25 times as high as, those without ACEs during the pandemic. Experience of specific ACE types (e.g., emotional abuse) was associated with higher prevalences of poor mental health and suicidal behaviors. Prevention and intervention strategies (5), including early identification and trauma-informed mental health service and support provision, for ACEs and their acute and long-term impacts could help address the U.S. child and adolescent mental health and suicide crisis.<sup>Ã¢â‚¬Â </sup>.","Anderson, Swedo, Trinh, Ray, Krause, Verlenden, Clayton, Villaveces, Massetti, Holditch Niolon","https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7141a2","20221013","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-14","",39217,""

Responses were analyzed with a grounded theory approach to identify overarching themes. Participants described persistent complications, both physical and mental, that have affected their recovery from COVID-19. Five overarching themes of post-acute patient experiences were generated: (1) an increased awareness of a mind and body connection, (2) feelings of premature aging, (3) an overall decline in quality of life, (4) a continued fear of infection, and (5) methods of coping. Patients described lasting changes to their mental health and overall quality of life in connection to physical complications after severe COVID-19 infection. Patients' reports of their experience call for a greater awareness of the psychological aspects of COVID-19 recovery to provide both physical and psychological rehabilitation services.

"Investigating the implications of changes in supervisor and organizational support","Workers tend to experience many benefits when they work for supportive supervisors and organizations. But what happens when workers experience changes in perceived support, more or less support than they typically experience? We studied family-supportive supervision (FSS) and perceived organizational support (POS) to test how changes in the perception of support in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may influence workers. Three waves of survey data from 368 workers in the United States and Canada were collected as the human and economic toll of COVID-19 manifested. Random-intercepts cross-lagged panel analyses were used to differentiate between stable associations and the within-person changes of interest. Stable associations among variables were consistent with prior research, but cross-lagged effects painted a complex picture that offered reasons for hope and concern. As hypothesized, we observed evidence for gain cycles such that there were reciprocal positive associations between FSS and POS, and higher-than-normal POS was associated with greater job satisfaction. However, remaining hypotheses were not supported, as changes in FSS and POS were not significantly associated with job insecurity, and heightened FSS was associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression. Our study reinforces prior findings by showing that employees generally benefit when working for supportive supervisors and organizations, while also suggesting that episodic changes in FSS and POS may have limited impacts on workers.

"Smart healthcare: A prospective future medical approach for COVID-19","COVID-19 has greatly affected human life for over 3 years. In this review, we focus on smart healthcare solutions that address major requirements for coping with the COVID-19 pandemic, including (1) the continuous monitoring of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), (2) patient stratification with distinct short-term outcomes (e.g. mild or severe diseases) and long-term outcomes (e.g. long COVID), and (3) adherence to medication and treatments for patients with COVID-19. Smart healthcare often utilizes medical artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing and integrates cutting-edge biological and optoelectronic techniques. These are valuable technologies for addressing the unmet needs in the management of COVID. By leveraging deep/machine learning (DL/ML) capabilities and big data, medical AI can perform precise prognosis predictions and provide reliable suggestions for physicians' decision-making. Through the assistance of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), which encompasses wearable devices, smartphone apps, Internet-based drug delivery systems, and telemedicine technologies, the status of mild cases can be continuously monitored and medications provided at home without the need for hospital care. In cases that develop into severe cases, emergency feedback can be provided through the hospital for rapid treatment. Smart healthcare can possibly prevent the development of severe COVID-19 cases and therefore lower the burden on intensive care units.","Yang, Chang, Hung, Wang, Cheng, Chiang, Chen, Liao, Lai, Liang","https://doi.org/10.1097/JCMA.0000000000000824","20221013","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-14","",39221,""
"Mental well-being of healthcare workers in 2 hospital districts during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Finland: a cross-sectional study","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unseen pressure on healthcare systems in many countries, jeopardizing the mental well-being of healthcare workers. The authors aimed to assess the mental well-being of Finnish healthcare workers from 2 hospital districts (Helsinki University Hospital [HUS] and Social and Health Services in Kymenlaakso [Kymsote]) with differing COVID-19 incidence rates during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020. A total number of 996 healthcare workers (HUS N = 862, Kymsote N = 134) participated in this prospectively conducted survey study during summer 2020. Symptom criteria of self-reported mental health symptoms followed ICD-10 classification, excluding duration criteria. Participants were divided into symptom categories ""often/sometimes"", and ""rarely/never"". These groups were compared to sociodemographic factors and factors related to work, workload, and well-being. The degree of mental health symptoms did not differ between the 2 healthcare districts despite differing COVID-19 incidences (p = 1). The authors observed a significant relationship between self-reported diagnostic mental health symptoms and experiences of insufficient instructions for protection against COVID-19 (in HUS cohort p &lt; 0.001), insufficient recovery from work (p &lt; 0.001), and subjective increased workload (p &lt; 0.001). The authors' results show the importance of well-planned and sufficient instructions for protection from SARS-CoV-2 for healthcare workers, indicating their need to feel safe and protected at work. The workload of healthcare workers should be carefully monitored to keep it moderate and ensure sufficient recovery. Sufficient control of the epidemic to keep the burden of the healthcare system low is vital for healthcare workers' well-being.","Rantanen, Lieslehto, Oksanen, Oksanen, Anttila, Lehtonen, Geneid, Sanmark","https://doi.org/10.13075/ijomeh.1896.01940","20221013","COVID-19; health personnel; major depressive disorder; mental health; post-traumatic stress disorder; workload","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-14","",39222,""
"Self-compassion training in palliative care during COVID-19: A pilot study","This pilot project replicated a self-compassion program to support health-care professionals in palliative care settings. We anticipated that undertaking this program would enhance participants' psychological well-being. Participants were recruited by convenience sampling from palliative care services in an area of Melbourne, Australia. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the program was offered online and comprised six once-weekly gatherings. Three survey rounds with identical questions were conducted prior to, immediately after, and 3 months after the training. The surveys consisted of 6 scales: the Self-Compassion Scale, the Santa Clara Brief Compassion Scale, the Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, the Professional Quality of Life Scale, and the Interpersonal Reactivity Index Scale. Paired-sample t-test and repeated measures analysis of variance analyses were used to compare participant responses. Nine participants working in palliative care completed the training and 3 surveys and included qualitative responses. The experience was overwhelmingly positive.

The emotional state improved by compassion satisfaction, showing a positive improvement 3 months post-training, along with there being no changes in compassion satisfaction, burnout, and dispositional empathy. Participants all worked in a supportive environment, which encouraged self-care. Even against the pandemic difficulties, a short online program was effective, assisting participants to cultivate their inner resources in mindfulness and self-compassion.

"Suicide Risk Among Military Veterans in the Southwestern United States Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Military Veterans have an increased risk of suicide compared to the general population, but less is known about changes in risk with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, or whether any changes have been moderated by psychiatric or demographic factors. The primary objective was to test the hypothesis that the likelihood of suicide attempt or death by suicide was stable during the first year of the pandemic versus the preceding year for the full sample. A second objective was to test the hypothesis that, in contrast, risk increased for Veteran subgroups characterized by traditional risk factors (e.g., psychiatric diagnosis). We extracted electronic health record data for 771,570 Veterans who received one or more health care visits between March 13, 2019, and March 12, 2021, at eight VA hospitals across the southwestern United States. Primary outcome measures were suicide attempts and deaths by suicide. Predictor variables included psychiatric diagnoses and demographic factors. Multivariable models indicated that the odds of death by suicide did not change during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, while the odds of making a suicide attempt declined. Veterans treated for major depression were at heightened risk for attempting suicide in both years, but the association was smaller during the pandemic than the year prior. In contrast, the relative risk of attempt for Veterans who were never married and Veterans treated for a non-alcohol, non-opioid substance-use disorder increased during the pandemic. The findings suggest that the pandemic has not led to an increase in suicidal behavior, which is consistent with other studies, although the degree of decline varied across diagnostic and demographic groups. Further longitudinal research is needed to evaluate whether the prolonged nature of COVID-19 may lead to changes in risk over time.","Doran, Gress-Smith, Raja, Waddell, Davis, De La Rosa, Hurwitz, Kratz, Louis, Moore, Peoples","https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usac303","20221013","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-14","",39224,""

"Effect of physical activity and sedentary sitting time on psychological quality of life of people with and without disabilities; A survey from Saudi Arabia","Mental and psychological health issues are on the rise globally. People with disabilities are at greater risk of poor psychological quality of life especially after covid-19 pandemic. Along with other factors physical activity (PA) may have a significant effect on mental health. This study aims to analyze the difference of PA participation and sitting time among people with and without disabilities and their association with psychological quality of life. A standard questionnaire was used to collect the data from disabled and non-disabled participants above 15 years of age. Bivariate and multivariate analysis was performed to yield statistical results. Total study sample consisted of 359 participants (67.7% without disability and 32.3% with disability). Participants without disabilities reported a significantly better psychological quality of life (QOL) (Mean score = 68) as compared to the ones with disabilities (Mean score = 61), (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). There was significant difference between the sitting time of two groups with longer sitting time among people with disabilities (6.1 h/day) as compared to non-disabled (5.3 h). Optimum level of PA was strongly associated with better psychological quality of life among individuals without disabilities (<i>p</i> = 0.00). Younger age (<i>p</i> = 0.00) and being single (<i>p</i> = 0.01) were significant predictors of poor psychological health among non-disables. Increase in sedentary sitting time was significantly associated with poor psychological quality of life among both groups. Tailored health policies to encourage PA and reduce sitting hours should be formulated to improve psychological health with special focus on individuals with disabilities. Future studies with large sample size are recommended to validate the current results and further explore the difference in association of PA and psychological wellbeing in people with and without disabilities.","Zahra, Hassan, Hassan, Parveen, Park, Iqbal, Khatoon, Atteya","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.998890","20221013","Saudi Arabia; disability; physical activity; psychological quality of life; sedentary sitting","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-14","",39226,""
"Naturalistic randomized controlled trial demonstrating effectiveness of Text4Hope in supporting male population mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","Mental illness is not uncommon among males. It is estimated that males are more likely to die by suicide, become dependent on alcohol, report frequent drug use, and be dissatisfied with their life, compared to women. In this study, we assessed the potential to offer support to this population using Text4Hope, a texting mental health service. The study was a naturalistic randomized controlled trial comparing two populations of Text4Hope male subscribers; an intervention group (IG, Text4Hope subscribers who received once-daily supportive text messages for 6 weeks) and a control group (CG, Text4Hope subscribers who joined the program in the same time frame but were yet to receive text messages). Inferential statistics were used to compare the severity and the prevalence of the likely stress, anxiety, and depression, between the two groups, using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and defined the Composite Mental Health (CMH) score as the sum of these three. <i>T</i>-test, Chi-squared association, and binary logistic regression analyses were applied. There were 286 male subscribers to Text4Hope. The majority were above 40 years, white, employed, had postsecondary education, were in a relationship, and owned a home. Mean scores of PSS-10, GAD-7, and PHQ-9 scales and the CMH were significantly higher for the CG compared to the IG, 11.4, 28.8, 25.8, and 18.7%, respectively. Similarly, a statistically significantly lower prevalence in IG, compared to the CG, on likely MDD (58.15 vs. 37.4%) and likely GAD (50 vs. 30.8%), with a small effect size. The IG was a significant predictor for lower odds of both likely MDD and likely GAD while controlling for sociodemographic characteristics. The Text4Hope service is an effective tool for mental health support for male subscribers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to the males who didn't receive the service, those who received it were in better mental health conditions. Further effort is still needed to encourage males to participate in such online services that can help them receive adequate support, particularly during crisis times.","Shalaby, Agyapong, Vuong, Hrabok, Gusnowski, Surood, Greenshaw, Agyapong","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.1002288","20221013","COVID-19; Text4Hope; males; mental health; naturalistic randomized controlled trial; texting services","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-14","",39227,""
"Comparison of Stimulant-Related Presentations to Victorian Emergency Departments Pre-pandemic and During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Introduction Victoria, Australia, holds the unenviable record for the longest number of lockdown days in the world (262 days) and some of the most rigid restrictions. The purpose of this study was to determine whether changes in harmful drug use occurred during the pandemic by comparing stimulant-related presentations to Victorian emergency departments before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A retrospective analysis of data from the Victorian Injury Surveillance Unit was undertaken for two time periods, March 2019 to September 2019 and March 2020 to September 2020. Results The proportion of people presenting to an ED who used methylamphetamine/methamphetamine/amphetamine significantly increased from 2019 to 2020. Conversely, there was a significant reduction in ED presentations among people who used 3,4-methylenedioxyÃ¢â‚¬â€¹methamphetamine (MDMA) and ecstasy during the study period. Conclusions COVID-19-related restrictions can affect mental health due to depression, or anxiety, particularly if people also experience loss of employment and income. In addition, mental health issues may affect substance use, including increased frequency of use and dose. This has implications for policy and planning during a pandemic and may be overlooked as the focus is on planning and resources for patients with COVID-19.","Redona, Woods, Jackson, Hayman, Usher","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.28813","20221013","amphetamine; cocaine; emergency departments; methamphetamine; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-14","",39228,""
"A Mental Health Survey of Medical Professionals Working During the COVID-19 Pandemic at Shaukat Khanum Cancer Hospital, Lahore","Introduction The last months of 2019 saw the emergence of a novel coronavirus, SARS-COV-2, capable of causing widespread disease in humans. The rapid spread of this new disease culminated in one of the biggest pandemics in known history. The far-reaching social, economical, and health effects of this pandemic are still unfolding on a global scale. Given the interconnectedness of social, environmental, and biological factors in manifesting psychiatric illnesses, it is fair to assume that the profoundÃ‚Â effects of this pandemic would likely increase the strain on mental healthcare systems.Ã‚ The objective of this study was to assess the mental health burden amongst healthcare workers at Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Center (SKMCH &amp; RC) at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify any differences in the mental health scores of anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance for professionals directly involved in the care of COVID-19 patients as compared to those who were not. Material and methods This was an observational cross-sectional clinical study that used self-reported questionnaires after approval from the hospital's ethical board. The sample size was calculated based on a study published previously by HuangÃ‚Â using a 23.04% incidence of anxiety in medical staff. Depression was quantified using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score (PHQ-9), anxiety by the Beck Anxiety Inventory, and sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index checklist (PSQI). A total of 221 healthcare workers who completed the questionnaires were included in the study and the results were analyzed using SPSS Statistics v. 23 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Levene's test was used to assess the equality of variances, and an independent sample t-test and chi-square test were applied for the comparison of means. A one-way ANOVA test was used to compare means across more than two groups. Results Of the 221 healthcare workers recruited in the study, 57% were males, and 43% were females. Among the sample, 43% of participants were doctors, 27.1%Ã‚Â were nurses, and others were technicians and medical assistants. It was observed that 50% of males and 36% of female healthcare workers experienced moderate to severe depression at the onset of the pandemic. Furthermore, 35% of males and 25% of females suffered from moderate to severe anxiety, and more than 80% of our study population reported poor quality of sleep. Conclusion The present study reported a high prevalence of anxiety levels, depressive symptoms, and poor sleep quality among the healthcare professionals working in SKMCH &amp; RC Lahore during the COVID-19 pandemic irrespective of direct contact with COVID-19 patients in a healthcare setting.","Chatha, Khan, Nazir Ahmed, Khan, Abu Bakar, Asif","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.28869","20221013","covid-19 outbreak; depressionÃ‚Â ; healthcare provider; mood and anxiety; sleep problems","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-14","",39229,""
"Surgery Training and Simulation Using Virtual and Augmented Reality for Knee Arthroplasty","A range of extended reality technology integration, including immersive virtual reality (IVR), augmented reality (AR), as well as mixed reality, has lately acquired favour in orthopaedics. The utilization of extended reality machinery in knee arthroplasty is examined in this review study. Virtual reality (VR)Ã‚Â and ARÃ‚Â are usually exercised together in orthopaedic surgical training as alluring training outside of the operation theatre is acknowledged as a good surgical training tool.Ã‚Â The use of this technology, its consequences for orthopaedic surgeons and their patients, and its moral and practical issues are also covered. Head-mounted displays (HMDs) are a potential addition directed toward improving surgical precision along with instruction. Although the hardware is cutting-edge, substantial effort needs to be done to develop software that enables seamless, trustworthy integration into clinical practice and training. Remote virtual rehabilitation has drawn increasing attention in recent years, and its significance has increased in light of the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic. Numerous medical sectors have shown the benefits of telerehabilitation, gamification, VR, and AR. Given the rising demand for orthopaedic therapy and its rising costs, this is a requirement. A remote surgeon can impart knowledge without being present, by virtually placing his or her hands in the visual fieldÃ‚Â of a local surgeon using AR technology. With the use of this innovation, orthopaedic surgery seems to have been able to participate in the telemedicine revolution. This technology may also have an impact on how surgeons collaborate and train for orthopaedic residencies in the future. Volatility in the HMDÃ‚Â market will probably stall improvements in surgical education.","Mandal, Ambade","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.28823","20221013","augmented reality; knee arthroplasty; rehabilitation; simulation; surgical training","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-14","",39230,""
"Pre-pandemic socio-economic status and changes in employment during the first lockdown (2020) on the health of middle-aged people in England: a longitudinal study","The COVID-19 pandemic markedly disrupted people's lives. It caused higher mortality and morbidity amongst individuals from poorer socio-economic position (SEP). It is well-recognised that job loss has a negative impact on health. We hypothesised that health effects of the pandemic on middle-aged people might be different depending on SEP and changes in employment. Data are from the Health and Employment After Fifty (HEAF), a cohort recruited 2013-2014 when aged 50-64 through 24 English general practices. At baseline and annually since, participants completed a questionnaire reporting about demographics, employment, health, lifestyle, and finances. In 2021 we sent an e-survey to all contactable HEAF participants, asking about effects of the first lockdown (March-July 2020). Outcomes were participants' perception of worsening of mental, physical health, and self-rated health (SRH) since lockdown. Associations between SEP, COVID-19 related employment changes and health were explored with Poisson regression with robust standard error, with adjustment for age, sex, and pre-pandemic SRH. In total, 2,469 (53%) returned a usable questionnaire, amongst whom 2,344 provided complete information for these analyses (44% men, mean age 65.7 years). Worsening of mental, physical or SRH since lockdown was reported by 21%, 27% and 17% respectively. Mutually adjusted models showed that reporting struggling financially pre-pandemic (versus living comfortably) was associated with an increased risk of deterioration in: mental (RRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.0, 95%CI 1.7-2.5), physical health (RRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.0, 95%CI 1.6-2.3), and SRH (RRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.6, 95%CI 1.2-2.1). Participants working from home during lockdown and those who lost their job (as opposed to those with unchanged employment) were at increased risk of reporting deterioration in mental health and SRH. In a cohort of older workers, working from home, job loss and poorer pre-pandemic SEP were all associated with worsening of mental health and SRH since lockdown.","D'Angelo, Ntani, Bloom, Walker-Bone","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-14248-9","20221012","COVID-19; employment changes; mental health; older workers; physical health; self-rated health; socio-economic status","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-14","",39231,""
"How acceptable do parents experiencing mental health challenges find e-Health interventions for mental health in the postnatal period: a systematic review","Poor mental health in the postnatal period is experienced by high numbers of parents, with a high associated cost to society, however accessing therapeutic support during this time is complicated by parenting commitments. This has been further compounded by the covid-19 pandemic, where access to traditional therapy has been impacted. A lack of access to support for poor mental health in this period can have long term impacts on both the parents and their child. E-Health provides a potential solution to parents accessing support during this period by providing a convenient and flexible intervention which overcomes the barriers of traditional face-to-face therapy. However, without investigating the acceptability of such support for parents, it is not possible to predict uptake and consequent effectiveness. The current review synthesizes data available on acceptability of e-Health interventions in the post-natal period, finding that parents valued e-Health interventions however considerations must be made to certain, key areas impacting the acceptability of these interventions for parents. An element of therapist support and individualised content was preferred, along with a smooth user experience. Parents valued that e-Health fit into their routines and provided anonymity in their interactions. Further research needs to be completed into acceptability for minority social and ethnic groups where access and preference may differ.","Attard, Iles, Satherley","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-022-05070-7","20221012","e-Health; postnatal mental health; remote interventions; review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-14","",39232,""
"An Unconditional Cash Transfer Program for Low-Income New Yorkers Affected by COVID-19","Early in the pandemic, New York City's public hospital system partnered with multiple philanthropic foundations to offer an unconditional cash transfer program for low-income New Yorkers affected by COVID-19. The $1000 cash transfers were designed to help people meet their most immediate health and social needs and were incorporated into healthcare delivery and contact tracing workflows as a response to the public health emergency. To better understand program recipients' experiences, researchers conducted 150 telephone surveys with randomly sampled cash transfer recipients and 20 in-depth qualitative interviews with purposefully sampled survey participants. Survey participants were predominantly Latinx (87%) and women (65%). The most common reported uses of the $1000 were food and rent. Most participants (79%) reported that without the $1000 cash transfer they would have had difficulty paying for basic expenses or making ends meet, with specific positive effects reported related to food, housing, and ability to work. The majority of survey participants reported that receiving the cash assistance somewhat or greatly improved their physical health (83%) and mental health (89%). Qualitative interview results generally supported the survey findings.","Kumar, Calvo-Friedman, Freeman, Fazio, Johnson, Seiferth, Clapp, Davis, Schretzman, Springer, Arcilla, Kaplan, Berry, Doran","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11524-022-00693-9","20221012","COVID-19; Cash assistance; Cash transfer; Food insecurity; Housing insecurity; Public hospital systems; Social determinants of health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-14","",39233,""
"Self-reported health-related quality of life of the general population in Alberta, Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted various aspects of people's life and wellbeing around the world. This study aimed to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health-related quality of life (HRQL), measured by the EQ-5D-5L, amongst the general population in the province of Alberta, Canada, and explore whether the impact varied across population subgroups based on age, gender, and dwelling. Data came from two waves of a repeated cross-sectional population-based survey, the COVID-19 Experiences and Impact Survey, administered by the Health Quality Council of Alberta. The first data collection (survey 1: nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°8790) was during May/June 2020 and the second (survey 2: nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°9263) during Oct 2020. We examined the comparability of weighted survey data and their representativeness to Alberta's general population. We then explored between-survey differences in EQ-5D-5L index, EQ-VAS and dimension responses, and differences across subgroups within each survey. We compared HRQL of the pooled sample (survey 1&amp;2) with the Alberta population norms data from the pre-pandemic period. Mean EQ-5D-5L index and EQ-VAS scores were 0.81 (0.15) and 72.54 (18.57), and 0.82 (0.14) and 71.98 (18.96) in surveys 1 and 2, respectively. The anxiety/depression dimension had the most reported problems (survey 1: 69.5%, survey 2: 70.2%). Respondents aged 16-24 or 75 and older, who identified themselves as a woman, or residing in urban areas had significantly lower EQ-5D-5L index scores compared to their counterparts in both surveys. Between-survey differences were not substantially different. Comparing the pooled sample with the pre-pandemic Alberta population norms, EQ-5D-5L index scores (0.82 vs. 0.84) and EQ-VAS scores (72.26 vs. 77.40) were significantly lower,Ã‚Â and respondents aged 16-44, women, or urban residents were more impacted. More problems were reported in the anxiety/depression (69.9% vs. 37.2%) and usual activities dimensions (40.5% vs. 26.0%) during the pandemic period, especially for respondents aged 16-44, women, and those residing in urban areas. Lower HRQL was reported during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to pre-pandemic HRQL in this population, with anxiety/depression and usual activities affected the most. People who were younger, women, and residing in urban areas were most impacted. The government responses to COVID-19 policies during population outbreaks should consider the needs of Albertans in these particular groups.","Wen, Al Sayah, Simon, Lahtinen, Johnson, Ohinmaa","https://doi.org/10.1186/s41687-022-00518-y","20221012","Alberta; COVID-19; EQ-5D-5L; General population; Health-related quality of life; Population norms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-14","",39234,""
