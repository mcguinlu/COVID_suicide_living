"Higher risk of mental health deterioration during the Covid-19 lockdown among students rather than non-students The French Confins study","Background: Covid-19 pandemic and its consequences have raised fears of its psychological impact. The objective of this study was to estimate the effect of student status on mental health conditions during Covid-19 general lockdown among adults in France. Methods: Using cross-sectional data of the Confins cohort, we estimated the effect of student status on depressive and anxiety symptoms, suicidal thoughts and perceived stress using multivariate logistic regression analyses. Stratified models for college students and non-students were performed to identify associated population-specific factors. Results: Among the 2260 included participants, students represented 59% (n=1335 vs 925 non-students) and 78% of the total sample were female. Student status was more frequently associated with depressive symptoms (adjusted OR(aOR)=1.58; 95%CI 1.17;2.14), anxiety symptoms (aOR=1.51; 95%CI 1.10;2.07), perceived stress (n=1919, aOR=1.70, 95%CI 1.26;2.29) and frequent suicidal thoughts (n=1919, aOR=1.57, 95%CI 0.97;2.53). Lockdown conditions that could be potentially aggravating on mental health like isolation had a higher impact on students than non-students. Limitations: Participants were volunteers, which could limit generalisation of the findings. The cross-sectional design did not allow determining if lockdown impacted directly mental health or if there is another cause. However, we adjusted analyses with the history of psychiatric disorders, and factors related to lockdown conditions were associated with mental health disturbances. Conclusions: College student's mental health is of great importance in the context of the general lockdown set up during the pandemic. Follow-up and interventions should be implemented especially for those at high-risk (younger people and those with history of psychiatric disorders).","Julie Arsandaux; Ilaria Montagni; Melissa Macalli; Nathalie Texier; Mathilde Pouriel; Raphael Germain; Adel Mebarki; Sherazade Kinouani; Marie Tournier; Stephane Schuck; Christophe Tzourio","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.04.20225706","20201105","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-05","",6745,""

"Tumor PatientsÂ´ Perceived Changes of Specific Attitudes, Perceptions, and Behaviors Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic and Its Relation to Reduced Wellbeing","Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Working Group â€œPrevention and Integrative Oncologyâ€ (PRIO) in the German Cancer Society has initiated flash interviews and surveys  One of these stated increasing rates of fears and mental stress of tumor patients  Now we aimed to analyze whether tumor patients did perceive changes in their attitudes and behaviors related to their relationships, awareness of nature and quietness, interest in spiritual issues, or feelings of worries and isolation  A further point of interest was how these perceived changes could be predicted, either by meaning in life, spirituality as a resource to cope, perceived fears and worries, or particularly by their wellbeing  Materials and Methods: Online survey with standardized questionnaires (i e , WHO-Five Well-being Index (WHO5), Meaning in Life Questionnaire (MLQ), Spiritual and Religious Attitudes to cope with illness (SpREUK-15), Gratitude/Awe scale (GrAw-7)) among 292 tumor patients (72% men;mean age 66 7 Â± 10 8 years;25%  70 years) from Germany between May 6 to June 10, 2020  Results: PatientsÂ´ wellbeing (WHO5) scores were in the lower range (14 7 Â± 6 0);35% scored &lt; 13, indicating depressive states  Wellbeing was significantly higher in older persons and lower in younger ones (F=11 1, p&lt; 0001)  Most were irritated by different statements about the danger and the course of the corona infection in the public media (60%), and 57% were worrying to be infected and to have a complicated course of disease  Because of the restrictions, patients noticed changes in their attitudes and behaviors (measured with the 12-item Perceptions of Change Scale): 1) Perception of nature and silence (CronbachÂ´s alpha = 82), 2) Worrying reflections and loneliness (CronbachÂ´s alpha = 80), 3) Interest in spirituality (CronbachÂ´s alpha = 91), 4) Intense relationships (CronbachÂ´s alpha = 64)  These perceptions of change were similar in women and men, age groups and also with respect to tumor stages  Regression analyses revealed that the factor Perception of nature and silence was predicted best by patientsÂ´ ability to value and experience the â€˜wonderâ€™ of the present moment (in terms of wondering awe and gratitude) and by patientsÂ´ search for meaning in life  The factor Worrying reflections and loneliness was predicted best by their search for meaning in life and by feelings of being under pressure because of the Corona pandemic  Interest in spirituality was predicted best by search for an access to a spiritual source and by frequency of praying  Intense relationships were explained with weak predictive power by patientsÂ´ ability to reflect life concerns  PatientsÂ´ wellbeing during the Corona pandemic was predicted (R2 = 57) by a mix of disease and pandemic related stressor, and by available resources (meaning in life and religious trust)  Conclusion: In this study among tumor patients from a secular society the topics meaning in life, having (religious) trust, stable relationships, mindful encounter with nature, and times of reflection were found to be of importance  To overcome tumor patientsÂ´ feelings of isolation, depressive states, and insecurity about future perspectives, further support is needed, particularly in their socio-spatial surrounding  These are the domains of psychotherapy and spiritual care  The planned integration of structured access to spiritual care seems to be important, not only for the field of cancer care  As the findings refer to patientsÂ´ self-perceptions, longitudinal studies are required to substantiate these perceived changes","BÃ¼ssing, A.; HÃ¼bner, J.; Walter, S.; GieÃŸler, W.; BÃ¼ntzel, J.","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.574314","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Frontiers in Psychiatry;11, 2020.; Publication details: Frontiers in Psychiatry;11, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-05","",6756,""

"The psychiatric and neuropsychiatric repercussions associated with severe infections of COVID-19 and other coronaviruses","Introduction It is known that viral infections are epidemiologically prevalent and some of them are harmful to the central nervous system (CNS) due to the development of neuropsychiatric syndromes which affect the cognitive, affective, behavioral and perceptual domains  Objective To carry out a comprehensive analysis of the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric repercussions of COVID-19 based on epidemiological, pathophysiological and clinical foundations observed in previous and recent pandemic events, and also to make a proposition about effective therapeutic interventions to help tackle this serious public health problem, more specifically in its neuropsychiatric developments  Method This current literature review has utilized literature reserves and scientific search engines MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science  The search terms included, â€œSARS-CoV-2â€, â€œetiology,â€ â€œpsychiatric and neuropsychiatric repercussionsâ€, â€œsevere infectionsâ€ â€œCOVID-19â€  Specific choices of unique papers from each of the searches were identified  The inclusion criteria were relevance and availability of full-text  Papers were excluded on the basis of relevance and non-availability of full-text  Papers were identified in the general literature reserve as pertinent to the search terms  Results The main psychiatric and neuropsychiatric repercussions analyzed were depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, psychosis, nonspecific neurological symptoms, delirium, cerebrovascular complications, encephalopathies, neuromuscular disorders, anosmia and ageusia  Conclusion The psychiatric and neuropsychiatric symptoms of acute respiratory syndromes can appear during or after the infectious stage  Among the risk factors pointed out for such effects are the female gender, health professionals, presence of avascular necrosis and distressing pain","de Sousa Moreira, Jorge Lucas, Barbosa, Sarah Maria Bacurau, Vieira, Jacyanne Gino, Chaves, Nicolly Castelo Branco, Felix, Esther Barbosa GonÃ§alves, Feitosa, Pedro Walisson Gomes, da Cruz, Italo Silva, da Silva, ClaÃºdio Gleidiston Lima, Neto, Modesto Leite Rolim","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110159","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry;: 110159, 2020.; Publication details: Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry;: 110159, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-05","",6778,""
"Equality of restraint: Reframing road safety through the ethics of private motorised transport","Background Motoring is an emancipation  It is both an individual freedom and a collective freedom with car ownership at 30, 491, 000 vehicles by 2019 in Great Britain  Yet, as the evidence of the impacts of road transport accumulates and the health and environmental aims of sustainable travel become clearer, demand for an ethical analysis also intensifies  Purpose The paper draws on a previous limited ethics-based literature on road transport  Key tenet of liberalism, of â€˜freedom fromâ€™ as well as â€˜freedom toâ€™, are highlighted  This includes Edmund Burke's concept of â€˜equality of restraintâ€™ in meeting common needs  Freedom from fear of road traffic danger forms part of an individual's rights  Findings Equality of rights and freedom from fear in road use have not been key considerations for reducing risks to vulnerable road users  Indeed, ethical issues have largely been ignored  The emergence of Vision Zero within the road safety field with its focus on zero deaths and serious injuries has brought an ethics-based approach to the mainstream although it appears to be struggling to gain traction in neo-liberal societies  Conclusions The Covid-19 pandemic has led to UK governments promoting the use of walking and cycling  These modes have hitherto been left to fend for themselves in an environment where road safety has been measured by casualty reduction while fear has suppressed walking and cycling with the consequence losses to physical and mental health  We ask whether an ethics-based contribution, and lessons from Covid-19, can help re-set the direction of UK road safety policy and practice","Davis, Adrian L.; Obree, David","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jth.2020.100970","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of Transport & Health;19:100970, 2020.; Publication details: Journal of Transport & Health;19:100970, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-05","",6779,""

The COVID-19 pandemic has already imposed a heavy human costâ€”taken together, this public health crisis and its attendant economic downturn appear poised to dwarf the scope, scale, and disruptiveness of most modern pandemics  What evidence we do have about other modern pandemics is largely limited to short-run impacts  Consequently, recent experience can do little to help us anticipate and respond to COVID-19â€™s potential long-run impact on individuals over decades and even generations  History, however, offers a solution  Historical crises offer closer analogues to COVID-19 in each of its key dimensionsâ€”as a global pandemic, as a global recessionâ€”and offer the runway necessary to study the life-course and intergenerational outcomes  In this paper, we review the evidence on the long-run effects on health, labor, and human capital of both historical pandemics (with a focus on the 1918 Influenza Pandemic) and historical recessions (with a focus on the Great Depression)  We conclude by discussing how past crises can inform our approach to COVID-19â€”helping tell us what to look for, what to prepare for, and what data we ought to collect now","Arthi, Vellore, Parman, John","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eeh.2020.101381","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Explorations in Economic History;: 101381, 2020.; Publication details: Explorations in Economic History;: 101381, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-05","",6783,""

"417TF Climate Change and Human Health for the Practicing Clinician","Introduction: In 2016, the American College of Physicians (ACP) published a position paper that identified tackling climate change as an opportunity to dramatically improve human health  It states that physicians should support efforts to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change and engage the public, their colleagues, community, and lawmakers about the health risks posed by climate change  However, many medical students and physicians feel that they have minimal understanding of the linkages between climate change and human health  A 2013 survey found that 34-40% of each yearâ€™s graduating medical students between 2009-2013 believed that their instruction in environmental health was inadequate  This curriculum aims to address this educational gap by leading all graduating 4th year medical students in a planetary health module  Study Objectives: 1) Explain how shifts in climate, natural resources, technology, economy and demography may affect the provision of health care in the future;2) Apply critical appraisal and science communication skills to describe climate health risks;3) Apply systems thinking and multidisciplinary perspectives to develop strategies to promote health service sustainability;4) Advocate for planetary health values in physicians groups and national conversation  Methods: All 4th year medical students graduating from the University of Rochester take a month-long course called â€œSuccessful Interning â€ The planetary health module will be held as part of this course  Students will have prerequisite reading to complete before starting the course  There will be a 1-hour Power Point lecture outlining the basic principles behind climate change and the link to human health  Following this, the students will gather in small groups based on the region they will be in for their residency for a 2-hour workshop  Faculty mediators will facilitate discussion on how each region will be affected by climate change, assist students in outlining exposure pathways, and help students discover what their specialty should expect in terms of patient experience and health effects stemming from these changes  At the end of the workshop, each group will briefly present the following: How the region they are practicing, and their patients will be affected by climate change, and a strategy for climate adaptation/mitigation  Course evaluation will be conducted by pre- and post-course REDCap surveys determining self-perceived knowledge  At the end of their intern year, students will be emailed a follow-up survey asking how relevant they feel the course content is to their current practice  Due to changes in course scheduling related to COVID-19, this course could not be carried out as planned  A one-hour lecture on planetary health for the practicing clinician was substituted, with the intent to return to the original full-length format next spring  Conclusion: The goal of this curriculum is to provide future physicians with the background and skills to tackle climate change in order to improve human health and avoid dire environmental consequences  Participants will learn strategies for climate adaptation and mitigation specific to their region and future practice population","Lou, V.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annemergmed.2020.09.433","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Annals of Emergency Medicine;76(4):S159, 2020.; Publication details: Annals of Emergency Medicine;76(4):S159, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-05","",6788,""
"315 Emergency Medicine and Trauma Physician Awareness of Mental Health Resources during and after Natural and Human-Made Disasters","Study Objectives: The mental health of physicians is a key issue during the recovery phase of natural and human-made disasters (NHD)  During NHDs, physicians must work within devastated health care infrastructures  Profoundly limited and strained resources and surges in acute and chronic care patients lead to prolonged, intense exposure to death, injury, and destruction  Physicians face a triple threat during NHDs - they are exposed to the NHD, are responsible for providing emergent and ongoing care to their community and must cope with complex decisions of delivering care or moving to safe spaces to protect themselves and their families  In non-NHD settings, 54 4% of physicians suffer from burnout  This adversely impacts physician wellbeing, job performance and may result in decreased quality of patient care  NHDs have the potential to exacerbate this effect  While federal law mandates that health care facilities have emergency operation plans in place for disaster preparedness, the accessibility of mental health resources to physicians in these settings has not been characterized  The objective of this study was to examine emergency medicine (EM) and trauma physician knowledge of and access to mental health resources at their institutions during and after NHDs  Methods: Between February 4, 2020 and March 9, 2020, researchers conducted a national survey among EM and trauma physicians  The survey was developed based on an emergency preparedness questionnaire created by researchers at Harvard T H  Chan School of Public Health in 2015  Our survey was distributed electronically to the members of the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) and the American Association of the Surgery of Trauma (AAST)  The 17-question survey collected information on EM and Trauma surgeon awareness and access to emergency preparedness resources at their institutions  Results: Of those who participated in the survey (n = 230), 80% were white, 75% were male, 80% were greater than 10 years out of graduate training and 76% worked in a trauma center  85% of responders were aware of a written emergency response plan for their facility and 51% were aware of ACEP and AAST disaster preparedness guidelines  20% of responders knew if their institutional emergency response plan included policies that addressed physician mental health needs during and after an NHD  In addition, 31% were aware of the hospitalâ€™s mental health policies and resources outside the emergency response plan;only 25% knew how to access these resources during and after an NHD  Finally, 10% reported incorporation of these mental health resources during emergency preparedness practice drills at their institution  Conclusion: In a survey administered to physicians in the period immediately prior to the COVID-19 outbreak in the US, the majority of physicians reported knowledge of emergency preparedness policies;however, significant gaps remain in physician knowledge and access to mental health resources during and after an NHD  As the frequency and severity of NHDs rapidly increase on a global scale, it is critical for health systems to ensure accessible infrastructure and resources to support the mental wellbeing of health professionals  In addition, physicians should be extensively and repeatedly educated regarding the existence of these resources and how to access them during or after an NHD","Sood, N.; Hazelton, J.

"161 Cardiopulmonary Ultrasound in Risk Stratification of Patients With Influenza","Study Objectives: As the upcoming influenza season aligns with a forecasted second wave of COVID-19, diagnostics are needed to effectively and efficiently differentiate between the two  Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is already widely used in the evaluation of cardiopulmonary dysfunction in the emergency setting, but scant research has been performed into the diagnostic implications of POCUS in patients with suspected influenza  This study investigated the utility of cardiopulmonary ultrasound as a novel diagnostic tool for patients with influenza  Methods: A convenience sample of patients presenting to an urban academic ED with influenza-like symptoms who received polymerase chain reaction (PCR) influenza testing were enrolled  An ultrasonographer blinded to influenza results performed a POCUS using the CLIFF (Cardiac, Lungs, IVC, and Free fluid-t) protocol  POCUS scans were performed by emergency medicine attendings, ultrasound fellows, or advanced practice providers who received 1-hour training in the CLIFF protocol  Clinical data including demographics, relevant comorbidities, and influenza vaccine status as well as laboratory values, interventions, and disposition were retrospectively collected  POCUS findings of PCR positive flu cases were then compared to PCR flu negative cases  Descriptive analysis using Fisherâ€™s exact test was used to compare the two groupsâ€™ findings  A subgroup analysis adjusting for heart failure was then performed  Results: A total of 117 patients were enrolled, of which 41 9% (49/117) tested positive for the flu  Patients with flu negative had a higher rate of hospitalization (75 0%, 51/68;36 8% 25/117) and found to have more comorbidities including congestive heart failure (57 1%, 28/49;8 2% 4/49) (P=0 046;p=0 001)  A subgroup analysis adjusted for CHF showed no statistical difference in POCUS findings of pulmonary b-lines (65 7%, 23/35;42 5%, 17/40;p=0 075), a-lines (85 7%, 30/35;82 5%, 33/40;p=0 95), consolidations (28 6%, 10/35;15%, 6/40;p=0 251) in cases with flu positive and negative  Non-flu patients also showed significantly depressed EF as compared to flu-positive patients (25/68, 36 8%;4/38, 8 33%;p= 001), as well as significantly higher levels of RV dysfunction (8/68, 14%;1/48, 2 17%) and IVC dilation (15/68, 23 1%;2/48, 4 44%;p= 027)  The proportion of patients with normal EF was higher in patients with flu compared to patients without flu (85 0% vs  65 7%, P = 0 042)  Mild RV dilation was more prevalent in flu-negative patients  Conclusion: In ED patients with suspected influenza, a POCUS CLIFF protocol showed no difference in cardiopulmonary findings in patients with confirmed influenza as compared to those who tested negative  Further studies comparing POCUS cardiopulmonary findings of influenza compared to COVID-19 are needed  [Formula presented]","Shokoohi, H.; Al Saud, A.; Goldsmith, A.; Schulwolf, S.; Eke, O.; Al Mulhim, A.; Huang, C.; Kharasch, S.; Liteplo, A.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annemergmed.2020.09.173","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Annals of Emergency Medicine;76(4):S63, 2020.; Publication details: Annals of Emergency Medicine;76(4):S63, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-05","",6792,""
"103 Impact of Stay-at-Home Orders on Reported Pediatric Poisonings during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Study Objectives: Systemic Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for the illness â€œCOVID-19,â€ was announced by China in December 2019  Soon after, a pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020  Cases of COVID-19 in Pennsylvania (PA) were first announced on March 6, 2020  Subsequently, there were limitations of gatherings and travel, closure of schools and non-essential businesses and physical distancing  With limitations, children were at home for longer periods of time and subsequently had increased access to potentially poisonous substances, such as over the counter medications, prescriptions, medications that are only delivered in a clinic but were given for home use due to closures, and increased amounts of cleaning supplies  The inherent isolation that comes with physical distancing was feared to surge depression and suicidal gestures particularly among adolescents  We know from previous natural disasters that an increase in reported exposures to poison control centers follow a major incident  We anticipated an increase in reported pediatric exposures to the Poison Control Center at Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP PCC) and nationally during the COVID-19 pandemic  Methods: We analyzed all reported pediatric cases (less than 18 years old) in the American Association of Poison Control Centersâ€™ National Poison Data System (NPDS) and the CHOP PCC of eastern Pennsylvania and Delaware  Timeframes analyzed included January 1, 2020 to May 31, 2020, which were compared to the same timeframes in 2018 and 2019  The data was then characterized by total reported cases per month, and subsequently by age groups of zero to five years, six to twelve years, and thirteen to eighteen years  Out of the separated groups, we evaluated sex, site of reported case, unintentional or intentional ingestion, and reported outcomes  Results: The number of reported pediatric poisonings did not vary significantly when comparing each month of 2020 to the previous two years  Sex, intent, and medical outcomes did not vary significantly from year to year or following the implementation of the stay-at-home order The greatest increase observed was among the age group six to twelve years with site listed as â€œown residence,â€ or the percentage of reports coming from a home, when comparing the months of March through May in the year 2019 to 2020 on both the local level (OR 2 2;95% CI 1 8-2 6, P&lt;0 0001) and the national level (OR 2 15;95% CI 2 08-2 23, P&lt;0 0001)  This reflects a statistically significant increase in poisonings occurring in the home during a pandemic when compared to the same time in the year previous  Conclusions: Following the implementation of stay-at-home orders during the COVID-19 pandemic, total volume of pediatric poisonings reported to both the CHOP PCC and nationally did not increase when compared to previous years  However, the number of exposures listed as occurring in â€œown residenceâ€ increased significantly from March through May 2020 when compared to the year prior, particularly in the age group six to twelve years  This is important for emergency physicians to be aware of as many predictions call for â€œa second wave,â€ as with the usual course of other coronaviruses  Additional stay-at-home orders to help mitigate spread of the virus may occur, along with an increase in school-aged children with reported poisonings","Cates, A.

"84 The Opioid Epidemic Meets the Coronavirus Pandemic: Rates of Emergency Department Visits for Opiate Use Disorder during COVID-19","Study Objectives: There is growing evidence that medication assisted therapy (MAT) which includes buprenorphine can lead to improved outcomes for patients with opiate use disorder (OUD), increased follow up with addiction treatment programs, as well as reduced illicit drug use and medical system costs for drug related emergency department (ED) visits  Emergency providers may serve to provide an induction to MAT and referrals to outpatient MAT providers  However, there continue to be barriers to utilization of buprenorphine from the ED including fears of precipitating withdrawal, fears of diversion or overdose, and beliefs that additional licenses are needed to offer treatment  The novel coronavirus epidemic threatens to pose even greater barriers to treatment access  EDs continue to serve patients throughout this crisis and may provide a critical role in continuing to link patients to MAT and provide care to patients with OUD  Methods: Our institution had planned to study the impact of an X-waiver training program for residents in our large, urban residency program  Closures during the coronavirus decreased patient volumes for many health care settings, especially outpatient clinics where much of MAT is delivered  We hypothesized that the â€œsafer at homeâ€ order would have minimal impact on the percentage of patients presenting with OUD related complaints, as this would be coupled with less access to community resources that had previously provided support  We considered OUD-related ED visits as those which included any of the following: visits with a discharge diagnosis related to OUD, patients administered buprenorphine or naloxone while in the ED, and visits where a prescription for buprenorphine or naloxone was given on discharge  We analyzed these visit rates compared with all ED visits per month  Results: The number of ED visits in January 2020 and February 2020 were 13,933 and 12,639 with rates of OUD-related visits 24 and 32 per 10,000, respectively  Social distancing guidelines were announced in Los Angeles on March 11, and stay at home orders began March 19, 2020  In April and May, there were 6,649 and 8,385 ED visits, however, rates of OUD-related visits were 59 and 35 per 10,000  Conclusion: Restrictive requirements on MAT dispensation already limits access to office-based treatment;during the coronavirus, the closure of clinics and other ancillary services to support persons with OUD threaten those most at risk of relapse  The COVID-19 pandemic and the changes in response to it have exacerbated disparities for marginalized populations  In order to combat these disparities, we need to recognize and bolster the systems of care serving these patient groups  Our ED continued to see steady rates of OUD-related visits, reinforcing the importance of continuing efforts to provide MAT from our social safety net  ED MAT programming represents an important portal to care, especially as a stop gap when other access points are destabilized  [Formula presented]","Johnson, E.; Lam, C.; Axeen, S.; Trotsky-Sirr, R.; Schneberk, T.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annemergmed.2020.09.094","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Annals of Emergency Medicine;76(4):S33, 2020.; Publication details: Annals of Emergency Medicine;76(4):S33, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-05","",6794,""

"Countermeasures for preventing and treating opioid overdose","The only medication available currently to prevent and treat opioid overdose (naloxone) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) nearly 50 years ago. Because of its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, naloxone has limited utility under some conditions and would not be effective to counteract mass casualties involving large-scale deployment of weaponized synthetic opioids. To address shortcomings of current medical countermeasures for opioid toxicity, a trans-agency scientific meeting was convened by the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID/NIH) on 6-7 August 2019 to explore emerging alternative approaches for treating opioid overdose in the event of weaponization of synthetic opioids. The meeting was initiated by the Chemical Countermeasures Research Program (CCRP), organized by NIAID, and was a collaboration with the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA/NIH), the FDA, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). This paper provides an overview of several presentations at that meeting that discussed emerging new approaches for treating opioid overdose, including the following: 1) intranasal nalmefene, a competitive, reversible opioid receptor antagonist with a longer duration of action than naloxone; 2) methocinnamox, a novel opioid receptor antagonist; 3) covalent naloxone nanoparticles; 4) serotonin (5-HT)1A receptor agonists; 5) fentanyl-binding cyclodextrin scaffolds; 6) detoxifying biomimetic ""nanosponge"" decoy receptors; and 7) antibody-based strategies. These strategies could also be applied to treat opioid use disorder (OUD).","France, Charles P; Ahern, Gerard; Averick, Saadyah; Disney, Alex; Enright, Heather A; Esmaeli-Azad, Babak; Federico, Arianna; Gerak, Lisa R; Husbands, Stephen M; Kolber, Benedict; Lau, Edmond Y; Lao, Victoria; Maguire, David R; Malfatti, Michael A; Martinez, Girardo; Mayer, Brian P; Pravetoni, Marco; Sahibzada, Niaz; Skolnick, Phil; Snyder, Evan Y; Tomycz, Nestor; Valdez, Carlos A; Zapf, Jim","https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cpt.2098","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Clin Pharmacol Ther;2020 Oct 28.; Publication details: Clin Pharmacol Ther;2020 Oct 28.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-05","",6810,""
"Does having a high-risk pregnancy influence anxiety level during the COVID-19 pandemic?","We aimed to analyze the changing level of anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic in pregnant women, with and without high-risk indicators separately, in a tertiary care center serving also for COVID-19 patients, in the capital of Turkey. We designed a case-control and cross-sectional study using surveys. The Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Scale questionnaire (STAI-T) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) which were validated in Turkish were given to outpatient women with high-risk pregnancies as study group and normal pregnancies as control group. A total of 446 women were recruited. There was a statistically significant difference between those with and without high-risk pregnancy in terms of Trait-State Anxiety scores with COVID-19 pandemic (p &lt; 0.05). We found an increased prevalence of anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic in high-risk pregnant women comparing to pregnancies with no risk factors (p &lt; 0.05). There was a statistically significant difference between the education level in high-risk pregnant women in terms of anxiety scores (p &lt; 0.05), Beck Anxiety score was highest in high school graduates (42.75). While the level of Trait Anxiety was the highest with pandemic in those with high-risk pregnancy with threatened preterm labor and preterm ruptures of membranes (58.0), those with thrombophilia were the lowest (50.88). The State Anxiety level and Beck Anxiety Score of those with maternal systemic disease were the highest (53.32 and 45.53), while those with thrombophilia were the lowest (46.96 and 40.08). The scores of Trait Anxiety (56.38), State Anxiety (52.14), Beck Anxiety (43.94) were statistically higher during the pandemic in those hospitalized at least once (p &lt; 0.05). High-risk pregnant women require routine anxiety and depression screening and psychosocial support during the COVID-19 pandemic. High-risk pregnancy patients have comorbid conditions most of the time, hence they not only at more risk for getting infected, but also have higher anxiety scores because of the stress caused by COVID-19 pandemic.","Sinaci, Ozden Tokalioglu, Ocal, Atalay, Yilmaz, Keskin, Erdinc, Sahin, Moraloglu Tekin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2020.10.055","20201104","Anxiety; COVID-19 pandemic; Comorbid diseases; High-risk pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-05","",6811,""
"Psychological distress, anxiety, family violence, suicidality, and wellbeing in New Zealand during the COVID-19 lockdown: A cross-sectional study","New Zealand's early response to the novel coronavirus pandemic included a strict lockdown which eliminated community transmission of COVID-19. However, this success was not without cost, both economic and social. In our study, we examined the psychological wellbeing of New Zealanders during the COVID-19 lockdown when restrictions reduced social contact, limited recreation opportunities, and resulted in job losses and financial insecurity. We conducted an online panel survey of a demographically representative sample of 2010 adult New Zealanders in April 2020. The survey contained three standardised measures-the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), the GAD-7, and the Well-Being Index (WHO-5)-as well as questions designed specifically to measure family violence, suicidal ideation, and alcohol consumption. It also included items assessing positive aspects of the lockdown. Thirty percent of respondents reported moderate to severe psychological distress (K10), 16% moderate to high levels of anxiety, and 39% low wellbeing; well above baseline measures. Poorer outcomes were seen among young people and those who had lost jobs or had less work, those with poor health status, and who had past diagnoses of mental illness. Suicidal ideation was reported by 6%, with 2% reporting making plans for suicide and 2% reporting suicide attempts. Suicidality was highest in those aged 18-34. Just under 10% of participants had directly experienced some form of family harm over the lockdown period. However, not all consequences of the lockdown were negative, with 62% reporting 'silver linings', which included enjoying working from home, spending more time with family, and a quieter, less polluted environment. New Zealand's lockdown successfully eliminated COVID-19 from the community, but our results show this achievement brought a significant psychological toll. Although much of the debate about lockdown measures has focused on their economic effects, our findings emphasise the need to pay equal attention to their effects on psychological wellbeing.","Every-Palmer, Jenkins, Gendall, Hoek, Beaglehole, Bell, Williman, Rapsey, Stanley","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0241658","20201104","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-05","",6812,""
"VIOLENCE AGAINST CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS: NOTIFICATION AND ALERT IN TIMES OF PANDEMIC","Social isolation is currently identified as the best way to prevent the infection by the new coronavirus. However, for some social groups, such as children and adolescents, this measure carries a contradiction: the home, which should be the safest place for them, is also a frequent environment of a sad aggravation: domestic violence. This study aims to evaluate the notifications of interpersonal/self-inflicted violence available in the Information System for Notifiable Diseases in the State of Santa Catarina (southern Brazil), for the juvenile age group, before and during the new coronavirus pandemics. Cross-sectional, descriptive study of violence against children and adolescents (from 0 to 19 years) notified by health professionals by completing and entering the occurrence in the Information System for Notifiable Diseases of the State of Santa Catarina in 11 weeks in which the social isolation measure was instituted as mandatory, comparing with the same period before this measure. During the study period, 136 municipalities in Santa Catarina made 1,851 notifications. There was a decrease of 55.3% of them in the isolation period, and the difficulties encountered in seeking protection and assistance institutions were listed. The society needs to be aware of possible cases of violence in the children and adolescent population. It is important to provide accessible, effective, and safe ways for complaints and notifications, as well as a quick response to the cases, aiming at protecting victims and minimizing damages to prevent the perpetuation of the violence.","Platt, Guedert, Coelho","https://doi.org/10.1590/1984-0462/2021/39/2020267","20201104","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-05","",6813,""
"Burden of disease from COVID-19 and its acute and chronic complications: reflections on measurement (DALYs) and prospects for the Brazilian Unified National Health System","COVID-19 is an acute infectious respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The disease is highly communicable and produces mild to severe symptoms, generating a high demand for intensive care and thousands of deaths. In March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic and has already surpassed five million cases and 300,000 deaths in the world. The natural history of the disease has still not been fully established, hindering the elaboration of effective clinical protocols and preventive measures. Nevertheless, the disease requires a systemic approach, since there is evidence of acute and chronic complications, in addition to the catastrophic effects on the population's mental health. This highlights the need for a methodology that more effectively captures the effect of COVID-19, considering such aspects as severity, duration, and the potential to generate chronic complications that will increase the demands on Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS). DALYs, or disability-adjusted life years, are thus an extremely useful indictor that adds mortality, an estimate of years of life lost (YLLs), and morbidity, an estimate of years of life lived with disability (YLDs). This article discusses the relevance and difficulties of studying the burden of COVID-19 and its complications in the Brazilian context, highlighting the natural history of the disease and estimating indicators such as YLDs, considering the high burden of disease in planning strategies to deal with the consequences of COVID-19 after the pandemic. The article also discusses the future challenges to deal with the disease in the SUS and the effects on the calculation of DALYs.

Apesar disso, pode-se afirmar que ÃƒÂ© uma doenÃƒÂ§a de abordagem sistÃƒÂªmica, jÃƒÂ¡ que hÃƒÂ¡ evidÃƒÂªncias de complicaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂµes agudas e crÃƒÂ´nicas, alÃƒÂ©m de efeitos catastrÃƒÂ³ficos na saÃƒÂºde mental da populaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o. Destaca-se entÃƒÂ£o a necessidade de uma metodologia que capte de forma mais efetiva os efeitos da COVID-19, considerando aspectos como sua gravidade, duraÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o e potencial de gerar complicaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂµes crÃƒÂ´nicas que aumentarÃƒÂ£o as demandas no Sistema ÃƒÅ¡nico de SaÃƒÂºde (SUS). Nesse sentido, ÃƒÂ© de extrema utilidade o indicador DALY, ou anos de vida perdidos por morte prematura ajustados por incapacidade (DALY), que agrega a (1) mortalidade - estimativa dos anos de vida perdidos (YLL) e (2) morbidade - estimativa dos anos vividos com incapacidade (YLD). Este artigo discute a relevÃƒÂ¢ncia e as dificuldades de estudar a carga da COVID-19 e de suas complicaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂµes, no contexto brasileiro, ressaltando a importÃƒÂ¢ncia de caracterizar a histÃƒÂ³ria natural da doenÃƒÂ§a e estimar indicadores como o YLD, que considerem a alta carga de morbidade no planejamento de estratÃƒÂ©gias para lidar com as consequÃƒÂªncias da COVID-19 pÃƒÂ³s-pandemia. Discute-se tambÃƒÂ©m os desafios futuros para o enfrentamento da doenÃƒÂ§a no SUS e reflexÃƒÂµes sobre o cÃƒÂ¡lculo do DALY. La COVID-19 es un sÃƒÂ­ndrome respiratorio agudo grave (SRAG) infeccioso, causado por coronavirus.

La historia natural de la enfermedad todavÃƒÂ­a no ha sido bien establecida, dificultando la elaboraciÃƒÂ³n de protocolos clÃƒÂ­nicos eficaces y medidas de prevenciÃƒÂ³n. A pesar de eso, se puede afirmar que es una enfermedad de abordaje sistÃƒÂ©mico, ya que existen evidencias sobre complicaciones agudas y crÃƒÂ³nicas, ademÃƒÂ¡s de efectos catastrÃƒÂ³ficos en la salud mental de la poblaciÃƒÂ³n. Se destaca entonces la necesidad de una metodologÃƒÂ­a que capte de forma mÃƒÂ¡s efectiva los efectos de la COVID-19, considerando aspectos como su gravedad, duraciÃƒÂ³n, potencial de generar complicaciones crÃƒÂ³nicas que aumentarÃƒÂ¡n las demandas en el Sistema ÃƒÅ¡nico de Salud (SUS).

"Correlation between emotional intelligence and negative emotions of front-line nurses during the COVID-19 epidemic: a cross-sectional study","The purpose of this study was to understand the emotional intelligence level (EI) and negative emotional status of the front-line nurses in the epidemic situation and to further explore the relationship between them. During the COVID-19 epidemic, under the influence of multiple factors, nurses were vulnerable to negative emotions. While previous studies have explored, the role of emotional intelligence in negative emotions, the relationship between the two has not been sufficiently discussed in the context of COVID-19. The study carried out a cross-sectional survey. The STROBE was selected as the checklist in this study. 202 nurses from Wuhan makeshift hospital participated in the questionnaire survey. Data collection tools included a general data questionnaire designed by the researchers, Chinese version of EI scale (WLEIS-C) and Chinese version of depression-anxiety-stress scale (DASS-21). Descriptive statistics, single factor analysis, and correlation analysis were used to analyze the data. The emotional intelligence of the front-line nurses was in the upper middle range. Among the negative emotions, anxiety was the most prominent symptom. Managers should pay attention to the negative emotional problems of front-line nurses, improve their EI level and promote mental health and the progress of epidemic prevention. Improving the level of emotional intelligence can reduce the frequency and intensity of negative emotions. In clinical work, emotional intelligence can be used as a skill to carry out relevant training, which is conducive to playing a positive role in future emergencies.","Sun, Wang, Wang, Han, Liu, Wu, Pang","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15548","20201104","COVID-19; China; Wuhan; emotional intelligence; negative emotions; nurse","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-05","",6815,""
"Prevalence and severity of depression, anxiety, stress and perceived stress in hospitalized patients with COVID-19","COVID-19, a disease that can be transmitted from person to person and with serious health problems, can be associated with mental health disorders. In this study, we evaluated the prevalence and severity of depression, anxiety, stress, and stress perception among a group of patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized. In this cross-sectional study, 106 inpatients with COVID-19 who had stable clinical conditions were evaluated psychologically by two questionnaires: Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4). More than one third of patients had underlying disease. Overall, 97.2% of patients with COVID-19 had some degree of depression. Severity of depression, according to the DASS questionnaire, was 85.8%. All patients (100%) had severe (0.9%) and very severe (99.1%) anxiety. Regarding to stress levels, 97.1% of patients had some degree of stress. In the severity of stress category, 84.9% of patients had severe and very severe stress. In terms of perceived stress, 73.6% of patients had high levels and 22.6% had moderate levels. A positive strong correlation was found between depression and perceived stress (Coefficient: 0.33, P-value: 0.001). Correlation between anxiety and perceived stress was statistically significant (Coefficient: 0.2, P-value: 0.04). The existence of such a high prevalence and severity of psychiatric disorders among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 underscores the need for serious attention to the mental health status of these patients. It seems that health policymakers need to have coherent plans for screening cases and managing related situations.","Zandifar, Badrfam, Yazdani, Arzaghi, Rahimi, Ghasemi, Khamisabadi, Mohammadian Khonsari, Qorbani","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40200-020-00667-1","20201104","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Management; Patients; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-05","",6816,""
"Long-term sequelae following previous coronavirus epidemics","Before the current pandemic, there had been two global epidemics from major coronavirus outbreaks since the turn of the century: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Both epidemics left survivors with fatigue, persistent shortness of breath, reduced quality of life and a significant burden of mental health problems.It is likely that some of the chronic problems encountered by survivors of SARS and MERS may be relevant for medical planning of the services required for survivors of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Given the similarities between the diseases, the recovery and rehabilitation of the survivors of COVID-19 is likely to be focused around cardiopulmonary sequelae, fatigue and the psychological burden of COVID-19, but in a much larger population.","O'Sullivan","https://doi.org/10.7861/clinmed.2020-0204","20201104","COVID-19; Coronavirus; rehab; rehabilitation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-05","",6817,""
"Infection, screening, and psychological stress of health care workers with COVID-19 in a non-frontline clinical department","To investigate risk factors and psychological stress of health care workers (HCWs) with COVID-19 in a non-frontline clinical department. Data of 2 source patients and all HCWs with infection risk were obtained in a department in Wuhan from January to February 2020. A questionnaire was designed to evaluate psychological stress of COVID-19 on HCWs. The overall infection rate was 4.8% in HCWs. 10 of 25 HCWs who contacted with 2 source patients were diagnosed with confirmed COVID-19 (8/10) and suspected COVID-19 (2/10). Other 2 HCWs were transmitted by other patients or colleagues. Close care behaviours included physical examination (6/12), life nursing (4/12), ward rounds (4/12), endoscopic examination (2/12). Contacts fluctuated from 1 to 24 times and each contact was short (8.1 min Ã‚Â± 5.6 min). HCWs wore surgical masks (11/12), gloves (7/12), and isolation clothing (3/12) when providing medical care. Most HCWs experienced a mild course with 2 asymptomatic infections, taking 9.8 days and 20.9 days to obtain viral shedding and clinical cure, respectively. Psychological stress included worry (58.3%), anxiety (83.3%), depression (58.3%), and insomnia (58.3%). Close contact with COVID-19 patients and insufficient protection were key risk factors. Precaution measures and psychological support on COVID-19 is urgently required for HCWs.","Wang, Guan, Zhu, Wang, Fang, Wen, Xie, Tian, Li","https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2020.428","20201104","COVID-19; health care worker; non-frontline; psychological stress; risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-05","",6818,""
"Reexamining Health Care Coalitions in Light of COVID-19","The national response to the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted critical weaknesses in domestic health care and public health emergency preparedness despite nearly two decades of federal funding for multiple programs designed to encourage cross-cutting collaboration in emergency response. Health care coalitions (HCCs), which are funded through the Hospital Preparedness Program, were first piloted in 2007 and have been continuously funded nationwide since 2012 to support broad collaborations across public health, emergency management, emergency medical services, and the emergency response arms of the health care system within a geographical area. This commentary provides a SWOT analysis to summarize the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to the current HCC model against the backdrop of COVID-19. We close with concrete recommendations for better leveraging the HCC model for improved health care system readiness. These include better evaluating the role of HCCs and their members (including the responsibility of the HCC to better communicate and align with other sectors), reconsidering the existing framework for HCC administration, increasing incentives for meaningful community participation in HCC preparedness, and supporting next-generation development of health care preparedness systems for future pandemics.","Barnett, Knieser, Errett, Rosenblum, Seshamani, Kirsch","https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2020.431","20201104","COVID-19; Health care coalitions; Hospital Preparedness Program","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-05","",6819,""
"Impact of Covid-19 in pregnancy on mother's psychological status and infant's neurobehavioral development: a longitudinal cohort study in China","Evidence concerning the long-term impact of Covid-19 in pregnancy on mother's psychological disorder and infant's developmental delay is unknown. This study is a longitudinal single-arm cohort study conducted in China between May 1 and July 31, 2020. Seventy-two pregnant patients with Covid-19 participated in follow-up surveys until 3Ã‚Â months after giving birth (57 cases) or having abortion (15 cases). We collected data from medical records regarding Covid-19, delivery or abortion, testing results of maternal and neonatal specimens, and questionnaires of quarantine, mother-baby separation, feeding, and measuring of mothers' mental disorders and infants' neurobehavioral disorders. All cases infected in the first trimester and 1/3 of cases infected in the second trimester had an abortion to terminate the pregnancy. 22.2% of pregnant patients were suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression at 3Ã‚Â months after delivery or induced abortion. Among 57 live births, only one neonate was positive of nucleic acid testing for throat swab, but negative in repeated tests subsequently. The median duration of mother-baby separation was 35Ã¢â‚¬â€°days (interquartile range 16 to 52Ã¢â‚¬â€°days). After the termination of maternal quarantine, 49.1% of mothers chose to prolong the mother-baby separation (median 8Ã¢â‚¬â€°days; IQR 5 to 23Ã¢â‚¬â€°days). The breastfeeding rate was 8.8% at 1Ã‚Â week after birth, 19.3% at the age of 1Ã‚Â month, and 36.8% at the age of 3Ã‚Â months, respectively. The proportion of &quot;monitoring&quot; and &quot;risk&quot; in the social-emotional developmental domain at the age of 3Ã‚Â months was 22.7% and 63.6%, respectively. After the adjustment of preterm, neonatal sex, admitted to NICU, and the mother's Covid-19 condition, the negative associations were significantly identified (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05) between mother-baby separation days and three developmental domains: communication, gross motor, and personal-social. There is no definite evidence on vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. In addition to control infection risk, researchers and healthcare providers should pay more attention to maternal mental health and infant's feeding, closeness with parents, and early development.","Wang, Chen, Wu, Shi, Li, Jiang, Zheng, Wang, Wei, Zhao, Qiao","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-020-01825-1","20201104","Child early development; Covid-19; Maternal health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-05","",6820,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on harm reduction services in Spain","Containment policies and other restrictions introduced by the Spanish government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic present challenges for marginalised populations, such as people who use drugs. Harm reduction centres are often linked to social services, mental health services, and infectious disease testing, in addition to tools and services that help to reduce the harms associated with injecting drugs. This study aimed to explore the impact of the pandemic on these services in four autonomous communities in Spain. This is a cross-sectional study that employed a seven-section structured survey administered electronically to 20 centres in July 2020. Data from the most heavily affected months (March-June) in 2020 were compared to data from the same period in 2019. Averages were calculated with their ranges, rates, and absolute numbers. All 11 responding centres reported having had to adapt or modify their services during the Spanish state of alarm (14 March-21 June 2020). One centre reported complete closure for 2Ã‚Â months and four reported increases in their operating hours. The average number of service users across all centres decreased by 22% in comparison to the same period in the previous year and the average needle distribution decreased by 40% in comparison to 2019. Most centres reported a decrease in infectious disease testing rates (hepatitis B and C viruses, human immunodeficiency virus, and tuberculosis) for March, April, and May in 2020 compared to the previous year. Reported deaths as a result of overdose did not increase during the state of alarm, but 2/11 (18%) centres reported an increase in overdose deaths immediately after finalisation of the state of alarm. Overall, Spanish harm reduction centres were able to continue operating and offering services by adjusting operating hours. The number of overall service users and needles distributed fell during the Spanish state of alarm lockdown period, suggesting that fewer clients accessed harm reduction services during this time, putting them at greater risk of reusing or sharing injecting equipment, overdosing, acquiring infectious diseases with decreased access to testing or discontinuing ongoing treatment such as methadone maintenance therapy, hepatitis C treatment, or antiretroviral therapy.","Picchio, Valencia, Doran, Swan, Pastor, MartrÃƒÂ³, Colom, Lazarus","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-020-00432-w","20201104","COVID-19; Harm reduction; Health systems; Healthcare utilisation; Spain","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-05","",6821,""
"Effects of COVID-19 on Informal Caregivers and the Development and Validation of a Scale in English and Spanish to Measure the Impact of COVID-19 on Caregivers","To understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected caregivers, we assessed its perceived impact on caregiving through a new measure: the Caregiver COVID-19 Limitations Scale (CCLS-9), in Spanish and English. We also compared levels of caregiver self-efficacy and burden pre-COVID-19 and early in the pandemic. We administered surveys via internet to a convenience sample of caregivers in January 2020 (pre-pandemic, <i>n</i> = 221) and in April-June 2020 (English, <i>n</i> = 177 and Spanish samples, <i>n</i> = 144) to assess caregiver self-efficacy, depression, pain, and stress. We used the early pandemic surveys to explore the validity of the CCLS-9. The pre-COVID-19 survey and the April English surveys were compared to determine how the COVID-19 pandemic affected caregivers. The CCLS-9 had strong construct and divergent validity in both languages. Compared to pre-COVID-19, caregiver stress (<i>p</i> = .002) and pain (<i>p</i> = .009) were significantly greater early in COVID-19, providing evidence of its validity. COVID-19 added to caregiver stress and pain.","Sheth, Lorig, Stewart, Parodi, Ritter","https://doi.org/10.1177/0733464820971511","20201104","COVID-19; burden; caregiving; self-efficacy; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-05","",6822,""
