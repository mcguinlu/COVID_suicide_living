"Yoga and meditation, an essential tool to alleviate stress and enhance immunity to emerging infections: A perspective on the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on students","The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has negatively impacted the global healthcare and economic systems worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic has also created an emotional and psychological pandemic among people of all ages irrespective of economic status and physical wellbeing. As a consequence of prolonged lockdowns, one of the most severely affected age groups globally is the young adults' group, especially students. Uncertainties in the academic calendar, restricted outdoor activities, and unusual daily routines during lockdowns led to higher incidences of stress, anxiety, and depression among students worldwide. In this review, we summarise the available evidence on the effect of lockdowns on students and discuss possible positive impacts of yoga and meditation on various psychological, emotional, and immunological parameters, which can significantly influence the general wellbeing and academic performance of students. Perspectives shared in the review will also bring awareness on how yoga and meditation could boost students' performance and assist them in maintaining physical and mental wellbeing during stressful conditions such as future epidemics and pandemics with novel infections. This information could help create better educational curriculums and healthy routines for students.","Dalpati, Nibedita, Jena, Subhashree, Jain, Shikha, Sarangi, Pranita P.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2022.100420","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Brain, Behavior, & Immunity - Health;: 100420, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-25","",25848,""
"Changes in Marijuana and Nicotine Vaping Perceptions and Use Behaviors among Young Adults since the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Study","Background Research is lacking on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on marijuana vaping behaviors;a notable limitation as marijuana vaping has been previously associated with respiratory issues among young people. This qualitative study explored how the COVID-19 pandemic influenced vaping perceptions and behaviors among young adults (18 to 25-year-olds). Methods Qualitative interviews were conducted with 50 regular marijuana vapers. Individuals were eligible if they vaped marijuana at least 3 days per week (exclusively or dual use with nicotine). Interview transcripts were analyzed using deductive coding processes to identify themes. Differences in themes by gender and user status (regular marijuana versus regular dual vapers) were explored. Results While many participants indicated that the pandemic negatively impacted their attitudes about vaping, participants also noted that their negative attitudes did not translate into reductions in use. Overall, 54% of participants reported increasing vaping during COVID-19. For both regular dual vapers and marijuana vapers, boredom was a prominent theme for increases in vaping. Lack of accessibility of marijuana was cited as a reason for decreasing marijuana among regular marijuana vapers but not for regular dual vapers. Males reported more unchanged attitudes about vaping and more males than females reported still sharing their devices. Conclusions More than half of participants reported increasing their vaping behaviors since the COVID-19 pandemic despite concerns about the potential for vaping to adversely impact lung and immune health. As the U.S. adapts to the COVID-19 pandemic, interventions should address factors that may contribute to increases in use behaviors.","Case, Kathleen R.; Clendennen, Stephanie L.; Shah, Jay, Tsevat, Joel, Harrell, Melissa B.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.abrep.2022.100408","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Addictive Behaviors Reports;: 100408, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-25","",25849,""
"An Assessment of the Impact of SARS-CoV-2 on a Level 1 Trauma Center Including Subgroup Analysis of Orthopedic Injuries and Mechanism of Injury","Background and objective There is a paucity of medical literature describing the preparedness of hospital institutions to withstand the population effects of a pandemic. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has had a global impact on all facets of medicine, which has ultimately affected the medical community in a significant manner. Furthermore, there is a scarcity of research regarding the effects of COVID-19 on trauma and acute care surgery injury and admission rates. We conducted this study to examine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on both pediatric and adult trauma admissions, injury types, and mechanisms of injury. Materials and methods Data from the Trauma Registry was extracted for all adult (&gt;15 years) and pediatric (&lt;15 years) patients who consulted trauma surgery, acute care surgery, or orthopedic surgery at our center in the year immediately prior to the pandemic (March 1, 2019-February 29, 2020) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 1, 2020-February 28, 2021). Patient demographics, cause of injury, injury type and mechanism, and procedures performed were recorded. Results We documented a 4.2% increase in adult encounters compared to the preceding year. There was a significant difference in the distribution of mechanism of injury of adult patients between the two time periods, with the most changes seen in motor-vehicle auto, gunshot, and other vehicle injuries. However, no significant difference was seen in trauma type or intent (assault, self-inflicted, unintentional). Pediatric encounters increased by 6.4% during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. Overall, there was no detectable association between the distribution of encounters by the mechanism of injury and the time period for pediatric encounters. Conclusion This retrospective review of trauma encounters through both pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods outlines the differences in factors such as demographics, injury mechanisms, and injury types between the two time periods. Overall, we expected a decrease in orthopedic-related trauma admissions during the COVID-19 pandemic;however, there was actually an increase of 4.1% in adult encounters and that of 6.4% in pediatric encounters. Our study lays out possible trends in injury patterns that can be correlated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown period. This information is useful for the healthcare system in that it demonstrates that resources should not be cut down or removed from surgical specialties. At level I facilities, resources need to be allocated for and continued to be provided to emergency rooms and operative services, including supplies and staffing. These departments need to be well-equipped to handle an increased number of trauma patients.","Moore, A.; Singleton, A.; Hiatt, L.; Miller, R.; Phillips, S.; Leskovan, J.

"A Criminological Approach to the COVID-19 Pandemic with a Comparative Perspective Based on Iran's and the World's Data","[...]the article concludes that the current pandemic exerts varying impacts on criminality, corroborating the assumption that 'disease' alongside 'crime' endangers human health on the whole. [...]the main question is how humans can maintain their physical health upon exposure to the dangers of COVID, and look after their mental health from the risks and the unpleasant effects of criminality, particularly fear of crime and moral panic? [...]as will be seen later, the relationships between the pandemic and economic crimes as well as domestic violence in the context of crime typology in criminology constitute the sub-titles of this part. 1.

"Impacts of long-term COVID-19 school closures on Japanese school children","Background This study investigated the impact of COVID-19 pandemic school closures on the mental health of school students with chronic diseases. Methods Questionnaires were distributed from 4th-9th grade students diagnosed with chronic diseases at Osaka Medical College Hospital and their parents or caregivers. Questionnaires from 286 families were returned by mail after schools reopened. The students were divided into the ?psychosomatic disorder? group (P, n = 42), ?developmental disorder? group (D, n = 89), and ?other disease? group (O, n = 155). Using students? self-report on the Questionnaire for Triage and Assessment with 30 items (QTA30), we assessed the proportion of students having a high risk of psychosomatic disorder in three groups. We investigated how the students requiring the support of somatic symptom (SS) felt about school during school closure. Further, using parents? and caregivers? answers, SS scores were calculated before and during school closure and after school reopening. Results The proportion of students having a high risk of developing psychosomatic disorder increased in all groups. For the students in Group P, the response ?I did not want to think about school? indicated an increase in SS scores, and for the students in Group O, ?I wanted to get back to school soon? indicated a decrease. Furthermore, especially in Group P students, SS scores decreased transiently during school closure and increased after school reopening. Conclusions The impact of school closure on mental health differed depending on students? diagnoses and feelings about school during school closures.","Hayano, Chiaki, Shimakawa, Shuichi, Fukui, Miho, Yoshida, Seiji, Tsuda-Kitahara, Hikaru, Ashida, Akira","https://doi.org/10.1111/ped.15131","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Pediatrics International; n/a(n/a):e15131, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-25","",25852,""
"Malaysia in crisis: political instability and feelings of hopelessness","Malaysia is experiencing its deepest crisis since World War II. The country is in the midst of a Covid-19 pandemic, where daily cases exceed 20,000, and daily deaths are in the hundreds. It is being ruled under emergency decree. The suffering evolving from the harsh restrictions is economically and socially costly, and lockdowns have been extended repeatedly due to a bungled vaccine rollout. More than 30,000 businesses closed permanently last year, with more closing this year. Many families are in a desperate situation;some are even unable to even feed themselves.

"Maternity healthcare providersâ€™ self-perceptions of well-being during COVID-19: A survey in Tshwane Health District, South Africa","Background: Mental health manifestations such as depression and anxiety disorders became more marked during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as frontline healthcare workers struggled to maintain high-quality intrapartum care and essential health services. Aim: This study aimed to identify maternity healthcare providersâ€™ self-perceptions of changes in their feelings of mental well-being. Setting: Ten midwife obstetric units and the labour wards of four district hospitals in Tshwane Health District, South Africa. Methods: We conducted an anonymous, cross-sectional survey amongst a convenience sample of 114 maternity healthcare workers to gauge the changes in healthcare workersâ€™ experience and perceptions of well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. Four items measured the perceived changes on a scale of 0â€“10 for the periods before and during COVID-19, respectively, namely feelings of fear or anxiety, stress, depression and anger. Results: The majority of participants were professional nurses (37%) and advanced midwives (47%). They reported a significant change in well-being from before the pandemic to during the pandemic with regard to all four items ( p &lt; 0.0001). The biggest â€˜before-duringâ€™ difference was in perceptions of fear or anxiety and the smallest difference was in perceptions of anger. A framework was constructed from the open-ended responses to explain healthcare workersâ€™ understanding and perceptions of increased negative feelings regarding their mental well-being. Conclusion: The observed trends in the changes in healthcare workersâ€™ self-perceptions of their mental well-being highlight the need for further planning to build resilient frontline healthcare workers and provide them with ongoing mental health support and improved communication pathways.","Oosthuizen, Sarie, Bergh, Anne-Marie, Silver, Antonella, Malatji, Refilwe, Mfolo, Vivian, Botha, Tanita","https://doi.org/10.4102/phcfm.v14i1.3034","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: African Journal of Primary Health Care & Family Medicine; 14(1), 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-25","",25854,""
"Impending Mental Health Issues During Coronavirus Disease 2019 â€“ Time for Personalized Nutrition Based on the Gut Microbiota to Tide Over the Crisis?","Covid-19 is a major pandemic facing the world today caused by SARS-CoV-2 which has implications on our mental health as well. The uncertain future, fear of job loss, lockdown and negative news all around have taken a heavy toll on the mental health of individuals from across the world. Stress and anxiety can affect the Covid-19 patients even more. Recent study suggests Covid-19 infection may lead to post-traumatic disorder (PTSD). Certain prebiotics and probiotics have been shown to have anxiolytic effect through gut microbiota modulation. Incidentally, preliminary report also suggests a differential microbial profile in Covid-19 patients as compared to healthy individuals. Gut microbiotaâ€™s role in anxiety and depression is well studied. The importance of the â€œgut-brainâ€ axis has been implicated in overall mental health. It is known that diet, environmental factors and genetics play an important role in shaping gut microbiota. Trials may be initiated to study if personalized diet and supplementation based on individualâ€™s gut microbiome profile may improve the general mental wellbeing of people prone to anxiety during this pandemic. Also, Covid-19 patients may be provided personalized nutritional therapy based on their gut microbiota profile to see if PTSD and anxiety symptoms can be alleviated.","Dhar, Debojyoti","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2021.831193","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Frontiers in Neuroscience;2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-25","",25855,""
"Mental health status of married women during COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh: A cross-sectional study","Aim The uncontrolled spread of COVID-19 has demanded unparalleled measures, from the imposition of quarantine to the declaration as a public health emergency of international concern. COVID-19 poses a severe threat to our day-to-day life as well as physical and mental health. This study explores mental health status among married women that remain understudied in Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methodology A cross-sectional study was conducted among 597 married women via face-to-face interview, maintaining all safety protocols. A semi-structured questionnaire was assembled that included socio-demographics and the DASS-21 scale. Descriptive analysis and logistic regression were performed to examine the associations between variables. Result Almost 35% of the respondents had stress, 20% had anxiety, and 44% had depression ranging from mild to extremely severe. Metropolitan city inhabitants, being housewives, higher educational status, number of children, financial condition, comorbidities, family members assistance in household activities, relocation during COVID-19, social media use, concern about family, infected family members, tendency to get COVID-19 updates had been found significant in multivariable and univariate regression analysis with depression, anxiety, and stress. Conclusion In this study, we found high rates of stress, anxiety, and depression among the study participants.

"Relevant aspects of the infodemic from a transgenerational perspective: the Peruvian case","The objective of the study was to analyze the access, action and reaction of young people, adults and older adults as relevant aspects of the infodemic. Given this, a quantitative, observational, cross-analytical study was carried out. The sample was of 503 people between the ages of 20 and 70 in Lima, Peru: young people (28.0%), adults (59.4%) and older adults (12.5%);44.0% men and 56.0% women. The evaluation instrument was a survey composed of 12 items showing evidence of validity. The results showed that young people and adults make greater use of Facebook for information, while older adults use instant messaging (WhatsApp) for the same purpose. It is the older adults who maintain a tendency to share information without contrasting the veracity, unlike young people and adults. Young people are looking for trusted sources such as official websites, unlike adults and older adults. The effect of the infodemic causes emotional effects on a higher level in older adults. It is concluded that the infodemic causes a set of social phenomena that alters public health, generates anxiety, stress and depression that overflows in behaviors such as self-medication, search for alternative medicine and creation of conspiracy theories.","Carhuaz, E.

"Bioprocessing strategies for microbial production and purification of immunosuppressants: an insight for process intensification","Beyond the conventional use of immunosuppressants in organ transplantation, it has multiple applications, including controlling autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. The recent pandemic of Covid -19 also sought its effectiveness in managing the later stage cytokine storm, which can otherwise lead to mortality. Regardless of recent advancements in the field, the considerably high cost of these agents is a limiting factor in organ transplantation that adds to the financial strain on patients with socioeconomic disparities. An in-depth analysis of the bioprocess engineering aspect of immunosuppressant drugs is essential to reveal the crucial points that can enhance the production of these secondary metabolites and show a way ahead for more economical production. This review aims to summarise past and current advances in bioprocessing strategies used in the field, emphasising the production of cyclosporins, tacrolimus, mycophenolic acid, and sirolimus.

"Incidence and Outcomes of COVID-19 First Wave Pandemic in a French Nursing Home with Residents suffering from Severe Mental Illnesses","During the first wave of COVID-19, nearly 50% of France's fatalities occurred in nursing homes. Older people with mental health disorders are considered to be more prone to infections when epidemics arise. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a retrospective descriptive and comparative study of the incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in a cohort of elderly residents with or without severe mental illness (SMI) living in a French nursing home facility. This was done during the first lockdown from March 17th until May 11th, 2020. Our study included 72 participants of 75 residents, of whom 58 contracted COVID-19, 14 developed a severe form requiring hospitalisation, and 14 died. The disease was significantly less frequent in residents with SMI 15(62%) than those without SMI 43 (89.6%). In regression analysis, a higher level of autonomy was significantly associated with a lower disease incidence. Once contracted, residents with or without SMI differed significantly neither on morbidity nor mortality. The period of survival did not either significantly differ between the two groups. As a potential explanation, we suggested that pathological social withdrawal added to stigmatisation could have protected SMI residents from contracting the disease.","Loganathan, Kavitha, Leroy, Pascale, Elbaz, Pierre, Grimfeld, Alain, Mouaffak, FayÃ§al","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114398","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Psychiatry Research;: 114398, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-25","",25860,""
"Individual obsessive-compulsive traits are associated with poorer adjustment to the easing of COVID-19 restrictions","Background As COVID-19 restrictions ease, the public are expected to relinquish previously enforced safety behaviors and resume a more normal lifestyle. Despite these aims, our recent survey of 438 adults from the general population, during a temporary release of lockdown in the United Kingdom (Julyâ€“November 2020), showed that 25% of the public find re-adjustment problematic. This was especially the case in those with a history of mental disorder and obsessive-compulsive (OC) traits and symptoms, including rigidity as measured by a neurocognitive test of attentional flexibility. To aid in identifying those most at risk, we performed a secondary analysis on the data to determine which specific OC traits were related to specific aspects of behavioral adjustment. Methods Correlational and multiple regression analyses were performed to determine associations between the eight individual personality traits constituting DSM-5 Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD), as measured by the self-rated Compulsive Personality Assessment Scale (CPAS) and a range of self-rated Post-Pandemic Adjustment Questionnaire items. Results Three items on the Post-Pandemic Adjustment Questionnaire correlated with individual CPAS items: â€˜General difficulties adjustingâ€™ correlated with perfectionism, preoccupation with details, over-conscientiousness and need for control;â€˜social avoidanceâ€™ correlated with perfectionism and preoccupation with details;and â€˜disinfecting behaviorsâ€™ correlated with preoccupation with details and miserliness (Pearson's r - all pÂ &lt;Â .001). Intriguingly, none of the adjustment items correlated significantly with self-rated rigidity. Conclusions Several OCPD traits predict post-pandemic adjustment difficulties, but perfectionism and preoccupation-with-details showed the most robust correlations. These traits constitute a platform for the development of new screening and interventional strategies aimed at restoring public mental health and wellbeing. Cognitive rigidity may be more reliably evaluated using an objective form of assessment.","Fineberg, Naomi A.; Pellegrini, Luca, Burkauskas, Julius, Clarke, Aaron, Laws, Keith R.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.01.029","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Psychiatric Research;2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-25","",25861,""
"Responding to women experiencing domestic and family violence during the COVID-19 pandemic: Exploring experiences and impacts of remote service delivery in Australia","The COVID-19 health pandemic has increased women's vulnerability to all forms of domestic and family violence (DFV). In the first weeks of March 2020, most Australian states and territories, like many other jurisdictions, entered into a period of government-directed restrictions including stay-at-home orders, physical distancing limitations and closure of a significant number of community services. With more people confined to their homes, the risk of DFV increased at the same time as access to support services was reduced. In this article, we present the findings of two surveys conducted in the Australian states of Victoria and Queensland to explore the professional experiences of practitioners supporting women experiencing violence during the pandemic. Our analysis offers new insights into the ways in which practitioners pivoted their services to respond remotely to women experiencing violence and the challenges of effectively undertaking safety planning and risk assessment without face-to-face contact. The second half of this article examines the implications of remote service delivery on practitioner mental health and well-being. The findings have global relevance and reveal the critical need to prioritize well-being supports for DFV practitioners in crisis response plans.","Pfitzner, N.; Fitz-Gibbon, K.; Meyer, S.","https://doi.org/10.1111/cfs.12870","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Child & Family Social Work; 27(1):30-40, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-25","",25862,""

In such unprecedented times, little was known about the potential impact on this group and their specific experience of the Covid-19 lockdown restrictions. A rapid review was conducted, 28 young carers responded to a survey and an additional 20 participants were interviewed in January 2021;the survey was repeated with a further 149 responses. Findings show that the level of care that young carers are required to provide had increased as external agency support for their families had been withdrawn while their own coping strategies had been challenged, in particular through school closures. These restrictions had a significant impact on every aspect of their lives, from their ability to meet their own mental health needs to managing the requirements of home schooling. The needs of young carers should be acknowledged within the political agenda, especially at times of crisis. It is crucial that health and social care services increase their capacity to identify and support young carers and that work is done within educational settings to provide a flexible response to individual needs.","Blake-Holmes, K.; McGowan, A.","https://doi.org/10.1111/cfs.12877","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Child & Family Social Work; 27(1):22-29, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-25","",25863,""
"Navigating the COVID-19 pandemic in the contingency framework: Antecedents and consequences of publicâ€™s stance toward the CDC","This study applied the contingency theory of conflict management to examine how contingency factors influence the publicâ€™s perceptual and behavioral responses to COVID-19 and stance toward the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In particular, we tested political ideology as an important individual characteristic variable to examine its roles in the contingency theory framework. The findings revealed that two situational variables (i.e., threat appraisal and attitudes toward CDC) positively influenced the publicâ€™s contingency accommodation stance toward the CDC. Furthermore, greater conservatism was significantly associated with lower levels of threat appraisal and more negative attitudes toward the CDC, however it did not influence the stance toward the CDC. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings and directions for future research are discussed.","Lee, Hyunmin, Kim, Hyo Jung, Hong, Hyehyun","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pubrev.2022.102149","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Public Relations Review; 48(1):102149, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-25","",25864,""
"The Impacts of Psychological Distress on Life Satisfaction and Wellbeing of the Indian General Population During the First and Second Waves of COVID-19: A Comparative Study","The current study aims to understand the impact of psychological distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on life satisfaction and wellbeing, in the Indian context. The study also analyses the differences in these effects between the first and second waves of the pandemic. For this purpose, a survey was conducted during the two waves of the pandemic. Eight hundred eighty-four and 925 respondents participated in the first and second waves, respectively. The study showed that depression, anxiety, and stress negatively related to life satisfaction and wellbeing during both waves. The study also showed that the effects were stronger during the second wave compared to the first. Life satisfaction and wellbeing of women were found to be affected to a higher level than those of men, due to psychological distress. The study showed that a combined approach involving coping mechanisms and health care can help manage the psychological issues that arise with crisis situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Is the Global Pandemic Driving Me Crazy? The Relationship Between Personality Traits, Fear of Missing Out, and Social Media Fatigue During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Nigeria","Individ    ualsâ€™ psychological behaviors and fear of missing out are affected by the global pandemic. This study investigates how individual â€œBig Fiveâ€ personality traits influence fear of missing out leading to social media fatigue, the impact of social media fatigue on social media fatigue behavior during the COVID-19 lockdown. As a result, this study proposes and develops a model using the structural equation modelling for data obtained from young adults in the South-Western region of Nigeria. Results show the impact of openness, conscientiousness, and extraversion emotional instability was positively significant towards fear of missing out over the use of social media during COVID-19, whereas the effect of agreeableness and emotional stability were insignificant towards fear of missing out over the use of social media during COVID-19. In addition, the impact of the fear of missing out on social media fatigue influences social media fatigue behavior. Theoretical and managerial implications for â€œBig Fiveâ€ personality traits, fear of missing out, social media fatigue, and social media behaviors are provided.

"Distress, anxiety, and its correlates among caregivers of children with kidney diseases during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown","Background : The COVID-19 pandemic has generated a significant amount of psychological burden in the form of stress, anxiety, uncertainty, depression, anger, and helplessness. The caregivers of children with chronic diseases in particular are at a higher risk of mental stress and burden. Material and Methods : We conducted an online survey among caregivers of children with kidney diseases to assess the psychosocial impact of COVID-19. The psychosocial impact of COVID-19 pandemic on their mental health was assessed through standardized psychological scales (Peritraumatic Distress Inventory, Insomnia Severity Scale [ISI], Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale [DASS], and Positive and Negative Aspect Scale) and a semi-structured interview was conducted telephonically. Results : A total of 200 caregivers participated in the study. The mean age of the participants was 36Â±5.56 years, and 76% were males. Participants experienced maximum distress in terms of life threat (6.27Â±4.64), followed by helplessness and anger (2.66Â±1.65). Among participants, 38% of them exhibited significant distress. The majority scored below the cut-off on positive affect (98%), and thus could not experience positive emotions and interaction, and 37.5% of participants were feeling significant negative affect. On the ISI, 38.5% of participants experienced significant sleep problems. On the DASS, 65% of participants exhibited significant stress, 76% anxiety, and 78.5% depression. Conclusion : A high prevalence of stress, anxiety, and depression along with insomnia was detected among the caregivers of children with kidney diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sharma, Rajni, Jafra, Bikramjit Singh, Tiewsoh, Karalanglin, Kumar, Krishan, Kaur, Navpreet, Sharawat, Indar Kumar, Dawman, Lesa","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcped.2022.01.003","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Archives de PÃ©diatrie;2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-25","",25867,""

"Substance abuse and neurotransmission","The number of people who suffer from a substance abuse disorder has continued to rise over the last decade; particularly, the number of drug-related overdose deaths has sharply increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Converging lines of clinical observations, supported by imaging and neuropsychological performance testing, have demonstrated that substance abuse-induced dysregulation of neurotransmissions in the brain is critical for development and expression of the addictive properties of abused substances. Recent scientific advances have allowed for better understanding of the neurobiological processes that mediates drugs of abuse and addiction. This chapter presents the past classic concepts and the recent advances in our knowledge about how cocaine, amphetamines, opioids, alcohol, and nicotine alter multiple neurotransmitter systems, which contribute to the behaviors associated with each drug. Additionally, we discuss the interactive effects of HIV-1 or COVID-19 and substance abuse on neurotransmission and neurobiological pathways. Finally, we introduce therapeutic strategies for development of pharmacotherapies for substance abuse disorders.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.apha.2021.10.007","20220101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-25","",25871,""
