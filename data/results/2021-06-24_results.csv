"The mental health of NHS staff during the COVID-19 pandemic: a two-wave cohort study","Abstract: Background Health and social care workers(HSCWs) are at risk of experiencing adverse mental health (MH) outcomes (e.g., higher levels of anxiety and depression) as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This can have a detrimental impact on quality of care, the national response to the pandemic and its aftermath. Aims A longitudinal design provided follow-up evidence on the MH(changes in the prevalence of disease over time) of NHS staff working in a remote health board in Scotland during the COVID-19 pandemic and investigated the determinants of MH outcomes over time. Method A two-wave longitudinal study was conducted from July to September 2020. Participants self-reported levels of depression(PHQ-9), anxiety(GAD-7), and mental well-being(WEMWBS) at baseline and again 1.5 months later. Results The analytic sample of 169 participants, working in community(43%) and hospital(44%) settings reported substantial levels of probable clinical depression, anxiety and low mental well-being(MWB) at baseline(depression:30.8%, anxiety:20.1%, low-MWB:31.9%). Whilst the MH of participants remained mostly constant over time, the proportion of participants meeting the threshold for clinical anxiety increased to 27.2% at follow-up. Multivariable modelling indicated that working with, and disruption due to COVID-19 were associated with adverse MH changes over time. Conclusions HSCWs working in a remote area with low COVID-19 prevalence, reported similar levels of substantial anxiety and depression as those working in areas of the UK with high rates of COVID-19 infections. Efforts to support HSCW MH must remain a priority and should minimize the adverse effects of working with, and the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Johannes H.

"Safe in my heart: resting heart rate variability longitudinally predicts emotion regulation, worry and sense of safeness during COVID-19 lockdown","Due to its ability to reflect the capacity to engage in context-appropriate responses, tonic heart rate variability (HRV) is considered a putative biomarker of stress resilience. However, most studies are cross-sectional, precluding causal inferences. The high levels of uncertainty and fear at a global level that characterize the COVID-19 pandemic offer a unique opportunity to investigate the longitudinal role of HRV in stress resilience. The present study examined whether HRV, measured about 2 years earlier (Time 0), could predict emotion regulation strategies and daily affect in healthy adults during the May 2020 lockdown (Time 1). Moreover, we evaluated the association between HRV measures, emotion regulation strategies, subjective perception of COVID-19 risk, and self-reported depressive symptoms at Time 1. Higher tonic HRV at Time 0 resulted a significant predictor of a stronger engagement in more functional emotion regulation strategies, as well as of higher daily feelings of safeness and reduced daily worry at Time 1. Moreover, depressive symptoms negatively correlated with HRV and positively correlated with the subjective perception of COVID-19 risk at Time 1. Current data support the view that HRV might be not only a marker but also a precursor of resilience under stressful times.","Elena Makovac; Luca Carnevali; Sonia Hernandez-Medina; Andrea Sgoifo; Nicola Petrocchi; Cristina Ottaviani","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.17.21259071","20210623","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-24","",15291,""
"I will teach you here or there, I will try to teach you anywhere: perceived supports and barriers for emergency remote teaching during COVID-19 pandemic","Background: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many universities moved to emergency remote teaching (ERT). This allowed institutions to continue their instruction despite not being in person. However, ERT is not without consequences. For example, students may have inadequate technological supports, such as reliable internet and computers. Students may also have poor learning environments at home and may need to find added employment to support their families. Additionally, there were consequences to faculty. It has been shown that female instructors are more disproportionately impacted in terms of mental health issues and increased domestic labor. This research aims to investigate instructors' and students' perceptions of their transition to ERT. Specifically, we wanted to: 1. Identify supports and barriers during the transition to ERT; 2. Compare instructors experiences with the student experiences; 3. Explore these supports and barriers within the context of social presence, teaching presence, and/or cognitive presence during ERT as well as how these supports and barriers relate to scaffolding in emergency remote courses Design: Using grounded theory techniques, we applied two-cycle, qualitative analyses to assess the instructor transcripts. In first-cycle analysis, we used open coding to develop initial ideas from the data. We then used second cycle coding to generate categories with definitions and criteria agreed upon during discussion-based consensus building. Finally, these categories and descriptions were used to code student survey data. Analyses/Interpretations: Instructors identified twice as many barriers as supports in their teaching during the transition to ERT and identified casual and formal conversations with colleagues as valuable supports. Emerging categories for barriers consisted of academic integrity concerns as well as technological difficulties. Similarly, students identified more barriers than supports in their learning during the transition to ERT. More specifically, students described pre-existing course structure, classroom technology, and community as best supporting their learning. Barriers that challenged student learning included classroom environment, student availability, and student emotion and comfort. Contribution: Together, this research will help us understand supports and barriers to teaching and learning during the transition to ERT. This understanding can help us better plan and prepare for future emergencies, particularly at MSIs, where improved communication and increased access to resources for both students and instructors are key.","Cristie Donham; Hillary A Barron; Jourjina Alkhouri; Maya Changaran Kumarath; Wesley Alejandro; Erik Menke; Petra Kranzfelder","https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.21.449058","20210622","","bioRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-24","",15292,""
"Innovative preclinic triage system to guide Australians to the right mental health care first time","This paper presents a case study of an innovative direct-to-consumer preclinic triage system designed to reduce predicted peak demand for Australian mental health services as a result of COVID-19 and its associated socioeconomic consequences by guiding Australians to the right mental health care first time. Our innovative, digital health solution comprises two components: (1) a highly personalised and measurement-based model of care (Brain and Mind Centre model of care) that considers both the heterogeneity of mental disorders and other underlying comorbidities, as well as clinical staging; and (2) a health information technology (i.e. the InnoWell Platform). This digital health solution has been embedded as part of standard service delivery into a community-based intake service, thus resulting in a redesigned service model. The service model is currently being implemented as part of a pilot feasibility study, the marker of acceptability at the health professional and service level, and is now under active evaluation to determine its effect on outcomes for consumers, health professionals and the service. For the purposes of this paper, this model served as a prototype for the preclinic triage system that was conceptualised for national scalability at the primary health network level. When implemented at a national level, our direct-to-consumer preclinic triage system is expected to be an effective population health demand management strategy to address the rapidly emerging mental health demand crisis in Australia, and is aligned with the recent recommendation from the Productivity Commission to develop a sustainable national digital platform to facilitate the assessment and referral process to ensure access to mental health care matched to an individual's level of need.What is known about the topic?Although there is increased recognition of the mental health demand crisis in Australia as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, little has been done to 'flatten' the curve. The Australian Government committed additional funding to support the Better Access Pandemic Support measure; however, this approach to care fails to appreciate both the disparities in service availability across Australia and the gap fees that are prohibitive to some of those seeking help. Furthermore, the expansion of this program may only result in those in care remaining in care, thus further delaying access to those in need.What does this paper add?This paper describes a digital health solution, comprised of a highly personalised and measurement-based model of care coupled with a health information technology, that has been embedded as part of standard service delivery. Consumers seeking mental health care complete a multidimensional self-report assessment via the technology, the results of which are available in real-time and used to facilitate triage to pathways of care as indicated by the severity of the consumer's illness and level of need to more effectively and efficiently allocate consumers to care. The redesigned service model is now under active evaluation to determine its effects on outcomes at consumer, health professional and service levels.What are the implications for practitioners?The redesigned local service model served as a prototype for our innovative direct-to-consumer preclinic triage system specifically designed to allocate consumers to self-management, ambulatory care or acute care based on clinical stage and level of need. It is our hypothesis that the preclinic triage system will be an effective population health demand management strategy. Importantly, the proposed preclinic triage system aligns with the recent recommendation from the Productivity Commission for the Australian Government to fund the development and sustained implementation of a digital platform to facilitate assessment and referral to evidence-based interventions matched to a consumer's level of need.","Davenport, LaMonica, Rowe, Sturgess, Scott, Lee, Cheng, Hickie","https://doi.org/10.1071/AH20233","20210623","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-24","",15293,""
"It","ObjectiveMindStepÃ¢â€žÂ¢ is an Australian low-intensity cognitive behaviour therapy (LICBT) program for individuals with mild-to-moderate symptoms of anxiety and depression. UK-produced LICBT guided self-help (GSH) materials were originally used in the MindStepÃ¢â€žÂ¢ program. In 2017, Australian LICBT GSH materials were developed to better suit Australian users. This study explored whether the Australian-produced materials continued to achieve the benchmark recovery rates established in the UK and maintained in recent Australian studies.MethodsBinomial logistic regression was conducted using retrospective client data, including the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale, between 2016 and 2019.ResultsDuring time periods in which the Australian-produced materials were used, equivalent rates of reliable recovery and improvement were achieved compared with time periods in which the UK-produced materials were used. Australian-trained LICBT coaches, using Australian-produced LICBT GSH materials, achieve client recovery rates of up to 60%, reliable improvement rates of 58% and reliable recovery rates of 46% (with the probability of recovery increasing with client age).ConclusionsThese findings are particularly pertinent with COVID-19 changing the landscape of mental health service delivery, requiring greater flexibility in the use of teleservices to ensure access to effective mental health care for populations that may already experience problems with isolation, access and service engagement.What is known about the topic?LICBT is an acceptable, feasible and effective treatment approach for people experiencing mild-to-moderate anxiety and depression in Australia. LICBT GSH materials used with clients in Australia originated from the UK. However, according to guidelines, LICBT GSH materials should be contextualised to suit the audience they are being used with.What does this paper add?This paper demonstrates that LICBT GSH materials tailored to an Australian context can be used in place of UK-produced materials because they yield equivalent and consistent therapeutic outcomes. Although contextualising the LICBT GSH materials for health services users was important, it is likely that the evidence-based cognitive behaviour therapy techniques sitting 'under the hood' of these materials are most important to ensure successful therapeutic outcomes.What are the implications for practitioners?As we face unprecedented challenges following 2020, the physical, social, psychological and economic impacts of life-changing events must not inhibit access to treatments for common mental health conditions. It is anticipated that more non-traditional, alternative providers of mental health services will be needed to scale-up and respond to increasing demand. This paper shows that the provision of telephone-based LICBT in Australia, by trained coaches using Australian-produced GSH materials, is an evidenced-based support pathway that can reduce the access gap to treatments.","Venning, Oswald, Barnes, Glover, Lawn, Azadi, Tepper, Redpath","https://doi.org/10.1071/AH20307","20210623","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-24","",15294,""
"Loneliness and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in older breast cancer survivors and noncancer controls","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had wide-ranging health effects and increased isolation. Older with cancer patients might be especially vulnerable to loneliness and poor mental health during the pandemic. The authors included active participants enrolled in the longitudinal Thinking and Living With Cancer study of nonmetastatic breast cancer survivors aged 60 to 89 years (n = 262) and matched controls (n = 165) from 5 US regions. Participants completed questionnaires at parent study enrollment and then annually, including a web-based or telephone COVID-19 survey, between May 27 and September 11, 2020. Mixed-effects models were used to examine changes in loneliness (a single item on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression [CES-D] scale) from before to during the pandemic in survivors versus controls and to test survivor-control differences in the associations between changes in loneliness and changes in mental health, including depression (CES-D, excluding the loneliness item), anxiety (the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), and perceived stress (the Perceived Stress Scale). Models were adjusted for age, race, county COVID-19 death rates, and time between assessments. Loneliness increased from before to during the pandemic (0.211; P = .001), with no survivor-control differences. Increased loneliness was associated with worsening depression (3.958; P &lt; .001) and anxiety (3.242; P &lt; .001) symptoms and higher stress (1.172; P &lt; .001) during the pandemic, also with no survivor-control differences. Cancer survivors reported changes in loneliness and mental health similar to those reported by women without cancer. However, both groups reported increased loneliness from before to during the pandemic that was related to worsening mental health, suggesting that screening for loneliness during medical care interactions will be important for identifying all older women at risk for adverse mental health effects of the pandemic.","Rentscher, Zhao, Small, Cohen, Dilawari, Patel, Bethea, Van Dyk, Nakamura, Ahn, Zhai, Ahles, Jim, McDonald, Saykin, Root, Graham, Carroll, Mandelblatt","https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.33687","20210623","anxiety; breast cancer; cancer survivorship; coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); depression; loneliness; older adults; psychological stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-24","",15295,""
"Are older adults of Rohingya community (Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals or FDMNs) in Bangladesh fearful of COVID-19? Findings from a cross-sectional study","This study aimed to assess the fear of COVID-19 and its associates among older Rohingya (Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals or FDMNs) in Bangladesh. We conducted a cross-sectional survey among 416 older FDMNs aged 60 years and above living in camps of Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect information on participants' socio-demographic and lifestyle characteristics, pre-existing non-communicable chronic conditions, and COVID-19 related information. Level of fear was measured using the seven-item Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) with the cumulative score ranged from 7 to 35. A multiple linear regression examined the factors associated with fear. Among 416 participants aged 60 years or above, the mean fear score was 14.8 (range 8-28) and 88.9% of the participants had low fear score. Participants who were concerned about COVID-19 (ÃŽÂ²: 0.63, 95% CI: -0.26 to 1.53) and overwhelmed by COVID-19 (ÃŽÂ²: 3.54, 95% CI: 2.54 to 4.55) were significantly more likely to be fearful of COVID-19. Other factors significantly associated with higher level of fear were lesser frequency of communication during COVID-19, difficulty in obtaining food during COVID-19, perception that older adults are at highest risk of COVID-19 and receiving COVID-19 related information from Radio/television and friends/family/neighbours. Our study highlighted that currently there little fear of COVID-19 among the older Rohingya FDMNs. This is probably due to lack of awareness of the severity of the disease in. Dissemination of public health information relevant to COVID-19 and provision of mental health services should be intensified particularly focusing on the individual who were concerned, overwhelmed or fearful of COVID-19. However, further qualitative research is advised to find out the reasons behind this.","Mistry, Ali, Akther, Peprah, Reza, Prova, Yadav","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253648","20210623","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-24","",15296,""
"Knowledge and Practice Related to COVID-19 and Mental Health among Adults in Sub-Saharan Africa","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a public health emergency affecting the lives of millions of people globally. Different measures and extraordinary steps are being taken to contain the transmission of the virus. The levels of knowledge and implementation of preventive practices related to COVID-19 in sub-Saharan African countries are unclear. Additionally, there is a lack of evidence regarding the impacts of the pandemic on mental health. This study aimed to describe knowledge and practices related to COVID-19 and to assess mental health status among adults in three sub-Saharan African countries: Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, and Nigeria. A total of 1,797 adults were included in the survey, and data were collected using computer-assisted telephone interviews. The proportions of adults who identified more than 80% of COVID-19 symptoms, transmission methods, and prevention mechanisms were 69.9%, 79.2%, and 90.7%, respectively. The practice of preventive measures was relatively lower for avoiding social gatherings and disinfecting contaminated surfaces. Better education, urban residence, and believing the pandemic is real were factors associated with good knowledge on COVID-19 symptoms, transmission methods, and preventive actions. Additionally, being male was associated with good knowledge on symptoms and transmission methods, whereas being in an older age group was associated with knowledge of transmission methods. Mild, moderate, and severe psychological distress was reported by 20.6%, 5.9%, and 1.1% of the participants, respectively. Although this study found high levels of knowledge regarding COVID-19, interventions are needed to increase the uptake of recommended preventive practices among adults in sub-Saharan Africa.","Workneh, Wang, Millogo, Worku, Chukwu, Lankoande, Assefa, Hemler, Korte, Soura, Oduola, Sie, Fawzi, Berhane","https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.21-0219","20210623","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-24","",15297,""
"Design and Field Methods of the ARISE Network COVID-19 Rapid Monitoring Survey","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has significant health and economic ramifications across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Data regarding its far-reaching impacts are severely lacking, thereby hindering the development of evidence-based strategies to mitigate its direct and indirect health consequences. To address this need, the Africa Research, Implementation Science, and Education (ARISE) Network established a mobile survey platform in SSA to generate longitudinal data regarding knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) related to COVID-19 prevention and management and to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on health and socioeconomic domains. We conducted a baseline survey of 900 healthcare workers, 1,795 adolescents 10 to 19 years of age, and 1,797 adults 20 years or older at six urban and rural sites in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, and Nigeria. Households were selected using sampling frames of existing Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems or national surveys when possible. Healthcare providers in urban areas were sampled using lists from professional associations. Data were collected through computer-assisted telephone interviews from July to November 2020. Consenting participants responded to surveys assessing KAP and the impact of the pandemic on nutrition, food security, healthcare access and utilization, lifestyle, and mental health. We found that mobile telephone surveys can be a rapid and reliable strategy for data collection during emergencies, but challenges exist with response rates. Maintaining accurate databases of telephone numbers and conducting brief baseline in-person visits can improve response rates. The challenges and lessons learned from this effort can inform future survey efforts during COVID-19 and other emergencies, as well as remote data collection in SSA in general.","Hemler, Korte, Lankoande, Millogo, Assefa, Chukwu, Workneh, Tinkasimile, Lyatuu, Soura, Wang, Madzorera, Vuai, BÃƒÂ¤rnighausen, Sando, Killewo, Oduola, Sie, Berhane, Fawzi","https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.20-1618","20210623","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-24","",15298,""
"COVID-19 Knowledge, Perception, Preventive Measures, Stigma, and Mental Health Among Healthcare Workers in Three Sub-Saharan African Countries: A Phone Survey","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an unprecedented public health crisis globally. Understanding healthcare providers' (HCPs') knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19 is crucial to identifying effective strategies to improve their ability to respond to the pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa. A phone-based survey of 900 HCPs in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, and Nigeria (300 per country) was conducted to assess knowledge, perceptions, COVID-19 prevention measures, stigma, and mental health of HCPs. Modified Poisson regression models were used to evaluate predictors of knowledge, perceptions, and prevention measures; adjusted risk ratios (ARRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Three-fourths of the HCPs had adequate knowledge, and over half had correct perceptions of risk and high levels of self-reported prevention measures. The majority of the HCPs (73.7%) reported self-perceived social stigma. There was relatively low prevalence of depression (6.6%), anxiety (6.6%), or psychological distress (18%). Compared with doctors, being a nurse was associated with lower levels of knowledge (ARR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.77-0.90) and was also negatively associated with having correct perceptions toward COVID-19 (AOR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.73-0.92). HCPs treating COVID-19 patients had higher likelihood of having high levels of prevention measures (AOR: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.23-1.53). Despite high levels of knowledge among HCPs in sub-Saharan Africa, there is a need to improve COVID-19 perceptions and compliance with prevention measures as well as address social stigma toward HCPs to better ensure their safety and prepare them to deliver health services.","Assefa, Soura, Hemler, Korte, Wang, Abdullahi, Lankoande, Millogo, Chukwu, Workneh, Sie, Berhane, Baernighausen, Oduola, Fawzi","https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.20-1621","20210623","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-24","",15299,""
"Transfer of face-to-face group therapies into online group-chats in a psychiatric outpatient setting during the COVID-19 pandemic","At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, several mental health care providers were obliged to shut down outpatient services, including group therapies and psychoeducational sessions. The lockdown in many countries is a serious threat for mental well-being, especially for individuals with severe mental illnesses. Discontinued outpatient treatments and a disruption of daily routines are considered to be a risk factor for destabilization of mentally ill patients. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the acceptability, usability, and feasibility of a group-chat program to replace cancelled face-to-face (f2f) group sessions in an outpatient psychiatric department. Participants (n = 33) were recruited in the outpatient department of a large university medical center in Leipzig, Germany. Former f2f group participants were invited to take part in a therapist-guided group-chat for four weeks (eight sessions) and were asked to evaluate the program via self-administered standardized questionnaires at baseline (T0, pre-intervention), after every chat session (T1), and post-treatment (T2, after 4-6 weeks). The chat groups were specific to the following mental disorder diagnoses and based on the same therapeutic principles and techniques as the former f2f groups: anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Sociodemographic measures, attitudes towards the COVID-19 pandemic, depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF), treatment credibility/expectancy (CEQ), and participants' satisfaction (ZUF-8) were measured. Participants joined an average of 5.0 out of eight offered chat sessions. Participation rates in the respective groups were highest in the ADHD group (78.2%) and lowest in the anxiety group (41.1%). The overall pre-intervention level of depressive symptoms was moderate and showed a slight, non-significant improvement at post-treatment (T0: M = 10.7, SD = 5.5; T2: M = 10.2, SD = 5.5). A similar result was observed regarding quality of life (T0: Median = 41.7 - 68.8; T2: Median = 50.0 - 70.3). Treatment credibility and expectancy scores were medium high (T0: Mcredibility = 18.1, SD = 3.8; Mexpectancy = 11.2, SD = 5.1; T2: Mcredibility = 17.1, SD = 4.8; Mexpectancy = 10.3, SD = 5.8). Further, significant correlations were detected between post-treatment expectancy score and post-treatment PHQ-9 score (r = -0.41; p = .024), post-treatment physical quality of life (r = 0.54; p = .001) and post-treatment psychological quality of life (r = 0.53; p = .002). Overall, participants' satisfaction with the program was very high, both after chat sessions and at post-treatment (ZUF-8: M = 20.6, SD = 1.0). Of all participants, a majority (87.1%) rated the program as excellent/good and would recommend the group-chat program to a friend in need of similar help (83.9%). A therapist-guided group-chat program to substitute outpatient group-setting treatment during the COVID-19 lockdown was shown to be feasible, usable, and highly acceptable for participants. Online programs, such as this one, provide an easy to implement tool to successfully stabilize participants during a difficult pandemic time.

"Mental health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic: stress vulnerability, resilience and mood disturbances in fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis","The COVID-19 pandemic severely increased the stress levels in the population. The aim of present study was to investigate the impact of the lockdown measures on emotional well-being and disease activity in patients with fibromyalgia (FM) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) through a telemedicine approach. An on-line survey, including demographic characteristics, disease-activity and psychometric scales (Stress-related Vulnerability Scale, Resiliency scale), Zung Anxiety and Depression Self-assessment Scale), was anonymously administered to FM, RA and healthy controls (HC). Disease activities were compared to the pre-lockdown cohort referring to our centre. Levels of anxiety and depression worthy of psychiatric attention were documented in 36.7% of FM, 14.6% of RA, 12.5% of HC and in 50% of FM, 17.1% of RA, 15% of HC, respectively. HC featured the highest stress scores, followed FM and then RA. RA showed higher resiliency than FM. Both anxiety and depression scores were significantly higher in FM than RA and HC. Disease severity was higher in RA patients and lower in FM patients when compared to the respective historical cohorts. Lockdown significantly affected emotional well-being and disease activity of patients suffering from rheumatic diseases.

"Renewed call for lifestyle interventions to address obesity among individuals with serious mental illness in the COVID-19 era and beyond","Behavioral health has the opportunity to lead the way in using lifestyle interventions to address obesity and health disparities in people with serious mental illness (SMI) in the COVID-19 era. Evidence-based interventions for weight loss in individuals with SMI exist, and the field has developed strategies for implementing these interventions in real-world mental health care settings. In addition to promoting weight loss, lifestyle interventions have the potential to address social isolation and loneliness and other patient-centered outcomes among individuals with SMI, which will be especially valuable for mitigating the growing concerns about loneliness attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions on in-person encounters. In this commentary, we discuss practice, policy, and research implications related to using evidence-based lifestyle interventions for individuals with SMI during the COVID-19 pandemic and sustaining these programs in the long-term.","Aschbrenner, Naslund, Reed, Fetter","https://doi.org/10.1093/tbm/ibab076","20210623","COVID-19 pandemic; Health promotion; Implementation; Obesity; Serious mental illness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-24","",15302,""
"A STUDY OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY LEVELS AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN YOUNG ADULTS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","The aim: To investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the level of physical activity and quality of life in young adults. Materials and methods: A survey of 327 young people aged 18-25 years was conducted; the SF-36 (Medical Outcomes Study-Short Form) questionnaire was used to determine the quality of life; a questionnaire taking into account the WHO Global Recommendations on Physical Activity for Health in order to determine the level of physical activity was applied. Results: Young adults men 88 (27%) and 239 women (73%), mean age 21.4Ã‚Â±1.8 y.o., the survey showed that 52% of those studied did not engage in physical activity at all, 28% had insufficient physical activity, only 20% had an adequate level of physical activity. There was a decrease in all quality of life indicators during the pandemic period compared to the previous period, especially the physical role functioning indicator (p = 0.0002), general health (p = 0.0004), emotional role functioning indicator (p = 0.0001) and mental health indicator (p = 0.0004). Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the quality of life and physical activity levels of young adults and most of this is due to the restrictive measures of the pandemic.","Ovdii, Solomakha, Yasynetskyi, Ponomarenko, Rydzel","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+STUDY+OF+PHYSICAL+ACTIVITY+LEVELS+AND+QUALITY+OF+LIFE+IN+YOUNG+ADULTS+DURING+THE+COVID-19+PANDEMIC.","20210623"," COVID-19 pandemic;  physical activity;  quality of life;  young adults ","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-24","",15303,""
"FEATURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPERIENCES IN SEVERE QUARANTINE DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: THE ROLE OF TOLERANCE FOR UNCERTAINTY","The aim: To examine the features of experiences during quarantine relating to the tolerance for uncertainty. Materials and methods: 306 volunteers aged 18-65 years participated in this study. All participants were tested during strict quarantine in April 2020. In order to diagnose the personality traits related to ambiguity tolerance, we used Budner's scale of tolerance-intolerance of ambiguity. To determine the features of experiences we used the survey, which included 40 statements and 12 emotional states related to the cognitive, emotional-evaluative, and behavioral components of the person's self-image. Results: The overwhelming majority of volunteers perceive the pandemic as a dangerous, threatening, uncertain situation and make hasty decisions on the base of polar judgments, react with anxiety, attempt to avoid uncertainty, rejection of everything unusual. Their experiences were filled with feelings of powerlessness and deterioration in mood. For the majority of our subjects, the situation of uncertainty is the source of intolerance. Negative consequences appeared in the behavior (loss of time management skills, laziness). There are direct relationships between the factor of shock and anxiety with the sources of intolerance, novelty and complexity, and general intolerance. The cognitive component of the experience was the least pronounced and involved only after an emotional experience. Conclusions: It has been established that cognitive rethinking of the self-isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic is possible after an emotional response and leads to a change in the behavioral stereotypes.","Pogorilska, Synelnykov, Palamar, Tukaiev, Nezhyva","https://www.google.com/search?q=FEATURES+OF+PSYCHOLOGICAL+EXPERIENCES+IN+SEVERE+QUARANTINE+DURING+THE+COVID-19+PANDEMIC:+THE+ROLE+OF+TOLERANCE+FOR+UNCERTAINTY.","20210623"," COVID-19 pandemic;  behavior;  coping strategies;  tolerance-intolerance of ambiguity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-24","",15304,""
"Face-to-face versus Video Teleconference Group Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Anxiety and Related Disorders: A Preliminary Comparison: ThÃƒÂ©rapie cognitivo-comportementale de groupe en personne contre par vidÃƒÂ©o tÃƒÂ©lÃƒÂ©confÃƒÂ©rence pour l'anxiÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© et les troubles connexes: une comparaison prÃƒÂ©liminaire","Telehealth is being increasingly incorporated into the delivery of mental health care and has received widespread attention during the COVID-19 pandemic for its ability to facilitate care during physical distancing restrictions. Videoconferencing is a common telehealth modality for delivering psychotherapy and has demonstrated similar outcomes to those of face-to-face therapy. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is the most common psychotherapy evaluated across various telehealth modalities; however, studies on CBT delivered via videoconference, particularly in a group therapy format, are lacking. Further, little research exists on videoconference group CBT for anxiety disorders. Accordingly, the present study compared the outcomes of group CBT for anxiety and related disorders delivered via videoconference versus face-to-face. Using a non-randomized design, data on attendance, dropout, clinical outcomes, and functional impairment were collected from 413 adult outpatients of a tertiary care anxiety disorders clinic who attended a CBT group for panic disorder/agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), or obsessive-compulsive disorder delivered either face-to-face (pre-COVID-19 pandemic) or via videoconference (since the onset of COVID-19 pandemic). Outcomes were assessed using well-validated self-report measures. Data were collected pre-treatment, across 12 weekly sessions, and post-treatment. Intent-to-treat analyses were applied to symptom outcome measures. Face-to-face CBT conferred only a slight benefit over videoconference CBT for symptom outcomes across all groups, but when assessed individually, only the GAD group showed greater symptom improvement in the face-to-face format. Effect sizes for significant differences between the delivery formats were small. Participants in videoconference groups tended to have slightly higher attendance rates in some instances, whereas functional improvement and treatment dropout were comparable across the delivery formats. Results provide preliminary evidence that videoconference group CBT for anxiety and related disorders may be a promising and effective alternative to face-to-face CBT. Additional research is needed to establish equivalence between these delivery formats.","Milosevic, Cameron, Milanovic, McCabe, Rowa","https://doi.org/10.1177/07067437211027319","20210623","agoraphobia; anxiety disorders; cognitive behavioural therapy; generalized anxiety disorder; group psychotherapy; obsessive-compulsive disorder; panic disorder; social phobia; telemedicine; videoconferencing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-24","",15305,""
"Changes in dream features across the first and second waves of the Covid-19 pandemic","Research during the Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted its significant impact on dreaming. Here we address changes in dream features both during the first wave, when the Italian government imposed a total lockdown, and the second wave (autumn 2020), when a partial lockdown was effected. In April 2020 (total lockdown), 1,622 participants (M<sub>age</sub> Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 34.1Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 13.6Ã¢â‚¬â€¦years; 1171F) completed an online survey including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and a set of questions on dream features and their possible changes relative to the month preceding the lockdown (pre-total lockdown). In November 2020 (partial lockdown), 214 participants (M<sub>age</sub> Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 36.78Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 14.2Ã‚Â years; 159F) from the previous sample completed the same survey. Approximately half of the subjects reported increased or decreased dream frequency (30.5% and 21.8%), length (27.1% and 15.8%) and vividness (31.5% and 17.1%) during total lockdown as well as during partial lockdown (frequency: 30.3% and 13.5%; length: 23.3% and 12.6%; vividness: 31.6% and 24.1%). Dream affect became significantly more negative in total lockdown relative to pre-total lockdown and in partial lockdown relative to pre-partial lockdown (both pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001). Both in total lockdown and partial lockdown, increased negative dream emotionality significantly predicted changes in dream frequency, length and vividness, and was significantly predicted, in turn, by worsened sleep quality. Our data confirm that dream features are significantly affected by major life changes such as those imposed by a pandemic. The fact that between lockdowns negative dream affect returned almost to baseline level suggests that dream emotionality is closely related to lifestyle and wake-time emotional changes. Also, our findings point to a modulating role of sleep quality on dream emotionality.","Conte, Rescott, De Rosa, Cellini, Coppola, Cerasuolo, Malloggi, Giganti, Ficca","https://doi.org/10.1111/jsr.13425","20210623","Covid-19 pandemic; dream affect; dream length; dream recall frequency; dream vividness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-24","",15306,""
"The impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on gastroenterologists in Southeast Asia: a mixed-methods study","The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has impacted gastroenterology practices worldwide, however, its protracted effects within Southeast Asia were unknown. The primary aim of the study was to determine the impact of the pandemic on clinical demands including burnout among gastroenterologists within the region. The secondary aim was to identify risk factors for burnout and determine regional stressors. This was a mixed-methods study. Gastroenterologists were surveyed electronically between 1 September to 7 December 2020 via gastroenterology and endoscopy societies of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected. The 22-item Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI-HSS) was used to detect burnout. Quantitative data were non-parametric; non-parametric methods were used for statistical comparisons. Logistic regression was used to determine risk factors for burnout. Content analysis method was used to analyze qualitative data. Ethical approval was obtained. 73.0% reported that they were still significantly affected by the pandemic. Of these, 40.5% reported increased workload and 59.5% decreased workload. Statistically significant differences in weekly working hours, endoscopy, and inpatient volumes were present. No differences were observed in outpatient volumes, likely because of telemedicine. Burnout was common however 50.1% of gastroenterologists were unaware of or did not have access to mental health support. This, as well as depression, being a trainee, and public sector work increased burnout risk significantly. The effects of the pandemic are multi-faceted and burnout is common amongst Southeast Asian gastroenterologists. Safeguards for mental health are sub-optimal and improvements are urgently needed.","Ong, Ong, Ong, Xin, Lee, Pausawasdi, De Lusong, Makmun, Chong, Ho, Lim, Ong, Dan, Khor","https://doi.org/10.1111/jgh.15594","20210623","COVID-19; Gastroenterology; burnout; gastroenterologists; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-24","",15307,""
"The psychological impact on patients with memory disorders and their caregivers during COVID-19","COVID-19 is erupting globally. Mass quarantine had been implemented all around China which could influence the psychological status of patients with memory disorders and their caregivers. To investigate the psychological impact of mass quarantine on patients with memory disorders and their caregivers in China. We completed a cross-sectionalÃ‚Â study in 787 patients and their caregivers registered from 2010 to 2019 in Memory Clinic, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, by telephone interviews. The performance in neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs), sleep, nutrition, chronic diseases of patients, and the burden of care, anxiety and depression of caregivers was assessed by six assessment scales (MNA-SF, PSQI, NPI, RSS, PHQ-9 and GAD-7). Only 68 (8.6%) patients worried about the outbreak of COVID-19. The prevalence of NPSs among all subjects was nearly 60.0%. Approximately 50.0% of the caregivers reported distress. More than 70.0% of patients remained stable in NPSs. However, anxiety, depression, aberrant motor disorder and delusion were exacerbated (22.9%, 18.6%, 17.1% and 16.8%, respectively). Appetite and eating disorder led alleviation rate by 25.8% while disappearing rate of agitation led by 5.8%. 7.5% of caregivers manifested depressive symptoms while 4.9% expressed anxiety symptoms, and 40.8% showed care burden.

"Longitudinal study on prenatal depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic","Several studies have reported the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic context on mental health. Given that pregnant women constitute a vulnerable group, they may be at greater risk for developing psychopathological symptoms due to the confinement. The current study aimed to longitudinally analyze the presence and evolution of indicators of depression and anxiety in pregnant and non-pregnant women, and to identify the differential effects of social isolation or distancing measures on these groups. Participants were 105 pregnant and 105 non-pregnant Argentine adult women. They completed the Beck Depression Inventory-II, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and closed-ended questions on sociodemographic factors, at four different times. Results showed a progressive increase in anxiety and depressive symptoms in the first 50Ã‚Â days of confinement in both groups, and a slight decrease after approximately 150Ã‚Â days. Pregnant women presented a more pronounced initial increase in symptoms, and a weaker decrease at the last wave, compared to the non-pregnant. Results suggest that the pandemic context produces a moderate negative early response and that the initial flexibilizations of sanitary measures (50Ã‚Â days) did not slow down the progression of symptoms (even less in pregnant women). In conclusion, being pregnant could be an extra risk factor for the development of psychopathological symptoms during this pandemic. The particular vulnerability of pregnant women and the associated potential negative effects both on them and on their offspring underline the importance of perinatal health policies aimed at prevention and treatment of possible future consequences.","LÃƒÂ³pez-Morales, Del-Valle, AndrÃƒÂ©s, Gelpi Trudo, Canet-Juric, Urquijo","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00737-021-01152-1","20210623","Lockdown; Pregnancy; Prenatal anxiety; Prenatal depression; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-24","",15309,""

"Psycho-oncology service provisions for hospitalised cancer patients before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in an oncology centre in eastern India","Addressing the mental health needs of cancer patients and their caregivers improves the quality of care the patient receives in any cancer care ecosystem. International practice currently encourages integrated care for physical and mental health in oncology. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the delivery of healthcare services across the world. The current research paper is on the psycho-oncology service provision for hospitalised cancer patients before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. All patients who were referred to psycho-oncology services during the study period of 1 month, in the two successive years of 2019 and 2020, were included in the study. Retrospective data were collected from the centralised electronic medical records for patients. Data included cancer diagnosis, reason for admission, admitting team and reason for a psychiatric referral. Other parameters that were measured were the timing of the psychiatric assessment, psychiatric diagnosis and psycho-oncology care provided, which included psychological interventions carried out and medications prescribed. The overall institutional data on cancer care provision are also presented in brief to provide context to the psycho-oncology services. Integrated psycho-oncology services reviewed and managed patients round the year in the hospital where the study was conducted. During the 1-month study period, in 2019 and 2020, the total number of hospitalised cancer patients managed by the services was 74 and 52, respectively. During the study period of 2020, 292 patients with cancer who were being treated in the hospital had tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) tested on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and 50 members of healthcare staff also tested positive. The most common diagnosis of patients was found to be stress-related adjustment disorder [16/74 (21.6%) in 2019 and 16/52 (30.8%) in 2020]. The paper discusses the common stressors voiced by the patients and their caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several challenges of providing psychological services were overcome by the team and the paper touches upon the common strategies that were used during the pandemic. Most patients did not need medications, but a significant minority did benefit from treatment with psychotropic medications. Simple psychological interventions such as sleep hygiene, supportive therapy sessions and psycho-education benefited many patients and were feasible even during the pandemic. The provision of psycho-oncology services to cancer patients and their caregivers was important before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.Watch a video which illustrates the psycho-oncology service provisions in an oncology centre in Eastern India during the COVID-19 pandemic here: https://ecancer.org/en/video/9707-psycho-oncology-service-provisions-for-hospitalised-cancer-patients-before-and-during-the-covid19-pandemic.","Mukherjee, Chatterjee, Chattopadhyay, Bhowmick, Basu, Bhattacharjee, Ghose, Datta","https://doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2021.1226","20210623","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; cancer; oncology; psychiatry; psycho-oncology; psychological support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-24","",15311,""

"Exploring cyberchondria and its associations in dental students amid COVID-19 infodemic","Adverse psychological effect of pandemic includes not only increased levels of stress, anxiety, and depression but also cyberchondria - the problematic online health research behavior. It is thought that the distress and uncertainty of pandemic clubbed with information overload and its ambiguity have paved the way for cyberchondria. Students being the vulnerable population, the present study was an effort at understanding cyberchondria in students. The aim of the study is to assess cyberchondria and its association with depression, anxiety, stress, and quality of life (QOL) in dental students during the pandemic. An online questionnaire-based survey was carried out on dental students. The survey tool comprised a semi-structured pro forma, General Health Questionnaire-12, Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale 21, Cyberchondria Severity Scale 15, and European Health Interview Survey QOL 8. The study revealed that 98.7% of the students were affected by one of the constructs of cyberchondria, viz., &quot;excessiveness&quot; (93.7%), followed by &quot;distress&quot; (84.3%) and &quot;reassurance&quot;-seeking behavior (83.7%). Cyberchondria affected girls more than boys and shared robust positive correlation with depression, anxiety, and stress but not QOL. Factors such as stress, anxiety, QOL, and changes in appetite were associated with higher severity of depression. Family financial losses, preexisting psychiatric illness, and media adverse effect shared robust positive associations with severity of depression, anxiety, and stress and an inverse association with QOL. 76.0% of the students expressed excessive worries regarding missing out on clinical exposure, and nearly half of the students were dissatisfied with eLearning. 78.3% of the students experienced changes in sleep; 68.7% had changes in appetite; and 89.0% reported reduction in the level of physical activity. Cyberchondria is affecting the large majority of students.

"Student support systems for undergraduate medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic narrative review of the literature","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has boosted medical students' vulnerability to various problems. Given the stressful nature of medical disciplines, considerable attention must be paid to student support systems during pandemics. This study aimed to review the current literature regarding medical student support systems systematically. We performed a systematic review of six databases and grey literature sources in addition to a hand search in the references of the articles on April 5, 2021. We included all studies about support for undergraduate medical students delivered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In conducting this review, we used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. A total of 3646 articles were retrieved from the databases, and 16 additional papers were extracted from other sources. After removing duplicates, we screened 2434 titles and abstracts according to our criteria. Among them, 32 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Ultimately, 10 studies were included for review. We identified two major themes: (a) academic support and (b) mental health support. All of the included studies utilized online methods whether for transitioning from previous support systems or developing novel approaches. Students and faculty members seemed to be receptive to these new systems. Despite indicating outstanding program outcomes, most studies merely described the positive effects of the program rather than providing a precise evaluation. There are several methods of supporting medical students who are experiencing unprecedented changes in their educational trajectory. Due to substantial differences in undergraduate medical education in different regions of the world, cultural and contextual-oriented support is indispensable for developing a safe learning environment. Future research should investigate the question of the extent to which online support can supersede in-person strategies.","Ardekani, Hosseini, Tabari, Rahimian, Feili, Amini, Mani","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-021-02791-9","20210623","COVID-19; Medical education; Medical students; Mentoring; Mentors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-24","",15317,""
"Stress levels among an international sample of pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic","Stress is a complex condition that can have a profound effect on an individual's sense of wellbeing and their ability to live a happy and healthy life. COVID-19 and its associated stressors have the potential to disrupt numerous facets of our everyday lives. Pregnant and postpartum women are especially vulnerable to changes in the availability of routine health and social care services and of their support networks. The current study sought to explore stress levels and their influencers among an international cohort of pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted an anonymous, online, cross-sectional survey in 64 countries between May and June 2020. The survey was hosted on the Pregistry platform and made available in 12 languages, with respondents sought through a variety of social media platforms and parenting forums. In addition to levels of stress, we collected data related to demographics, COVID-19 exposure and worries, lifestyle changes, traditional and social media use, precautionary measures related to COVID-19, and mental health. In total, 7185 women were included in our sample. We found statistically significant (<i>p</i>-value &lt;0.05) reductions in stress score among older women (Ã¢â€°Â¥35Ã¢â‚¬â€°years of age), those either living with a partner or married, those who had graduated from college, and those with medical coverage. Higher stress scores were found among women who resided in Africa, Asia and the Pacific, the Middle East, and North America compared with those in Europe. When race and ethnicity were included in the model, black women were found to have higher stress compared to white women. Level of family and community support was inversely associated with level of stress. Our study is one of the first to explore stress levels among pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found statistically significant differences in stress levels by age, education, marital status, region of residence, race/ethnicity and level of support. Understanding stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, and exploring ways to address it, will be key to contributing to the mental and physical health of expectant and new mothers, as well as their children, in both the short and long term.","Wyszynski, Hernandez-Diaz, Gordon-Dseagu, Ramiro, Koenen","https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2021.1936489","20210623","COVID-19; postpartum; pregnancy; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-24","",15318,""
"Predictors of mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in older adults: the role of socio-demographic variables and COVID-19 anxiety","The objective of this study was to evaluate factors related to the mental health of Peruvian older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study had a cross-sectional and observational design. A total of 274 older adults in Lima, Peru (M<sub>age</sub>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 67.86) filled out a sociodemographic survey, the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, Mental Health Inventory-5, Patient Health Questionnaire-2 item, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale. A Structural Equation Model (SEM) was estimated to test an a priori model that relates the sociodemographic variables, COVID-19 Anxiety, psychological well-being, anxiety and depression. The model fit indices indicated a good fit to the data. The socio-demographic variables explained 23.8% of the variance of the COVID-19 Anxiety (R<sup>2</sup>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â .238). Socio-demographic variables explained 50.5% of psychological well-being variance, 52% of anxiety and 46.9% of depression. Also, sex, work; being diagnosed with COVID-19; family member with COVID-19 diagnosis; and time of exposure to COVID-19 information had statistically significant effects psychological well-being, anxiety and depression. In conclusion, some sociodemographic characteristics and COVID-19 anxiety affect the psychological well-being, anxiety and depression. The findings may allow for a better understanding of the mental health of older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic and guide government responses to detect, anticipate and minimize its impact on the mental health of this population.","Caycho-RodrÃƒÂ­guez, TomÃƒÂ¡s, Vilca, GarcÃƒÂ­a, Rojas-Jara, White, PeÃƒÂ±a-Calero","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2021.1944655","20210623","Covid-19 anxiety; mental health; older adults; socio-demographic variables","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-24","",15319,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on Peer Support Specialists in the United States: Findings From a Cross-Sectional Online Survey","Peer support specialists (PSS) are an integral part of the mental health workforce. The purpose of this study was to better understand how the COVID-19 pandemic affected their employment status and day-to-day work. A cross-sectional, online survey was conducted (May-June 2020). Recruitment occurred through the National Association of Peer Specialists and additional snowball sampling. Closed- and open-ended questions sought information about employment status, work tasks, challenges faced by PSS and by individuals they supported, and positive impacts they experienced. A total of 1,280 surveys were analyzed. Nine percent of respondents reported having lost their job as a result of COVID-19. Of these, 65% reported a length of employment of 2 or more years, and 61% reported working 35 hours or less per week. Job tasks changed dramatically, with 73% reporting engagement in new tasks, including increased reliance on technology (N=717), increased coordination of resources (N=123), and COVID-19-related tasks (N=142). Engagement in some support tasks decreased significantly from prepandemic levels, including individual support provision (p&lt;0.001) and group facilitation (p&lt;0.001). Respondents reported significant challenges among individuals they supported, including increased isolation (92%), substance use (67%), housing instability (38%), and food insecurity (64%). Although respondents also reported challenges, satisfaction with organizational and supervisory support was high. Most respondents (73%) reported positive impacts or benefits from the pandemic. The changing roles and tasks identified in this study have implications for hiring, training, supervising, and supporting peer staff. The peer workforce demonstrated flexibility and commitment to meeting increasing needs.","Adams, Rogers, Edwards, Lord, McKnight, Barbone","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202000915","20210623","Coronavirus/COVID-19; Rehabilitation/psychosocial; Social support networks; Social support specialists","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-24","",15320,""
