"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on migraine patients, observations from a tertiary care centre in South India","BACKGROUND: Primary headache especially migraine ranks among the top 20 causes of the disease burden as per the years lived with disability (YLD) criteria.1 Stress due to many factors during the COVID-19 pandemic can worsen the migraine symptoms and reduce the therapeutic response.2,3 In this study, we aimed to investigate this impact on migraine frequency and severity on medical care, in addition to overall psychosocial health and specific COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) concerns among migraine patients. METHODS A questionnaire based telephonic survey was used to collect details about the impact of COVID-19 on patients with migraine who visited our outpatient clinic from 1st January 2019 to 31st December 2019. Telephonic interview was carried out by the investigators from July 5th to August 15th of 2021. RESULTS A total of 320 patients participated in the survey. Women constituted 79.7% of the study population and, 39.7% were between 40-60 years while 34.1% were between 20-40 years of age. In comparison to the pre-pandemic period, 56.9% of patients reported increase in the severity of migraine and 55.9% reported increase in the number of headache-days. Difficulties in accessing headache medications was reported by 73.4% and, 75.3% were not able to follow their medication schedule. Only 57.2% were able to access specialist care during the pandemic. Overuse of analgesics was reported by 15.9% of participants in the pre-pandemic period, while it increased to 37.8% after the pandemic. Sleep disturbances, anxiety and depression were reported by 47.2% and increase in screen-time exposure was mentioned by 41.9%. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significantly negative impact on patients with migraine. Well planned strategies should be implemented to ensure availability of quality care for patients with migraine, with emphasis on psychosocial well-being.","Bincy, Baby, Roy, R. A.; John, J.

"Questioning potential ethical issues: facts on a hospitalized psychiatric patient with Covid-19","La contradicciÃ³n en los principios de manejo de pacientes psiquiÃ¡tricos internados con Covid-19 acompaÃ±ada de cambios en las polÃ­ticas gerenciales tiene la oportunidad de crear desafÃ­os Ã©ticos para la enfermerÃ­a. Sin embargo, estudios mÃ­nimos han descrito posibles problemas Ã©ticos durante la atenciÃ³n de pacientes con enfermedades mentales que padecen Covid-19. Por lo tanto, se necesita la mÃ¡xima sinergia en el manejo de Covid-19 en personas con condiciones de salud mental para que los posibles problemas Ã©ticos puedan reducirse y prevenirse. Este estudio explora las perspectivas de las enfermeras sobre posibles problemas Ã©ticos en funciÃ³n de sus experiencias en el cuidado de pacientes con Covid-19 que reciben atenciÃ³n psiquiÃ¡trica. Los resultados de la recopilaciÃ³n de datos de esta investigaciÃ³n cualitativa se analizaron mediante el anÃ¡lisis de contenido convencional segÃºn Lundman y Graneheim. La recolecciÃ³n de datos se llevÃ³ a cabo durante quince entrevistas en profundidad considerando la saturaciÃ³n de datos. De acuerdo con la tÃ©cnica de muestreo por conveniencia, una enfermera jefe fue entrevistada dos veces y realizÃ³ trece entrevistas con cinco enfermeras. Durante las entrevistas en profundidad, se realizaron grabaciones y se documentaron en transcripciones para su posterior anÃ¡lisis paso a paso para generar temas. El tema central formulado es el potencial de problemas Ã©ticos sustentado en tres temas: tratamiento psiquiÃ¡trico ineficaz, falta de apoyo gerencial para la condiciÃ³n mental del paciente y la complejidad de la situaciÃ³n enfrentada por los enfermeros. La conciencia, el sentido de responsabilidad y la confianza en sÃ­ mismos de las enfermeras acompaÃ±adas del apoyo de la gestiÃ³n facilitan la mejora de las condiciones fÃ­sicas y psicolÃ³gicas de los pacientes psiquiÃ¡tricos de pacientes con Covid-19.Alternate :The contradiction in the principles of handling psychiatric inpatients with Covid-19 accompanied by changes in managerial policies has the opportunity to create ethical challenges for nursing. However, minimal studies have described potential ethical issues during the care of mentally ill patients suffering from COVID-19. Therefore, maximum synergy is needed in handling Covid-19 in people with mental health conditions. Subsequently, potential ethical problems can be reduced and prevented. This study explores nurses' perspectives on potential ethical issues based on their experiences caring for Covid-19 patients undergoing psychiatric inpatient care. The results of this qualitative research data collection were analyzed using conventional content analysis according to Lundman and Graneheim. Data collection was carried out for fifteen in-depth interviews by considering data saturation. According to the convenience sampling technique, a head nurse was interviewed twice and conducted thirteen interviews with five nurses. During in-depth interviews, recordings were made and documented into transcripts for further analysis step by step to generate themes. The central theme formulated is the potential for ethical problems supported by three parts: ineffective psychiatric treatment, lack of managerial support for the patient's mental condition, and the complexity of the situation nurses face. Awareness, sense of responsibility, and self-confidence of nurses accompanied by management support facilitate the improvement of the physical and psychological conditions of psychiatric patients of Covid-19 patients.","Kusumawaty, Ira, Lukman, Lukman, Tamzil, Ebagustian, Ningsih, Nurna, Yunike","https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6481840","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Revista Latinoamericana de Hipertension; 17(1):82-88, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37087,""
"Mental and physical training with meditation and aerobic exercise improved mental health and well-being in teachers during the COVID-19 pandemic","Teachers face significant stressors in relation to their work, placing them at increased risk for burnout and attrition. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about additional challenges, resulting in an even greater burden. Thus, strategies for reducing stress that can be delivered virtually are likely to benefit this population. Mental and Physical (MAP) Training combines meditation with aerobic exercise and has resulted in positive mental and physical health outcomes in both clinical and subclinical populations. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility and potential effectiveness of virtual MAP Training on reducing stress and improving mood and well-being in teachers. Participants (n = 104) were from recruited online from kindergarten-grade twelve (K-12) schools in the Northeastern region of the United States and randomly assigned to a six-week program of (n = 58) virtual MAP Training or no training (n = 13). Primary outcomes included pre-intervention and post-intervention ratings on self-report measures of social and emotional health. Changes in cognitive functioning and physical health were also examined in secondary analyses. By intervention end, participants in the MAP Training group reported less anxiety and work-related stress compared to those who received no training (ds = -.75- -.78). Additionally, MAP Training participants reported improvements in depressive symptoms, rumination, work-related quality of life, perceived stress, and self-compassion (ds = .38- -.82), whereas no changes were observed in the no training group. Participants also reported increased subjective ratings of executive functioning, working memory, cognitive flexibility, and fewer sleep disturbances (ds = -.41-.74). Together, these results suggest that the combination of meditation and aerobic exercise is an effective virtual intervention for improving mental health and well-being among K-12 teachers and may enhance resilience to stressful life events such as occurred during the coronavirus pandemic.","Demmin, Docia L.; Silverstein, Steven M.; Shors, Tracey J.","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2022.847301","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Frontiers in Human Neuroscience;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37088,""
"Universality of universal health coverage: A scoping review","Background The progress of Universal health coverage (UHC) is measured using tracer indicators of key interventions, which have been implemented in healthcare system. UHC is about population, comprehensive health services and financial coverage for equitable quality services and health outcome. There is dearth of evidence about the extent of the universality of UHC in terms of types of health services, its integrated definition (dimensions) and tracer indicators utilized in the measurement of UHC. Therefore, we mapped the existing literature to assess universality of UHC and summarize the challenges towards UHC. Methods The checklist Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analysis extension for Scoping Reviews was used. A systematic search was carried out in the Web of Science and PubMed databases. Hand searches were also conducted to find articles from Google Scholar, the World Bank Library, the World Health Organization Library, the United Nations Digital Library Collections, and Google. Article search date was between 20 October 2021 and 12 November 2021 and the most recent update was done on 03 March 2022. Articles on UHC coverage, financial risk protection, quality of care, and inequity were included. The Population, Concept, and Context framework was used to determine the eligibility of research questions. A stepwise approach was used to identify and select relevant studies, conduct data charting, collation and summarization, as well as report results. Simple descriptive statistics and narrative synthesis were used to present the findings. Results Forty-seven papers were included in the final review. One-fourth of the articles (25.5%) were from the African region and 29.8% were from lower-middle-income countries. More than half of the articles (54.1%) followed a quantitative research approach. Of included articles, coverage was assessed by 53.2% of articles;financial risk protection by 27.7%, inequity by 25.5% and quality by 6.4% of the articles as the main research objectives or mentioned in result section. Most (42.5%) of articles investigated health promotion and 2.1% palliation and rehabilitation services. Policy and healthcare level and cross-cutting barriers of UHC were identified. Financing, leadership/governance, inequity, weak regulation and supervision mechanism, and poverty were most repeated policy level barriers. Poor quality health services and inadequate health workforce were the common barriers from health sector challenges. Lack of common understanding on UHC was frequently mentioned as a cross-cutting barrier. Conclusions The review showed that majority of the articles were from the African region. Methodologically, quantitative research design was more frequently used to investigate UHC. Palliation and rehabilitation health care services need attention in the monitoring and evaluation of UHC progress. It is also noteworthy to focus on quality and inequity of health services. The study implies that urgent action on the identified policy, health system and cross-cutting barriers is required to achieve UHC.","Endalamaw, Aklilu, Gilks, Charles F.; Fentie, Ambaw, Assefa, Yibeltal","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0269507","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: PLoS One; 17(8), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37089,""
"Protocol for a feasibility randomised controlled study of a multicomponent intervention to promote a sustainable return to work of workers on long-term sick leave â€” PROWORK: PROmoting a Sustainable and Healthy Return to WORK","Background The cost of sickness absence has major social, psychological and financial implications for individuals and organisations. Return-to-work (RTW) interventions that support good quality communication and contact with the workplace can reduce the length of sickness absence by between 15 and 30 days. However, initiatives promoting a sustainable return to work for workers with poor mental health on long-term sickness absence across small, medium and large enterprises (SMEs and LEs) are limited. This paper describes the protocol of a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) to test the feasibility of implementing a RTW intervention across SMEs and LEs across all sectors. Methods and design A two-arm feasibility RCT with a 4-month intervention will be conducted in SMEs and LE enterprises from the Midlands region, UK. At least 8 organisations (4 controls and interventions), and at least 60 workers and/or managers, will be recruited and randomised into the intervention and control group (30 interventions, 30 controls). Workers on long-term sickness absence (LTSA) (between 8 and 50 days) and managers with a worker on LTSA will be eligible to participate. The intervention is a behavioural change programme, including a managers and workers RTW toolkit, focused on supporting sickness absence and RTW through the provision of knowledge, problem-solving, action planning, goal setting and positive communication that leads to a sustainable RTW. Organisations assigned to the control group will continue with their usual practice. Measurements of mental health, RTW, work outcomes, quality-of-life, workplace support and communication and other demographic data will be taken at baseline, 2 months and 4 months. Feasibility will be assessed based on recruitment, retention, attrition, completion of measures and intervention compliance for which specific process and research outcomes have been established. A process evaluation will explore the experiences and acceptability of the intervention components and evaluation measures. Exploratory economic evaluation will be conducted to further inform a definitive trial. Discussion This is a novel intervention using a worker-manager approach to promote a sustainable return to work of workers on long-term sick leave due to poor mental wellbeing. If this intervention is shown to be feasible, the outcomes will inform a larger scale randomised control trial.

"Combined lifestyle, mental health, and mortality in US cancer survivors: a national cohort study","Background Adopting healthy lifestyles and staying mentally health are two cost-effective modifiable strategies that cancer survivors can implement in self-management. We aimed to evaluate the independent, mediation, interaction, and joint associations of combined lifestyle and mental health with mortality in cancer survivors. Methods We performed a cohort study including 3145 cancer survivors from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2005â€“2018). A healthy lifestyle score was constructed based on post-diagnosis body mass index, physical activity, diet, smoking, and drinking. Post-diagnosis mental health was assessed by Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all-cause, cancer, and non-cancer mortality were computed using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results After 20,900 person-years of follow-up (median, 6.3 years), cancer survivors with higher lifestyle score had decreased mortality, independent of mental health. Compared to participants with lower lifestyle score (0â€“1), HRs (95% CIs) for all-cause and non-cancer mortality among those with higher lifestyle score (3â€“5) were 0.68 (0.52â€“0.89) and 0.69 (0.56â€“0.85), respectively. 6.2â€“10.3% of the associations were mediated by mental health. Similar trends were observed among participants categorized by mental health, those with better mental health had lower mortality, independent of lifestyle. Participants with better mental health benefited more from adopting healthy lifestyles, and vice versa. Combinations of higher healthy lifestyle score and better mental health were associated with significant decreased mortality, the lowest mortality was seen in participants with highest healthy lifestyle score and concurrently with best mental health. Conclusions For the first time, in this cohort study with a nationally representative sample of US cancer survivors, we comprehensively explored the complex associations of lifestyle, mental health, and mortality. Evidence derived from this study may give much confidence to cancer survivors and healthcare providers that, changing oneâ€™s lifestyle and/or staying mentally healthy after cancer diagnosis can improve survival.","Zhao-yan, Liu, Wang, Chen, Yao-jun, Zhang, Hui-lian, Zhu","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-022-03584-4","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Translational Medicine; 20:1-13, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37091,""
"Examining the incidence of acute stress in pediatric trauma patients","ObjectivePediatric patients can be significantly impacted emotionally by exposure to acute trauma which may negatively impact long-term functioning and lead to an increase in overall distress. This study reports on the incidence of acute stress disorder among pediatric trauma patients in a hospital setting in the southeastern region of the USA.MethodsPediatric patient mental health assessments were conducted using the Childhood Stress Disorders Checklist- Short Form (CSDC-SF) as part of a new integrated behavioral health standard of care within the Trauma Services Division of a level 1 pediatric hospital. Mental health consultations occurred at bedside on inpatient hospital admission into trauma services, or at the outpatient hospital clinic after discharge for injuries treated in the emergency department.ResultsAssociations among type of trauma, child age, and sex were explored in a sample of 617 children (58.9% male) aged 2â€“18 years (Mage=10.27). The sample was primarily ethnic minorities (56.1% black/African-American, 5% Hispanic/Latinx). Fifteen per cent or more of trauma reports were for burns (26%), motor vehicle accident (22.7%), and recreational sports or leisure activity-related injury (17.5%). Sixty-four per cent of children scored =1 on the CSDC-SF, indicating symptoms consistent with acute stress disorder. Higher scores were associated with female sex, age, and injury type.Level of evidenceLevel IV study provides evidence of the link between traumatic injury and mental health symptoms in a pediatric population.

"Implementing integrated-youth services virtually in British Columbia during the COVID-19 pandemic","ObjectiveDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Foundry responded to support youth across the province of British Columbia (BC), Canada, by creating a virtual platform to deliver integrated services to youth. In this paper, we report on the development of Foundry Virtual services, initial evaluation results and lessons learnt for others implementing virtual services.Methods and analysisIn April 2020, Foundry launched its virtual services, providing young people and their caregivers from across BC with drop-in counselling services via chat, voice or video calls. Foundry consulted with youth and caregivers to implement, improve and add services. Using Foundryâ€™s quality improvement data tool, we document service utilisation, the demographic profile of young people accessing virtual services, and how young people rate the quality of services accessed.FindingsSince launching, 3846 unique youth accessed Foundry Virtual services over 8899 visits, totalling 11 943 services accessed. The predominant services accessed were walk in counselling (32.5%), mental health and substance use services (31.4%), youth peer support (17.2%) and group services (7.3%). Over 95% of youth reported that they would recommend virtual services to a friend.ConclusionIn response to our early findings, we provide three recommendations for other implementers. First, engage the audience in which you intend to serve at every phase of the project. Second, invest in the needs of staff to ensure they are prepared and supported to deliver services. Last, imbed a learning health system to allow for the resources culture of continuous learning improvement that allows for rapid course adjustments and shared learning opportunities.","Zenone, Marco, Raimundo, Al, Nanji, Suhail, Neha, Uday, Tee, Karen, Ewert, Alayna, Helfrich, Warren, Chan, Godwin, Mathias, Steve, Barbic, Skye","https://doi.org/10.1136/ihj-2021-000089","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Integrated Healthcare Journal; 4(1), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37093,""

Use of the SNAP was associated with a statistically significant reduction in LoS of -8.8 hours (95% CI -12.6 to -2.0), and a reduced risk of anaphylactoid reaction (Number Needed to Treat=10).ConclusionIn this retrospective study, use of the SNAP reduced the duration of inpatient admissions and rate of anaphylactoid reactions.","Humphries, Christopher, Roberts, Georgina, Taheem, Anjeli, Hashem Abdel, Kader, Kidd, Rebecca, Smith, Jason","https://doi.org/10.1136/emermed-2021-212180","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Emergency Medicine Journal : EMJ;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37095,""

"Policing the largest drug market on the eastern seaboard: officer perspectives on enforcement and community safety","Purpose&gt;The Kensington transit corridor runs between Huntingdon and Allegheny stations in the Kensington area of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and is one of the largest illicit drug areas in the country. The authors report qualitative findings from ride-alongs with transit police officers assigned to a vehicle patrol dedicated to reducing the response time to opioid overdoses in and around the transit system (trains and buses) in this large open-air drug market. This study's focus was on management and mitigation of the criminogenic harms associated with the illicit drug environment.Design/methodology/approach&gt;For ten months, transit officers patrolled the Kensington transit corridor in a dedicated vehicle (callsign â€œOscar Oneâ€). Oscar One operated during either an early (8 a.m. to 4 p.m.) or late (4 p.m. to midnight) shift, between September 2020 and June 2021. 269 shifts were randomly selected for Oscar One from 574 possible shifts. Researchers accompanied Oscar One for 51 observations (19%), 45 of which were completed by the authors. Semi-structured interviews occurred during these shifts, as well as ethnographic field observations.Findings&gt;Four main themes emerged from the study. These centered on the role of law enforcement in a large drug market, the politics of enforcement within the city of Philadelphia, the policing world around risk and proactive engagement postâ€“George Floyd, and the sense of police being overwhelmed on the front-line of community safety.Originality/value&gt;Police officers have a community safety as well as a law enforcement mandate, and this study explores the community safety and harm mitigation role from their perspective. The article draws on their words, based on approximately 400Â h of field observation.","Ratcliffe, Jerry H.; Wight, Hayley","https://doi.org/10.1108/PIJPSM-12-2021-0172","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Policing; 45(5):727-740, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37098,""

"Interrogating and recuperating masculinities in therapeutic practice","In this invited commentary I reflect on issues concerning masculinities in therapeutic spaces. I draw on contemporary masculinity concepts as well as the psychonalytic, postmodern and post-qualitative aspects of the various articles. I consider how traditional and modern expectations concerning masculinities create problems and possibilities for men in different situations, for example men from different generations (e.g. me, my father, my son). Similarly, I discuss how therapists might unwittingly [re]construct traditional masculinities in their practice â€“ but are also ideally positioned to deconstruct masculinities which are implicated in their clientâ€™s suffering. At the same time, I note that the promotion of healthy, caring and inclusive masculinities need not be confined to the therapy room since there are now various mental health intervention which are community-based, entail peer support and which are tailored to specific constituencies of men.

"Community lung health service design for COPD patients in China by the Breathe Well group","COPD is increasingly common in China but is poorly understood by patients, medications are not used as prescribed and there is no access to recommended non-pharmacological treatment. We explored COPD patientsâ€™ and general practitionersâ€™ (GPs) knowledge of COPD, views on its management and the acceptability of a flexible lung health service (LHS) offering health education, exercise, self-management, smoking cessation and mental health support. Using a convergent mixed methods design, data were collected from patients and GPs using focus groups (FGs) in four Chinese cities, questionnaires were also used to collect data from patients. FGs were audio-recorded and transcribed. Quantitative data were analysed descriptively, thematic framework analysis was used for the qualitative data. Two-hundred fifty-one patients completed the questionnaire;39 patients and 30 GPs participated in ten separate FGs. Three overarching themes were identified: patientsâ€™ lack of knowledge/understanding of COPD, current management of COPD not meeting patientsâ€™ needs and LHS design, which was well received by patients and GPs. Participants wanted COPD education, TaiChi, psychological support and WeChat for social support. 39% of survey responders did not know what to do when their breathing worsened and 24% did not know how to use their inhalers. 36% of survey respondents requested guided relaxation. Overall, participants did not fully understand the implications of COPD and current treatment was sub-optimal. There was support for developing a culturally appropriate intervention meeting Chinese patientsâ€™ needs, health beliefs, and local healthcare delivery. Further research should explore the feasibility of such a service.","Pang, Hui, Pan, Zihan, Adams, Rachel, Duncan, Eleanor, Chi, Chunhua, Kong, Xia, Adab, PeymanÃ©, Cheng, Kar Keung, Cooper, Brendan G.; Correia-de-Sousa, Jaime, Dickens, Andrew P.; Enocson, Alexandra, Farley, Amanda, Gale, Nicola, Jolly, Kate, Jowett, Sue, Maglakelidze, Mariam, Maghlakelidze, Tamaz, Martins, Sonia, Sitch, Alice, Stavrik, Katarina, Stelmach, Raphael, Turner, Alice, Williams, SiÃ¢n, Jordan, Rachel E.","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41533-022-00286-8","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine; 32(1), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37101,""
"Food insecurity and mental health of college students in Lebanon: a cross-sectional study","The present study aimed to assess the prevalence of food insecurity (FI) among college students and explore its association with indicators of mental and psychosocial health. Data were collected using a cross-sectional online survey from college students in different universities in Lebanon during the Spring 2021 semester. FI was assessed using the validated eight-item food insecurity experience scale. The mental health of college students was assessed using validated screening tools for depression, anxiety and well-being, namely the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and the World Health Organization (WHO-5) index, respectively. Multiple linear regression models were conducted to assess the relationship of FI with PHQ-9, GAD-7 and WHO-5 scores. A total of 745 students completed the online survey. Approximately 39 % of students in the sample were experiencing FI of which 27Â·4, 8Â·1, and 3Â·5 % were experiencing mild, moderate and severe FI , respectively. Low maternal education, low household monthly income and high levels of stress were significant correlates of FI among college students (P-trend &lt; 0Â·001). In addition, 22Â·6 and 34Â·4 % of students showed severe symptoms of depression and anxiety, respectively. Regression models showed that FI was associated with higher scores on PHQ-9 and GAD-7 (ÃŸ = 2Â·45;95 % CI [1Â·41, 3Â·49]) and (ÃŸ = 1Â·4;95 % CI [1Â·1, 2Â·2], respectively) and lower scores on WHO-5 (ÃŸ = -4Â·84;95 % CI [-8Â·2, -1Â·5]). In conclusion, a remarkable proportion of college students reported experiencing different forms of FI, which was associated with poorer mental health and well-being outcomes. Public health programmes and interventions are needed to mitigate FI and improve student health-related outcomes.","Itani, Rita, Mattar, Lama, Kharroubi, Samer, Bosqui, Tania, Diab-El-Harake, Marwa, Jomaa, Lamis","https://doi.org/10.1017/jns.2022.68","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Nutritional Science; 11, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37102,""
"Evaluating clinician-led quality improvement initiatives: A system-wide embedded research partnership at Stanford Medicine","Introduction Aim Methods Results Conclusion Many healthcare delivery systems have developed clinician-led quality improvement (QI) initiatives but fewer have also developed in-house evaluation units. Engagement between the two entities creates unique opportunities. Stanford Medicine funded a collaboration between their Improvement Capability Development Program (ICDP), which coordinates and incentivizes clinician-led QI efforts, and the Evaluation Sciences Unit (ESU), a multidisciplinary group of embedded researchers with expertise in implementation and evaluation sciences.To describe the ICDP-ESU partnership and report key learnings from the first 2 y of operation September 2019 to August 2021.Department-level physician and operational QI leaders were offered an ESU consultation to workshop design, methods, and overall scope of their annual QI projects. A steering committee of high-level stakeholders from operational, clinical, and research perspectives subsequently selected three projects for in-depth partnered evaluation with the ESU based on evaluability, importance to the health system, and broader relevance. Selected project teams met regularly with the ESU to develop mixed methods evaluations informed by relevant implementation science frameworks, while aligning the evaluation approach with the clinical teams' QI goals.Sixty and 62 ICDP projects were initiated during the 2 cycles, respectively, across 18 departments, of which ESU consulted with 15 (83%). Within each annual cycle, evaluators made actionable, summative findings rapidly available to partners to inform ongoing improvement. Other reported benefits of the partnership included rapid adaptation to COVID-19 needs, expanded clinician evaluation skills, external knowledge dissemination through scholarship, and health system-wide knowledge exchange. Ongoing considerations for improving the collaboration included the need for multi-year support to enable nimble response to dynamic health system needs and timely data access.Presence of embedded evaluation partners in the enterprise-wide QI program supported identification of analogous endeavors (eg, telemedicine adoption) and cross-cutting lessons across QI efforts, clinician capacity building, and knowledge dissemination through scholarship.

MÃ©thodologie Nous avons utilisÃ© les donnÃ©es de surveillance du SystÃ¨me canadien hospitalier dâ€™information et de recherche en prÃ©vention des traumatismes (SCHIRPT) pour identifier les enfants sâ€™Ã©tant prÃ©sentÃ©s Ã  lâ€™Hospital for Sick Children pour intoxication durant deux pÃ©riodes: avant la pandÃ©mie (du 11 mars au 31 dÃ©cembre 2018 et 2019) et durant la pandÃ©mie (du 11 mars au 31 dÃ©cembre 2020). Les principaux paramÃ¨tres dâ€™Ã©valuation Ã©taient la variation par rapport au total des visites Ã  lâ€™urgence de la proportion des intoxications totales, des intoxications accidentelles, de lâ€™usage de drogues rÃ©crÃ©atives et dâ€™automutilation intentionnelle. Nous avons Ã©galement examinÃ© la variation entre avant et durant la pandÃ©mie de la proportion dâ€™intoxications en fonction de lâ€™Ã¢ge, du sexe, du type de drogues et des exigences dâ€™admission. RÃ©sultats La proportion par rapport au total des visites Ã  lâ€™urgence sâ€™est significativement accrue pour ce qui est des intoxications totales (122,5 %), des intoxications accidentelles (127,8 %), de lâ€™usage de drogues rÃ©crÃ©atives (160 %) et des intoxications intentionnelles (automutilation;104,2 %).

"â€˜Feel Good Factorâ€™: Positive recognition impacted staff morale, encouraged juniors and led to the overall departmental development during the COVID-19 pandemic","Aims Low doctor morale and mental well-being is associated with poor patient care, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. We report on a local initiative, Feel Good Factor (FGF), and its impact on doctors and the department. Methods FGF is a monthly presentation at the departmental meeting implemented at WHH, started in December 2019;where kind acts are applauded. A 10-item questionnaire was distributed to doctors working in two Surgery Departments (WHH and QEQM) in May 2021. Questionnaires collected demographic data, awareness of both positive/negative events and mental well-being using Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS). Data was collected on audits, QIP's, sickness due to mental health, junior progression and publications. Results 48 doctors responded (58.3% QEQM). There was no significant difference in overall WEMWBS score. Doctors in the WHH department were more decisive (70% vs 25%, p = 0.043);positive incident reporting was higher at WHH (25.0% vs 0.0%, p = 0.025). A trust-wide record number of 45 audits, 22 publications, 6 national studies and 11 juniors progressed in 2020. Patient clinical marker of NELA mortality was one of the least. There was no sickness leave due to mental health. FGF was also shortlisted for the annual BMJ awards. Conclusion FGF is associated with increased awareness of positive events. Improved doctor morale led to widespread participation in projects and departmental output leading to national recognition. Initiatives such as FGF should be encouraged and advertised to other departments, to improve the hospital rating.","Zarsadias, Prizzi, Burford, Charlotte, Rai, Sujata, Vigneswaran, Natali, Shah, Ankur","https://www.google.com/search?q=â€˜Feel+Good+Factorâ€™:+Positive+recognition+impacted+staff+morale,+encouraged+juniors+and+led+to+the+overall+departmental+development+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: The British journal of surgery; 109(Suppl 5), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37106,""
"Critical Considerations for Optimizing the Support for International Student Engagement","International student engagement is often linked with and relies on optimal student experiences across a range of interrelated aspects, including: * connection between international students and domestic students and communities * engagement with support services regarding mental health and wellbeing, accommodation, finance, intercultural communication, and language and learning skills * work-integrated learning (WIL) and employability * engagement with face-to-face, hybrid and online learning and teaching * international students' navigation through crises such as, health, financial, natural disaster, geopolitical crises, or war. There is concern about the cultural appropriateness of support services relating to teaching and learning, language and intercultural communication, counselling, and mental health services (Forbes-Mewett & Sawyer, 2015;Tran, 2013). The COVID-19 pandemic has forced large-scale shifts to online learning, which presents both challenges and opportunities, with a range of digital technologies being increasingly used to assist not only with online and blended learning, but also with support provision in relation to international students' connectedness, mental health and work-integrated learning (Adachi & Tran, 2022;Humphrey & Forbes-Mewett, 2021). Rather, it extends to co-designing support resources with them. * Effective engagement with international students is based on a holistic approach and understanding of how aspects of a crossborder student life are interlinked and inter-dependent on each other, including academic performance, learning outcomes, mental health and wellbeing, employment, accommodation, finance, life plans, and aspirations.","Tran, Ly Thi, Blackmore, Jill, Forbes-Mewett, Helen, Nguyen, Diep Thi Bich, Hartridge, Danielle, Aldana, Renata","https://www.google.com/search?q=Critical+Considerations+for+Optimizing+the+Support+for+International+Student+Engagement","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of International Students; 12(3):I-VIII, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37107,""

"Yoga to improve maternal mental health and immune function during the COVID-19 crisis (Yoga-M 2 trial): study protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial [version 2;peer review: 2 approved]","Background: Mental health of women is adversely affected during pregnancy. Stress and depression during pregnancy negatively impact birthweight and neuro-cognitive development of the fetus. The current crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic further adds to the stressful situation. Yoga practiced during pregnancy has beneficial effects on improving stress and depression and preliminary evidence suggests that yoga-based interventions can improve immunity. This study aims to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a Yoga-based intervention for maternal Mental health and i Mmunity (Yoga-M 2) in a rural community in India.Â  Â Â  Methods: The study design will be a single-blind individual randomized parallel group-controlled pilot trial with 1:1 allocation ratio. Adult pregnant women, with gestational age between 12â€“24 weeks will be randomly allocated to either the Yoga-M 2 group or the Enhanced Usual Care (EUC) group. Participants in the Yoga-M 2 arm will attend weekly group yoga sessions for 12 weeks and will be encouraged to practice yoga at home. In the EUC arm, participants will receive a single session of health education. Eligibility of the participants, recruitment, retention-in-care, and study completion rates will be estimated and feasibility of delivering Yoga-M 2 and acceptability of this intervention by the participants will be assessed. Change in the scores of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), EuroQoL 5 Dimensions Score (EQ-5D-5L), Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Severity Scale (WURSS-21), and serum C-Reactive Protein at three-months from baseline will be used to assess preliminary efficacy. Discussion: The key outputs of this trial will be a structured intervention manual and evidence about the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the intervention,Â establishing the foundation to undertake an explanatory randomized controlled trial to assess efficacy and cost-effectiveness of Yoga-M 2 intervention.Â  Trial registration: CTRI/2022/01/039701.

"Fear of COVID-19, hotel employee outcomes and workplace health and safety management practices: Evidence from Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt","This paper investigates the effect of fear of COVID-19 on employee turnover intention and depression, hypothesizing the mediating effect of psychological well-being and the moderating effect of workplace health and safety management practices. Data was gathered from 687 employees of five-star hotels in Sharm El-Sheikh using a structured survey instrument with time-lag approach. A partial least-square-based path modeling (PLS-PM) was applied to analyze the dataset. The findings reveal the partial mediation of psychological well-being in the relationships of fear of COVID-19 with both turnover intention and depression. While workplace safety and management practices significantly moderate the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and both turnover intentions, depression also mediates the relationship. The findings add to the existing literature on the effects of COVID-19 through the dual lenses of protection motivation theory and attribution theory. We can employ these findings to overcome issues of employee well-being in the hotel setting.","Selem, Kareem M.; Ahmad, Muhammad S.; Belwal, Rakesh, AlKayid, Kholoud","https://www.google.com/search?q=Fear+of+COVID-19,+hotel+employee+outcomes+and+workplace+health+and+safety+management+practices:+Evidence+from+Sharm+El-Sheikh,+Egypt","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Tourism and Hospitality Research;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37110,""
"Implementation of video-calls between patients admitted to intensive care unit during the COVID-19 pandemic and their families: a pilot study of psychological effects","Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused over 530 million infections to date (June 2022), with a high percentage of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. In this context, relatives have been restricted from visiting their loved ones admitted to hospital. This situation has led to an inevitable separation between patients and their families. Video communication could reduce the negative effects of such phenomenon, but the impact of this strategy on levels of anxiety, depression, and PTSD disorder in caregivers is not well-known. Methods We conducted a prospective study (6 October 2020â€“18 February 2022) at the Policlinico University Hospital in Catania, including caregivers of both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ICU patients admitted during the second wave of the pandemic. Video-calls were implemented twice a week. Assessment of anxiety, depression, and PTSD was performed at 1-week distance (before the first, T1, and before the third, video-call, T2) using the following validated questionnaires: Impact of Event Scale (Revised IES-R), Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results Twenty caregivers of 17 patients completed the study (T1 + T2). Eleven patients survived (n = 9/11 in the COVID-19 and n = 2/6 in the â€œnon-COVIDâ€ group). The average results of the questionnaires completed by caregivers between T1 and T2 showed no significant difference in terms of CES-D (T1 = 19.6 Â± 10, T2 = 22 Â± 9.6;p = 0.17), HADS depression (T1 = 9.5 Â± 1.6, T2 = 9 Â± 3.9;p = 0.59), HADS anxiety (T1 = 8.7 Â± 2.4, T2 = 8.4 Â± 3.8;p = 0.67), and IES-R (T1 = 20.9 Â± 10.8, T2 = 23.1 Â± 12;p = 0.19). Similar nonsignificant results were observed in the two subgroups of caregivers (COVID-19 and â€œnon-COVIDâ€). However, at T1 and T2, caregivers of â€œnon-COVIDâ€ patients had higher scores of CES-D (p = 0.01 and p = 0.04, respectively) and IES-R (p = 0.049 and p = 0.02, respectively), while HADS depression was higher only at T2 (p = 0.02). At T1, caregivers of non-survivors had higher scores of CES-D (27.6 Â± 10.6 vs 15.3 Â± 6.7, p = 0.005) and IES-R (27.7 Â± 10.0 vs 17.2 Â± 9.6, p = 0.03). We also found a significant increase in CES-D at T2 in ICU-survivors (p = 0.04). Conclusions Our preliminary results showed that a video-call implementation strategy between caregivers and patients admitted to the ICU is feasible. However, this strategy did not show an improvement in terms of the risk of depression, anxiety, and PTSD among caregivers. Our pilot study remains exploratory and limited to a small sample.

"Boerhaaveâ€™s Syndrome Secondary to Symptomatic COVID-19 Infection","Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has infected over 140 million people worldwide (1). COVID-19 symptoms primarily involve the respiratory system. However, recent data suggests that gastrointestinal symptoms occur in 11-61% of cases (2, 3).Boerhaaveâ€™s syndrome is a rare and dangerous disorder of the gastrointestinal tract, associated with a mortality rate of up to 50% (4). It most commonly occurs due to a lack of coordination between upper and lower oesophageal sphincters during forceful emesis, leading to an abrupt rise in intra-oesophageal pressures which leads to a transmural tear (5). Less commonly, a tear can be secondary to prolonged coughing (6). The majority of tears occur in the distal posterolateral third of the oesophagus and have an average length of 2.2 cm (7). Risk factors include males, excess alcohol or food consumption (6).Â We present a case of Boerhaaveâ€™s syndrome secondary to prolonged coughing, from COVID-19 infection. The tear was 8 cm in length in the mid anterior oesophagus. The patient survived a major operation and prolonged intensive care stay. Meloy et al. (8) published one case of oesophageal rupture in symptomatic COVID-19 â€“ unfortunately the patient passed away before intervention. Methods A 75-year-old Caucasian female was day seven of COVID-19 infection and had been coping in the community with a continuous dry cough and mild shortness of breath. She presented to Accident and Emergency in the late afternoon when her cough developed into unremitting retching, vomiting, a global headache and epigastric pain disproportionate to presentation. No associated haematemesis or change in bowel habit. Past medical history was significant for hypertension, hypothyroidism, depression and anxiety. Previous surgical history included an open appendicectomy, cholecystectomy and resection of a melanoma. She was previously independent, consumed alcohol socially, a non-smoker and compliant with her regular medications.A CT chest with contrast demonstrated distal oesophageal rupture transversely with pneumomediastinum and extensive surgical emphysema in the neck and secondary bilateral pleural effusions, consistent with Boerhaaveâ€™s syndrome. The patient was taken to theatre the next morning for an oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (OGD), right posterolateral thoracotomy and primary repair of the oesophageal perforation.On endoscopy, an 8cm defect in the anterior oesophagus starting at the T4 vertebral level was identified and was repaired using tunnelled permanent mesh. During the surgery, mediastinitis was noted and washed out. The antimicrobial therapy was altered post-operatively to intravenous tazocin and fluconazole.Â  Results The management of this patient was a huge multidisciplinary team achievement. She spent forty-six days recovering in ICU, intubated, ventilated and sedated with noradrenaline vasopressor support. The patient developed a severe acute kidney injury, requiring haemofiltration. The mediastinal fluid culture grew Enterococcus faecalis, sensitive to vancomycin and antibiotic therapy was adjusted accordingly.Â The patientâ€™s recovery was burdened by seizures, whilst being weaned off sedation, and episodes of bradycardia and asystole, most of which were self-resolving except one requiring thirty seconds of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation. After chest drain removal, the patient redeveloped a right sided loculated pleural effusion so a further drain was inserted.A gastrografin contrast swallow study performed thirty-five days post-operatively demonstrated no evidence of contrast leak although some tracheobronchial aspiration. She was later stepped down to the ward and recovered very well. However, a component of post-ICU delirium and low mood was persistent. The patient had a repeat water-soluble contrast study on day 77 which demonstrated a contained anastomotic leak, managed conservatively. She was deemed medically ready for discharge at day 110. She was readmitted due to dysphagia secondary to a stricture at the site of mesh repair. OGD was performed and a stent was inserted. Conclusions COVID-19 infection may lead to an abnormal presentation of Boerhaaveâ€™s syndrome, with oesophageal tears being secondary to coughing, longer and more proximal.Peri-operative morbidity in COVID patients is elevated and clinicians should consider the short and long term implications of this to provide a holistic approach to care. Clinicians should maintain an awareness of the diversity of COVID-associated complications whilst ensuring that they do not succumb to the diagnostic overshadowing that becomes commonplace during a pandemic.","Saad, Ahmed, Sharma, Amit, Dhillon, Syra, Jaunoo, Shameen","https://www.google.com/search?q=Boerhaaveâ€™s+Syndrome+Secondary+to+Symptomatic+COVID-19+Infection","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: The British journal of surgery; 108(Suppl 9), 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37112,""

To assess the baseline prevalence of mental health conditions and associated exposures in a cohort of health care workers (HCWs) in Guatemala. Methods. We analyzed baseline information from the 2020 Web-based COVID-19 Health Care Workers Study (HEROES)â€“Guatemala. Outcomes included mental distress and depressive symptoms. Exposures included COVID-19 experiences, sociodemographic characteristics, and job characteristics. We used crude and adjus- ted Poisson regression models in our analyses. Results. Of the 1801 HCWs who accepted to participate, 1522 (84.5%) completed the questionnaire; 1014 (66.8%) were women. Among the participants, 59.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 56.6, 61.5) screened positive for mental distress and 23% (95% CI = 20.9, 25.2) for moderate to severe depressive symptoms. COVID-19 experiences, sociodemographic characteristics, and job characteristics were associated with the study outcomes. Participants who were worried about COVID-19 infection were at higher risk of mental distress (relative risk [RR] = 1.47; 95% CI = 1.30, 1.66) and depressive symptoms (RR = 1.51; 95% CI = 1.17, 1.96). Similarly, the youngest participants were at elevated risk of mental distress (RR = 1.80; 95% CI = 1.24, 2.63) and depressive symptoms (OR = 4.58; 95% CI = 1.51, 13.87). Conclusions.

"Physical and psychological reconditioning in long covid syndrome patients: results of a structured physical exercise program","Funding Acknowledgements Type of funding sources: None. Background Long Covid Syndrome (LCS) is used to describe signs and symptoms that continue or develop after acute COVID-19 infection. Natural history and treatments of this syndrome is still poorly understood. In literature there is currently a lack of data on the real effectiveness of a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program based on structured physical exercise (SPE) in these patients. Purpose To evaluate safety, effectiveness and feasibility of a structured individualized rehabilitation program in improving physical and psychological parameters in patients with LCS. Methods Twenty-eight patients with LCS (19 males, mean age 57 years) underwent an accurate medical screening process, body composition evaluation, cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), muscular strength assessment, quality of life (QoL), psychological assessment and counselling, before and after a 12-sessions SPE program. Results At baseline, all LCS patients showed severe impairments in physical performance, QoL and psychological parameters. No adverse effects and dropouts were observed during training session. After the rehabilitation program, significant improvement in CPET parameters, upper and lower limb muscular strength, perceived physical and mental health, body composition, depression and anxiety and Covid residual symptoms was observed. Conclusions The present study confirms severe impairment of patients with LCS and suggest that a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program based on SPE could promote their physical and psychological recovery.","Palermi, S.; Compagno, S.; Pescatore, V.; Brugin, E.; Tegon, G.; Sarto, M.; Marin, R.; Calzavara, V.; Nizzetto, M.; Scevola, M.; Albertin, C.; Biffi, A.; Giada, F.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Physical+and+psychological+reconditioning+in+long+covid+syndrome+patients:+results+of+a+structured+physical+exercise+program","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of preventive cardiology; 29(Suppl 1), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37116,""
"An observational study investigating the differences the COVID-19 Pandemic had on admissions, methods of injury in a tertiary trauma centre in a major UK City","Background During March 2020 the country was plunged into a nationwide lockdown. Despite this, there remained a steady stream of trauma admissions. COVID changed a lot about how many medical specialties worked and we wanted to explore the effects on our patient population, and compare it to the experience of other hospitals. Â  Methods We analysed existing data on admissions to the Emergency Department that were referred to the trauma service between the 12th of March to the 24th of May;encompassing the lockdown and the two weeks either side. This data was compared to that of the year beforehand. We compared ages, sexes, mortality, methods of injury, and disposition. Results Admissions fell, 193, compared to 271 (~3:1 M:F). Both cohorts featured more younger people, but there was a drop-off in the number of older folk post-COVID;6 of 9 centiles of the over 60s showed a fall in admissions of at least 14%. Those admitted to the Major Trauma service (ISS 9+) remained the same. Regarding the methods of injury, Â the most common presentations remained road traffic accidents, stabbings and falls &lt;1m, contributing to 71 and 72% Â total admissions before and after COVID respectively. However, there were fewer patients falling from heights of &gt; 2m (OR 0.5), and fewer recorded assaults (OR 4.0). Penetrating injuries were separated into â€œstabbingsâ€ and â€œothersâ€. There was a significant increase in non-stabbing penetrating injuries (OR 4.6), a majority of which were self-inflicted. The rate of self harm during the lockdown showed a similar increase, from featuring in 8% of total presentations to 15% of admissions (OR 1.87). Â The hospital restructured considerably between the sample dates such that dispositions are not possible to compare meaningfully. Rates of patients sent straight home from the ED were similar (OR 1.0). Conclusions Overall, the lockdown had a moderate impact on patient numbers and demography. The data implies that the measures did small amounts to deter people from the roads and from interacting with each other in assaults and stabbings. Older people were less likely to present traumatically. The isolation may have led to a masking of mental health issues leading to a significant increase in self harm, which may present opportunities for restructuring of services in any the event of further major lockdowns.Â  These conclusions are limited by the data, and next steps would include gathering more detailed mortality data.","Mwangi, Brian","https://www.google.com/search?q=An+observational+study+investigating+the+differences+the+COVID-19+Pandemic+had+on+admissions,+methods+of+injury+in+a+tertiary+trauma+centre+in+a+major+UK+City","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: The British journal of surgery; 108(Suppl 9), 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37117,""
"â€œInside Outâ€: A Regional Inpatient Joy in Work Project","Aims Inpatient admissions during the COVID-19 pandemic went up in the regional unit by 18%. This included a 50% increase in Eating Disorder Presentations and more complex SMI requiring admission to Beechcroft. Beechcroft is the regional inpatient unit for CAMHS in Northern Ireland. This project aimed to improve staff joy in work by 30% by June 2021, following what was one of the most difficult years to be a health professional with the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We used the IHI Joy in Work methodology along with our own rating scales in the inpatient unit. Several PDSA cycles were carried out including focus groups, gathering baseline data from different wards, and our change ideas- Beechcroft stars nominations, Virtual Quizzes and Staff recognition certificates. Results Baseline data on our run chart demonstrated a bad day median in Beechcroft with 4.3 being the score. With the PSDA cycle we demonstrated a 33% improvement in good day scores with a median of 1.4. We have learnt that Joy in work comes from recognising the work already being done and rewarding the efforts our staff go to. Spread and scale with Beechcroft stars now part of fortnightly MDT meeting and management meeting. Also rolled out to a community mental health team. Conclusion Joy in Work comes from the team. Recognising the efforts of the team is central to this.

"The Predictive Power and Dominance of Variables of Purpose and Social Support for Depression, Anxiety, and Fear of COVID-19 in Paraguay","The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic forces us to investigate new emotional phenomena, as well as the validity of psychological variables associated with well-being and mental health. In this cross-sectional study with a correlative-predictive scope, there were 265 participants, adults residing in the Republic of Paraguay. The objectives of this research were to determine the predictive power and dominance of the social support and purpose variables for depression, anxiety, and fear of COVID-19. Both social support and purpose presented a significant negative prediction level for depression. In contrast, only social support presented a negative prediction for anxiety and fear of COVID-19, while purpose even presented a positive relationship with respect to the variable. When evaluating the relationship between the variables of social support and purpose, the perception of meaning presented dominance and negative predictive power for depression, while a positive link between destiny-freedom, depression, anxiety, and fear of COVID-19 was obtained. The probable causes of the results are explained;new research is suggested, and it is concluded on the need to review salutogenic psychological concepts in light of the new pandemic context.","Lombardo, Marcelo Panza, Recalde, Olivia Gamarra, Cervigni, Mauricio, Gallegos, Miguel, Martino, Pablo, Caycho-RodrÃ­guez, TomÃ¡s, Calandra, Manuel, Gamarra, Giuliana Rivera, Razumovskiy, Anastasia","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Predictive+Power+and+Dominance+of+Variables+of+Purpose+and+Social+Support+for+Depression,+Anxiety,+and+Fear+of+COVID-19+in+Paraguay","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Trends in Psychology;: 1-23, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37119,""
"Increasing stoma requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic","Aims The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a change in working practices in the diagnosis and management of colorectal cancer. Guidelines emerged which recommended changing anastomotic practice in favour of forming a defunctioning stoma or end stoma in patients who would have previously had an anastomosis. This study aimed to identify whether these changes have resulted in an increase in patients requiring a stoma and its potential impact. Methods All patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer in the authorsâ€™ tertiary surgical unit in three 4-month intervals were included. These corresponded to before the pandemic (Marchâ€“June 2019), during the UK's first wave of COVID-19 (Marchâ€“June 2020), and during the second wave (December 2020â€“March 2021). The incidence of stomas was compared between groups. Results In patients undergoing elective surgery the incidence of stomas was 13% pre-pandemic. However, this tripled to 39% during the first wave and increased to 54% in the second wave. Similar trends were seen in patients undergoing emergency surgery with 36% having stomas before the pandemic which rose to 50% during both the waves. Conclusion A change in stoma practice was observed with patients having a stoma when they would usually have had an anastomosis only. As COVID-19 continues to have a severe effect on planned surgery in the UK, patients requiring stoma reversal adds to the backlog. As the huge task of clearing the backlog begins, surgical teams must be provided with appropriate resources, professional and mental health support.","Kumaran, Naren, Vijayaregu, Vishal, Abdelqader, Bushra, Chang, Wen Yuan, Sangal, Sam, Polson, Robin","https://www.google.com/search?q=Increasing+stoma+requirements+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: The British journal of surgery; 109(Suppl 5), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37120,""
"Two Routes to Status, One Route to Health: Trait Dominance and Prestige Differentially Associate with Self-reported Stress and Health in Two US University Populations","Objective Social status has been extensively linked to stress and health outcomes. However, two routes by which status can be earned â€“ dominance and prestige â€“ may not uniformly relate to lower stress and better health because of inherent behavioral and stress-exposure differences in these two routes. Methods In one exploratory and two preregistered studies, participants (total N = 978) self-reported their trait dominance and prestige and self-reported several stress and health outcomes. Results The meta-effects evident across the three studies indicate that higher trait dominance was associated with worse outcomes â€“ higher stress, poorer physical and mental health, poorer behavioral health, poorer life satisfaction, higher negative affect (range of absolute values of non-zero correlations, ;r;= [0.074, 0.315], ps &lt; 0.021) â€“ and higher trait prestige was associated with better outcomes â€“ lower stress, better physical and mental health, better behavioral health, better life satisfaction, higher positive and lower negative mood (;r;= [0.134, 0.478], ps &lt; 0.001). These effects remained evident (with few exceptions) after controlling for socioeconomic status, other status-relevant traits, or self-enhancing motives;associations with behavior relevant to the COVID19 pandemic generally were not robust. Conclusions This work indicates that evolved traits related to the preferred route by which status is earned likely impact self-reported stress and health outcomes. Future research is necessary to examine physiological and other objective indicators of stress and health in more diverse populations.

"Rheumatology Referrals to Tertiary Care Hospital over a Three Month Period During Covid-19 Pandemic: a Quality Improvement Project","Background/Aims During the COVID-19 pandemic, waiting times for routine new referrals to our tertiary rheumatology department was &gt;20 weeks. Therefore, a quality improvement project (QIP) was undertaken to understand the nature of these referrals and develop an alternative option to rheumatology review. Our aim was to reduce waiting times and improve patient experience by better integrating primary, secondary and therapy services, as well as provide additional triage options. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of all routine referrals over a 3-month period (1st April to 30th June 2020). Urgent referrals including GCA, CTD and EIA were excluded. Results A total of 92/143 (64%) patients were referred, a more significant reduction than normal due to the pandemic. Median age [IQR] was 39.5 [28-66.25] years and most referrals (79%) were from primary care. Table 1 represents information included in the referrals. Thirty-one patients had previously undergone a rheumatology review, of which 11 (35%) were seen in our department. Of these, 18/31 (58%) patients had a diagnosis of Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder (HSD) or fibromyalgia.

Based on this, we conducted a regional GP trainee educational session and highlighted: i) key features in investigation and management of common rheumatological conditions ii) vital information to include in referrals based on presenting complaint(s) and working diagnosis. We developed a pathway for patients previously diagnosed with fibromyalgia or HSD in our department and re-referred with worsening symptoms, to be triaged into a newly set up weekly specialist MSK physiotherapy-led clinic with rheumatology supervision. Future work will involve re-assessing routine new-referral waiting times and evaluating pre- and post-physiotherapy intervention MSK and quality of life scores, with the aim of formulating a business case to conduct this clinic on a permanent basis. We hope incorporating this pathway will lead to improved patient outcomes and ease some departmental management decisions. Disclosure B. Khan: None. T. David: None. C. Clegg: None. B.

"Q&A: Know yourself to better help others â€“ psychologist","Speed read Psychology still misunderstood as a field of study: dementia specialist But, greater awareness is changing attitudes towards mental health Understanding yourself means you are better able to help others It took 15 years for psychologist Elizabeth Mutungaâ€™s father to be diagnosed with Alzheimerâ€™s disease, after he began forgetting what day it was. Psychology seems like something of an unorthodox choice for study in Sub-Saharan Africa, as we often hear that mental health is not well understood in the region. Because a lot of people who are studying psychology are women â€” there are men in the field, but a lot of women study psychology.

"Coronavirus-related stress, anxiety, and obsessive thinking in patients undergoing cardiac rehabilitation during the COVID19 pandemic","Funding Acknowledgements Type of funding sources: Public grant(s) â€“ National budget only. Main funding source(s): Slovenian Research Agency and Ministry of Health of the Republic of Slovenia Background The coronavirus (COVID19) pandemic has disrupted the provision of health care, including cardiac rehabilitation. Reduced healthcare provision has been associated with reduced accessibility, wheares patientsâ€™ perspectives â€“ such as COVID19-related anxiety, stress and obsessive thinking â€“ have been less thouroghly addressed. Methods This was a cross-sectional study of COVID19-related anxiety, stress and obsessive thinking in consecutive patients undergoing outpatient cardiac rehabilitation after myocardial infarction at two centres â€” a general hospital catering a predominantly rural area and a university hospital in an urban area. From April to October 2021 we captured patientsâ€™ clinical and socio-economic characteristics, and resposes to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) as well as to three dedicated COVID19-related questionnaires â€“ the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, the Obsession with COVID-19 Scale and a customized COVID-19 Stress Scale. Results We included 109 patients (mean age 59Â±10 years, 20% women). Fifteen (13.8%) and eleven (11%) patients reached a HADS treshold for depression and anxiety, respectively. Pateints expressed most concenrs regarding the safety of COVID19 vaccinces (60.6%) on the COVID19 Stress Scale, sleeping disturbances (14.8%) on the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, and fear of interacting with infected people (30.3%) on the Obsession with COVID-19 Scale. No significant differences were observed between respondents from the general and the university hospital. HADS score and social statusâ€”but not age, sex and clinical characteristicsâ€”were associated with scores on the COVID-19-specific questionnaires;HADS-anxiety domain score remained an independent predictor of COVID19-related stress (p=0.009), obsessive thinking (p&lt;0.001) and anxiety (p=0.009) after multivariate adjustment. Conclusions Patients undergoing cardiac rehabilitation expressed relatively low levels of COVID19-related stress and anxiety. Higher levels of COVID19-related stress, anxiety, and obsessive thinking were observed in patients with higher levels of anxiety, but not in association with demographic or clinical characteristics.","Jug, B.; Farkas Lainscak, J.; Sedlar, N.; Stojnic, D.; Lainscak, M.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Coronavirus-related+stress,+anxiety,+and+obsessive+thinking+in+patients+undergoing+cardiac+rehabilitation+during+the+COVID19+pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of preventive cardiology; 29(Suppl 1), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37124,""
"Physiotherapy services in axial spondyloarthritis in the North West of England An ASSIGNw benchmarking survey","Background/Aims The physiotherapist's role in the assessment and management of axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) is evolving. The axSpA Specialist Interest Group North-West (ASSIGNw) surveyed practices of its members in 2016. This  reports on a 5-year follow-up survey, exploring how our North-West physiotherapy axSpA services are running following the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim is to benchmark practice of physiotherapists working with axSpA, identifying discrepancies between services and recommending ways forward. Methods In June 2021, members of ASSIGNw identified areas of practice to benchmark;questions were formulated to elucidate these, creating a SmartSurveyTM sent to ASSIGNw members August-September 2021. Results Sixteen Trusts replied, two more than the 2016 survey. Ratios of physiotherapy:medical staffing range from 1:1 to 1:8. All centres intended to offer virtual appointments as a long-term option. The majority of centres (60%) offered yearly follow up;40% offered 6-monthly follow up. The median appointment duration had reduced from 45 minutes in 2016 to 30 minutes in 2021. The number of centres offering 60 minute slots reduced from 36% in 2016 to 20% in 2021. The vast majority of consults were undertaken independently by the physiotherapist (86%), a small number offering combined appointments with medical colleagues (7.1%). Half of centres surveyed had no access to onsite hydrotherapy, most of these actively signpost to local pools for self-led water-based exercise (62.5%). A dedicated flare/emergency access service was not offered by 60% of centres. Most centres undertake patient education on a one-to-one basis (94%);formal axSpA education programmes are only offered in one centre surveyed.

Conclusion This survey, as in 2016, has highlighted a large inter-trust variation in physiotherapy:medic staffing ratio. A broad collection of outcome measures was collected and there is an unchanged general consensus that the BASMI and BASDAI are essential. The average and maximum appointment durations have both reduced. Urgent/flare and hydrotherapy access remains limited. Formal patient education is yet to be adopted, one-to-one education remains the prevalent model. Further work on standardising axSpA physiotherapy-led services is warranted. As we drive forwards best-care, the enhanced use of the full rheumatology multi-disciplinary team and standardisation of staffing levels is recommended. Disclosure W.J.

"Tackling cardiovascular prevention after coronary disease settled: the challenges of guideline implementation","Funding Acknowledgements Type of funding sources: None. Purpose Cardiovascular disease (CVD) as it is known, is a multifactorial disease that needs to be addressed exactly in that way. Knowledge deficit regarding symptoms and unadjusted lifestyles are still the most relevant nursing diagnoses identified as main causes for readmissions in patients with CVD (1). Recent guidelines evidenced that after a CVD event, patients should attend to their lifestyle choices and health behaviors, in order to avoid future events, as this works in a cardioprotective way (2). Having programs structured in a way that makes it possible to involve both population and person-centered strategies all teamed up, could be a way of involving patients in their own care, tackling several recommendations at the same time. Our aim is to describe the implementation of a cardiovascular disease prevention program with a multidisciplinary approach and identify the most prevalent CVD risk factors during the first trimester of its implementation. Methods In order to improve patient outcomes post-discharge, the program was outlined as follows: firstly. a Multidisciplinary Appointment was structured, with a Cardiologist and a Nurse, where also family is invited, to assess risk factors, therapeutic adherence and quality of life. According to the patient's needs and preferences they can be assigned to the Cardiac Rehabilitation Lab, to the Education Group Sessions on CVD risk factors where a Nutritionist, Psychiatrist and Physiatrist also participate according to the sessions' topic. For more personalized approach it also comprises: Therapeutic Groups and Mental Health Appointment;Nutrition Appointment;and Nursing Counseling at Outpatient clinics for family and person-centered approach. To assess the program at its third month baseline the focus group method was used for patients and professionals perspectives. Results The program was implemented from October to December 2021. During that time 24 patients were admitted. Nursing Counseling was needed for almost all patients for different reasons. Out of those, 50% were assigned to the group sessions, 33.33% were assigned to the Cardiac Rehab, 12.5% were oriented to the Nutrition consults and 20,83% to the Mental Health consults. Even though we offered therapeutic groups as an option for some patients, none of them were willing to go. Regarding the modifiable risk factors, 70% of patients had 3 or more risk factors, showing that we do have a high risk population to tackle. Putting it into perspective, the most prevalent risk factors were dyslipidemia (70.83%), tobacco use (70.83%), obesity (54.17%) and hypertension (50%). Conclusions Managing a multidisciplinary program can be demanding, and there were several challenges to this programâ€™s implementation such as: short-staffing, structural issues, covid-19 prevention issues, digital systems, agendas, etc.). But focusing on patients' needs and preferences, helped us to do our utmost to make this program happen.","Gomes, A.

Introduction The current COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant changes in physical and mental health and has become a major challenge for cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs. CR is an essential component in the treatment of heart failure (HF), as it improves cardiorespiratory fitness and quality of life, as well as reducing hospitalization rates. COVID-19 pandemic increased social isolation, and the CR centers were closed. Center-based CR requires the patient to travel to the hospital, which increases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this high-risk population. In this context, home-based CR can be an excellent strategy to reduce the physical and mental consequences of the social isolation imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective To test the effectiveness of a home-based CR program on cardiorespiratory fitness and anxiety and depression levels in individuals with HF during covid-19 pandemic. Methods Forty-two individuals with HF (age: 61.3Â±12.0;LVEF: 37.5Â±11.2) were included in this study. The exercise training program consisted in 12 weeks of combined exercise training (2x/week;60min/day, 60-80% VO2peak), with 4 supervised exercise sessions in the hospital context and the remaining at home. Patients were monitored using a heart rate monitor and weekly phone calls. The following parameters were evaluated: cardiorespiratory fitness through the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and anxiety and depression levels through the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results After the home-based CR program, there was a significant increase in the 6MWT of 49 meters (95%IC: 38 to 60;p&lt;0.001) and a significant decrease in anxiety levels of -1.12 points (95%CI: - 2.163 to -0.075 p=0.036). No significant changes were found in depression levels (p=0.954). Furthermore, the improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness were significantly associated with the reduction in the levels of anxiety (r= -0.281;p=0.028) and depression (r=: -0.278;p=0.030). Conclusions The home-based CR program was able to improve cardiorespiratory fitness and this improvement was associated with a decrease in anxiety and depression levels in individuals with HF. The results suggest that home-based CR can be an important strategy to minimize the physical and mental impact induced by social isolation imposed by COVID-19 pandemic in HF patients.","Gois, P.; Magalhaes, S.; Alexandre, A.; Barreira, A.; Fernandes, P.; Ribeiro, F.; Schmidt, C.; Santos, M.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Home-based+cardiac+rehabilitation+can+reduce+anxiety+and+depression+in+heart+failure+patients","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of preventive cardiology; 29(Suppl 1), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37127,""
"Outcomes from a digital cardiovascular prevention and rehabilitation programme delivered in Ireland during COVID 19","Funding Acknowledgements Type of funding sources: Public grant(s) â€“ National budget only. Main funding source(s): Government of Ireland's SlÃ¡intecare Integration Fund Health Research Board, Ireland Background & Aim COVID 19 has accelerated the uptake and acceptance of digital health tools for the prevention and management of Cardiovascular Disease. With health systems being urged to learn from the pandemic and to reassess how they will deliver services in future, robust audit and evaluation of digital interventions are required to inform best practice. This study aims to evaluate the clinical outcomes of a digital CVD prevention and rehabilitation programme which was established during COVID 19 to provide cardiac patients with efficient and timely access to a home-based, structured, comprehensive programme of care. Methods Developed and delivered by an interdisciplinary team (Nurse Prescriber, Physiotherapist, Dietitian, Cardiologist), the core components of this 12 week programme included, behavioural change support, lifestyle modification, medical risk factor management and electronic prescribing of cardio-protective medication. To support self-management, patients were provided with a Fitbit, blood pressure monitor and a workbook to support goal setting and overall tracking of progress. Patients were given access to a bespoke web-based platform and invited to attend weekly (2hr) group-based sessions, which included an exercise component and an interactive educational workshop. Results Over a 4 month period, 105 patients were referred with an uptake rate of 73% (n=77). Of these, 97% (n=75) enrolled in the programme, with an 85% (n=64) completion rate. Significant improvements in CVD risk factors were observed between initial and end of programme assessment. The proportion of patients meeting guideline-recommended physical activity targets increased from 14 to 82% (p&lt;0.001), mean BMI (kg/m2) reduced from 28.7 to 27.7 (p&lt;0.001), mean Mediterranean diet score improved from 5.2 to 7.3 (p&lt;0.001), and anxiety and depression levels =8 (Hospital Anxiety and Depression score) both reduced by more than 50% (p&lt;0.001). The proportions achieving the recommended blood pressure (&lt;130/80 mmHg) and LDL cholesterol targets (&lt;1.4 mmol/L) increased from 24 to 68% (p&lt;0.001) and 14 to 41% (p&lt;0.001), respectively. Conclusion Outcomes from this programme demonstrate that digital CVD prevention and rehabilitation programmes can achieve the recommended lifestyle, medical and therapeutic targets associated with reduced CVD events and improved health outcomes. This programme represents a scalable, accessible and effective option to deliver vital CVD preventive care in the patientâ€™s home.","Gibson, I.; McCrudden, Z.; Harris, A.; Hynes, L.; Dunne, D.; Murphy, A.; Byrne, M.; McEvoy, J.

"Job Loss, Financial Hardship, and Sleep during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Differences by Sex/Gender and Race/Ethnicity","Introduction In the United States (US), health and financial consequences of COVID-19 have disproportionately impacted minoritized groups. Yet, few US studies have investigated COVID-related financial loss/consequences and sleep health disparities. Methods To investigate differences by sex/gender and race/ethnicity in cross-sectional associations between both job/business loss and substantial financial hardship (SFH) with sleep health, we used data collected from 12/2020 to 2/2021 among 4,726 men and women in the nationally representative COVID-19 Unequal Racial Burden (CURB) Study (N=5,500 American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN), Asian, Black, Hispanic/Latino, Multiracial, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (NH/PI), and non-Hispanic (NH)-White adults). Participants reported job/business loss since the start of the pandemic (yes, no) and SFH (e.g., unable to pay for housing costs). Poor sleep health was defined as concurrence of self-reported fair/poor sleep quality, non-restorative sleep, sleep problems, and difficulty falling asleep in the past week. Adjusting for sociodemographic and health characteristics and receipt of financial assistance, weighted Poisson regression with robust variance estimated prevalence ratios (PRs) for poor sleep overall, by sex/gender, and by race/ethnicity. Results Men and women equally reported both job/business loss (20%) and SFH (11% men and 12% women). Minoritized racial/ethnic groups except Asians most frequently reported job/business loss (20%-25% vs. 16% Asian, 13% NH-White) and SFH (11%-15% vs. 9% NH-White, 5% Asian). Poor sleep health was more prevalent among women (21%) than men (14%) and among AI/AN, NH/PI, and Multiracial adults (each 22% vs. 11%-19% remaining racial/ethnic groups). Both job/business loss and SFH were associated with a higher prevalence of poor sleep health, overall. Compared to women, men had stronger associations for both job/business loss (PRmen=1.80 [95% CI:1.39,2.33], PRwomen=1.23 [1.01,1.50];pinteraction=0.01) and SFH (PRmen=4.46 [3.18,6.26]), PRwomen= 1.82 [1.45,2.30];pinteraction=0.01). For job/business loss, associations were strongest among Asians (PR=2.07 [1.32,3.23] vs. PR range=0.88-1.89;pinteraction=0.09). Conclusion COVID-19 related job/business loss and financial hardship were both associated with poorer sleep health, and associations for job/business loss were strongest among men and Asian adults.

"A Call to Action: Integration of Buprenorphine Prescribing into the Care of Persons with HIV and Opioid Use Disorder","During the COVID-19 pandemic, we also experienced a worsening opioid overdose epidemic. Untreated opioid use disorder (OUD) in persons with HIV is associated with worse HIV-related outcomes. Buprenorphine is a safe, evidence-based medication for OUD and is effective in reducing opioid craving and overdose and improving outcomes along the HIV care continuum. Despite the longstanding evidence supporting the benefits of buprenorphine, there remains an implementation gap in the uptake of buprenorphine prescribing in HIV care settings. To improve integration of OUD care and HIV primary care, we recommend 1) all HIV clinicians obtain a buprenorphine waiver, 2) teaching on OUD should be integrated into infectious diseases and HIV continuing medical education, and 3) previously validated models of integrated care should be leveraged to urgently expand access to buprenorphine for persons with HIV and OUD.","Fujita, A.

"A Qualitative Investigation of the Positive and Negative Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Post-Secondary Studentsâ€™ Mental Health and Well-Being","Evidence suggests that post-secondary students without pre-existing mental health concerns may have experienced worsening mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, relative to students with pre-existing mental health concerns. To clarify the psychological impacts of the pandemic, and elucidate why differences may exist among students, 20 interviews were conducted with emerging adults enrolled in university. Using directed content analysis, eight themes were identified: three more common among students with pre-existing mental health concerns, three more common among students without pre-existing mental health concerns, and two shared. Although all students experienced novel stressors during the pandemic, students without pre-existing mental health concerns reported greater increases in social and academic isolation, relative to students with pre-existing mental health concerns. Students with pre-existing mental health concerns also leveraged existing coping repertoires, which further supported their ability to manage pandemic-related challenges.

"Deep sedation with dexmedetomidine administered by electrophysiologists during COVID-19 pandemic compared with propofol administered by anesthesiologists for ablation of atrial fibrillation","Funding Acknowledgements Type of funding sources: None. Background COVID-19 pandemic, limiting the availability of anesthesiologists, has impacted heavily on the organization of invasive cardiac procedures such as transcatheter atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. Purpose We compared the safety and efficacy of deep sedation with dexmedetomidine administered by electrophysiologists without anesthesiologist supervision, against the standard protocol performed with propofol. Methods We retrospectively included all AF ablation procedures performed in 2020: 23 patients sedated with 1% propofol (2 ml bolus followed by infusion starting at 1 mg/Kg/h), 26 patients with dexmedetomidine (infusion starting at 0.7 mcg/Kg/h). Both groups additionally received 1 mcg/Kg of midazolam as a single bolus and 0.05 mg single boluses of fentanyl prior to ablation on each pair of pulmonary veins (PV). Primary outcomes were oxygen desaturation (&lt; 90%) or need for assisted ventilation/intubation, bradycardia (heart rate &lt; 45 bpm) and persistent hypotension (systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg). Results Baseline characteristics and hemodynamic variables did not differ between the two groups (all p &gt; 0.05). In 8/23 (35%) patients propofol infusion velocity reduction was necessary to maintain the hemodynamic values, compared to 7/26 (27%) with dexmedetomidine. Inter-group comparison of hemodynamic variables during the procedure showed no statistically significant difference, despite a trend in favor of dexmedetomidine (3 respiratory depressions and 3 persistent hypotension episodes with propofol vs. 0 with dexmedetomidine;p = 0.057). Conclusion Deep sedation with dexmedetomidine administered by electrophysiologists without anesthesiologist supervision is safe and effective for AF transcatheter ablation. A trend towards a lower incidence of hypotension and respiratory depression was noted when compared to propofol.","Ebrille, E.; Lucciola, M.

"â€œDrilling Downâ€: psychiatry and dentistry in collaborative action","Aims People with severe mental health illnesses experience multiple adverse physical health outcomes, in part caused by difficulties accessing, engaging with health promoting behaviour, treatment and recovery strategies. As oral health is a major contributor to physical and mental wellbeing, obstacles to care, prevention, and therapy play an important role in the oral health of individuals with mental illnesses. Psychiatric medications are known to predispose to oral health pathologies, including sialorrhea and dental caries, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may rarely result in dental fractures, and substance misuse may contribute to poor dental health. Unsurprisingly, COVID-19 has been more acutely noticed by those already at risk of worse oral health outcomes, including people with mental health conditions. Methods We address the interplay between mental health and dental care, outline evidence behind the vital importance of collaborative working, and advocate for a joint approach between mental health and dental teams utilising harm reviews adapted to assessing the impact of delay dental care upon patients and familiesâ€™ quality of life. As COVID-19 persists and winter pressures are experienced every year, these raise the question of what needs to be done to demonstrate the effects of poor oral health on patients with learning difficulties and mental illness. Results With annual winter pressures in healthcare, many elective operations are postponed to allow capacity for increased demand. Dental general anaesthetics are amongst the first lists to be suspended, particularly since the arrival of COVID-19. During the first peak of the pandemic, limited access to personal protective equipment and concerns over viral transmission risked by aerosol generating procedures restricted the provision of community dental care to urgent cases, and dental general anaesthetics to life-threatening infections alone.These impacts were particularly acute for those with learning difficulties and mental illness, further exacerbated by social, geographical and financial inequalities. Waiting for patients to deteriorate to access dental care treatment seems in direct opposition to the mental health movement towards community and early management of mental illnesses. Conclusion Adapted harm reviews are a powerful tool for mental health and dental teams to demonstrate to hospital managers the multidimensional impact that poor oral health has and causing physical, behavioural and emotional deterioration on patients, families and supporting staff. Wider understanding of the dental needs of those with mental health conditions may foster research on the interplay between oral and psychological health, and remains vital to multidisciplinary, compassionate and holistic care.","Cattra, Chiara, Malaga, Elizabeth Gonzalez","https://www.google.com/search?q=â€œDrilling+Downâ€:+psychiatry+and+dentistry+in+collaborative+action","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych open; 8(Suppl 1):S88-S89, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37135,""

"A programme to support resilience and clinical excellence in inherited cardiac conditions nurses based in the hospital and charity sector during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond","Funding Acknowledgements Type of funding sources: Foundation. Main funding source(s): The Burdett Trust for Nursing Background The COVID-19 pandemic affected health care systems profoundly. Inherited cardiac condition (ICC) specialist nurses were redeployed to intensive care or acute settings which either left services with no nurse or a single nurse manning a normally busy service (Bueser 2020). An exponential rise in patients reaching out to patient support charities was seen (Charity Today 2020) and at the peak of the pandemic, nurses based at an ICC charity dealt with 599 inquiries which was a 328% increase in activity. The toll on the mental health of nurses during the pandemic is well documented and programmes have been suggested to address this which includes peer support and psychological support by clinical psychologists Purpose The aim was to develop and strengthen collaborations between ICC specialist nurses in a tertiary hospital and those working in the community charity sector;and provide peer and psychological support to enable consistent high quality patient care. Methods The project was based on Wengerâ€™s (1999) Communities of Practice (COP) framework model of situational learning, collaboration among peers, working to a common purpose. To develop the counselling aspect, a psychotherapist led a scoping exercise with the group. The 4Rs Skilled Helper Programme (SHP) of reflective learning, supervision and continuing professional development was then adapted as a bespoke programme - combining 30 hours of formal counselling, communication and reflective learning skills with equal attention to the normative, formative and restorative components of support and development needed to ensure practitioner health and wellbeing and the safety and quality of patient care Results Nine ICC nurses from a tertiary hospital and 3 from the charity sector participated in the project. Nine nurses undertook the tailored 4RS SHP course, adapting Egan's 3 stage problem-solving, decision-making and opportunity development framework as the vehicle for personalised, psychosocial, time-sensitive decision-making and informed consent for patients, and for the identification of support and development strategies that represent the 'best fit' for both clients and practitioners in their particular social and organisational circumstances. Counselling supervision is ongoing on a whole group, team and individual basis and provides opportunities to discuss collaborations, gain support for challenging clinical cases and work situations;and promoting psychological well-being. Conclusions The COP established through this project alongside the development of a bespoke counselling course and psychological supervision is an exemplar of how nurses can be empowered to continue to provide excellent care despite challenging circumstances. The 4RS SHP course also specifically addresses the competency needs for ICC nurses as move towards a genomics-driven, personalised health care delivery model.","Bueser, T.; Phillips, A.; Kirkby, C.; Partridge, J.; Kearl, F.; Moss, L.; Evans, C.; Sanders, J.","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+programme+to+support+resilience+and+clinical+excellence+in+inherited+cardiac+conditions+nurses+based+in+the+hospital+and+charity+sector+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic+and+beyond","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of cardiovascular nursing; 21(Suppl 1), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37137,""

"GENDER DIFFERENCE IN PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS SYMPTOMS IN CARDIAC OUTPATIENTS AT THE TIME OF COVIDâ€“19 PANDEMIC THE ABC STUDY ON HEART DISEASE","Introduction COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVIDâ€“19) exerts a significant impact on public health since it has reached a pandemic level in March 2020 and a high rate of negative mental health outcomes has been reported in the Italian general population. Purpose We aimed to investigate the pandemic impact on the psychological status of, COVIDâ€“19 negative, cardiac patients and if there are any gender differences. Methods Consecutive COVIDâ€“19 free patients who were presented to the cardiac outpatient clinic of Conegliano general hospital were divided into 2 groups according to their presentation, either before or during the COVIDâ€“19 Pandemic. The presence or absence of stress symptoms was established based on the patientâ€™s selfâ€“assessment psychoâ€“emotion questionnaire based on a reproduced form of Cohenâ€™s perceived stress scale. Results A total of 310 patients were included in this analysis. Patientsâ€™ mean age was 65Â±18.5 years, males were 57% with 128 (41%) and 132 (59%) patients presented before and during the pandemic respectively. Both patientsâ€™ groups shared most of the demographic and clinical characteristics. In all patients, stress symptoms were reported in (52% VS 60%;p = 0.15) for patients who were presented before and during the pandemic, respectively. In male patients, stress symptoms were more frequent in patients who were presented during the pandemic (59%) compared to the preâ€“pandemic presented male patients (43%);(p = 0.03). Yet, no difference in the frequency of stress symptoms was observed in female patients. In an ageâ€“adjusted logistic regression analysis, psychological stress was significantly higher in male patients who were presented during the pandemic (Odds Ratio [OR]=2.0;95% confidence interval [CI]=1.1â€“3.6;p = 0.03). Although, no significant difference was observed in female patients (OR = 0.8;95% CI = 0.4â€“1.7;p = 0.63). Same results were obtained using the fully adjusted model, (OR = 1.9;95% CI = 1.0â€“3.5;p = 0.04) and (OR = 0.8;95% CI = 0.4â€“1.7;p = 0.64), for male and female patients, respectively. Conclusion Psychological stress symptoms has been observed more frequently in male patients seen during the COVIDâ€“19 pandemic, with almost double risk compared to the preâ€“pandemic, independently from baseline clinical characteristics. No difference in the frequency of stress symptoms was observed in female patients.","Berton, G.; Mahmoud, H.; Cavuto, F.; Bagato, F.; Palmieri, R.; Stocchero, L.; Selvestrel, E.; Allocca, G.; Lorenzon, E.; Merotto, D.","https://www.google.com/search?q=GENDER+DIFFERENCE+IN+PSYCHOLOGICAL+STRESS+SYMPTOMS+IN+CARDIAC+OUTPATIENTS+AT+THE+TIME+OF+COVIDâ€“19+PANDEMIC.+THE+ABC+STUDY+ON+HEART+DISEASE","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European heart journal supplements : journal of the European Society of Cardiology; 24(Suppl C), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37139,""
"Queer Times, Black Futures","""2 Kara Keeling's effort echoes Lordc's excavation of deep-earth Black wisdom that, as the late poet writes, becomes a ""jewel in . . . open light"" and that might service what historian Robin Kelley has termed freedom dreams-""the dream of a new world"" entertained and envisioned by activists and artists that might form the ""catalyst for . . . political engagement"" in our time.3 Keeling enhances Kelley's principle by considering Nassim Nicholas Taleb's trope of the ""Black Swan event,"" which is ""characterized by 'a combination of low predictability and large impact'"" and manifests as reliance upon what is known rather than the inevitable eruptions of the unknown.4 Keeling leverages Taleb's principle to explain how the long history of revolutions can still be narrated as surprises within the colonial mindset. ""5 Freedom dreams are also, as Keeling demonstrates in her book, expressed in such layered texts as Grace Jones's video for ""Corporate Cannibal"" as well as C. L. R. James's 1953 study Mariners, Renegades, and Castaways.6 This orientation toward a more just future to come-one that ""requires (recreation and imagination""-is recognized as ""what Frantz Fanon referred to as a 'real leap.' ""' Keeling's interest in these potentialities, ""(re)turns,"" and ""the (im)possible"" is constructed as anticapital;the resources she identifies are for the enactment of a sustainable, ethical world that is not just divested from but radically un-invested in property, accumulation, and the injustices that follow investment in those capitalist, settler-colonial fictions.8 If poetry resists the lure of rendering the felt into material, so too does it effectively transmit queer dreams of a radical future because ""Ipjoetry is a way of entering the unknown and carrying back the impossible. ""9 Keeling's book resonates with Stephen Best's 2018 monograph, None Like Us: Blackness, Belonging, Aesthetic Life, in their shared concern about the character of Black study and the utopianism of queer thought.10 But whereas Best is invested in critiquing the Black history-bound subject of Afropessimism and the queer utopian subject who is alienated from an insistence upon a future bound up with narratives of reproduction, Keeling's approach seems much more expansive in its characterization of Black and queer radicalism. Queer Times, Black Futures explores the philosophical principle of the ""'Black Swan' event""-that which ""appears to be a random, unpredictable, outlier,"" otherwise called the unthinkable-through and against another of Taleb's books, Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder.b In so doing, it offers that what is radical, unpredictable, and capable of surviving the disasters of late capitalism and environmental catastrophe is identifiable (though not knowable) as Black and queer thought.","Baker, Courtney R.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Queer+Times,+Black+Futures","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Cinema and Media Studies; 60(1):164-167, 2020.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37140,""

"Impact of Social Media Exposure on Risk Perceptions, Mental Health Outcomes, and Preventive Behaviors during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Saudi Arabia","Introduction Social media has played a key role in mediating the communication of information during the COVID-19 pandemic. The way information is shared through social media shapes people's risk perceptions, which in turn affects their mental health and behaviors. This study aimed to assess social media's impact on the public's risk perceptions, mental health, and preventive behaviors during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A Web-based survey was developed to assess social media exposure, risk perceptions, mental health, and COVID-19-related preventive behaviors among adults in Saudi Arabia. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify the association between social media exposure and key measurements. Results A total of 1,500 individuals participated in the study;of those, 93.2% of participants reported using social media for COVID-19-related information. Twitter (68.3%) followed by Snapchat (25.1%) were the most used platforms. About 44.4% of participants were highly exposed to social media. High social media exposure was significantly associated with higher risks of anxiety (OR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.19â€“2.05) and depression (OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.01â€“2.81) and higher levels of COVID-19 risk perception (OR = 1.43, 95% CI: 1.08â€“1.89). However, social media has no significant impact on the adoption of preventive behaviors. Discussion/Conclusion Our results were consistent with the other international studies that were conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The anticipated future increase in social media use urges the need for longitudinal studies to investigate the psychological and behavioral effects of social media during emerging pandemics.","Alrasheed, Meshael, Alrasheed, Salman, Alqahtani, Amani Salem","https://www.google.com/search?q=Impact+of+Social+Media+Exposure+on+Risk+Perceptions,+Mental+Health+Outcomes,+and+Preventive+Behaviors+during+the+COVID-19+Pandemic+in+Saudi+Arabia","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Saudi Journal of Health Systems Research;: 1-7, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37142,""
"[Resilience and General Self-Efficacy are Related to Perception of COVID-19 Symptomatology, Mental Health, and Coping with Acute COVID-19 Infection]","The COVID-19 pandemic may be associated with massive impacts on mental health. For example, people with pre-existing mental illness were particularly vulnerable to mental health deterioration. It is known that resilience and general self-efficacy can be protective factors for mental health in the face of stress and challenge such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This study is the first to examine the associations of resilience and general self-efficacy on mental health coping with acute COVID-19 infection in home isolation. This study is a cross-sectional online survey of people with acute, PCR-diagnosed COVID-19 infection during their home isolation. Recruitment was conducted by telephone via the Freudenstadt health department (Germany). After informed consent, study participants received a link for an online questionnaire. The questionnaire assessed sociodemographic aspects, resilience, general self-efficacy, COVID-19 somatic health, psychological burden (depressiveness, anxiety, somatic symptom disorder), stress experience, and coping strategies. Descriptive statistics, correlational analyses, and multiple linear regressions with resilience and general self-efficacy as independent variables were performed. A total of 224 home-isolated people with acute COVID-19 infection were included in the study. Lower resilience and lower general self-efficacy were each related with more intense perception of COVID-19 somatic symptoms, higher psychological burden, increased stress perception, lower coping skills, and lower experienced support. Resilience and general self-efficacy are essential for mental health as well as for coping with acute COVID-19 infection. They not only protect against negative effects on mental health but also enhance positive effects. Resilience is positively related to the perception and evaluation of somatic COVID-19 symptoms. More resilient people with COVID-19 infection feel physically healthier. Home-isolated people with acute COVID-19 infection should be screened for support needs using standardized brief questionnaires to avoid negative psychological and somatic consequences. Demand-driven, low-threshold, digital, and individualized intervention programs should also be developed and established for the home isolation setting.

Diese Studie ist eine querschnittliche Untersuchung von Menschen mit akuter, PCR-diagnostizierter COVID-19-Infektion wÃƒÂ¤hrend ihrer hÃƒÂ¤uslichen Isolation. Die Rekrutierung erfolgte telefonisch ÃƒÂ¼ber das Gesundheitsamt Freudenstadt (Baden-WÃƒÂ¼rttemberg). Nach Einwilligung erhielten die Studienteilnehmenden einen Link fÃƒÂ¼r einen Online-Fragebogen. Der Fragebogen erfasste soziodemographische Aspekte, Resilienz, Selbstwirksamkeitserwartung, COVID-19-Somatik, psychische Belastung (DepressivitÃƒÂ¤t, Ãƒâ€žngstlichkeit, somatische BelastungsstÃƒÂ¶rung), Stresserleben und Coping-Strategien. Deskriptive Statistiken, Korrelationsanalysen und multiple lineare Regressionen mit Resilienz &amp; Selbstwirksamkeitserwartung als unabhÃƒÂ¤ngige Variablen wurden durchgefÃƒÂ¼hrt. Es konnten 224 hÃƒÂ¤uslich isolierte Menschen mit akuter COVID-19-Infektion eingeschlossen werden. Eine geringere Resilienz &amp; geringere Selbstwirksamkeitserwartung hingen jeweils mit einer stÃƒÂ¤rkeren Wahrnehmung der somatischen COVID-19-Symptome, hÃƒÂ¶herer psychischer Belastung, erhÃƒÂ¶hter Stresswahrnehmung, geringeren Coping-FÃƒÂ¤higkeiten und geringerer wahrgenommener UnterstÃƒÂ¼tzung zusammen. Resilienz &amp; Selbstwirksamkeitserwartung sind sowohl fÃƒÂ¼r die psychische Gesundheit als auch fÃƒÂ¼r die BewÃƒÂ¤ltigung einer akuten COVID-19-Infektion essenziell. Sie schÃƒÂ¼tzen nicht nur vor negativen Effekten auf die psychische Gesundheit, sondern verstÃƒÂ¤rken gleichzeitig auch positive Effekte. Resilienz hÃƒÂ¤ngt auÃƒÅ¸erdem positiv mit der Wahrnehmung und Bewertung somatischer COVID-19-Symptome zusammen, sodass sich resilientere Menschen mit COVID-19-Infektion kÃƒÂ¶rperlich gesÃƒÂ¼nder fÃƒÂ¼hlen. HÃƒÂ¤uslich isolierte Menschen mit akuter COVID-19-Infektion sollten mittels standardisierter KurzfragebÃƒÂ¶gen auf UnterstÃƒÂ¼tzungsbedarf gescreent werden, um negative psychische und somatische Folgen zu vermeiden. Bedarfsorientierte, niedrigschwellige, digitale und individuell angepasste Interventionsprogramme sollten auch fÃƒÂ¼r das hÃƒÂ¤usliche Isolationssetting entwickelt und etabliert werden.","Kowalski, Graf, Schneider, Zipfel, Stengel","https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1876-2777","20220907","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37143,""
"The impacts of COVID-19 on LGBTQ+ foster youth alumni","LGBTQ+ youth frequently experience disparities in outcomes related to permanency and overall well-being while in out-of-home care. These negative outcomes often persist after youth have transitioned out of care, particularly in the domains of housing, education, employment, and mental health. Initial research has found that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated negative physical and mental health outcomes, as well as decreased economic stability among transition age youth. This study seeks to determine if COVID-19 has resulted in unique impacts on foster care alumni, and if these impacts are the same for LGBTQ+ and non-LGBTQ+ transition age youth. This study used data from the 2020 Jim Casey Youth Opportunities Initiative Opportunity Passport Survey to explore these questions. This survey was administered electronically to a national sample of 1223 youth ages 18-26 with lived experience in foster care. Results indicate that relative to non-LGBTQ+ foster care alumni, LGBTQ+ foster care alumni experienced more negative outcomes in housing stability, employment, and mental health/trauma due to COVID-19. No significant differences were found for education-related impacts. Outcomes varied by sex assigned at birth, ethnicity, and sexual orientation, gender identity and expression (SOGIE) of respondents, with female respondents, black, indigenous and other people of color (BIPOC) youth and LGBTQ+ youth being most frequently impacted. Results indicate that relative to non-LGBTQ+ foster care alumni, LGBTQ+ foster care alumni experienced more negative outcomes in housing stability, employment, and mental health/trauma due to COVID-19.

Thematic analysis revealed that participants' developmental processes (e.g., identity exploration, building financial independence) were shaped by pandemic-related stressors, especially unemployment and financial instability. Participants who were able to maintain employment did so but at the risk of their health and safety. Findings also showed that participants experienced feelings of anxiety and depression due to social isolation, but online communication played an important role in combatting loneliness. Findings highlight the potential for trauma-informed and intersectional approaches to practice with SGM emerging adult migrants and expanded health services and temporary entitlement programs to mitigate the pandemic's effects on this population's psychosocial and financial well-being.

"The Toxicology Investigators Consortium Case Registry-the 2021 Annual Report","The Toxicology Investigators Consortium (ToxIC) Core Registry was established by the American College of Medical Toxicology in 2010. The Core Registry collects data from participating sites with the agreement that all bedside and telehealth medical toxicology consultations will be entered. This twelfth annual report summarizes the registry's 2021 data and activity with its additional 8552 cases. Cases were identified for inclusion in this report by a query of the ToxIC database for any case entered from January 1 to December 31, 2021. Detailed data was collected from these cases and aggregated to provide information, which included demographics, reason for medical toxicology evaluation, agent and agent class, clinical signs and symptoms, treatments and antidotes administered, mortality, and whether life support was withdrawn. Gender distribution included 50.4% of cases in females, 48.2% of cases in males, and 1.4% of cases in transgender or gender non-conforming individuals. Non-opioid analgesics were the most commonly reported agent class (14.9%), followed by opioids (13.1%). Acetaminophen was the most common agent reported. Fentanyl was the most common opioid reported and was responsible for the greatest number of fatalities. There were 120 fatalities, comprising 1.4% of all cases. Major trends in demographics and exposure characteristics remained similar to past years' reports. Sub-analyses were conducted to describe new demographic characteristics, including marital status, housing status and military service, the continued COVID-19 pandemic and related toxicologic exposures, and novel substances of exposure.","Love, Karshenas, Spyres, Farrugia, Kang, Nguyen, Campleman, Li, Wax, Brent, Aldy, Abesamis, Acciani, Adeyeye, Adkins, Akpunonu, Al Balushi, Albertson, Algren, Amaducci, Archer, Avera, Babu, Baker, Baumgartner, Bearlin, Beauchamp, Bebarta, Betting, Beuhler, Bird, Blundell, Boroughf, Bourgeois, Boyle, Bradley, Brambl, Brandehoff, Brenner, Brooks, Buchanan, Burns, Cahana, Caja, Calello, Calleo, Camarena-Michel, Canning, Cannon, Cao, Carey, Carpenter, Carreiro, Castaneda, Castelli, Ceretto, Cetaruk, Chenoweth, Christian, Church, Clemons, Colby, Comstock, Conicella, Cook, Correia, Cox, Daigh, Dargan, De Baerdemaeker, DeGelorm, De Olano, Devgun, Dion, Dribben, Dulaney, Eisenga, Epperson, Farah, Farrar, Feng, Fikse, Fisher, Ford, Fox, French, Froberg, Furmaga, Ganetsky, Geib, Gittinger, Graeme, Graham, Greene, Greene, Hail, Halmo, Hartmann, Hatten, Heard, Heise, Hendrickson, Hieger, Hoang, Hodgman, Hoppe, Horowitz, Howard, Hoyte, Hurlbut, Hughes, Hunter, Iwanicki, Jacob, James, Jefri, Jewett, Johnson, Jones, Judge, Kaczor, Kaiser, Kao, Katz, Kazzi, Keenan, Kiernan, Kirschner, Kleinschmidt, Kongkaew, Koons, Kopec, Kosnett, Krasik, Kroll, Kusin, Lai, Lai-Becker, Latch, Lavon, Lavonas, Levine, Lewis, Liebelt, Linnemeyer, Liss, Lo, Lopez, Loughran, Lucyk, Lurie, Majlesi, Makar, Malcho, Malley, Marlin, Marshall, Martin, Matsler, McElyea, Meaden, Monte, Morgan, Mullins, Murphy, Nacca, Nanagas, Nelson, Neumann, Nguyen, Niruntarai, Noble, Obilom, O'Connor, O'Donnell, Othong, Ovakim, Overbeek, Owen, Pakhawadee, Parris, Pepin, Phillips, Pitotti, Pizon, Quang, Rague, Rianprakaiasang, Rickner-Schmidt, Rigatti, Riggan, Riley, Rivera, Ross, Roth, Rothstein, Ruha, Salhanick, Salmo, Santos, Scanlon, Schauben, Scheerlinck, Schwarz, Shah, Shaker, Sharma, Sheikh, Shulman, Simpson, Snow, Sollee, Steck, Stephani, Stott, Sullivan, Surmaitis, Temple, Thompson, Thompson, Thornton, Thurgur, Toce, Tormoehlen, Trautman, Ubani, Vearrier, Wang, Wang, Warpinski, Watson, Waters, Wermuth, Whitledge, Wiegand, Wolk, Wood, Yarema, Yip, Young, Zuckerman","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13181-022-00910-6","20220907","Epidemiology; Medical toxicology; Overdose; Poisoning; Surveillance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37146,""
"Associations between psychosocial risk factors, and changes in substance dependence and psychosocial functioning, during engagement with digital cognitive behavioral therapy for methamphetamine use: use of 'Breaking Free from Substance Abuse' by incarcerated people during the COVID-19 pandemic","Methamphetamine use can be associated with involvement with correctional services and incarceration. Traditionally, treatments for methamphetamine use have been delivered in-person - however, lockdowns initiated during the COVID-19 pandemic significantly reduced access to such in-person support in prisons. Therefore, in May 2020 a digital cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) program for substance use disorders - 'Breaking Free from Substance Abuse'Ã‚Â - was made available across prisons in Ohio in order to meet this treatment gap. This represents the first time this digital CBT intervention has been made widely available to incarcerated people residing in prisons or jails in the United States (US). This was a within-subjects study using data from 2187 Ohio prison residents who engaged with this digital CBT program to address their methamphetamine use. Participants reported multiple psychosocial risk factors, including moderate to severe substance dependence, depression and anxiety; interpersonal conflict; aggressive behavior; paranoia; and difficulties with work, education and accommodation. Significant reductions in substance dependence, depression/anxiety and biopsychosocial impairment, and improvements in quality of life, were identified in the sample. Risk factors were associated with less positive outcomes, specifically interpersonal conflict and poor mental health. Completion of specific components of the program were associated with more positive outcomes - a dose response was also identified. Digital CBT can be delivered in secure US correctional settings and may help to fill unmet needs for in-person treatment. Specifically, this digital CBT program may support incarcerated individuals to address methamphetamine use, with outcomes being associated with psychosocial risk factors and program engagement.","Elison-Davies, Newsome, Jones, Davies, Ward","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40352-022-00190-w","20220907","Breaking Free from Substance Abuse; Cognitive behavioral therapy; Digital; Methamphetamine; Prisons; Treatment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37147,""

"Associations of Depression, Anxiety, Worry, Perceived Stress, and Loneliness Prior to Infection With Risk of Post-COVID-19 Conditions","Few risk factors for long-lasting (Ã¢â€°Â¥4 weeks) COVID-19 symptoms have been identified. To determine whether high levels of psychological distress before SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by depression, anxiety, worry, perceived stress, and loneliness, are prospectively associated with increased risk of developing post-COVID-19 conditions (sometimes called long COVID). This prospective cohort study used data from 3 large ongoing, predominantly female cohorts: Nurses' Health Study II, Nurses' Health Study 3, and the Growing Up Today Study. Between April 2020 and November 2021, participants were followed up with periodic surveys. Participants were included if they reported no current or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection at the April 2020 baseline survey when distress was assessed and returned 1 or more follow-up questionnaires. Depression, anxiety, worry about COVID-19, perceived stress, and loneliness were measured at study baseline early in the pandemic, before SARS-CoV-2 infection, using validated questionnaires. SARS-CoV-2 infection was self-reported during each of 6 monthly and then quarterly follow-up questionnaires. COVID-19-related symptoms lasting 4 weeks or longer and daily life impairment due to these symptoms were self-reported on the final questionnaire, 1 year after baseline. Of 54Ã¢â‚¬Â¯960 participants, 38.0% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°20Ã¢â‚¬Â¯902) were active health care workers, and 96.6% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°53Ã¢â‚¬Â¯107) were female; the mean (SD) age was 57.5 (13.8) years. Six percent (3193 participants) reported a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result during follow-up (1-47 weeks after baseline). Among these, probable depression (risk ratio [RR], 1.32; 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.12-1.55), probable anxiety (RRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.42; 95% CI, 1.23-1.65), worry about COVID-19 (RR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.17-1.61), perceived stress (highest vs lowest quartile: RR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.18-1.81), and loneliness (RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.08-1.61) were each associated with post-COVID-19 conditions (1403 cases) in generalized estimating equation models adjusted for sociodemographic factors, health behaviors, and comorbidities. Participants with 2 or more types of distress prior to infection were at nearly 50% increased risk for post-COVID-19 conditions (RR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.23-1.80). All types of distress were associated with increased risk of daily life impairment (783 cases) among individuals with post-COVID-19 conditions (RR range, 1.15-1.51). The findings of this study suggest that preinfection psychological distress may be a risk factor for post-COVID-19 conditions in individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Future work should examine the biobehavioral mechanism linking psychological distress with persistent postinfection symptoms.","Wang, Quan, Chavarro, Slopen, Kubzansky, Koenen, Kang, Weisskopf, Branch-Elliman, Roberts","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2022.2640","20220907","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37149,""
"The Apple Watch for Monitoring Mental Health-Related Physiological Symptoms: Literature Review","An anticipated surge in mental health service demand related to COVID-19 has motivated the use of novel methods of care to meet demand, given workforce limitations. Digital health technologies in the form of self-tracking technology have been identified as a potential avenue, provided sufficient evidence exists to support their effectiveness in mental health contexts. This literature review aims to identify current and potential physiological or physiologically related monitoring capabilities of the Apple Watch relevant to mental health monitoring and examine the accuracy and validation status of these measures and their implications for mental health treatment. A literature review was conducted from June 2021 to July 2021 of both published and gray literature pertaining to the Apple Watch, mental health, and physiology. The literature review identified studies validating the sensor capabilities of the Apple Watch. A total of 5583 paper titles were identified, with 115 (2.06%) reviewed in full. Of these 115 papers, 19 (16.5%) were related to Apple Watch validation or comparison studies. Most studies showed that the Apple Watch could measure heart rate acceptably with increased errors in case of movement. Accurate energy expenditure measurements are difficult for most wearables, with the Apple Watch generally providing the best results compared with peers, despite overestimation. Heart rate variability measurements were found to have gaps in data but were able to detect mild mental stress. Activity monitoring with step counting showed good agreement, although wheelchair use was found to be prone to overestimation and poor performance on overground tasks. Atrial fibrillation detection showed mixed results, in part because of a high inconclusive result rate, but may be useful for ongoing monitoring. No studies recorded validation of the Sleep app feature; however, accelerometer-based sleep monitoring showed high accuracy and sensitivity in detecting sleep. The results are encouraging regarding the application of the Apple Watch in mental health, particularly as heart rate variability is a key indicator of changes in both physical and emotional states. Particular benefits may be derived through avoidance of recall bias and collection of supporting ecological context data. However, a lack of methodologically robust and replicated evidence of user benefit, a supportive health economic analysis, and concerns about personal health information remain key factors that must be addressed to enable broader uptake.","Lui, Loughnane, Polley, Jayarathna, Breen","https://doi.org/10.2196/37354","20220907","Apple Watch; data; digital health; energy expenditure; heart rate variability; mental health; mobile phone; precision medicine; psychology; sleep tracking; validation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37150,""
"Discovering Long COVID Symptom Patterns: Association Rule Mining and Sentiment Analysis in Social Media Tweets","The COVID-19 pandemic is a substantial public health crisis that negatively affects human health and well-being. As a result of being infected with the coronavirus, patients can experience long-term health effects called long COVID syndrome. Multiple symptoms characterize this syndrome, and it is crucial to identify these symptoms as they may negatively impact patients' day-to-day lives. Breathlessness, fatigue, and brain fog are the 3 most common continuing and debilitating symptoms that patients with long COVID have reported, often months after the onset of COVID-19. This study aimed to understand the patterns and behavior of long COVID symptoms reported by patients on the Twitter social media platform, which is vital to improving our understanding of long COVID. Long COVID-related Twitter data were collected from May 1, 2020, to December 31, 2021. We used association rule mining techniques to identify frequent symptoms and establish relationships between symptoms among patients with long COVID in Twitter social media discussions. The highest confidence level-based detection was used to determine the most significant rules with 10% minimum confidence and 0.01% minimum support with a positive lift. Among the 30,327 tweets included in our study, the most frequent symptoms were brain fog (n=7812, 25.8%), fatigue (n=5284, 17.4%), breathing/lung issues (n=4750, 15.7%), heart issues (n=2900, 9.6%), flu symptoms (n=2824, 9.3%), depression (n=2256, 7.4%) and general pains (n=1786, 5.9%). Loss of smell and taste, cold, cough, chest pain, fever, headache, and arm pain emerged in 1.6% (n=474) to 5.3% (n=1616) of patients with long COVID. Furthermore, the highest confidence level-based detection successfully demonstrates the potential of association analysis and the Apriori algorithm to establish patterns to explore 57 meaningful relationship rules among long COVID symptoms. The strongest relationship revealed that patients with lung/breathing problems and loss of taste are likely to have a loss of smell with 77% confidence. There are very active social media discussions that could support the growing understanding of COVID-19 and its long-term impact. These discussions enable a potential field of research to analyze the behavior of long COVID syndrome. Exploratory data analysis using natural language processing methods revealed the symptoms and medical conditions related to long COVID discussions on the Twitter social media platform. Using Apriori algorithm-based association rules, we determined interesting and meaningful relationships between symptoms.","Matharaarachchi, Domaratzki, Katz, Muthukumarana","https://doi.org/10.2196/37984","20220907","COVID-19; Twitter; association rule mining; bigram analysis; content analysis; data mining; health information; infodemiology; long COVID symptoms; natural language processing; social media analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37151,""
"Ideology and COVID-19 Vaccination Intention: Perceptual Mediators and Communication Moderators","Widespread COVID-19 vaccination is critical to slow the spread of the illness. This study investigates how political ideology is associated with COVID-19 vaccine intention via perceived effectiveness of the vaccine, perceived side effects, and perceived severity of the illness, three key aspects of the Health Belief Model (HBM). This study also examines how partisan information flow moderates the effects of ideology on these three HBM components. Using survey data collected from two battleground states in the 2020 election (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1849), regression, mediation and moderation analyses revealed that conservatives were less likely to intend to get vaccinated against COVID-19, and this association was significantly mediated by perceived effectiveness and perceived side effects of vaccination, as well as perceived severity of COVID-19. In addition, partisanship of news sources and discussion partners were significant moderators of ideology's association with perceived vaccine effectiveness, with conservatives viewing COVID-19 vaccination as less effective if they were frequently exposed to liberal news, and if they had frequent conversations with fellow conservatives. This suggests boomerang effects for cross-cutting mass media exposure, and reinforcement effect for interpersonal communication. Implications for efforts to promote COVID-19 vaccine uptake are discussed, including tailored and targeted campaign strategies.","Jiang, Hwang, Su, Wagner, Shah","https://doi.org/10.1080/10810730.2022.2117438","20220907","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37152,""
"Influencing factors of fatigue among public health nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study","This study investigated the effects of occupational stress, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance on the level of fatigue among public health nurses (PHNs). The study had a cross-sectional, correlational survey design. A total of 198 PHNs were enrolled from 30 public healthcare centers/offices. Data were collected between May and July 2021 using a structured questionnaire to investigate the general characteristics, occupational stress, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, and fatigue of the participants. Descriptive statistics and multiple regressions were used to determine fatigue and its influencing factors among PHNs. The participants showed high fatigue and occupational stress levels due to a lack of rewards. The percentage of participants with mild-to-severe anxiety and mild-to-severe depression, and those who identified themselves as poor sleepers were 44.9%, 50.5%, and 70.2%, respectively. High levels of sleep disturbance (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â .23, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001), occupational stress (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â .21, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001), anxiety (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â .20, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .016), depression (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â .17, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .043), being younger (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â -.15, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .004), and being a regular worker (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â .13, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .017) were influencing factors of fatigue. Individual efforts and organizational interventions to enhance sleep quality are needed to relieve fatigue among PHNs. Further, organizational support can be considerate of young nurses and regular workers, and alleviate their occupational stress. Moreover, anxiety and depression should be managed efficiently to reduce fatigue.","Cho, Yoon, Kim","https://doi.org/10.1111/phn.13131","20220907","anxiety; depression; fatigue; nurses; occupational stress; public health; sleep disturbance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37153,""

"The role of parental conflict in predicting adolescent depression symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal study","The present study was designed to investigate the association and the underlying mechanism between parental conflict and adolescent depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. In a longitudinal study, a total of 655 Chinese adolescents ranging from 13 to 16Ã‚Â years old completed a three-wave survey (W1, W2, W3) via a survey website. The data was collected three times: March 15-20, 2020 (W1, the outbreak period of the COVID-19 pandemic in Mainland China), June 20-25, 2020 (W2, the trough stage), and December 15-20, 2020 (W3, six months after the trough stage). The SPSS 16.0 software was used to investigate the relationships among study variables. The findings showed that a double-hump effect was found for depression detection among adolescents during the pandemic, with depression rates in W1 (26.9%) and W3 (29%) were higher than that in W2 (21.9%). The parental conflict subscales of content and resolution had a greater impact on adolescent adjustment than other subscales. The parental conflict had direct and indirect impacts (through reducing family support and increasing burdensomeness) on adolescent depression symptoms in W3. It was concluded that when the COVID-19 pandemic was in a trough curve for more than six months, adolescent adjustment was significantly impacted by the pandemic, and parental conflict was an important risk factor in predicting individual adjustment. Therefore, family intervention is recommended when improving adolescent adjustment during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Li, Wang, Zhang, Sun, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-03696-6","20220907","Adolescent; Burdensomeness; COVID-19 pandemic; Depression; Family support; Parental conflict","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37155,""
"Experimental longitudinal evidence for causal role of social media use and physical activity in COVID-19 burden and mental health","The COVID-19 outbreak has severely impacted people's mental health. The present experimental study investigated how to reduce this negative effect by a combination of two interventions. Participants (<i>N</i> <sub>total</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°642) were users of social media in Germany. For two weeks, the social media group (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°162) reduced its social media use (SMU) by 30Ã‚Â minutes daily, the physical activity group (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°161) increased its physical activity by 30Ã‚Â minutes daily, the combination group (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°159) followed both instructions, and the control group (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°160) did not get specific instructions. Online surveys assessed variables of SMU, physical activity, mental health, COVID-19 burden, and lifestyle at six measurement time points up to six months after the intervention. In the experimental groups, (addictive) SMU, depression symptoms, and COVID-19 burden decreased, while physical activity, life satisfaction, and subjective happiness increased. All effects were stronger and more stable in the combination group in the longer-term. Smoking behavior decreased in the social media group only. Thus, the conscious combination of less SMU and more physical activity leads causally to more psychological resilience against negative pandemic impacts and to higher levels of mental health over six months. Prevention programs could improve their effectiveness by integrating the time- and cost-efficient interventions - separately or in combination.

"Mucosal Immunity After Novel COVID-19 Infection - Virus-Induced Immunosuppression: Preliminary Study","In recovered COVID-19 patients, the state of mucosal immunity remains understudied. Cytological, functional, and metabolic characteristics of neutrophils and the interleukin status will help to correctly assess the need for immunorehabilitation measures. The study objective is to assess the state of mucosal immunity after COVID-19. A comprehensive study of mucosal immunity included the assessment of nasal mucosal neutrophils with the monitoring of destructive and apoptotic changes as well as examination of the functional and metabolic activity of neutrophils entering the nasal secretions. Phagocytic activity was assessed using microbial suspension of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, as well as intracellular oxygen-dependent biocidity, the functions of capturing, absorbing, and killing pathogens. Study of the secretory component included assessment of interleukin levels (TNF-ÃŽÂ±, IL-10, IFN-ÃŽÂ³) and the content of sCD95 (sAPO-1/FAS), membrane marker of apoptosis, in the nasal secretions. Cell wall neutrophils in recovered COVID-19 patients show enhanced destructive and apoptotic processes within the cells. Functional disorders due to inhibited phagocytosis of autoflora are recorded. Functionally defective cells are brought into the nasal secretions; they demonstrate severely inhibited oxygen-dependent biocidity, rapid depletion of reserves, incomplete phagocytosis, and limited ability to capture pathogens, which can contribute to the growth of various pathogenic viruses and bacteria. In the nasal secretions, the concentration of sCD95 (sAPO-1/FAS), the membrane marker of apoptosis, is increased. Elevated level of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-ÃŽÂ±, IL-10) downregulates IFN-ÃŽÂ³, thus directly contributing to the formation of functionally defective neutrophils. Compensatory increase in the IL-10 anti-inflammatory cytokine under the influence of SARS-CoV-2 virus proteins downregulates IFN-ÃŽÂ³ and is a cofactor of depression of intracellular biocidity of neutrophils. An increased level of the TNF-ÃŽÂ± pro-inflammatory cytokine increases apoptotic and destructive changes in neutrophils entering the nasal secretion. Virus-induced, functional, and metabolic impairment of neutrophils of the mucosal immunity system develop in recovered COVID-19 patients, thus providing a scientific rationale for immunomodulatory therapy.","Agafonova, Reshetnikova, Rizvanova","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12668-022-01020-x","20220907","COVID-19; Cytokines; Mucosal immunity; Neutrophils; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37158,""
"ENACT study: What has helped health and social care workers maintain their mental well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic?","A growing body of research has highlighted the adverse impact of COVID-19 stressors on health and social care workers' (HSCWs) mental health. Complementing this work, we report on the psychosocial factors that have had both a positive and negative impact on the mental well-being of HSCWs during the third lockdown period in Scotland. Using a cross-sectional design, participants (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1364) completed an online survey providing quantitative data and free open-text responses. A multi-method approach to analysis was used. The majority of HSCWs were found to have low well-being scores, high levels of COVID-19 stress, worry, burnout and risk perception scores and almost half of HSCWs met the clinical cut-off for acute stress (indicative of PTSD). HSCWs with higher scores on adaptive coping strategies and team resilience reported higher scores on mental well-being. HSCWs were significantly more likely to seek informal support for dealing with personal or emotional problems compared to formal supports. Barriers to formal help-seeking were identified including stigma and fear of the consequences of disclosure. HSCWs mostly valued peer support, workplace supports, visible leadership and teamwork in maintaining their mental well-being. Our findings illuminate the complexity of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on HSCWs' well-being and will inform future intervention development seeking to increase positive adaptation and improve staff well-being. Addressing barriers to mental health help-seeking among HSCWs is essential. The implications emphasise the importance of lessons learned across health and social care contexts, planning and preparedness for future pandemics.","Cogan, Kennedy, Beck, McInnes, MacIntyre, Morton, Tanner, Kolacz","https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.13992","20220907","COVID-19; adaptation; health and social care workers; help-seeking; mental health; peer support; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37159,""
"Subjective cognitive decline and anxious/depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic: what is the role of stress perception, stress resilience, and ÃŽÂ²-amyloid?","The COVID-19 pandemic may worsen the mental health of people reporting subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and therefore their clinical prognosis. We aimed to investigate the association between the intensity of SCD and anxious/depressive symptoms during confinement and the underlying mechanisms. Two hundred fifty cognitively unimpaired participants completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and SCD-Questionnaire (SCD-Q) and underwent amyloid-ÃŽÂ² positron emission tomography imaging with [<sup>18</sup>F] flutemetamol (N = 205) on average 2.4 (Ã‚Â± 0.8) years before the COVID-19 confinement. During the confinement, participants completed the HADS, Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Brief Resilience Scale (BRS), and an ad hoc questionnaire on worries (access to primary products, self-protection materials, economic situation) and lifestyle changes (sleep duration, sleep quality, eating habits). We investigated stress-related measurements, worries, and lifestyle changes in relation to SCD. We then conducted an analysis of covariance to investigate the association of SCD-Q with HADS scores during the confinement while controlling for pre-confinement anxiety/depression scores and demographics. Furthermore, we introduced amyloid-ÃŽÂ² positivity, PSS, and BRS in the models and performed mediation analyses to explore the mechanisms explaining the association between SCD and anxiety/depression. In the whole sample, the average SCD-Q score was 4.1 (Ã‚Â± 4.4); 70 (28%) participants were classified as SCD, and 26 (12.7%) were amyloid-ÃŽÂ²-positive. During the confinement, participants reporting SCD showed higher PSS (p = 0.035) but not BRS scores (p = 0.65) than those that did not report SCD. No differences in worries or lifestyle changes were observed. Higher SCD-Q scores showed an association with greater anxiety/depression scores irrespective of pre-confinement anxiety/depression levels (p = 0.002). This association was not significant after introducing amyloid-ÃŽÂ² positivity and stress-related variables in the model (p = 0.069). Amyloid-ÃŽÂ² positivity and PSS were associated with greater HADS irrespective of pre-confinement anxiety/depression scores (p = 0.023; p &lt; 0.001). The association of SCD-Q with HADS was mediated by PSS (p = 0.01). Higher intensity of SCD, amyloid-ÃŽÂ² positivity, and stress perception showed independent associations with anxious/depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 confinement irrespective of pre-confinement anxiety/depression levels. The association of SCD intensity with anxiety/depression was mediated by stress perception, suggesting stress regulation as a potential intervention to reduce affective symptomatology in the SCD population in the face of stressors.","Akinci, SÃƒÂ¡nchez-Benavides, Brugulat-Serrat, PeÃƒÂ±a-GÃƒÂ³mez, Palpatzis, Shekari, Deulofeu, Fuentes-Julian, SalvadÃƒÂ³, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-de-EchÃƒÂ¡varri, SuÃƒÂ¡rez-Calvet, MinguillÃƒÂ³n, Fauria, Molinuevo, Gispert, Grau-Rivera, Arenaza-Urquijo, Beteta, Cacciaglia, CaÃƒÂ±as, Cumplido, Dominguez, Emilio, Falcon, Hernandez, Huesa, Huguet, Marne, MenchÃƒÂ³n, Operto, Polo, RodrÃƒÂ­guez-FernÃƒÂ¡ndez, Pradas, Sadeghi, Soteras, Stankeviciute, Vilanova, Vilor-Tejedor","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13195-022-01068-7","20220906","AlzheimerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease; Anxiety; COVID-19 confinement; Depression; Stress; Subjective cognitive decline","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37160,""
"The Opioid Epidemic: a Crisis Disproportionately Impacting Black Americans and Urban Communities","The heroin epidemic has existed for decades, but a sharp rise in opioid overdose deaths (OODs) jolted the nation in the mid-twenty-teens and continues as a major health crisis to this day. Although the new wave of OODs was initially approached as a rural problem impacting a White/Caucasian demographic, surveillance records suggest severe impacts on African Americans and urban-dwelling individuals, which have been largely underreported. The focus of this report is on specific trends in OOD rates in Black and White residents in states with a significant Black urban population and declared as hotspots for OOD: (Maryland (MD), Illinois (IL), Michigan (MI), and Pennsylvania (PA)), and Washington District of Columbia (DC). We compare OODs by type of opioid, across ethnicities, across city/rural demographics, and to homicide rates using 2013-2020 data acquired from official Chief Medical Examiners' or Departments of Health (DOH) reports. With 2013 or 2014 as baseline, the OOD rate in major cities (Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia) were elevated two-fold over all other regions of their respective state. In DC, Wards 7 and 8 OODs were consistently greater than other jurisdictions, until 2020 when the rate of change of OODs increased for the entire city. Ethnicity-wise, Black OOD rates exceeded White rates by four- to six-fold, with fentanyl and heroin having a disproportionate impact on Black opioid deaths. This disparity was aggravated by its intersection with the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. African Americans and America's urban dwellers are vulnerable populations in need of social and political resources to address the ongoing opioid epidemic in under-resourced communities.","GondrÃƒÂ©-Lewis, Abijo, GondrÃƒÂ©-Lewis","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-022-01384-6","20220906","African American; Black; Caucasian; European American; Fentanyl; Health disparity; Heroin; Homicides; Opiates; Opioid; Opioid overdose; Social Determinants of Health; Social Determinants of Mental Health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37161,""
"Variability in Opioid-Related Drug Overdoses, Social Distancing, and Area-Level Deprivation during the COVID-19 Pandemic: a Bayesian Spatiotemporal Analysis","Monitoring the spatial and temporal course of opioid-related drug overdose mortality is a key public health determinant. Despite previous studies exploring the evolution of drug-related fatalities following the stay-at-home mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic, little is known about the spatiotemporal dynamics that mitigation efforts had on overdose deaths. The purpose of this study was to describe the spatial and temporal dynamics of overdose death relative risk using a 4-week interval over a span of 5Ã‚Â months following the implementation of the COVID-19 lockdown in the city of Chicago, IL. A Bayesian space-time model was used to produce posterior risk estimates and exceedance probabilities of opioid-related overdose deaths controlling for measures of area-level deprivation and stay-at-home mandates. We found that area-level temporal risk and inequalities in drug overdose mortality increased significantly in the initial months of the pandemic. We further found that a change in the area-level deprivation from the first to the fourth quintile increased the relative risk of a drug overdose risk by 44.5%. The social distancing index measuring the proportion of persons who stayed at home in each census block group was not associated with drug overdose mortality. We conclude by highlighting the importance of contextualizing the spatial and temporal risk in overdose mortality for implementing effective and safe harm reduction strategies during a global pandemic.","Barboza, Angulski, Hines, Brown","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11524-022-00675-x","20220906","Area deprivation; Bayesian spatiotemporal model; Opioid overdose mortality; Social distancing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37162,""

"Psychotropic Prescriptions During the COVID-19 Pandemic Among US Children and Adolescents Receiving Mental Health Services","<b><i>Objective:</i></b> Increased mental health problems among children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic may have impacted psychotropic medication use. This study describes trends in monthly psychotropic medications before and early in the COVID-19 pandemic among 2- to 17-year-old children and adolescents with mental health disorders. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> A cross-sectional study design using the 2019-2020 IQVIAÃ¢â€žÂ¢ prescription and medical commercial claims data to estimate the proportion of children and adolescents with any psychotropic prescription in the month out of all with any mental health-related medical or prescription services in the month and the year-over-year percent change. We assessed monthly proportions of youth who filled a psychotropic prescription overall and by psychotropic class, stratified by age and gender. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Of the 8,896,713 children and adolescents in the sample, 24.7% received psychotropic medication during the study period. The proportion of the cohort prescribed a psychotropic medication in a given month averaged 27%-28% from January 2019 to February 2020, peaked at 36.9% in April 2020, and gradually declined to 28.7% in September 2020. The largest year-over-year percent change was in April for antipsychotic (41.9%) and antidepressant (37.9%) medication, which remained higher in September 2020 compared to September 2019, particularly among ages 6 years or older and females. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> The proportion of youth with a psychotropic prescription increased at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, later returning to prepandemic levels.

"The Use of Automated Machine Translation to Translate Figurative Language in a Clinical Setting: Analysis of a Convenience Sample of Patients Drawn From a Randomized Controlled Trial","Patients with limited English proficiency frequently receive substandard health care. Asynchronous telepsychiatry (ATP) has been established as a clinically valid method for psychiatric assessments. The addition of automated speech recognition (ASR) and automated machine translation (AMT) technologies to asynchronous telepsychiatry may be a viable artificial intelligence (AI)-language interpretation option. This project measures the frequency and accuracy of the translation of figurative language devices (FLDs) and patient word count per minute, in a subset of psychiatric interviews from a larger trial, as an approximation to patient speech complexity and quantity in clinical encounters that require interpretation. A total of 6 patients were selected from the original trial, where they had undergone 2 assessments, once by an English-speaking psychiatrist through a Spanish-speaking human interpreter and once in Spanish by a trained mental health interviewer-researcher with AI interpretation. 3 (50%) of the 6 selected patients were interviewed via videoconferencing because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Interview transcripts were created by automated speech recognition with manual corrections for transcriptional accuracy and assessment for translational accuracy of FLDs. AI-interpreted interviews were found to have a significant increase in the use of FLDs and patient word count per minute. Both human and AI-interpreted FLDs were frequently translated inaccurately, however FLD translation may be more accurate on videoconferencing. AI interpretation is currently not sufficiently accurate for use in clinical settings. However, this study suggests that alternatives to human interpretation are needed to circumvent modifications to patients' speech. While AI interpretation technologies are being further developed, using videoconferencing for human interpreting may be more accurate than in-person interpreting.

"Twitter Usage Among Physicians From 2016 to 2020: Algorithm Development and Longitudinal Analysis Study","Physicians are increasingly using Twitter as a channel for communicating with colleagues and the public. Identifying physicians on Twitter is difficult due to the varied and imprecise ways that people self-identify themselves on the social media platform. This is the first study to describe a reliable, repeatable methodology for identifying physicians on Twitter. By using this approach, we characterized the longitudinal activity of US physicians on Twitter. We aimed to develop a reliable and repeatable methodology for identifying US physicians on Twitter and to characterize their activity on Twitter over 5 years by activity, tweeted topic, and account type. In this study, 5 years of Twitter data (2016-2020) were mined for physician accounts. US physicians on Twitter were identified by using a custom-built algorithm to screen for physician identifiers in the Twitter handles, user profiles, and tweeted content. The number of tweets by physician accounts from the 5-year period were counted and analyzed. The top 100 hashtags were identified, categorized into topics, and analyzed. Approximately 1 trillion tweets were mined to identify 6,399,146 (&lt;0.001%) tweets originating from 39,084 US physician accounts. Over the 5-year period, the number of US physicians tweeting more than doubled (ie, increased by 112%). Across all 5 years, the most popular themes were general health, medical education, and mental health, and in specific years, the number of tweets related to elections (2016 and 2020), Black Lives Matter (2020), and COVID-19 (2020) increased. Twitter has become an increasingly popular social media platform for US physicians over the past 5 years, and their use of Twitter has evolved to cover a broad range of topics, including science, politics, social activism, and COVID-19.

"Exercise training as part of multidisciplinary rehabilitation in cancer survivors: an observational study on changes in physical performance and patient-reported outcomes","To describe changes in physical performance and patient-reported outcomes in cancer survivors who participated in an exercise program as part of usual-care multidisciplinary rehabilitation and the influence of training adaptations during the coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. In an observational cohort study, cancer survivors underwent usual-care multidisciplinary rehabilitation including a 10-week exercise program. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the exercise program was adapted with reduced training time and frequency. Mean changes and 95% confidence intervals in physical performance (peak oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub>peak), peak work rate during a steep ramp test (SRT-WRpeak), 6-min walking distance, muscle strength) and patient-reported outcomes (health-related quality of life, fatigue, anxiety, and depression) were assessed between the start and the end of the exercise program. Linear regression analysis, adjusting for baseline levels of outcomes, was used to investigate differences in changes in outcomes between participants who underwent the original and the adapted program. All outcomes statistically significantly improved over time, regardless of adaptations in the exercise program. VO<sub>2</sub>peak increased with 9.6% and 7.7% in the original and adapted program, respectively. Significant smaller improvements were observed in SRT-WRpeak (-Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.9%) and upper body muscle strength (-Ã¢â‚¬â€°10.8%) after participation in the adapted compared to the original program. No significant between-group differences were observed for other outcomes.

"Mental health in medical and biomedical doctoral students during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic and racial protests","Concerns about the mental health of students, trainees and staff at universities and medical schools have been growing for many years. Recently, these have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and a period of heightened reckoning and protests about systemic racism in the United States in 2020. To better understand the mental health of medical students and biomedical doctoral students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill during this challenging period, we performed a cross-sectional study (n=957) using institutional annual survey data on measures of depression, anxiety, hazardous alcohol use, problems related to substance use, and suicidal ideation. These data were collected in 2019 and 2020, and were analyzed by type of training program, race/ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and survey year. Results indicated significant differences for rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation, with biomedical doctoral students showing greater incidence than medical students, and historically excluded students (e.g., people of color, women, LGBQ+ trainees) showing greater incidence compared to their peers. Of note, mental health remained poor for biomedical doctoral students in 2020 and declined for those belonging to historically excluded populations. The high rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation reported suggest that training environments need to be improved and support for mental health increased.","Schad, Layton, Ragland, Cook","https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.69960","20220907","equality diversity; graduate students; inclusion; medical students; mental health; none; training environment; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37169,""
"Relooking the monkeypox virus during this present outbreak: epidemiology to therapeutics and vaccines","The recent monkeypox disease outbreak is another significant threat during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This viral disease is zoonotic and contagious. The viral disease outbreak is considered the substantial infection possessed by the Orthopoxvirus family species after the smallpox virus' obliteration, a representative of the same family. It has potentially threatened the Republic of Congo's regions and certain African subcontinent zones. Although repeated outbreaks have been reported in several parts of the world, as conferred from the epidemiological data, very little is explored about the disease landscape. Thus, here we have reviewed the current status of the monkeypox virus along with therapeutic options available to humanity. We have accessed and reviewed the available literature on the monkeypox virus to highlight its epidemiology, pathogenicity, virulence, and therapeutic options available. For the review, we have searched different literature and database such as PubMed, PubMed Central, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, etc., using different keywords such as ""monkeypox"", ""Orthopox"", ""smallpox"", ""recent monkeypox outbreak"", ""therapeutic strategies"", ""monkeypox vaccines"", etc. This review has included most of the significant references from 1983 to 2022. It has been reported that the monkeypox virus shows a remarkable similarity with smallpox during the ongoing outbreak. Sometimes, it creates considerable confusion due to misdiagnosis and similarity with smallpox. The misdiagnosis of the disease should be immediately corrected by rendering some cutting-edge techniques especially intended to isolate the monkeypox virus. The pathophysiology and the histopathological data imply the immediate need to design effective therapeutics to confer resistance against the monkeypox virus. Most importantly, the potential implications of the disease are not given importance due to the lack of awareness programs. Moreover, specific evolutionary evidence is crucial for designing effective therapeutic strategies that confer high resistance, particularly against this species. The review focuses on a brief overview of the recent monkeypox virus outbreak, infection biology, epidemiology, transmission, clinical symptoms, and therapeutic aspects. Such an attempt will support researchers, policymakers, and healthcare professionals for better treatment and containment of the infection caused by the monkeypox virus.","Chatterjee, Sharma, Bhattacharya, Dhama, Lee, Chakraborty","https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202208_29541","20220907","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37170,""
"The acquisition of clinical experience during GP training - how can we mitigate for the impact of COVID-19?","The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted the way general practice is run and this is expected to have had a knock-on effect upon GP training. A questionnaire-based study was designed to investigate what was happening to GP trainees 16Ã‚Â months into the pandemic in terms of opportunities to develop clinical experience and clinical decision-making. We also asked trainers and trainees for ideas on how we might mitigate for the effects of COVID-19. In particular, there has been decreased exposure to clinical examination during the pandemic and there appear to be gaps in opportunities to learn from urgent and unscheduled care settings and to develop skills in rapid clinical decision-making. It is interesting to consider what general practice will look like when the pandemic is over and how this will this affect the GP training curriculum going forwards. Although response rates were low, we were able to determine some emerging themes for national, local and educational review going forwards to help shape and improve GP training for the future.","Rodgers, O'Leary, Fernandez, Rutherford","https://doi.org/10.1080/14739879.2022.2116730","20220906","COVID-19; Trainees; clinical experience; decision-making; primary care; remote consulting","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37171,""
"Mental Health of Adolescents and Subjective Economic Deterioration Caused by COVID-19 in Korea","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic greatly impacted the health and economy worldwide. Children and adolescents are less affected by COVID-19 but are more vulnerable to secondary damage, such as mental health. We would like to evaluate the subjective economic changes caused by COVID-19 in Korea and adolescents' mental health status. The data are based on the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Survey, published by the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention in South Korea. It is an annual cross-sectional national representative survey of middle and high school students. There were 54,948 subjects, and the survey was conducted from August 3, 2020 to November 13, 2020. We investigated usual stress, loneliness, anxiety, sadness and hopelessness, and suicidal ideation. We found that the odds ratio of adolescent mental health increased as the economic deterioration caused by COVID-19 increased.

"Gains and losses within the homeless service, supportive housing, and harm reduction sectors during the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative study of what matters to the workforce","The COVID-19 pandemic has had deleterious effects on individuals experiencing homelessness; yet, less is known about how this global health crisis is impacting service providers that support the homeless population. This qualitative study examined the perceived impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the lives and work experiences of service providers in the homeless service, supportive housing, and harm reduction sectors in Canada. Further analyses were conducted to identify the occupational values that were represented in the work-related changes experienced by providers. A stratified purposive sample of 40 participants (30 direct service providers and 10 providers in leadership roles) were drawn from a pan-Canadian study of the mental health of service providers working with individuals experiencing homelessness. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to identify five themes of the work-related changes experienced by service providers during the pandemic: [1] ""Everything was changing every day"": Work role and responsibility instability; [2] ""How on Earth do we do our job?"": Challenges to working relationships with service users; [3] ""It used to be a social environment"": Transitions to impersonal and isolating workspaces; [4] ""It all comes down the chute"": Lack of organisational support and hierarchical conflict; and [5] ""We've been supported as well as we could have"": Positive organisational support and communication. The findings underscored how many of the occupational changes during the pandemic did not align with service providers' occupational values for collaboration, control, effective and safe service provision, and the importance of human relationships, among other values. As pre-existing sectoral problems were exacerbated by the pandemic, recovery efforts need to address these long-standing issues in ways that are aligned with service providers' values. Future research is warranted on how organisational approaches can promote supportive workplaces for service providers and improve outcomes for individuals experiencing homelessness.","Goodwin, Tiderington, Kidd, Ecker, Kerman","https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.14008","20220906","COVID-19 pandemic; harm reduction; homeless services; occupational values; service provision; supportive housing; workplace mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37173,""
"Outreach to the Veterans Crisis Line During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Mixed-Methods Analysis","The mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have been widely felt among already vulnerable populations, such as U.S. military veterans, including a heightened risk for depression and suicidal ideation. Support hotlines such as the Veterans Crisis Line (VCL) took a central role in addressing various concerns from callers in distress; research has yet to examine the concerns of veterans who used the VCL during the early months of the pandemic. A mixed-methods analysis of characteristics of veteran outreach to the VCL during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States was conducted on 342,248 calls during April-December 2020; 3.8% (N=12,869) of calls were coded as related to COVID-19. Quantitative examination was conducted regarding COVID-19-related reasons for contact, suicide risk screens, and caller concerns; 360 unique calls with synopsis notes that included a COVID-19 flag were qualitatively analyzed. Quantitative analysis of the calls with a COVID-19 flag revealed mental health concerns, loneliness, and suicidal thoughts as top reasons veterans contacted the VCL during the pandemic. Qualitative analysis identified specific economic and mental health concerns, including negative impacts on income and housing, increased feelings of depression or anxiety, and pandemic-specific concerns such as testing and vaccine availability. Disrupted access to resources for coping, including support groups or gyms, had negative perceived impacts and sometimes exacerbated preexisting problems such as substance abuse or depression. These findings emphasize the role of VCL as providing general support to veterans experiencing loneliness and supplying assistance in coping with pandemic-related distress.","Krishnamurti, Agha, Iverson, Monteith, Dichter","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202200044","20220906","COVID-19 pandemic; Crisis intervention; Crisis line; Mental health; Suicide and self-destructive behavior; Veterans issues","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37174,""
"Low COVID-19 Vaccination Rates Among Psychiatric Inpatients: Implications for Institutional Settings and Outreach Efforts","This study sought to determine COVID-19 vaccination rates for individuals with serious mental illness admitted to a large health system in New York State. Vaccination rates among 12,714 patients admitted to psychiatric units and to medical and surgical units were compared between April 6, 2021, and September 30, 2021. Only 40% (N=416 of 1,029) of patients admitted to psychiatric services had at least one COVID-19 vaccination, whereas 64.4% (7,523 of 11,685) of patients admitted to medical and surgical services had at least one vaccination. After adjustment for differences in key demographic and clinical characteristics, patients admitted to psychiatric services had a significantly lower likelihood of vaccination during the study period (risk ratio=0.78, 95% confidence interval=0.73-0.85, p&lt;0.001). Black psychiatric patients had the lowest vaccination rate (28%). Psychiatric patients with acute illness had low COVID-19 vaccination rates.

Using data from several ongoing clinical trials (N = 458), this study examined exposure to COVID-19-related stressors and their associations with key sociodemographic factors and mental health outcomes. The results showed that exposure to COVID-19-related stressors was common, higher among veterans who were racial/ethnic minorities d = 0.32, and associated with elevated posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), r = .288, and depressive symptom severity, r = .246. Women veterans experienced more difficulty accessing social support, d = 0.31, and higher levels of COVID-19-related distress, d = 0.31, than men. Qualitative data were consistent with survey findings and highlighted the broader societal context in veterans' experience of COVID-19-related distress.

"A Novel Adaptive Affective Cognition Analysis Model for College Students Using a Deep Convolution Neural Network and Deep Features","Currently, under the impact of the COVID-19, college students are facing increasingly elevated employment pressure and higher education pressure. This can easily cause a huge psychological burden on them, causing affective cognition problems such as anxiety and depression. In the long run, this is not conducive to students' physical and mental health, nor is it conducive to the healthy development of the school and even the whole society. Therefore, it is imperative to build a novel adaptive affective cognition analysis model for college students. In particular, in the context of smart cities and smart China, many universities have opened the smart campus mode, which provides a huge data resource for our research. Due to problems of the low real-time evaluation and single data source in traditional questionnaire evaluation methods, evaluation errors are prone to occur, which in turn interferes with subsequent treatment. Therefore, for the purpose of alleviating the above deficiencies and improving the efficiency and accuracy of the affective cognition analysis model of college students, this paper studies the adaptive affective cognition analysis method of college students on basis of deep learning. First, because students' psychological problems are often not sudden, on the contrary, most of these abnormalities will leave traces in their daily activities. Therefore, this paper constructs a multisource dataset with the access control data, network data, and learning data collected from the smart campus platform to describe the affective cognition status of students. Second, the multisource dataset is divided into two categories: image and text, and the CNN model is introduced to mine the psychological characteristics of college students, so as to provide a reference for the subsequent affective cognition state assessment. Finally, simulation tests are developed to confirm the viability of the technique suggested in this research. The experiments demonstrate that the accuracy of the assessment model is significantly increased because it can fully reflect the heterogeneity and comprehensiveness of the data. This also highlights that the new method has a wide range of potential applications in the modern campus setting and is also helpful in fostering the accuracy and depth of college students' work on their affective cognition.","Feng","https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/2114114","20220907","COVID-19; Cognition; Humans; Neural Networks, Computer; Students; Universities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37178,""
"Relationships between Dark Triad and negative emotions during COVID-19 lockdown: The chain mediating roles of negative coping and state boredom","Personality is distal vulnerability of negative emotions and vital to mental health. Dark Triad was significantly correlated with negative emotions, whereas the mechanisms beneath the relationships were less clear. Based on life history strategy theory (LHS) and cognitive vulnerability-transactional stress model, the study explored the relationships between Dark Triad and negative emotions and investigated the roles of negative coping style and state boredom in the relationships aforementioned during the strict period of COVID-19 lockdown in China. 464 participants (<i>M</i> <sub>age</sub> = 36.78 years; <i>SD</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°10.53) finished a package of measurements online including Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), Short Dark Triad (SD3), Multidimensional State Boredom Scale (MSBS), and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ). The results showed there were positive relationships between Dark Triad and depression, anxiety and stress. Moreover, the relationships between Dark Triad and negative emotions were sequentially mediated by negative coping style and state boredom. The present study offered fascinating perspectives in the relationships between Dark Triad and negative emotions, and revealed how Dark Triad affected depression, anxiety and stress during the initial phase of COVID-19 pandemic and strict lockdown among Chinese population. The present results may provide important implications for the prevention and intervention of depression, anxiety and stress during COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown. Specifically, the intervention strategies that focus on reducing Dark Triad, negative coping and boredom may help offset occurrence of negative emotional states.","Yang, Qu, Zhang, Guo, Guo, Yang, Tian, Hu","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-03560-7","20220907","Anxiety; Coping style; Dark Triad; Depression; State boredom; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37179,""
"Serum metabolomic abnormalities in survivors of non-severe COVID-19","Metabolic reprogramming is a distinctive characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which refers to metabolic changes in hosts triggered by viruses for their survival and spread. It is current urgent to understand the metabolic health status of COVID-19 survivors and its association with long-term health consequences of infection, especially for the predominant non-severe patients. Herein, we show systemic metabolic signatures of survivors of non-severe COVID-19 from Wuhan, China at six months after discharge using metabolomics approaches. The serum amino acids, organic acids, purine, fatty acids and lipid metabolism were still abnormal in the survivors, but the kynurenine pathway and the level of itaconic acid have returned to normal. These metabolic abnormalities are associated with liver injury, mental health, energy production, and inflammatory responses. Our findings identify and highlight the metabolic abnormalities in survivors of non-severe COVID-19, which provide information on biomarkers and therapeutic targets of infection and cues for post-hospital care and intervention strategies centered on metabolism reprogramming.","Li, Fu, Liu, Liu, Liang, Lv, Yang, Guo, Chen, Li, Pan, Luo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e10473","20220907","COVID-19 survivors; Health consequences; Metabolic abnormalities; Metabolomics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37180,""
"Caesarean childbirth and associated factors during Covid-19 pandemic at public hospitals in the Sidama region, Southern Ethiopia","The increasing number of caesarean births worldwide concerns pregnant women, obstetric service providers, and the country's economy. Unnecessary caesarean childbirth increases childbirth complications and the cost of health care in low-income countries, including Ethiopia. This study aims to assess caesarean birth and associated factors at the Sidama region public hospitals, Southern Ethiopia, 2020. An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 484 women who gave birth at public hospitals in the Sidama region. A multi-stage sampling technique was employed. The data were collected from 1st to 30th of July 2020 by face-to-face interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire (see Table S1: see supplementary materials associated with this article on line), and the wealth index was analysed by principal component analysis. Backward logistic regression used an adjusted odds ratio and a 95% confidence interval to assess the strength and association between the caesarean section and its associated factors. A <i>P</i>-value of &lt; 0.05 was used to declare statistical significance. Caesarean childbirth in this study was 34.3%. In this study, partograph monitoring (AOR=2.23, CI=1.13, 4.38), previous caesarean birth (AOR=3.21, CI=1.28,8.17), having genital cutting/mutilation (AOR=2.51, CI=1.14,5.53), intermittent cardiotocography monitoring during childbirth (AOR=2.3, CI=1.14, 4.49), absence of companionship during delivery (AOR=4.97, CI=2.37, 10.43) and is not remembering the last normal menstrual period (AOR=3.12, CI=1.40,6.94) had increased the odds of caesarean birth. Studies show that the prevalence of caesarean has alarmingly increased in both developed and developing countries. However, the magnitude of caesarean section differs from country to country and in rural and urban areas; the magnitude of caesarean section in this study is much higher than the WHO recommends threshold. The local health bureau and obstetric care providers should pay attention to the caesarean section and need intervention in partograph plotting, companionship, cardiotocography, and female genital mutilation.","Kassa, Debelo, Burayu, Azene","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jemep.2022.100840","20220906","Caesarean childbirth; Ethiopia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37181,""
"The long COVID syndrome: A conundrum for the allergist/immunologist","<b>Background:</b> The long coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) syndrome includes a group of patients who, after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exhibit lingering mild-to-moderate symptoms and develop medical complications that can have lasting health problems. <b>Objective:</b> The purpose of this report was to examine the current body of evidence that deals with the relationship of COVID-19 infection with the long COVID syndrome to define the possible immunologic mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of long COVID and to describe potential strategies for the diagnosis and clinical management of the condition. <b>Methods:</b> Extensive research was conducted in medical literature data bases by applying terms such as long COVID, post-COVID-19 condition, pathogenesis of long COVID, management of the long COVID syndrome. <b>Results:</b> The post-COVID conditions, a more recent and less anxiety-inducing term for the patient than long COVID or ""long haul,"" is an umbrella term for a wide range of physical and mental health symptoms similar to those seen in patients with the myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), experienced by some patients and are present Ã¢â€°Â¥ 4 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although the precise reason why long COVID develops is unknown, one of the major causes is thought to be related to chronic inflammation with overproduction of inflammatory cytokines responsible for the symptoms of the disorder. <b>Conclusion:</b> Long COVID is a growing burden for millions of patients, health-care providers, and global health-care systems, and is a particular challenge for the allergist/immunologist. Many survivors of COVID-19 struggle with multiple symptoms, increased disability, reduced function, and poor quality of life. The allergist/immunologist can assist the total health-care team's efforts in providing a comprehensive and coordinated approach to the management of these patients by promoting comprehensive vaccination and rehabilitation and social services that focus on improving physical, mental, and social well-being, and by establishing partnerships with specialists and other health-care professionals who can provide behavioral, lifestyle, and integrative approaches that may have much to offer in helping patients cope with their symptoms.","Bellanti","https://doi.org/10.2500/aap.2022.43.220059","20220907","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37182,""
"Face masks impair facial emotion recognition and induce specific emotion confusions","Face masks are now worn frequently to reduce the spreading of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Their health benefits are undisputable, but covering the lower half of one's face also makes it harder for others to recognize facial expressions of emotions. Three experiments were conducted to determine how strongly the recognition of different facial expressions is impaired by masks, and which emotions are confused with each other. In each experiment, participants had to recognize facial expressions of happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and disgust, as well as a neutral expression, displayed by male and female actors of the Radboud Faces Database. On half of the 168 trials, the lower part of the face was covered by a face mask. In all experiments, facial emotion recognition (FER) was about 20% worse for masked faces than for unmasked ones (68% correct vs. 88%). The impairment was largest for disgust, followed by fear, surprise, sadness, and happiness. It was not significant for anger and the neutral expression. As predicted, participants frequently confused emotions that share activation of the visible muscles in the upper half of the face. In addition, they displayed response biases in these confusions: They frequently misinterpreted disgust as anger, fear as surprise, and sadness as neutral, whereas the opposite confusions were less frequent. We conclude that face masks do indeed cause a marked impairment of FER and that a person perceived as angry, surprised, or neutral may actually be disgusted, fearful, or sad, respectively. This may lead to misunderstandings, confusions, and inadequate reactions by the perceivers.","Rinck, Primbs, Verpaalen, Bijlstra","https://doi.org/10.1186/s41235-022-00430-5","20220907","Face masks; Facial emotion recognition; Radboud Faces Database","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37183,""
"<i>45 and Up COVID Insights</i>: a dynamic and collaborative approach to evidence-making during the COVID-19 pandemic","In response to the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a research project was developed with a cohort of 45 and Up Study participants to generate timely, relevant evidence to guide policy, practice and planning. This paper describes the research model, the cohort establishment and characteristics, and some findings. A subgroup of 45 and Up Study participants was invited to enrol in 45 and Up COVID Insights -a series of five online surveys conducted during 2020-22. The model involved a close collaborative partnership with the New South Wales Ministry of Health and a panel of scientific advisers, an agile data collection methodology and rapid dissemination of findings. Frequent, iterative engagement with stakeholders provided a framework for identifying survey themes and questions and ensured wide dissemination of findings. Themes included healthcare use, attitudes toward and uptake of COVID-19 prevention measures, and the impact of the pandemic on mental health, loneliness, and lifestyle behaviours. 45 and Up COVID Insights achieved strong stakeholder engagement through extensive consultation and rapid reporting of results. The project recruited a diverse cohort of 32 115 participants: median age 68 years (range: 56-100+); 8% from outer regional/remote areas; 12% from the most socioeconomically disadvantaged communities; and 9% from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. The first four surveys found that the impact of the pandemic varied across populations and stages of the pandemic. Between February-April (survey 2) 2021, 10% reported missed healthcare in the past month because of the pandemic, rising to 26% by September-November 2021 (survey 4). Quality of life remained high (&gt;90% good-excellent across the surveys). As the pandemic progressed, the proportion reporting worsened mental health as a result increased from 29% (July-December 2020, survey 1) to 46% (survey 4). In survey 2 (February-April 2021), 89% intended to get the COVID-19 vaccine, with 8% unsure. By late 2021, vaccination uptake was high, with 98% of respondents having received at least one vaccination. There is great value in harnessing a large longitudinal, well-described, and diverse cohort study to generate evidence in a changing context with evolving information needs.

"The effect of COVID-19 on employees' mental health","Long lockdowns, food shortages, and the inability to receive basic primary healthcare have aggravated the effects of pandemics. However, most studies have focused on the health problems of the infected people or the measures employed to keep the disease under control. This cross-sectional study focused primarily on the mental health issues of employees. By employing a convenient sampling method, we reached 237 respondents (135 with coronavirus history) to assess the impact of the pandemic on employees. Multivariate causal relationships were assessed with Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The predictors included internal entrapment (INT) and difficulty identifying feelings (DIF), which are significant predictors of depression (DEPR). DIF was found to be a significant predictor of INT and EXT feelings, while FEAR was found to be a significant predictor of INT, DIF, and DEPR. Quality of life (QoL) was found to be a significant predictor of DIF and DDF, DEPR, EXT and INT, and FEAR. The results also showed that DIF mainly manifested its effect on depression through INT. The DEPR level of employees working only from home was higher than that of other employees. The depression levels of women, young employees, and those whose QoL was adversely affected by the coronavirus were higher than the rest.","Rodoplu Ã…Å¾ahin, Aslan, Demirkaya, AteÃ…Å¸oÃ„Å¸lu","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-18692-w","20220907","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37185,""
"Association of Sociodemographic and Psychosocial Factors With COVID-19-Related Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Risk Group Among Medical Students","Several previous studies have reported the negative psychological impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on medical students worldwide. This study investigated the sociodemographic and psychosocial factors associated with COVID-19-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) risk among medical students in Daegu, a region that experienced a high concentration of infections. A total of 270 students completed the self-reported questionnaires including COVID-19 exposure, psychological measurement, and sociodemographic factors. We evaluated the COVID-19-related PTSD risk group using the Korean version of the Impact of Event Scale-Revised. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the odds ratio for the COVID-19-related PTSD risk group in sociodemographic and psychosocial factors. The prevalence of the COVID-19-related PTSD risk group was 10.4% in medical students. Among sociodemographic factors, lower grades (specially, first-year medical students) and current smokers were associated with the COVID-19-related PTSD risk. Indirect exposure to COVID-19 was also associated with this risk. Meanwhile, having higher resilience, self-esteem, and social support were less likely to be associated with COVID-19-related PTSD risk. This study suggested that it is necessary to develop a system for the screening and managing of COVID-19-related PTSD risk group among medical students, especially high-risk groups during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lee, Lee, Chang, Won, Woo, Kim","https://doi.org/10.30773/pi.2022.0080","20220906","COVID-19; Korea; Medical students; Mental health; Post-traumatic stress disorders; Risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37186,""

Using data from the 16th Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-Based Survey (2020) of 46,475 adolescents, we examined sleep duration and satisfaction and examined mental health for depressive symptoms, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. The data were analyzed using complex sample descriptive statistics and a multiple logistic regression model. In 2020, the average sleep duration was 6.3 hours, and the sleep satisfaction rate was 30.8%. Depressive symptom and suicidal ideation rates were 24.2 and 10.3, respectively. These values are slightly better than those previously reported, before COVID-19. However, poor sleep was still associated with mental health. The likelihood of mental health problems was higher among those who slept for six hours or less than for those who slept for eight hours or more (p&lt;0.05). Additionally, the results showed that the lower the sleep satisfaction, the higher the likelihood of mental health problems (p&lt;0.05).

"Remote workers' perceived health during the COVID-19 pandemic: an exploratory study of influencing factors in the IT and communications sector in Malta","The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a sudden switch to remote working that many organisations and workers were unprepared for. The study investigates the perceived impact of remote working on workers' health and influencing factors. The topic has received limited attention within published studies. A cross-sectional online survey was distributed to IT and communication remote workers in Malta (N=459). Closed-ended questions were analysed quantitatively in order to identify perceived changes in health. Open-ended questions were analysed qualitatively to determine the perceived reasons for such changes. More workers reported that their health had deteriorated than improved during the first 12 months of the pandemic. Greater proportions of remote work were associated with improved levels of health. Several factors were perceived to have influenced levels of health, including: health behaviours, such as physical activity, nutrition, and sleep; the development of disease, particularly mental health issues; work related factors, such as social support, work demands, and the blurring of work-life boundaries; and personal factors, including family life and leisure. The study concludes that remote working can be beneficial for health when workers engage in the correct health-promoting behaviours and are provided with the necessary support, both during their working and private life.","Fiorini","https://doi.org/10.2486/indhealth.2022-0018","20220904","COVID-19; Mental health; Occupational health; Remote work; Telework; Work from home","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37188,""
"State-level unemployment and negative emotions throughout the Covid-19 pandemic in the United States","Although prior research has assessed public mental health in the U.S. throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, it is unclear how area-level unemployment impacted psychological well-being; moreover, studies that examine potential effect heterogeneity of the impact of area-level unemployment on well-being by employment status are lacking. To address these shortcomings, this study utilized data from Gallup's repeated cross-sectional, nationally representative COVID-19 web survey collected between April 2020 and July 2021 (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯132,971). Survey modified Poisson regression models were estimated to determine the association between current unemployment rate in respondents' state of residence and experience of each of the following negative emotions during a lot of the prior day: sadness, worry, stress, anger, loneliness, depression, and anxiety. These models were stratified by employment status and sequentially adjusted for individual-level covariates, state fixed effects and current state-level COVID-19 mortality. State-level unemployment was most strongly associated with sadness, followed by worry, anger, loneliness, stress, and anxiety; no associations were observed for depression. For sadness, worry, and stress, associations were strongest among full-time employed and retired individuals, and weakest among unemployed respondents and homemakers. Moreover, there was some evidence that state-level unemployment was negatively associated with the experience of anger in the early stages of the pandemic, and positively in its later stages. In sum, these findings suggest that Americans' emotional experience during the COVID-19 pandemic was considerably impacted by the state of the economy, highlighting the need for risk-buffering social policies.","Hagen, Lai, Goldmann","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2022.107239","20220904","COVID-19; Public mental health; Unemployment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37189,""
"Associations between depressive symptoms and quality of life among residents of Wuhan, China during the later stage of the COVID-19 pandemic: A network analysis","Various populations have experienced significant increases in depression and decreased quality of life (QOL) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This network analysis study was designed to elucidate interconnections between particular depressive symptoms and different aspects of QOL and identify the most clinically important symptoms in this network among adults in Wuhan China, the initial epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional, convenience-sampling study (NÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯2459) was conducted between May 25 to June 18, 2020, after the lockdown policy had been lifted in Wuhan. Depressive symptoms and QOL were measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and first two items of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire - brief version (WHOQOL-BREF), respectively. A network structure was constructed from the extended Bayesian Information Criterion (EBIC) model. Network centrality strength and bridge strength were evaluated along with the stability of the derived network model. Loss of energy (DEP-4) and Guilt feelings (DEP-6) were the two central symptoms with the highest strength as well as the two most prominent bridge symptoms connecting the clusters of depression and quality of life (QOL) in tandem with the two nodes from the QOL cluster. Network structure and bridge strengths remained stable after randomly dropping 75Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% of the sample. Interventions targeting ""Loss of energy"" and ""Guilt feelings"" should be evaluated as strategies for reducing depressive symptoms and promoting improved QOL in COVID-19-affected populations.","Zhao, Zhang, Li, Zhang, Guo, Cheung, Jackson, Yang, Xiang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.08.104","20220904","Depression; Later stage of COVID-19; Network analysis; Quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37190,""
"Mental health symptoms 1Ã¢â‚¬Â¯year after the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain: The role of pre-existing mental disorders and their type","The type of pre-existing disorder might determine changes in mental health symptoms (i.e., anxiety, depression) during the COVID-19 pandemic and influence the effect of psychological factors (e.g., social support, resilience, stress) on such symptoms. Longitudinal data from two assessments (June-2020 and February/March-2021) collected through telephone interviews (Spanish general population) were analysed. Outcome variables included anxiety (GAD-7) and depressive symptoms (PHQ-8). Psychological factors included COVID-perceived stress (adapted COVID-perceived risk scale), social support (OSSS-3), and resilience (CD-RISC). Pre-existing mental conditions (3 groups: mood, anxiety, and comorbid depression+anxiety) were assessed using the CIDI checklist. Changes in anxiety and depressive symptoms between baseline and follow-up were assessed with the paired samples Wilcoxon test. Tobit regression and interaction models were conducted to test associations between psychological factors and these symptoms in follow-up. Final sample included 1942 participants (mean age 49.6Ã¢â‚¬Â¯yrs., Ã‚Â±16.7; 51.7Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% females). Anxiety symptoms increased in all groups except for those with pre-existing mood conditions. Depressive symptoms only increased in those without pre-existing mental disorders and in those with pre-existing anxiety. Higher baseline resilience, increases in social support, and decreases in COVID-perceived stress were associated with lower anxiety and depressive symptoms. The type of pre-existing mental disorder did not modify these associations. Lack of pre-pandemic data and the limited number of pre-existing mental conditions.

"The ""loneliness epidemic"", intersecting risk factors and relations to mental health help-seeking: A population-based study during COVID-19 lockdown in Canada","Pandemic-induced social distancing and stay-at-home orders, while successful in decreasing the transmission of COVID-19, could exacerbate loneliness. Few studies have examined how pandemic-related social determinants intersect to shape pandemic loneliness and its relations to mental health care in Canada. A population-representative sample of 3772 adults from the Canadian Perspective Survey Series (CPSS-6; January 25 to 31, 2021) was analyzed. Gender-specific logistic regression was employed to investigate the association between three-item loneliness scale (UCLA-3) with socio-demographics, job precarity, health behaviours, social isolation indicators, and mental health help-seeking. Classification and Regression Tree (CART) modelling was also used to identify intersecting risk factors and the most important predictor of severe loneliness (UCLA-3 scoreÃ¢â‚¬Â¯Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬Â¯7). The estimated prevalence of severe loneliness was 34.7Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% in Canada, with women significantly higher than men (38.1Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% vs 31.3Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%, pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001). Pandemic loneliness were more prevalent in female (ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.53, 99Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% CI: 1.26-1.85), those who were younger (OR's range 1.42-3.00), women without college degree (ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.44, 99Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% CI: 1.01-2.04), those living alone (ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.56, 99Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% CI: 1.09-2.23), immigrant men (ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.79, 99Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% CI: 1.23-2.60), those with small network (OR's range: 1.73-3.26), those who were absent from work due to COVID-19 related reasons (ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯2.11, 99Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% CI: 1.04-4.28), past-month binge drinkers (OR's range: 1.39-1.70) and cannabis user (ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.47, 99Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% CI: 1.12-1.93). The CART algorithm identifies that immigrants who experienced pandemic-triggered job insecurity were the most-at-risk group of severely loneliness. Loneliness was positively associated with formal help-seeking from mental health professionals (ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.71, 99Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% CI: 1.21-2.41), informal help-seeking from social circle (ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.51, 99Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% CI: 1.17-1.95), and unmet mental health needs (ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.78, 99Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% CI: 1.29-2.49). Cross-sectional data prohibits causal inferences. The COVID-19 pandemic converges with loneliness epidemic in Canada. Prevention and intervention programs should target upstream social determinants of mental health, especially the intersection of migration status and job precarity, to eliminate loneliness during the pandemic.","Lin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.08.131","20220904","COVID-19; General population; Loneliness; Machine learning; Psychiatric epidemiology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37192,""
"Risk factors for heightened COVID-19-Related anxiety among breast cancer patients","The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted medical care, increased isolation, and exacerbated anxiety in breast cancer patients. Since March 2020, Breastcancer.org experienced a sustained surge in requested pandemic-related information and support. To characterize the pandemic-related experiences of breast cancer patients, we surveyed the Breastcancer.org Community early in the COVID-19 era. Breastcancer.org Community members were invited to complete an online questionnaire regarding their experience during the pandemic. Self-reported data on demographics, comorbidities, care disruptions, anxiety, coping ability, telemedicine use, and satisfaction with care were collected. Results were analyzed using Stata 16.0 (Stata Corp., Inc). Included were 568 current and previous breast cancer patients, primarily with U.S. residence. Overall, 43.8% reported at least one comorbidity associated with severe COVID-19 illness and 61.9% experienced care delays. Moderate to extreme anxiety about contracting COVID-19 was reported by 36.5%, increasing with number of comorbidities (33.0% vs. 55.4%, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.021), current breast cancer diagnosis (30.4% vs. 42.5%, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.011), and poorer coping ability (15.5% vs. 53.9%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001). Moderate to extreme anxiety about cancer care disruptions was reported by 29.1%, increasing with current breast cancer diagnosis (19.1% vs. 38.9%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001), actual delayed care (18.9% vs. 35.3%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001), and poorer coping ability (13.1% vs. 57.7%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001). Most utilized telehealth and found it helpful, but also expressed increased anxiety and subjectively expressed that these were less preferable. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, anxiety was reported by a large proportion of breast cancer patients, with increased prevalence in those with risk factors.

"OnTrack Chile for people with early psychosis: a study protocol for a Hybrid Type 1 trial","Substantial data from high-income countries support early interventions in the form of evidence-based Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) for people experiencing First Episode Psychosis (FEP) to ameliorate symptoms and minimize disability. Chile is unique among Latin American countries in providing universal access to FEP services through a national FEP policy that mandates the identification of FEP individuals in primary care and guarantees delivery of community-based FEP treatments within a public health care system. Nonetheless, previous research has documented that FEP services currently provided at mental health clinics do not provide evidence-based approaches. This proposal aims to address this shortfall by first adapting OnTrackNY (OTNY), a CSC program currently being implemented across the USA, into OnTrackChile (OTCH), and then examine its effectiveness and implementation in Chile. The Dynamic Adaptation Process will be used first to inform the adaptation and implementation of OTCH to the Chilean context. Then, a Hybrid Type 1 trial design will test its effectiveness and cost and evaluate its implementation using a cluster-randomized controlled trial (RCT) (N = 300 from 21 outpatient clinics). The OTCH program will be offered in half of these outpatient clinics to individuals ages 15-35. Usual care services will continue to be offered at the other clinics. Given the current COVID-19 pandemic, most research and intervention procedures will be conducted remotely. The study will engage participants over the course of 2 years, with assessments administered at enrollment, 12 months, and 24 months. Primary outcomes include implementation (fidelity, acceptability, and uptake) and service outcomes (person-centeredness, adherence, and retention). Secondary outcomes comprise participant-level outcomes such as symptoms, functioning, and recovery orientation. Over the course of the study, interviews and focus groups with stakeholders will be conducted to better understand the implementation of OTCH. Findings from this study will help determine the feasibility, effectiveness, and cost for delivering CSC services in Chile. Lessons learned about facilitators and barriers related to the implementation of the model could help inform the approach needed for these services to be further expanded throughout Latin America. www. gov NCT04247711 .

"Development and implementation of an online community as a strategy for mixed methods research during a pandemic","Conducting mixed methods research is critical for healthcare researchers to understand attitudes, behaviors, and experiences on health-related topics, such as vaccine acceptance. As the COVID-19 pandemic has made it difficult to employ traditional, face-to-face qualitative methodologies, this paper describes the use of a virtual platform to conduct person-centered research. To overcome these challenges and better understand the attitudes and behaviors of vaccine-eligible individuals in the United States, an online health community called the Virtual Engagement Research Community (VERC) was designed and implemented. Using the Health Belief Model as a framework, the VERC employed a mixed methods approach to elicit insights, which included discussion topics, rapid polls, and surveys. Throughout the initial enrollment period of April-October 2021, continuous improvement efforts were made to bolster recruitment and member engagement. This agile research strategy was successful in utilizing mixed methods to capture community sentiments regarding vaccines. While this community focused on vaccination, the methodology holds promise for other areas of health research such as obesity, HIV, mental health disorders, and diabetes. The COVID-19 pandemic has made it difficult to conduct research in person, but qualitative and quantitative data remain critical for developing research design. To gather and understand vaccine perceptions, opinions, and behaviors in a real time manner, The Virtual Engagement Research Community (VERC) was launched. As of October 2021, the VERC had 72 members who had the opportunity to participate in research events such as surveys, polls, discussion topics, and moderated chats in a private, invitation-only virtual community. The online format offered researchers the opportunity to adapt the types and frequency of engagements, fine-tune the research questions based on community responses and current events, and adjust the analysis and reporting methodology as needed to increase participation and maximize the value of the VERC. The success of the VERC and the lessons learned support the use of online communities to enhance mixed methods research as a valuable strategy for other health researchers.","Shea, Bushen, Ahmad, Geonnotti, LaMori, Terrey, Gonzalez, Shuman","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40900-022-00383-5","20220905","Mixed methods; Online health community; Pandemic; Qualitative research; Vaccines","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37195,""
"Building Emotional Awareness and Mental Health (BEAM): study protocol for a phase III randomized controlled trial of the BEAM app-based program for mothers of children 18-36 months","The prevalence of maternal depression and anxiety has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, and pregnant individuals are experiencing concerningly elevated levels of mental health symptoms worldwide. Many individuals may now be at heightened risk of postpartum mental health disorders. There are significant concerns that a cohort of children may be at-risk for impaired self-regulation and mental illness due to elevated exposure to perinatal mental illness. With both an increased prevalence of depression and limited availability of services due to the pandemic, there is an urgent need for accessible eHealth interventions for mothers of young children. The aims of this trial are to evaluate the efficacy of the Building Emotion Awareness and Mental Health (BEAM) app-based program for reducing maternal depression symptoms (primary outcome) and improve anxiety symptoms, parenting stress, family relationships, and mother and child functioning (secondary outcomes) compared to treatment as usual (TAU). A two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) with repeated measures will be used to evaluate the efficacy of the BEAM intervention compared to TAU among a sample of 140 mothers with children aged 18 to 36 months, who self-report moderate-to-severe symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. Individuals will be recruited online, and those randomized to the treatment group will participate in 10 weeks of psychoeducation modules, an online social support forum, and weekly group teletherapy sessions. Assessments will occur at 18-36 months postpartum (pre-test, T1), immediately after the last week of the BEAM intervention (post-test, T2), and at 3 months after the intervention (follow-up, T3). eHealth interventions have the potential to address elevated maternal mental health symptoms, parenting stress, and child functioning concerns during and after the COVID-19 pandemic and to provide accessible programming to mothers who are in need of support. This RCT will build on an open pilot trial of the BEAM program and provide further evaluation of this evidence-based intervention. Findings will increase our understanding of depression in mothers with young children and reveal the potential for long-term improvements in maternal and child health and family well-being.

"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Fabry Disease Patients: an examination of Mood Status, Therapy Adherence, and COVID-19 infection","Fabry disease (FD) is a rare metabolic disorder, in which a lifelong enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) constitutes the cornerstone of disease-specific therapy. In this study, we examined the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures on the management of FD patients. We collected data in three main domains; mood status, adherence to ERT, and COVID-19 infection. We used the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to evaluate the mood statuses of FD patients and the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS) and the Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS) to assess patients' adherence to non-disease specific therapy. We also examined a control group to compare the mood status data. A total of 67 FD patients (males: 47.8%, mean age: 37.0Ã‚Â years) were recruited to the study, of which 58 were receiving ERT. Both the HADS depression and anxiety scores were higher in the control group compared to FD patients. During the first wave of the pandemic, 25 patients reported to have missed an infusion for a mean of 2.3Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.7 doses and half of the patients had adopted a home-based infusion treatment regimen. COVID-19 infection developed in 25 patients, of which one died. The majority of our patients (71.6%) have had at least one shot of the vaccine. We found that FD patients were more resilient to the negative psychological effects of lockdown. Traumatic growth may be an important factor in explaining this finding. Government-supported home therapy programs might be beneficial for FD patients to increase the therapy adherence.","Karaca, Dincer, Ozcan, Sarac, Ahmadzada, Alagoz, Bakir, Kiykim, Trabulus, Seyahi","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13023-022-02491-7","20220907","COVID-19; Enzyme replacement therapy; Fabry disease; Psychological effect","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37197,""
"COVID-19 related stigma among the general population in Iran","COVID-19 related stigma has been identified as a critical issue since the beginning of the pandemic. We developed a valid and reliable questionnaire to measure COVID-19 related enacted stigma, inflicted by the non-infected general population. We applied the questionnaire to measure COVID-19 related enacted stigma among Tehran citizens from 27 to 30 September 2020. A preliminary questionnaire with 18 items was developed. The total score ranged from 18 to 54; a higher score indicated a higher level of COVID-19 related stigma. An expert panel assessed the face and content validity. Of 1637 randomly recruited Tehran citizens without a history of COVID-19 infection, 1064 participants consented and were interviewed by trained interviewers by phone. Item content validity index (I-CVI), Item content validity ratio (I-CVR), and Item face validity index (I-FVI) were higher than 0.78 for all 18 items. The content and face validity were established with a scale content validity index (S-CVI) of 0.90 and a scale face validity index (S-CVI) of 93.9%, respectively. Internal consistency of the questionnaire with 18 items was confirmed with Cronbach's alpha of 0.625. Exploratory factor analysis revealed five latent variables, including ""blaming"", ""social discrimination"", ""dishonor label"", ""interpersonal contact"", and ""retribution and requital attitude"". The median of the stigma score was 24 [25th percentile: 22, 75<sup>the</sup> percentile: 28]. A large majority (86.8%) of participants reported a low level of stigma with a score below 31. None of the participants showed a high level of stigma with a score above 43. We found that the higher the educational level the lower the participant's stigma score. We found a low level of stigmatizing thoughts and behavior among the non-infected general population in Tehran, which may be due to the social desirability effect, to the widespread nature of COVID-19, or to the adaptation to sociocultural diversity of the large city.","Faghankhani, Nourinia, Rafiei-Rad, Adeli, Yeganeh, Sharifi, Namazi, Khosravifar, Bahramian, Fathimakvand, Golalipour, Mirfazeli, Baradaran, Thornicroft, Jalali Nadoushan","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-14039-2","20220907","COVID-19; Cross-sectional studies; Enacted stigma; Iran; Mental health; Pandemics; Social stigma; Surveys and questionnaires; Urban population","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37198,""

"Evolution of physical function, cognition, depressive mood, and quality of life during the Covid-19 pandemic in prefrail elderly people: A longitudinal cohort study (Covid-Mefap)","Confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the living habits and health of the population, notably in the pre-frail elderly. This study aimed to study the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical function, mental function (cognition and mood), and quality of life of pre-frail elderly individuals over 70Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years of age following confinement as well as to analyze the variables associated with the observed changes. Observational study of a cohort of pre-frail community-dwelling older adults over 70Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years of age during the COVID-19 pandemic conducted in primary care. The main outcome variables were recorded during face-to-face interviews between December 14 of 2020 and August 12 of 2021 using scales for the evaluation of physical function (Short Physical Performance Battery), cognition (Lobo's Mini-Examen Cognoscitivo), depressive mood (Geriatric Depression Scale), and quality of life (EuroQol-5D-3L). Covariates: sociodemographic data and variables related to the pandemic and general health (social support network, COVID-19 infection, exercising, and leisure activities) were also collected. The Student's t-test for paired samples and multivariate linear regression models were employed for the statistical analyses. Ninety-two subjects were included in the study.

"Physical exercise prevents behavioral alterations in a reserpine-treated zebrafish: A putative depression model","Major depressive disorder (MDD) has increasingly reached the world population with an expressive increase in recent years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we used adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model to verify the effects of reserpine on behavior and neurotransmitter levels. We observed an increase in the immobile time and time spent in the bottom zone of the tank in reserpine-exposed animals. The results demonstrated a decrease in distance traveled and velocity. Reserpine exposure did not induce changes in memory and social interaction compared to the control group. We also evaluated the influence of exposure to fluoxetine, a well-known antidepressant, on the behavior of reserpine-exposed animals. We observed a reversal of behavioral alterations caused by reserpine. To verify whether behavioral alterations in the putative depression model induced by reserpine could be prevented, the animals were subjected to physical exercise for 6Ã¢â‚¬Â¯weeks. The results showed a protective effect of the physical exercise against the behavioral changes caused by reserpine in zebrafish. In addition, we observed a reduction in dopamine and serotonin levels and an increase in the 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) levels in the brain. Physical exercise was able to prevent the changes in dopamine and serotonin levels, reinforcing that the preventive effect promoted by physical exercise is related to the modulation of neurotransmitter levels. Our findings showed that reserpine was effective in the induction of a putative depression model in zebrafish and that physical exercise may be an alternative to prevent the effects induced by reserpine.","de Melo Martins, Pettersen, RÃƒÂ¼bensam, da Silva, Gaspary, Wiprich, Altenhofen, Bonan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pbb.2022.173455","20220905","Major depressive disorder; Physical exercise; Reserpine; Zebrafish","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37201,""
"Attitude toward COVID-19 vaccines and its association with depressive symptoms in 386,924 Chinese primary school students during COVID-19 epidemic normalization","Before Chinese primary school students were generally vaccinated against the COVID-19 vaccine, this study evaluated the willingness of this population and its influencing factors before vaccination, and evaluate its association between attitudes toward the vaccine and depressive symptoms. A cross-sectional study involved 386,924 primary school students using a cluster sampling method during May 21-27, 2021. The Chinese version of the Children Depression Inventory (CDI) was used to assess depressive symptoms. Multiple logistic regression analysis models were used to estimate the relationship between attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines and depressive symptoms. Among the participants, the prevalence of depressive symptoms was higher in higher grades. The prevalence was higher in fifth and sixth grade students than third and fourth grade students and first and second grades (10.22% vs. 6.07% vs. 3.04%). In addition, 20.79% of students do not know whether the vaccine can protect him from the COVID-19 infection, and 40.60% of students do not know whether the vaccine is safe. Of note, in terms of attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines, students with more positive attitudes have a lower risk of depressive symptoms (adjusted odds ratio (aOR)Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.151; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.140-0.164).

"Associations of parenting daily hassles with parents' mental health during the COVID-19 school closure","Parenting is a demanding task associated with parents' mental health, which is likely exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. The present study investigated daily parenting hassles and their effects on parents' mental health during this period. A total of 7314 parents with children aged 3-14 years old completed a sociodemographic questionnaire and reported on their perceived daily parenting hassles, mental health, family support, and co-parenting during the COVID-19 school closure. Most parents (73.4%) showed different degrees of daily hassles, and a relatively higher prevalence of depression (18.7%), anxiety (22.4%), and stress (12.1%) were found. Motherhood, parents' younger ages, lower education parents, job loss, and having younger children, boys, and multiple children were associated with elevated daily parenting hassles and mental health issues. Importantly, daily parenting hassles were uniquely associated with mental health problems after controlling for various sociodemographic characteristics, family support, and co-parenting. Furthermore, family support and co-parenting can attenuate daily parenting hassles, which, in turn, protect parents' mental health. The findings of the present study underscore the critical need to consider daily parenting hassles and their effects on the mental health of parents during the COVID-19 lockdown. The present study also outlines potential factors (family support and co-parenting) that attenuate parents' daily parenting hassles and protect their mental health during the COVID-19 lockdown.","Li, Xu, Xie, Wang, Li, Ma, Xia","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.115301","20220908","COVID-19; Coparenting; Daily parenting hassles; Family support; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37203,""
"Anxiety, Depression and Death Anxiety in Individuals with COVID-19","This study aimed to determine the death anxiety, anxiety, and depression levels of the individuals staying at the hospital due to COVID-19. The study recruited 300 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were staying at specialized clinics in the hospital. Three tools - A Patient Information Form, the Death Anxiety Scale (DAS), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)-were used to collect data. The findings of the present study revealed that 28.7% of the participants were at a high risk for developing anxiety and 45.0% were equally at a high risk for developing depression. 33.3% of the participants suffered from high level of death anxiety. There was a positive and highly significant correlation between their death anxiety and their anxiety and depression scores (<i>p</i> &lt; .001). Accordingly, more evidence-based studies need to be conducted that examine how effective non-pharmacological practices are at helping COVID-19 patients by identifying their anxiety, depression, and death anxiety. Furthermore, nurses need to take care of patient care in a holistic manner that would include addressing patients' psychological needs alongside their physical problems.","KaradaÃ„Å¸, Ergin, Erden","https://doi.org/10.1177/00302228221124981","20220905","COVID-19; anxiety; death anxiety; depression; nursing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37204,""
"Self-harm and suicidal ideation in Pakistani youth amid COVID-19 pandemic: findings of a large, cross-sectional study","Suicide is the fourth leading cause of death among young people. COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated various factors which could lead to suicidal ideation. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess self-harm and suicidal ideation among university students in Pakistan. We conducted an online, cross-sectional study among students of four major Pakistani universities. The generalized anxiety scale and patient health questionnaire were used to screen students for anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation/self-harm. Suicidal ideation/self-harm was determined from the ninth-item (score Ã¢â€°Â¥1) of the patient health questionnaire. Brief-COPE was used to assess coping methods. This study included 1134 respondents (age 21.76Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 3.48Ã‚Â years; female 70.5%). Around 32% students reported having thoughts of death and/or self-harm in the past 2 weeks (several days 14.8%, over half the days 7.1%, and nearly every day 10.2%). Moreover, these thoughts were equally prevalent among the demographics. Suicidal ideation/self-harm was found to be increased by the severity of generalized anxiety and depression (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). In conclusion, the rate of suicidal ideation/self-harm is alarmingly high in Pakistani university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a dire need to initiate the psychological measures to prevent suicidal behaviors in Pakistani youth. Addressing mental health disparities and preparing support systems to mitigate mental health consequences as the pandemic evolves will continue to be needed urgently.","Salman, Shehzadi, Mustafa, Mallhi, Khan, Khan, Hussain","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2022.2119483","20220905","COVID-19; Pakistan; suicidal ideation; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37205,""

"The role of meaning in life in psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic","Meaning in life may function as a protective factor in the context of potentially traumatic experiences, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigated the associations between meaning and psychological distress (i.e., depression, anxiety, COVID-19-related PTSD) prospectively and cross-sectionally. We hypothesized that meaning inversely predicts peri-pandemic distress and that meaning moderates the association between being negatively affected by the pandemic and distress. We additionally explored cross-sectional associations between meaning subcomponents and distress and a meaning violations perspective. Undergraduate students (<i>NÃ¢â‚¬â€°</i>=Ã¢â‚¬â€°109) completed questionnaires before (October 2019 to March 2020; meaning, anxiety) and during the pandemic (April to June 2020; meaning, meaning subcomponents, depression, anxiety, PTSD). Correcting for family-wise errors, meaning prospectively predicted less depression and anxiety, but not PTSD. Correcting for family-wise errors, peri-pandemic meaning was consistently related with peri-pandemic distress. Meaning did not moderate the link between being affected by the pandemic and distress. The meaning subcomponent comprehension was most strongly related with distress and a meaning violations perspective was partly supported. Meaning emerged as a significant correlate of peri-pandemic distress. Current findings should be replicated longitudinally and experimentally to establish their robustness and to examine the causal influence of meaning on distress.","Seidel, Daniels, Ostafin","https://doi.org/10.1080/10615806.2022.2113993","20220905","COVID-19; Meaning in life; PTSD; anxiety; depression; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37207,""
"1000 Hometown Heroes: Mobilising community social influencers for COVID-19 prevention, care and coping","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) created life-disrupting stressors that disproportionately burden disadvantaged communities with devastating impacts that extend far beyond the burden of the disease itself, including joblessness, housing and food insecurity, educational system upheavals, isolation due to disrupted relationships, worsened mental health and substance use and violence. Socially interconnected community members are resources whose efforts can be mobilised to improve COVID-19 coping within their social networks. This research examined the feasibility, acceptability, and reach of a social media-based peer influencer intervention for COVID-19 coping. Over a 9-month period in 2020, the project enrolled 1253 social influencers in Milwaukee-primarily ethnic and racial minorities-who regularly received and passed along messages to members of their social networks that provided advice about COVID-19 pandemic coping, economic survival, health protection, mental health, family needs, social justice and other impacts. Messages were shared by influencers with others over social media and also text messages, phone calls and conversations. Facebook social media tracking metrics objectively measured the community reach of social influencers' messages. Quantitative surveys and qualitative follow-up interviews with a subset of influencers also measured the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Social media monitoring metrics showed that, by the end of the project, influencers' messages reached an average of 7978 unique individuals per week and had an average of 13,894 total views per week, with more than 140,000 total cumulative organic impressions. More than half of social influencers indicated that-beyond Facebook message sharing-they shared COVID-19 prevention, care, and coping messages with social network members in conversations, phone calls and text messages. Social influencers reported that they valued having the opportunity to help community members to cope with pandemic stressors by conveying practical COVID-19 coping advice.","Kelly, Walsh, Christenson, Glasman, Galletly, Quinn, Algiers, Pearson, Amirkhanian","https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.14000","20220905","COVID-19; community coping; intervention; prevention; social influencers; social media; social networks","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37208,""
"The impact of covid-19: Anxiety, depression, and wellbeing among medical students","Medical students have been considered as a vulnerable group at higher risk of mental health issues during the COVID-19 outbreak. We set out to detect symptoms of depression and anxiety in medical students in St. Petersburg (Russia) during the first wave of COVID-19 outbreak and explore the associations between psychosocial factors related to the pandemic and students' psychological well-being. An anonymous online survey of medical students was conducted in May-June 2020. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used for screening anxiety and depression symptoms. The final sample consisted of 144 students (78.5% females). About 69.4% of respondents reported that COVID-19 pandemic and social restrictions were a new source of stress in their lives. More than one-third (38.9%) of respondents reported a need for psychological (emotional) support due to a change in their daily life during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the vast majority (83.9%) of these respondents indicated an increased need for support in this specific period. Symptoms of anxiety were reported by 55.8% of females (HADS score: 9.05Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.69) and 48.4% of males (8.09Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.0), and symptoms of depression were found in 38.9% of females (6.40Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.57) and 41.9% of males (6.16Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.21).

"The psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers","As unprecedented and prolonged crisis, healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk of developing psychological disorders. We investigated the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on HCWs. This cross-sectional study randomly recruited 439 HCWs in Hunan Cancer Hospital via a web-based sampling method from June 1st 2021 to March 31st 2022. Anxiety and depression levels were measured using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) was used to assess the presence and severity of PTSD. Fear was measured by modified scale of SARS. Data were collected based on these questionnaires. Differences in fear, anxiety, depression and PTSD among HCWs with different clinical characteristics were analyzed using a multivariate analysis of variance. The Cronbach's alpha scores in our samples were calculated to evaluate the internal consistency of HADS, fear scale and PCL-5. The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and PTSD in HCWs was 15.7, 9.6, and 12.8%, respectively. Females and nurses were with higher fear level (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) and higher PTSD levels (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Further analysis of female HCWs revealed that PTSD levels in the 35-59 years-old age group were higher than that in other groups; while married female HCWs were with increased fear than single HCWs. The internal consistency was good, with Cronbach's ÃŽÂ± = 0.88, 0.80 and 0.84 for HADS, fear scale, and PCL, respectively.

"COVID-19 infection prevention and control procedures and institutional trust: Perceptions of Palestinian healthcare workers","Lack of trust in institutional control measures during Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks may affect healthcare workers' (HCWs) levels of stress and wellbeing, and as a consequence, may influence their trust and confidence in their organization. This study aims to understand factors associated with healthcare workers perceptions of trust in organizational preparedness, communication, and infection risk during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study was conducted among HCWs (<i>n</i> = 876) in 16 COVID 19 healthcare facilities between October and December 2020 in Palestine (Gaza Strip, West Bank and East Jerusalem). A stratified purposive sample using an online self-administered Arabic version of a questionnaire was used for data collection. The questionnaire used for this study was adapted from the World Health Organization Blueprint Novel Coronavirus Perceptions of healthcare workers regarding local infection prevention and control procedures for a COVID-19 research protocol.Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences software version 23. In the bivariate analysis, <i>T</i>-test, one-way ANOVA and Ãâ€¡2 test were used at a significant <i>p</i>-value &lt; 0.05. In the multivariable logistic regression analyses, the adjusted odds ratios and its 95% confidence intervals are presented. Findings showed that confidence in the systems' ability to manage COVID-19 cases, encouragement and support from senior medical/nursing staff to apply recommended IPC measures, and good levels of mental health increased trust in the organization. Additionally, receiving proper training on IPC procedures for other communicable diseases, having access to clear policies and procedures related to IPC procedures for COVID-19, and providing PPE during the previous clinical shift also increased trust. However, the intention to use recommended PPE when treating patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 when having access to it and feeling emotional was negatively correlated with this trust. HCWs should be provided with clear, accessible communications about policies and protocols, as well as training about infection prevention and control, personal protective equipment, and support during pandemics to increase their trust in the healthcare system. Additionally, the improvement in HCWs' wellbeing can be attributed to a greater sense of trust in institutions.","El Sharif, Ahmead, Imam","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.947593","20220907","COVID-19; Palestine; healthcare workers; institutional trust; perception","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37213,""
"The impact of COVID-19 on self-reported burnout and health and mental health services in Nampula, Mozambique","The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on self-reported burnout of health workers, quality of care, and perceptions of COVID-19-related stigma in Mozambique. We conducted a cross-sectional quantitative assessment of 170 frontline health workers in Nampula District, Mozambique, including 149 (87.6%) primary care providers and 21 (12.4%) mental health specialists. Of the 170 frontline workers, only 10.1% of frontline workers were experiencing more professional burnout, whereas 33.3% felt it had lessened. The perceived impact on quality of care also varied, without any significant differences by sex, education level, or mental health training background. Compared to the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, 42.3 and 38.1% providers felt that their ability to provide mental health and general health care, respectively, had worsened, compared to 57.7 and 61.9% who believed that either there was no change, or that the work had become easier. Likewise, 26.8% of providers felt that their ability to meet patients' needs had gotten more difficult, whereas 43.4% reported no change and 29.8% reported that it was easier. Twenty-two percent of providers reported an overall increase in caseloads since before the pandemic whereas the majority (67.9%) reported a decrease. Providers believed that 57.1% of people in general were afraid of people with COVID-19, 27.5% were afraid of a person recovered from COVID-19, and 39.9% were afraid of a person with family members with COVID-19. The perceived stigma about healthcare professionals was also low; only 27.4% believed that people in general were afraid of healthcare providers who deliver care to people with COVID-19. In contrast with other global studies, many healthcare workers in our sample reported a reduction in burnout, which may be associated with the lower overall caseloads seen during this period.

The patient received30-45 minutes of hyperbaric oxygen with 15 minutes of pressurizing and depressurizing at 2.0 atmosphere absolute (ATA) with or without airbrakesas per the critical care team. Oxygen requirement, PaO2, andcondition at discharge were considered as primary outcome variables. Among the 50 participants studied, the mean age was 53.64Ã‚Â±13.26 years. Out of 50 participants, 49(98.00%) had PaO2Ã¢â€°Â¤80 mmHg, and one (2.00%) had &gt;80 PaO2. All the participants 50(100%) had PaO2 as 90 mmHg after three sittings. This studyshows promising results in using HBOT to overcome respiratory failure in COVID-19. HBOT reduced the need for oxygen by improving the oxygen saturation levels.","Palaniappan, Shaikh, Kirthika","https://doi.org/10.2478/jccm-2022-0008","20220906","COVID-19; hyperbaric oxygen therapy; infectious diseases; oxygen; partial pressure","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37216,""
"Using WhatsApp During the COVID-19 Pandemic and the Emotions and Perceptions of Users","Social media is an integral part of daily life as people are exposed to considerable amounts of information via social media. In particular, WhatsApp is a messaging application used for sharing information and keeping in touch with individuals and groups. It is a platform considered appropriate for expressing emotions. This study analyzed a WhatsApp group of friends in Saudi Arabia and their messages regarding the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic during the first wave of infections to capture their attitudes, emotions, and perceptions related to the pandemic. We also investigated WhatsApp usage during COVID-19. A quantitative exploratory study and qualitative content analysis of a sample of WhatsApp group interactions during the pandemic in Saudi Arabia were combined. We found that WhatsApp was used more frequently than other social media platforms for communication with family and friends. Moreover, denial was the first behavior evident at the beginning of the pandemic, followed by hope, sadness, and anxiety, and then, panic, fear, and happiness. WhatsApp affects its users' attitudes, perceptions, and behavior just as much as any other social media. Posts and comments shared on WhatsApp reflected different emotions, ranging from fear, anger, and sadness to hope, happiness, and pride.","Moawad","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S367724","20220906","COVID-19 pandemic; WhatsApp; emotions; perception; social networks","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37217,""
"Sleep alterations following COVID-19 are associated with both neuroinflammation and psychological disorders, although at different times","By the end of 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 rapidly spread all over the world impacting mental health and sleep habits. Insomnia, impaired sleep quality, and circadian rhythm alterations were all observed during the pandemic, especially among healthcare workers and in patients with acute and post-acute COVID-19. Sleep disruption may induce a pro-inflammatory state associated with an impairment of immune system function. We investigated the relationship between sleep alterations, psychological disorders, and inflammatory blood biomarkers in patients with post-acute COVID-19. We enrolled 47 subjects diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia at <i>Santa Maria della Misericordia</i> University Hospital (Udine, Italy) between March and May 2020. Selected patients were evaluated at 2 months (T1) and 10 months (T2) after discharge. Each time, we collected clinical interviews, neurological examinations, and self-administered questionnaires to assess sleep and life quality, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Blood biomarkers of endothelial activation, neuroinflammation, and inflammatory cytokines were also measured at each follow-up. Collected variables were analyzed using comparisons between groups and linear regression models. Prevalence of insomnia increased from 10.6% up to 27.3% after COVID-19. Poor sleep quality was found in 41.5% of patients at both study visits. At T1 follow-up, poor sleepers showed higher levels of neurofilament light chain, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, and interleukin 10; no significant associations were found between sleep quality and psychological disorders. At T2 follow-up, lower sleep quality was associated with higher levels of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and interleukin 8, but also with higher scores for anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Our results suggest an association of poor sleep quality with both psychological disorders and neuroinflammation, although at different times, in previously hospitalized patients with moderate-to-critical COVID-19.","Pellitteri, Surcinelli, De Martino, Fabris, Janes, Bax, Marini, Milanic, Piani, Isola, Gigli, Valente","https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2022.929480","20220906","COVID-19; NfL; SARS-CoV-2; VCAM-1; anxiety; blood biomarkers; psychological disorders; sleep disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37218,""
"Health Priorities of Multi-Morbid Ambulatory Patients in New York City During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Analysis","During the COVID-19 pandemic, adults with chronic conditions delayed or avoided seeking preventative and general medical care, leading to adverse consequences for morbidity and mortality. In order to bring patients back into care, we, in this qualitative study, sought to understand the foremost health-related needs of our multi-morbid ambulatory patients to inform future outreach interventions. Via a telephone-based survey of our high-risk patients, defined using a validated EPIC risk model for hospitalization and ED visits, we surveyed 214 participants an open-ended question, ""What is your top health concern that you would like to speak with a doctor or nurse about"". We found 4 major themes: 1) primary care matters, 2) disruptions in health care, 3) COVID-19's impact on physical and mental health, and 4) amplified social vulnerabilities.

"""I miss seeing the kids!"": Australian teachers' changing roles, preferences, and positive and negative experiences of remote teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant upheaval in schools in Australia and internationally. The aim of this study was to map Australian teachers' positive and negative experiences during remote and online learning. Our study took place during the first COVID-19 wave, in the early stages of lockdown. Using an online instrument, we asked 210 primary and secondary teachers about changes in their teaching roles due to COVID-19. Responses were coded for positive and negative themes using inductive thematic analysis. The majority of teachers reported negative themes (88.6%), while half also reported positive themes (44.8%). Participants reported missing their students and struggling with excessive workload demands. They also experienced difficulties tracking student progress and felt worried for student wellbeing. Interestingly, concerns about technology were less common. Indeed, 19.1% enjoyed learning new online skills and integrating IT in new ways. Implications for student-teacher relationships, mental health, and future teaching are discussed.","Van Bergen, Daniel","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13384-022-00565-w","20220906","COVID-19; Online learning; Remote teaching; StudentÃ¢â‚¬â€œteacher relationships; Technology; Wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37220,""
"COVID-19 perceived stigma among survivors: A cross-sectional study of prevalence and predictors","Perceived stigma related to infectious diseases is of public health importance and can adversely impact patients' physical and mental health. This study aims to identify the level of perceived stigma among COVID-19 survivors in Qatar and investigate its predictors. An analytical cross-sectional design was employed. Four hundred and four participants who had a positive COVID-19 PCR test were randomly selected from medical records. The selected participants were interviewed to collect sociodemographic and health-related information. Perceived stigma was assessed using the COVID-19 perceived stigma scale-22 (CPSS-22) that was developed by the researchers. A descriptive analysis followed by a bivariate analysis investigated possible associations between the perceived stigma levels and independent variables. A multivariable analysis was performed using logistic regression to identify any significant associations with perceived stigma. The validity and reliability of the developed tool were also tested. The prevalence of COVID-19 perceived stigma was twenty-six percent (n=107, 26.4%) at 95% CI [22.4-30.4]. Factors associated with higher COVID-19 perceived stigma were male gender, being a manual worker, non-Arabic ethnicity, low educational level, living alone, and being isolated outside the home. However, only occupation, ethnicity, and low educational level predicted COVID-19 perceived stigma in multivariable analysis. The CPSS-22 showed excellent reliability (Cronbach's alpha 0.92). Perceived stigma was relatively common among participants. Designing programs and interventions targeting male manual workers and those of low-educational levels may assist policymakers in mitigating the stigma related to COVID-19.","Alchawa, Naja, Ali, Kehyayan, Haddad, Bougmiza","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpsy.2022.08.004","20220906","COVID-19 survivors; Qatar; perception; stereotyping; stigma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37221,""
"Hair cortisol level might be indicative for aÃ‚Â 3PM approach towards suicide risk assessment in depression: comparative analysis of mentally stable and depressed individuals versus individuals after completing suicide","Depression and suicidal behavior are interrelated, stress-associated mental health conditions, each lacking biological verifiability. Concepts of predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (3PM) are almost completely missing for both conditions but are of utmost importance. Prior research reported altered levels of the stress hormone cortisol in the scalp hair of depressed individuals, however,Ã‚Â data on hair cortisol levels (HCL) for suicide completers (SC) are missing. Here, we aimed to identify differences in HCL between subject with depression (<i>n</i> = 20), SC (<i>n</i> = 45) and mentally stable control subjects (<i>n</i> = 12) to establish the usage of HCL as a new target for 3PM. HCL was measured in extracts of pulverized hair (1-cm and 3-cm hair segments) using ELISA. In 3-cm hair segments, an average increase in HCL for depressed patients (1.66 times higher; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.011) and SC (5.46 times higher; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.65Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ãƒâ€”Ã¢â‚¬â€°10<sup>-5</sup>) compared to that for controls was observed. Furthermore, the average HCL in SC was significantly increased compared to that in the depressed group (3.28 times higher; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.4Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ãƒâ€”Ã¢â‚¬â€°10<sup>-5</sup>). A significant correlation between HCL in the 1-cm and the 3-cm hair segments, as well as a significant association between the severity of depressive symptomsÃ‚Â and HCL (3-cm segment) was found. To conclude, findings of increased HCL in subjects with depression compared to that in controls were replicatedÃ‚Â and an additional increase in HCL was seen in SC in comparison to patients with depression.

"A systematic review of the impact of COVID-19 on the game addiction of children and adolescents","During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is reported that children and adolescents who are socially isolated experience high levels of stress and various mental health problems. At present, little research has been done to collect previous studies that focused on game addiction in children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this research, we aimed to investigate the prevalence of gaming disorder during COVID-19 in children and adolescents and the various factors experienced by children and adolescents that affected gaming disorder. We searched PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane on 5 May 2021 to identify relevant literature. We extracted the prevalence estimates of game addiction from the studies to measure the global prevalence of game addiction. Then, we found the answers to the questions raised and synthesized them into several themes. We identified 2,609 articles. Among them, studies that were not related to the topic, duplicated, and that did not meet the selection criteria were excluded, and 18 studies were selected. We rated most of the studies as moderate, and a few were low, and high. A majority of studies found an increase in game usage time and game addiction score during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some children and adolescents in emotional pain play games to communicate with their peers. Regarding parenting, violent parenting and the absence of parental supervision increase levels of game addiction in children. Gaming disorder was caused by the impact of COVID-19 in a vulnerable group with predisposing factors such as depression, anxiety, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Adolescents and males scored higher on a game addiction scale, although we could not find any quantitative correlations due to the heterogeneous scales used for gaming addiction. During the COVID-19 pandemic, isolated children and adolescents reported increased gaming hours as a result of coping with their psychological pain and avoiding social isolation. Their parents, who should provide proper supervision, also failed to provide appropriate support due to the stress caused by the pandemic. Mental health providers should educate children, adolescents, and their guardians on alternative ways to relieve stress and help parents effectively control their children's usage of games.","Han, Cho, Sung, Park","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.976601","20220906","COVID-19; adolescent; children; game addiction; internet gaming disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37223,""
"Mental health interventions for adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa: A scoping review","Globally, adolescents are vulnerable to mental health problems, particularly those from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) due to impoverished living conditions and a higher prevalence of chronic conditions such as HIV/AIDS in the region. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated this risk. This calls for an urgent need for evidence-based adolescent mental health interventions to reduce the risk and burden of mental health problems in SSA. The review aims to identify and characterize existing adolescent mental health interventions in SSA, as well as to evaluate their implementation strategies and effectiveness. We systematically searched PubMed, African Index Medicus, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases for relevant articles. Furthermore, we searched gray literature databases, including Think Tank search, open gray, NGO search engine, and IGO search engine for additional relevant articles. The scoping review was conducted to identify original research articles on mental health interventions among adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa published from database inception to 31 December 2021. We carried out a narrative synthesis to report our findings. Our literature search generated 4,750 studies, of which 1,141 were duplicates, 3,545 were excluded after screening, and 64 articles met the inclusion criteria. The 64 studies describe a total of 57 unique mental health interventions comprising 40,072 adolescents. The nature of these interventions was diverse, encompassing various implementation strategies such as economic-based, family strengthening, psychoeducation, interpersonal psychotherapy, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and resilience training, among others. Most of the interventions were selective interventions that targeted adolescents at high risk of developing mental health problems including adolescents living with HIV, war-affected adolescents, orphans, adolescents from poorer backgrounds, and survivors of sexual violence. Half of the interventions were delivered by lay persons. Sixty-two of the eligible studies examined the effectiveness of the mental health interventions, of which 55 of them reported a positive significant impact on various mental health outcomes. The review findings show that there exist several diverse interventions that promote mental health among adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa. These interventions can be implemented in diverse settings including schools, communities, health facilities, and camps, and can be delivered by lay persons.","Mabrouk, Mbithi, Chongwo, Too, Sarki, Namuguzi, Atukwatse, Ssewanyana, Abubakar","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.937723","20220906","adolescents; intervention; mental health; scoping review; sub-Saharan Africa","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37224,""
"Resilience and mental health: A longitudinal cohort study of Chinese adolescents before and during COVID-19","The COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in mental health issues, mainly depression and anxiety, prompted by stressors such as the need to maintain social distance, adapting to quarantine, and lockdown policies. Resilience may be vital in protecting individuals from mental disorders. However, few studies have examined the longitudinal relationships between resilience and mental disorders (i.e., depression and anxiety) among adolescents before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to examine the association between resilience, depression, and anxiety among Chinese adolescents before and during COVID-19 using a longitudinal cross-lagged model. A total of 7,958 Chinese adolescents completed a baseline survey in the month before COVID-19 and were followed up after the COVID-19 lockdown. Structural equation modeling analyses were applied to evaluate the associations between resilience, depression, and anxiety after controlling for three covariates (i.e., gender, age, and COVID-19 effect). A higher level of resilience before COVID-19 significantly predicted decreased severity of depression and anxiety after the lockdown. Moreover, the mean level of resilience and prevalence of mental disorders (i.e., depression and anxiety) among Chinese adolescents decreased after the lockdown. These findings suggest resilience is a vital protective factor against depression and anxiety among adolescents. Furthermore, younger participants and those less affected by the pandemic could be more resilient. No significant link was found between gender and resilience in the second wave. Resilience is an essential protective factor for reducing mental disorders among Chinese adolescents exposed to COVID-19. Resilience-related interventions should be developed to efficiently promote mental health recovery among youth during pandemics.","Shi, Zhao, Liu, Hong, Jiang, Jia","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.948036","20220906","COVID-19; adolescents; anxiety; depression; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37225,""
"Media multitasking, depression, and anxiety of college students: Serial mediating effects of attention control and negative information attentional bias","The COVID-19 epidemic provides an environment for frequent media multitasking, which might associate with an increase in depression and anxiety. Since many studies have found that media multitasking negatively affects cognitive capacity, we propose a cognitive perspective to explore how media multitasking may associate with mental health. This study examined the potential mediating role of attention control and negative information attentional bias in the relationship between media multitasking and anxiety and depression. Participants (<i>n</i> = 567) were recruited from college students in China. They completed an online survey that included the Media Multitasking Inventory (MMI), Attention Control Scale (ACS), Attention to Positive and Negative Information Scale (APNI), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). After exploring the correlations between the measures, serial mediation models were examined. The results indicated significant positive correlations between media multitasking and anxiety and depression. Media multitasking, anxiety, and depression were negatively correlated with attention focusing, while positively correlated with negative information attention bias. Media multitasking did not correlate with attention shifting. Mediation modeling demonstrated that attention focusing and negative information attention bias played a serial mediating role in the relationship between media multitasking and anxiety and depression. However, the results did not support the serial mediation model through attention shifting and negative information attention bias. Media multitasking does not directly influence anxiety and depression, while attention focusing and negative information attention bias play serial mediating roles in their relationship. This study highlights the potential cognitive mechanisms between media multitasking and anxiety and depression, providing theoretical support for interventions in individual mental health during the epidemic.","Li, Fan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.989201","20220906","anxiety; attention bias; attentional control; depression; media multitasking","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37226,""
"The impact of 2008 financial crisis and COVID-19 pandemic on the demand and supply of seafarer officers: evidence from China","During the shipping market boom in the 2000s, China adopted initiatives to expand its maritime education and training (MET) capacity, which significantly increased the supply of seafarer officers in the next few years. Drawing on multiple types of statistical information, including MET enrolments, seafarer numbers, seafarer wages, and labour market analyses, this paper examines the outcomes of the initiatives in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 outbreak. It shows that the financial crisis together with the expanded training capacity led to a serious oversupply problem, characterised by a lack of job opportunities, depressed wages, and slow career progression for junior officers. When the situation improved in 2017, however, a shortage of junior officers ensued, and their number plummeted quickly. The recent COVID-19 pandemic increased the demand for Chinese officers. Nevertheless, the decline in the number of 3<sup>rd</sup> officers continued.

Upon programme completion, all students were invited to complete barriers to engagement survey, irrespective of whether they had attended or heard of the programme. Descriptive statistics were calculated for demographics, as well as feasibility and acceptability outcomes including recruitment rates, attendance rates and reported barriers to attendance. Open-ended questions were coded for themes. Less than 1% of those who consented to participate actually attended the programme, with attendance ranging from 2 to 17 participants. Participants were predominantly female (68%), domestic students (81%) and had a mean age of 29.5 years. The barriers students reported included fixed time, online format, a belief programme would not be helpful, preference for existing supports and perceived impacts of coronavirus disease 2019. Students recommended embedding support within policies/teaching, offering a range of supports and involving students in design. Barriers to mental health promotion via telehealth should be considered to promote accessibility and acceptability for tertiary students.

"Post-traumatic growth in people experiencing high post-traumatic stress during the COVID-19 pandemic: The protective role of psychological flexibility","The COVID-19 pandemic evokes high levels of post-traumatic stress (PTS) in some people as well as positive personal changes, a phenomenon known as post-traumatic growth (PTG). Experiencing an adverse event as traumatic is crucial for triggering PTG, therefore higher PTS is often associated with higher PTG. This longitudinal study examined the protective role of psychological flexibility in fostering PTG in a group of people reporting high PTS related to COVID-19 as compared to those with low PTS. We hypothesized that higher psychological flexibility will be associated with higher PTG in those with high PTS and that psychological flexibility would be unrelated to PTG in those with low PTS. Secondary data analysis was conducted on data from a larger project investigating the psychological impacts of COVID-19. Adult Italians (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 382) completed online surveys at Time 1 (three months after the first national lockdown, July 2020) and Time 2 (three months later when the number of COVID-19 cases increased, October 2020). Based on the Impact of Event Scale-Revised cut-off score, two PTS groups were identified at Time 2: low PTS (below cut-off) and high PTS (above cut-off). As predicted, moderation analyses showed that after controlling for Time 1Ã‚Â PTS and PTG and confounding variables, Time 1 psychological flexibility was associated with higher Time 2Ã‚Â PTG in the high PTS group, whereas psychological flexibility was unrelated to PTG in the low PTS group. Four psychological flexibility sub-processes (present moment awareness, defusion, values, committed action) at Time 1 were related to higher Time 2Ã‚Â PTG in only the high PTS group. Findings advance understanding of the role of psychological flexibility in trauma reactions and pandemic mental health adjustment. Evidence-based approaches that target psychological flexibility, like Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, are likely to foster PTG and ultimately adjustment in people with high PTS during and after the pandemic.","Landi, Pakenham, Mattioli, Crocetti, Agostini, Grandi, Tossani","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2022.08.008","20220906","COVID-19 pandemic; Longitudinal study; Pandemic-related adjustment; Post-traumatic growth; Post-traumatic symptoms; Psychological flexibility","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37230,""

Among those who had ever been infected with Covid-19, a total of 2092 respondents (1180 from Dhaka and 912 from Chittagong) were randomly selected and interviewed. <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mtext>Ãâ€¡</mml:mtext> <mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> test for independence of attributes was employed to observe the association of various socioeconomic, cultural, demographic and health factors with psychological distress. Moreover, multinomial logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the factors that contributed to psychological distress. Among participants from Dhaka, of three mental health conditions, the prevalence was higher for anxiety (80.0%), followed by stress (64.2%) and depression (59.8%), respectively. Anxiety was also more prevalent (57.3) among respondents in Chittagong, followed by depression (47.7%) and stress (39.5%). As the coexistence of symptoms, 52.8% of respondents in Dhaka, 34.4% in Chittagong experienced depression, anxiety and stress simultaneously. Moreover, in both Dhaka and Chittagong, all three psychological symptoms were strongly correlated in pairs. Multivariate analysis revealed that the most consistent factors associated with mild to moderate (MM), and severe to extremely severe (SES) depression were respondents from Chittagong who were illiterate or primary educated (OR = 0.166, CI: 0.076-0.364 for MM and OR = 0.041, CI: 0.013-0.131 for SES), male (OR = 0.999, CI: 0.666-1.496 for MM and OR = 0.395, CI: 0.249-0.625 for SES), single (OR = 0.393, CI: 0.157-0.982 for MM and OR = 0.121, CI: 0.049-0.303 for SES) and married (OR = 0.403, CI: 0.177-0.916 for MM and OR = 0.075, CI: 0.033-0.167 for SES), had a family of size <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mml:mrow><mml:mo>Ã¢â€°Â¤</mml:mo></mml:mrow> </mml:math> 4 (OR = 0.253, CI: 0.140-0.458 for MM and OR = 0.114, CI: 0.059-0.218 for SES) and a family of size 5-6 (OR = 0.151, CI: 0.084-0.272), and no family members at risk being infected with Covid-19 (OR = 0.699, CI: 0.487-1.002 for MM and OR = 0.332, CI: 0.199-0.522 for SES). The analysis yielded similar findings for the other two mental health subscales, such as anxiety and stress. For respondents in Dhaka, the effect of factors other than sex on psychological distress was the opposite in Chittagong. Overall, psychological distress during the outbreak was greater among respondents in Dhaka than in Chittagong if respondents were not classified based on various characteristics. This study showed that in both Dhaka and Chittagong, a substantially large portion of Covid-19-infected respondents experienced all three psychological distress (e.g., depression, anxiety and stress). Regardless of the dissimilarity between the results in Dhaka and Chittagong, better mental health support was needed for women in both cities.","Zahangir, Rokonuzzaman","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e10415","20220906","DASS-21; Dhaka and Chittagong city; Multinomial logistic regression; The Covid-19 pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37231,""
"Financial hardship and mental health conditions in people with underlying health conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh","Financial hardship is a major concern for patients who are suffering from long-term underlying health conditions. It is likely that emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic would impose increased financial distress and lead to the development or exacerbation of mental health conditions. The present study aimed to explore the relationship between financial hardship and mental health conditions (loneliness, anxiety, and depression) among patients with underlying health conditions in Bangladesh. An e-survey based cross-sectional study was conducted among purposively selected 971 patients (50.1% male; mean age = 42.29 [SD = 15.86]) with underlying health conditions between November 2020 and January 2021. Depression, anxiety, and loneliness were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), and UCLA loneliness scale, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to determine any associations between financial hardship and mental health conditions (loneliness, anxiety, and depression). 46.2% of participants reported experiencing financial difficulties, and a number of respondents (12.3%) had lost their jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The prevalence of anxiety, depression and loneliness were 35.2%, 38.9%, and 47.68%, respectively. In the multiple logistic regression analysis, age, gender, occupation, marital status, monthly income, self-reported health status and financial hardship were significantly associated with mental health conditions. Mental health problems were prevalent among people with underlying health conditions and were also associated with financial difficulties. The findings suggest that care facilities should be strengthened by including psychosocial support components delivered with lower costs, particularly for patients with underlying health conditions.","Sujan, Tasnim, Islam, Ferdous, Haghighathoseini, Koly, Pardhan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e10499","20220906","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Financial hardship; Loneliness; Underlying health conditions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37232,""
"Exploring mental health disability gaps in the labour market: the UK experience during COVID-19","People with long-term mental health problems that affect their daily activities are a growing proportion of the UK working population and they have a particularly low employment rate. We analyse gaps in labour market outcomes between mental health disabled and non-disabled people during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. We also decompose the outcome gaps in order to explore the relative importance of different factors in explaining these gaps. Our results suggest that the employment effects of the pandemic for mental health disabled people may have been temporary. However, they were more likely to be away from work and/or working reduced hours than people without a disability. Workers with mental health disability were over-represented in part-time work and in caring, leisure and other service occupations, which were disproportionately affected by COVID-19 and the economic response. This is important new evidence on the contribution of segmentation and segregation in explaining the labour market position of people with mental health disability. The longer term effects of the pandemic were still not apparent at the end of our analysis period (2021:Q3), but the concentration of disabled workers into cyclically sensitive sectors and part-time work means that they will always be particularly vulnerable to economic downturns.","Bryan, Bryce, Rice, Roberts, Sechel","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.labeco.2022.102253","20220906","COVID-19; Disability gaps; decomposition analysis; employment outcomes; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37233,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Canadian national team athletes' mental performance and mental health: The perspectives of mental performance consultants and mental health practitioners","The COVID-19 global pandemic has led to significant disruptions in the lives of high-performance athletes, including the postponement of the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, the cancellation of many international and national competitions, and drastic changes in athletes' daily training environment. The purpose of this research was to examine the interplay between the mental health and mental performance of Canadian national team athletes and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these variables from the perspective of mental performance consultants and mental health practitioners. Twelve individuals working in these roles with national team athletes participated in focus groups and interviews during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. Findings from the inductive reflexive thematic analysis revealed three main themes: (a) factors impacting athlete mental health (i.e., social and environmental, psychological, and public health restrictions), (b) consequences of COVID-19 for athletes (low mood symptoms, anxiety and stress symptoms, maladaptive behaviors, time for life outside of sport, rest, and recovery), and (c) impact of the pandemic on practitioners (roles, preparation and resources, gaps, and well-being). Interestingly, athletes with prior good mental performance skills were perceived to be more equipped to cope with challenges related to the pandemic, which concurrently seemed to facilitate good mental health throughout the pandemic. Furthermore, even though the pandemic had several debilitative consequences on athletes' mental health, it imposed a break from training and competition that allowed them to rest and enjoy their life outside of sport. Finally, participants discussed the need for more mental health resources and better access to practitioners supporting mental performance and mental health in the Canadian sport system.","Dithurbide, Boudreault, Durand-Bush, MacLeod, Gauthier","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.937962","20220906","coronavirus; high-performance; sport; sport psychology; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37234,""
"Eighteen Months of COVID-19 Pandemic Through the Lenses of Self or Others: A Meta-Analysis on Children and Adolescents' Mental Health","The COVID-19 pandemic can have a serious impact on children and adolescents' mental health. We focused on studies exploring its traumatic effects on young people in the first 18Ã‚Â months after that the pandemic was declared, distinguishing them also according to the type of informants (self-report and other-report instruments). We applied a meta-analytic approach to examine the prevalence of depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and psychological distress among children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic, considering the moderating role of kind of disorder and/or symptom, type of instrument, and continent. We used PsycINFO, PubMed, and Scopus databases to identify articles on the COVID-19 pandemic, applying the following filters: participants until 20Ã‚Â years of age, peer-review, English as publication language. Inclusion required investigating the occurrence of disorders and/or symptoms during the first 18Ã‚Â months of the pandemic. The search identified 26 publications. The meta-analysis revealed that the pooled prevalence of psychological disorders and/or symptoms for children and adolescents, who were not affected by mental health disturbances before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, was .20, 95% CI [.16, .23]. Moreover, we found a moderating role of type of instrument: occurrence was higher for self-report compared to other-report instruments. The study presented an analysis of the psychological consequences for children and adolescents of the exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic, soliciting further research to identify factors underlying resilience. Notwithstanding limitations such as the small number of eligible articles and the fact that we did not examine the role of further characteristics of the studies (such as participants' age or design), this meta-analysis is a first step for future research documenting the impact of such an unexpected and devastating disaster like the COVID-19 pandemic.","Raccanello, Rocca, Vicentini, Brondino","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10566-022-09706-9","20220906","Adolescents; COVID-19; Children; Mental health; Meta-analysis; Self-report and other-report instruments","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37235,""
"Chatbot as an emergency exist: Mediated empathy for resilience via human-AI interaction during the COVID-19 pandemic","As a global health crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic has also made heavy mental and emotional tolls become shared experiences of global communities, especially among females who were affected more by the pandemic than males for anxiety and depression. By connecting multiple facets of empathy as key mechanisms of information processing with the communication theory of resilience, the present study examines human-AI interactions during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to understand digitally mediated empathy and how the intertwining of empathic and communicative processes of resilience works as coping strategies for COVID-19 disruption. Mixed methods were adopted to explore the using experiences and effects of Replika, a chatbot companion powered by AI, with ethnographic research, in-depth interviews, and grounded theory-based analysis. Findings of this research extend empathy theories from interpersonal communication to human-AI interactions and show five types of digitally mediated empathy among Chinese female Replika users with varying degrees of cognitive empathy, affective empathy, and empathic response involved in the information processing processes, i.e., companion buddy, responsive diary, emotion-handling program, electronic pet, and tool for venting. When processing information obtained from AI and collaborative interactions with the AI chatbot, multiple facets of mediated empathy become unexpected pathways to resilience and enhance users' well-being. This study fills the research gap by exploring empathy and resilience processes in human-AI interactions. Practical implications, especially for increasing individuals' psychological resilience as an important component of global recovery from the pandemic, suggestions for future chatbot design, and future research directions are also discussed.","Jiang, Zhang, Pian","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2022.103074","20220906","COVID-19 pandemic; empathy; human-AI interaction; information processing; resilience; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37236,""
"Twitter as a Knowledge Translation Tool to Increase Awareness of the OpenHEARTSMAP Psychosocial Assessment and Management Tool in the Field of Pediatric Emergency Mental Health","Rationale The increasing prevalence of pediatric mental health presentations in pediatric emergency departments (PED) requires improved integration of evidence-based management strategies. Social media, specifically Twitter, has shown potential to aid in closing the knowledge translation (KT) gap between these evidence-based management strategies and pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) providers. Aims and objectives The primary outcome of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Twitter as a KT dissemination tool in PEM. The exploratory outcomes were to assess how to effectively implement Twitter in KT, explore ways in which Twitter can maximize the global reach of OpenHEARTSMAP and whether Twitter can lead to increased adoption of OpenHEARTSMAP. Methods A one-week prospective promotion on Twitter was conducted to disseminate the OpenHEARTSMAP tool using 15 topic-related hashtags (arm 1, 15 Tweets) versus one post wherein 15 different Twitter users were mentioned in 15 different comments (arm 2, 1 Tweet). A one-week control period immediately prior to posting was employed for comparisons. Results During the Twitter week, visits per day to OpenHEARTSMAP increased by 175%; mean time spent on the website increased by 212%; and mean page actions per visit increased by 130%. The greatest increase in visits occurred on the first day of Tweeting. Arm 2 received the greatest engagements. Within arm 1, the category of pediatrics received the most engagements (hashtag #Peds was most popular). Arm 1 received 455 impressions compared to 2071 in arm 2. No new users registered an account on the OpenHEARTSMAP website, which is required to physically use the tool. Conclusion Twitter can be an effective KT tool to increase awareness of research, the first step of KT, in the domain of PEM mental health care. Strategies for success include building a robust Twitter following; posting during peak healthcare-related Twitter traffic times; employing hashtags coinciding with current events; and targeting posts by tagging users who need not necessarily be generally well-known opinion leaders.","Chun, Panchmatia, Doan, Meckler, Narayan","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.27597","20220906","covid-19; emergency; evidence based management; knowledge translation; mental health; pediatric; social media; twitter","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37237,""
"Trends in postpartum mental health care before and during COVID-19","To assess the impact of COVID-19 on trends in postpartum mental health diagnoses and utilization of psychotherapy and prescription drug treatment. Data were obtained from a large, national health insurance claims database that tracks individuals longitudinally. We used interrupted time series models to examine changes in trends of postpartum mental health diagnoses before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and t-tests to examine differences in treatment. We used billing codes to identify individuals who received mental health-related diagnoses and treatment in the first 90Ã¢â‚¬â€°days after a birth hospitalization. We excluded individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and those with an unknown payer at delivery. Compared to the pre-pandemic period, the trend in new postpartum mental health diagnoses increased significantly in the post-COVID-19 period (0.06 percentage points [95%CI 0.01, 0.11]). Over 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°months, the percentage of new diagnoses was 5.0% greater relative to what would be expected in absence of COVID-19. The percentage of diagnosed individuals who did not receive treatment increased from 50.4% to 52.7% (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.003). Findings point to an urgent need to improve screening and treatment pathways for perinatal individuals in the wake of COVID-19.","Rokicki, Steenland, Geiger, Gourevitch, Chen, Martin, Cohen","https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-6773.14051","20220905","COVID-19; COVID-19 research database; Medicaid; interrupted time series; mental health; perinatal depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37238,""
"The relationship between Turkish women's self-efficacy for managing work-family conflict and depression, anxiety and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic: AÃ‚Â web-based cross-sectional study","The COVID-19 pandemic has changed working women's workplace and family workload. The changing workplace-family workload may cause a decrease in work-family conflict management self-efficacy. The decrease in work-family conflict management self-efficacy in women may increase their depression, anxiety, and stress levels. This study aimed to examine the relationship between Turkish women's self-efficacy for managing work-family conflict and their depression, anxiety, and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional study was conducted with 244 Turkish women via social media (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp). The data were collected online through a Questionnaire, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21), and sub-scales of the Self-Efficacy for Managing Work-Family Conflict Scale (SE-WFC): Work-to-Family Conflict (WFC) and Family-to-Work Conflict (FWC). During the COVID-19 pandemic, 87.3% of working women experienced an increase in their family workload (100% increase in cooking and cleaning jobs). On the other hand, workplace workload of 83% of women increased. According to DASS-21, women experienced depression (55.7% ), anxiety (49.6% ) and stress (63.1% ). A negative correlation was found between the mean scores of WFC/FWC and the mean scores of depression, anxiety, and stress. (pÃ¢â‚¬Å &lt; Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.001).

"Prevalence of mental health problems amongÃ‚Â stranded international students during the COVID-19 pandemic","The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread fast throughout China and the rest of the world, prompting the World Health Organization to declare a worldwide pandemic on March 11, 2020. Many countries have implemented travel bans, lockdowns, and stay-at-home policies to combat the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to investigate the risk factors of mental health problems among international students stranded outside of China during the pandemic. A qualitative study was conducted among non-Chinese international students enrolled at Chinese universities who were stranded in their home countries. The participants were recruited using a purposive sampling technique. Following informed consent, in-depth interviews were conducted with the help of a semi-structured guide. Two independent investigators transcribed and coded the interview data. The investigators established themes after going through a detailed discussion. Participants reported several mental health risk factors, such as a rise in hopelessness and level of uncertainty, worry, lost interest and focus, lack of support, unemployment and financial hardships, social pressure, behavioral and mood changes, sleep disorder, andÃ‚Â increased smoking. These mental health problemsÃ‚Â will affect the concentration and deep learning, thereby increasing academic stress. In addition, we found that the outbreak of the delta-variant led to a further increase in these mental health risk factors. The pandemic scenario, along with international travel restrictions, increased the likelihood of mental health problems among stranded international students. Thus, preventing further rises in mental health disorders and reducing the effects of pandemic-related measures on stranded international students, such as researchers and policymakers can mitigate the pandemic's effects and achieve national or international health and educational goals. Adequate intervention for this group is strongly recommended.","Iftikhar, Perceval, Fu, Zhou, Cao","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-022-00917-2","20220907","COVID-19; Delta-variant; International students; Risks factors of mental health; COVID-19; Communicable Disease Control; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Prevalence; Students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37240,""

"Depression and Suicidality in Patients With Psoriasis and the Role of Psoriatic Arthritis: A Cross-sectional Study in a Tertiary Setting","Background Depression is overrepresented in psoriasis. However, it is not clear whether the presence of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) independently increases patients' depressive burden. Furthermore, current evidence regarding suicidality risk of psoriasis populations is conflicting, and the role of PsA in suicidality outcomes of psoriasis is unknown. Objectives (i) To test whether PsA is associated with depression and lifetime suicidal ideation among patients with psoriasis; (ii) to capture different suicidal phenomena in these patients; and (iii) to investigate whether suicidality and depressive symptom severity are associated with clinical markers of psoriasis severity and chronicity. Methods A cross-sectional survey of tertiary patients (nÂ = 219, aged 18â€“65 years) with dermatologist-confirmed chronic plaque psoriasis, of whom 84 had rheumatologist-confirmed PsA, was undertaken. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Sheehan-Suicidality Tracking Scale were used to assess depression and lifetime suicidality, respectively. Results PsA presence was associated with depression in patients with psoriasis, independent of other physical comorbidities (adjusted odds ratio 2.92, 95% confidence interval 1.53â€“5.68). Furthermore, patients with PsA experienced significantly higher levels of anhedonia and anxiety, after controlling for psychiatric history. Of all participants, 48.8% reported lifetime suicidal ideation with or without intent, 21.3% reported suicidal planning, and 9.4% reported suicide attempts. Lifetime suicidality prevalence did not differ between patients with and without PsA. Depressive symptom severity and lifetime suicidality scores were not associated with objective measures of psoriasis severity or treatment group. Conclusions These data suggest that joint involvement in psoriasis is associated with higher depressive burden. There is a need for routine depression screening among patients with psoriasis, particularly when PsA is present. Anhedonia appears to be a particularly relevant symptom in the depression phenotype of this population. We did not find a statistically significant association between PsA and suicidality. Nevertheless, suicidality rates in tertiary patients with psoriasis appear to be higher than those in the general population. Suicidality monitoring is recommended to help in reducing future psychiatric morbidity and mortality in patients with psoriasis.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaclp.2021.12.007","20220701","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-08","",37244,""
