"Characterizing and Predicting Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS CoV-2 infection (PASC) in a Large Academic Medical Center in the US","Objective: The growing number of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) survivors who are affected by Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS CoV-2 infection (PACS) represent a worldwide public health challenge. Yet, the novelty of this condition and the resulting limited data on underlying pathomechanisms so far hampered the advancement of effective therapies. Using electronic health records (EHR) data, we aimed to characterize PASC-associated diagnoses and to develop risk prediction models. Methods: In our cohort of 63,675 COVID-19 positive patients seen at Michigan Medicine, 1,724 (2.7 %) had a recorded PASC diagnosis. We used a case control study design comparing PASC cases with 17,205 matched controls and performed phenome-wide association studies (PheWASs) to characterize enriched phenotypes of the post-COVID-19 period and potential PASC pre-disposing phenotypes of the pre-, and acute-COVID-19 periods. We also integrated PASC-associated phenotypes into Phenotype Risk Scores (PheRSs) and evaluated their predictive performance. Results: In the post-COVID-19 period, cases were significantly enriched for known PASC symptoms (e.g., shortness of breath, malaise/fatigue, and cardiac dysrhythmias) but also many musculoskeletal, infectious, and digestive disorders. We found seven phenotypes in the pre-COVID-19 period (irritable bowel syndrome, concussion, nausea/vomiting, shortness of breath, respiratory abnormalities, allergic reaction to food, and circulatory disease) and 69 phenotypes in the acute-COVID-19 period (predominantly respiratory, circulatory, neurological, digestive, and mental health phenotypes) that were significantly associated with PASC. The derived pre-COVID-19 PheRS and acute-COVID-19 PheRS had low accuracy to differentiate cases from controls; however, they stratified risk well, e.g., a combination of the two PheRSs identified a quarter of the COVID-19 positive cohort at a 3.5-fold increased risk for PASC compared to the bottom 50% of their distributions. Conclusions: Our agnostic screen of time stamped EHR data uncovered a plethora of PASC-associated diagnoses across many categories and highlighted a complex arrangement of presenting and likely pre-disposing features -- the latter with a potential for risk stratification approaches. Yet, considerably more work will need to be done to better characterize PASC and its subtypes, especially long-term consequences, and to consider more comprehensive risk models.","Lars G Fritsche; Weijia Jin; Andrew J Admon; Bhramar Mukherjee","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.10.21.22281356","20221022","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-23","",39583,""
"Effects of long-term COVID-19 confinement and music stimulation on mental state and brain activity of young people","The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may have had a negative emotional impact on individuals. This study investigated the effect of long-term lockdown and music on young people's mood and neurophysiological responses in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Fifteen healthy young adults were recruited and PFC activation was acquired using functional near-infrared spectroscopy during the conditions of resting, Stroop and music stimulation. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scales mental scale scores were simultaneously recorded. Mixed effect models, paired t-tests, one-way ANOVAs and Spearman analyses were adopted to analyse the experimental parameters. Stress, anxiety and depression levels increased significantly from Day 30 to Day 40. In terms of reaction time, both Stroop1 and Stroop2 were faster on Day 40 than on Day 30 (P = 0.01, P = 0.003). The relative concentration changes of oxyhemoglobin were significantly higher during premusic conditions than music stimulation and postmusic Stroop. The intensity of functional connectivity shifted from inter- to intracerebral over time. In conclusion, the reduced hemodynamic response of the PFC in healthy young adults is associated with negative emotions, especially anxiety, during lockdown. Immediate music stimulation appears to improve efficiency by altering the pattern of connections in PFC.","Luo, Shan, Zu, Chen, Bu, Wang, Ni, Niu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neulet.2022.136922","20221022","Cognitive neuroscience; Functional brain connectivity; Lockdown; Music stimulation; Negative emotions; Prefrontal cortex activation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-23","",39584,""
"The effect of COVID-19 confinement and economic support measures on the mental health of older population in Europe and Israel","This study focuses on the impact of confinement and economic support measures on the mental health of the older population (aged 50 and above) across twenty-five European countries and Israel. While studies evaluating the effect of confinement measures on mental health exist, they largely ignore the potentially offsetting effects of economic support measures. Moreover, previous findings on the effect of confinement measures are inconsistent, and many studies are based solely on cross-sectional designs. Using data from the Corona Survey wave (2020) of the Survey on Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), we leverage the date of interview information to vary individual exposure to different policy contexts within countries. Overall, we do not find support for the negative effect of confinement measures on older adults' mental health. If anything, both confinement and support measures worked in tandem to soothe mental distress, resulting from the pandemic. The confinement effects, however, are contingent on age, potentially indicating that younger people are more likely to be negatively affected by lockdowns.","Yastrebov, Maskileyson","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.115445","20221022","Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE); Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Economic support; Lockdowns; Mental health; Older adults; Sleep quality; Survey of Health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-23","",39585,""
"Association of Workplace Bullying with Suicide Ideation and Attempt Among Chinese Nurses During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Nurses experience a high incidence of workplace bullying and are at a higher risk of suicide than the general population. However, there is no empirical evidence on how exposure to workplace bullying is associated with suicide ideation and attempts among nurses. Nurses were recruited from tertiary hospitals in Shandong Province, China, using stratified cluster sampling. Suicide ideation and attempts were assessed using two items, and the Workplace Psychologically Violent Behaviors Instrument was used to measure subtypes of workplace bullying. The prevalence of workplace bullying, suicide ideation, and suicide attempts was 30.6%, 16.8%, and 10.8%, respectively. After adjusting for covariates, victims of workplace bullying were at a high risk of suicide ideation and attempts. Among workplace bullying subtypes, individuals' isolation from work and direct negative behaviors were predictors of both suicide ideation and attempts; attack on personality only predicted suicide attempts. The more bullying subtypes experienced by nurses, the greater their likelihood of suicide ideation and attempts. These findings suggested that workplace bullying was associated with an increased risk of suicide ideation and attempts in nurses, with both independent and cumulative risks. Interventions should focus on prevention and managing the effects of workplace bullying among nurses.","Lu, Sun, Li, Wu, Zhang, Wang, Huang, Cao","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10880-022-09915-3","20221022","Bullying in nurses; Suicide attempt; Suicide ideation; Tertiary hospital; Workplace bullying","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-23","",39586,""

"The effect of job strain and worksite social support on reported adverse reactions of COVID-19 vaccine: A prospective study of employees in Japan","This prospective study aimed to examine the association of psychosocial working conditions with adverse reactions after receiving COVID-19 vaccination in a sample of employees in Japan. The data were retrieved from an online panel of full-time employees (E-COCO-J). The analysis included participants who were employed and were not vaccinated at baseline (June 2021) but received vaccination at a 4-month follow-up (October 2021). An 11-item scale measured the adverse reactions. Four types of psychosocial working conditions (i.e., job demands, job control, and supervisor and coworker support) were measured using the Brief Job Stress Questionnaire. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between the psychosocial working conditions and adverse reactions of COVID-19 vaccines, adjusting for socioeconomic variables, chronic disease, the number of vaccination, type of vaccine, anxiety for adverse reactions, fear and worry about COVID-19, and psychological distress at baseline. Overall, 747 employees were included in the analysis. The average number of adverse reactions was 3.8 (standard deviationÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.2): Arm pain (81.1%), fatigues (64.1%), muscle pains (63.3%), and fever (37.5Ã‚Â°C+) (53.5%) were reported more frequently. Coworker support score was significantly and negatively associated with the numbers of adverse reactions (standardized ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.100, PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .023). Women, young age, second-time vaccination, Moderna, and high psychological distress were significantly associated with adverse reactions. Employees with low coworker support may be more likely to have adverse reactions after vaccinations. The findings of this study could support that increasing workplace support may reduce adverse reactions.","Sasaki, Kuroda, Tsuno, Imamura, Kawakami","https://doi.org/10.1002/1348-9585.12356","20221022","job stressors; mental health; occupational health; reactogenicity; side reactions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-23","",39588,""
"The association between the restriction of daily life and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic in Korea: a nationwide based survey","The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has led to substantial daily life changes for people worldwide. We investigated the association between daily life restrictions and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic based on the Korea Community Health Survey. Daily life restrictions were evaluated using a questionnaire to population into three restriction categories: no/slightly, moderately, and severely. Depression was assessed by the Korean version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Chi-square tests and Fisher's exact tests were used to compare the demographic characteristics of individuals with and without depression. Logistic regression was used to assess the association between the severity of daily life restrictions and the prevalence of depression. The prevalence of depression was 2.4% in the total population: 5.7% in the severely restricted group and 2.7% in the moderately restricted group. After adjusting for age, sex, educational level, income, marital status, and employment status, the severely restricted group was more likely to have depression than was the no change/slightly restricted group (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.40, 95% CI 2.16-2.67, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Employers with severely restricted daily life exhibited a higher OR for depression compared to the no/slightly restricted group (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.24, 95% CI 2.37-4.45, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001).

"Gut microbiota in COVID-19: key microbial changes, potential mechanisms and clinical applications","The gastrointestinal tract is involved in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The gut microbiota has important roles in viral entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression, immune homeostasis, and crosstalk between the gut and lungs, the 'gut-lung axis'. Emerging preclinical and clinical studies indicate that the gut microbiota might contribute to COVID-19 pathogenesis and disease outcomes; SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with altered intestinal microbiota and correlated with inflammatory and immune responses. Here, we discuss the cutting-edge evidence on the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the gut microbiota, key microbial changes in relation to COVID-19 severity and host immune dysregulations with the possible underlying mechanisms, and the conceivable consequences of the pandemic on the human microbiome and post-pandemic health. Finally, potential modulatory strategies of the gut microbiota are discussed. These insights could shed light on the development of microbiota-based interventions for COVID-19.","Lau, Zhang, Liu, Su, Chan, Ng","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41575-022-00698-4","20221022","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-23","",39590,""

"Analysis of mental health effects among nurses working during the COVID-19 pandemic: A Systematic Review","Health professionals have suffered negative consequences during the COVID-19 pandemic. No review has specifically addressed the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of nurses exclusively according to the work context. To analyse the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of nurses who have worked in hospitals, primary care centres and social health centres. PubMed, CINAHL, PsychINFO and Cochrane databases were searched (Prospero number: CRD42021249513). Out of 706 papers, 31 studies (2020-2021) were included in the systematic review. A qualitative synthesis method was used to analyse the data. Most studies were conducted in hospitals or frontline settings. The prevalence of moderate to severe symptoms was for anxiety 29.55%, depression 38.79%, posttraumatic stress disorder 29.8%, and insomnia 40.66%. This review highlights the mental health effects among nurses working in acute hospital settings. It also evidences a data gap on mental health effects among nurses working in primary health care and in nursing homes. In the post phase of the pandemic, there is an urgent need to assess and respond to the impact on mental well-being of nurses, and to monitor international policies for the improvement of nurses 'working conditions.","Garcia-Vivar, Rodriguez-Matesanz, San Martin-Rodriguez, Soto-Ruiz, Ferraz-Torres, Escalada-Hernandez","https://doi.org/10.1111/jpm.12880","20221021","COVID-19 pandemic; Health Services; mental health; nurses; systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-23","",39592,""
