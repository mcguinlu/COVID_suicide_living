"Evaluation of an individualized, tablet-based physiotherapy training programme for patients with Parkinson's disease: the ParkProTrain study, a quasi-randomised controlled trial","Regular physical activity is of great relevance in Parkinson's disease (PD). It is part of the inpatient multimodal Parkinson's complex treatment (MKP) in Germany. However, there is often a lack of human resources in outpatient settings to continue an interprofessional approach. A large proportion of PD patients live a predominantly sedentary lifestyle and do not get enough exercise. The intervention group (IG) used a tablet-based physiotherapy training programme at home for a period of nine months. We conducted a quasi-randomised longitudinal study with three measurement times (at the beginning (t<sub>0</sub>) and end of MKP (t<sub>1</sub>) and at 9Ã‚Â months after MKP (t<sub>2</sub>)). The primary outcome measured was PD-specific quality of life using the PDQ-8. The secondary outcome focused on participation restrictions, falling anxiety, sleep disorder, anxiety and depression as well as comorbidity, pain, performance capability and physical activity. For nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°93 IG and nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°137 control group (CG) patients, evaluable cases were available for all measurement times. Both groups achieved significant improvements in all parameters at the end of MKP. These parameters deteriorated again at nine months after MKP for most parameters and were even below the baseline levels. However, this deterioration was less pronounced in the IG than in the CG. For general health and social participation, a significant slightly positive effect was observed in the IG nine months after MKP when compared with the baseline level. Paying attention to physical activity slightly increased in the IG for the catamnesis survey compared to baseline. Nearly all IG patients were satisfied with the intervention, especially with the consultations with the physiotherapist. Although the expected extent of effects could not be determined for the IG, stabilisation effects could be demonstrated. These stabilisation effects shown for the IG might be attributed to the intervention. The effects might have been greater without the COVID-19 pandemic. German Register of Clinical Trials, drks.de.

"Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2: predictors of vaccination resistance in young adults in Spain","Rationale: widespread population vaccination against the SARS-CoV-2 virus is a matter of great interest to public health managers as it is the main pharmacological measure to contain the COVID-19 epidemic. Hesitancy or reluctance to vaccination has become one of the main barriers to containing the pandemic. The young adult population appears as one of the population clusters with the greatest reluctance to vaccination, even in countries such as Spain, one of those with the highest vaccination rate during this pandemic. Objective: the aim of this study was to identify the main predictive factors of vaccination intention and profile people with hesitancy/reluctance to vaccinate against SARS-CoV-2 virus in young adults living in Spain during the pandemic. Method: a cross-sectional study was carried out based on the administration of an online form (PSY-COVID-2) that evaluated the intention of vaccination together with a wide range of sociodemographic, social, cognitive, behavioral and affective variables in a sample of 2210 young adults. Results: 14% of the young adults sample showed hesitancy/reluctance to vaccination at the beginning of their vaccination campaign. Pearson`s product-moment correlation revealed that a total of 35 factors of a heterogeneous nature were associated with the intention to vaccinate. Analysis of variance showed that belonging to health personnel, threat to personal health, tolerance of confinement, favorable attitude to mobility restrictions, to preventive measures, to the vaccine and to the public system response, trust in the government and health/science experts, personality (extraversion and agreeableness), time and quality of information about COVID-19, and coping strategy of seeking emotional support were conditions associated with the intention to vaccinate against SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, conspiratorial thinking about COVID-19, availability of public resources for mental health, good post-pandemic mood, and coping strategies of seeking family support and substance use were conditions associated with hesitancy/reluctance to vaccination. A multiple linear regression analysis showed that a reduced set of 4 attitudinal and social variables explained 41% of the variability in vaccination intention: attitude towards vaccination, trust in health/science experts, conspiracy ideations and time spent on information about COVID-19. A discriminant analysis showed that these 4 variables had good sensitivity and specificity when classifying people as reluctant/not reluctant to vaccination, properly classifying 86% of people. Conclusions: psychosocial processes related to attitudes, trust and information are the main predictors of vaccination intention in a highly reluctant group such as the young adult population.","Corel Mateo-Canedo et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0186-9C7-7F2","20220515","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; vaccination hesitancy; attitudes; beliefs; vaccination reluctance; covid-19; sars-cov-2","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-16","",31449,""
