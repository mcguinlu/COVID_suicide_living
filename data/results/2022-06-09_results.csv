"Non-pharmacological therapies for post-viral syndromes, including Long COVID: A systematic review","Background: Post-viral syndromes (PVS), including Long COVID, are symptoms sustained from weeks to years following an acute viral infection. Non-pharmacological treatments for these symptoms are poorly understood. This review summarises evidence for the effectiveness of non-pharmacological treatments for symptoms of PVS. It also summarises the symptoms and health impacts of PVS in individuals recruited to studies evaluating treatments. Methods and findings: We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions for PVS, as compared to either standard care, alternative non-pharmacological therapy, or placebo. The outcomes of interest were changes in symptoms, exercise capacity, quality of life (including mental health and wellbeing), and work capability. We searched five databases (Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, MedRxiv) for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published between 1st January 2001 to 29th October 2021. We anticipated that there would be few RCTs specifically pertaining to Long COVID, so we also included observational studies only if they assessed interventions in individuals where the viral pathogen was SARS-COV-2. Relevant outcome data were extracted, study quality appraised using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, and the findings were synthesised narratively. Quantitative synthesis was not planned due to substantial heterogeneity between the studies. Overall, five studies of five different interventions (Pilates, music therapy, telerehabilitation, resistance exercise, neuromodulation) met the inclusion criteria. Aside from music-based intervention, all other selected interventions demonstrated some support in the management of PVS in some patients. Conclusions: In this study, we observed a lack of robust evidence evaluating non-pharmacological treatments for PVS, including Long COVID. Considering the prevalence of prolonged symptoms following acute viral infections, there is an urgent need for clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of non-pharmacological treatments for patients with PVS as well as what may work for certain sub-groups of patients with differential symptom presentation. Registration: The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO [CRD42021282074] in October 2021 and published in BMJ Open in 2022.

"Post-acute COVID-19 cognitive impairment and decline uniquely associate with kynurenine pathway activation: a longitudinal observational study","Cognitive impairment and function post-acute mild to moderate COVID-19 are poorly understood. We report findings of 128 prospectively studied SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. Cognition and olfaction were assessed at 2-, 4- and 12-months post-diagnosis. Lung function, physical and mental health were assessed at 2-month post diagnosis. Blood cytokines, neuro-biomarkers, and kynurenine pathway (KP) metabolites were measured at 2-, 4-, 8- and 12-months. Mild to moderate cognitive impairment (demographically corrected) was present in 16%, 23%, and 26%, at 2-, 4- and 12-months post diagnosis, respectively. Overall cognitive performance mildly, but significantly (p<.001) declined. Cognitive impairment was more common in those with anosmia (p=.05), but only at 2 months.

"Distinct smell and taste disorder phenotype of post-acute COVID-19 sequelae","BackgroundOlfactory dysfunction (OD) often accompanies acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its sequelae. Herein, we investigated OD during COVID-19 recovery in the context of other symptoms, quality of life, physical and mental health.

MethodsSymptom recovery patterns were analyzed in a bi-national, ambulatory COVID-19 survey (n = 906, [&ge;] 90 days follow-up) and a multi-center observational cross-sectional cohort of ambulatory and hospitalized individuals (n = 108, 360 days follow-up) with multi-dimensional scaling, association rule mining and partitioning around medoids clustering.

ResultsBoth in the ambulatory collective (72%, n = 655/906) and the cross-sectional ambulatory and hospitalized cohort (41%, n = 44/108) self-reported OD was frequent during acute COVID-19, displayed a slow recovery pace (ambulatory: 28 days, cross-sectional: 90 days median recovery time) and commonly co-occurred with taste disorders. In the ambulatory collective, a predominantly young, female, comorbidity-free group of convalescents with persistent OD and taste disorder (>90 days) was identified. This post-acute smell and taste disorder phenotype was characterized by a low frequency of other leading post-acute symptoms including fatigue, respiratory and neurocognitive complaints. Despite a protracted smell and taste dysfunction, this subset had high ratings of physical performance, mental health, and quality of life.

ConclusionOur results underline the clinical heterogeneity of post-acute COVID-19 sequelae calling for tailored management strategies. The persistent smell and taste disorder phenotype may represent a distinct COVID-19 recovery pathway characterized by a good recovery of other COVID-19 related symptoms.

"OpenSAFELY NHS Service Restoration Observatory 2: changes in primary care activity across six clinical areas during the COVID-19 pandemic","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted healthcare activity across a broad range of clinical services. The NHS stopped non-urgent work in March 2020, later recommending services be restored to near-normal levels before winter where possible.

AimsUsing routinely collected data, our aim was to describe changes in the volume and variation of coded clinical activity in general practice in: (i) cardiovascular disease, (ii) diabetes, (iii) mental health, (iv) female and reproductive health, (v) screening, and (vi) processes related to medication.

Design and settingWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted a cohort study of 23.8 million patient records in general practice, in-situ using OpenSAFELY.

MethodsWe selected common primary care activity using CTV3 codes and keyword searches from January 2019 - December 2020, presenting median and deciles of code usage across practices per month.

ResultsWe identified substantial and widespread changes in clinical activity in primary care since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with generally good recovery by December 2020. A few exceptions showed poor recovery and warrant further investigation, such as mental health, e.g. ""Depression interim review"" (median across practices in December 2020 -41.6% compared to December 2019).

ConclusionsGranular NHS GP data at population-scale can be used to monitor disruptions to healthcare services and guide the development of mitigation strategies. The authors are now developing real-time monitoring dashboards for key measures identified here as well as further studies, using primary care data to monitor and mitigate the indirect health impacts of Covid-19 on the NHS.

How this fits inDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, routine healthcare services in England faced significant disruption, and NHS England recommended restoring NHS services to near-normal levels before winter 2020. Our previous report covered the disruption and recovery in pathology tests and respiratory activity: here we describe an additional six areas of common primary care activity. We found most activities exhibited significant reductions during pandemic wave 1 (with most recovering to near-normal levels by December); however many important aspects of care - especially those of a more time-critical nature - were maintained throughout the pandemic. We recommend key measures for ongoing monitoring and further investigation of the impacts on health inequalities, to help measure and mitigate the ongoing indirect health impacts of COVID-19 on the NHS.","Helen J Curtis; Brian MacKenna; Milan Wiedemann; Louis Fisher; Richard Croker; Caroline E Morton; Peter Inglesby; Alex J Walker; Jessica Morley; Amir Mehrkar; Sebastian CJ Bacon; George Hickman; David Evans; Tom Ward; Simon Davy; William J Hulme; Orla Macdonald; Robin Conibere; Tom Lewis; Martin Myers; Shamila Wanninayake; Kiren Collison; Charles Drury; Miriam Samuel; Harpreet Sood; Andrea Cipriani; Seena Fazel; Manuj Sharma; Wasim Baqir; Christopher Bates; John Parry; Ben Goldacre","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.06.01.22275674","20220602","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32099,""
"Young age, student status and reported non-binary gender associate strongly with decreased functioning during Covid-19 pandemic in a university community","BackgroundCovid-19 pandemic has had detrimental effects on physical and mental well-being whereas there are fewer studies on Covid-19 effects on everyday functioning.

AimsWe aimed to investigate effects of Covid-19 on functioning and related factors in a university community.

MethodIn all, 2004 students and university personnel responded to a Webropol survey in May 2021, when the measures for preventing Covid-19 infections had sustained about a year and a half. Functioning included Visual Analog Scale (0 to 10) assessments on ability to function and ability to work.

ResultsYoung age, reported non-binary gender, being student, low resilience, loneliness, received mental care and minor physical exercise, as well as depressive symptoms associated with inferior functioning and negative effects of Covid-19 on functioning. Good school performance at adolescence associated with better, while childhood adversities associated with poorer functioning.

ConclusionsIn the university community, young age and non-binary gender associated with decreased functioning during Covid-19 pandemic. Functioning of students was lower than in that of the university personnel. The need for therapeutic counselling and interventions is greatest among young students.","Raimo K. R.

"Increased ambulance attendances related to suicide and self-injury in response to the pandemic","Investigating the change in the trend of ambulance service utilization for suicide in response to the COVID-19 pandemic can clarify the impact of the pandemic on acute health services. To determine whether the trends of the ambulance attendances related to self-injury and suicide changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We extracted the data from the National Ambulance Surveillance System in Australia between March 2018 and March 2021 to examine the trajectory of the ambulance attendances related to self-injury and suicide. The results indicate that the number of ambulance attendances related to self-injury, suicidal ideation and suicidal attempt increased immediately during the first quarter since the outbreak and stayed higher over the at least 12 months. Notably, the post-outbreak surge in ambulance attendances associated with these mental health crises did not continue to escalate further. To sum up, the overall increase in ambulance attendances may reflect increased distress in the community, but also signify disruptions of other non-emergency health services. In contrast to recent evidence for the suicide rate being unchanged during the pandemic, our findings provide a different perspective on the impact of the pandemic on mental health services. This warrants a re-assessment of resources for mental health services in the post-COVID era.","James John; Ei Phyu Synn; Teresa Winata; Valsamma Eapen; Ping-I Lin","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.05.29.22273082","20220530","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32101,""

As manifestaÃ§Ãµes clÃ­nicas ocorrem apÃ³s um perÃ­odo de incubaÃ§Ã£o que varia de aproximadamente 10 dias a 2 anos, sendo subclÃ­nicas na maioria dos infectados. Entretanto, cerca de 20 % apresentarÃ£o formas sintomÃ¡ticas e casos graves podem cursar com infecÃ§Ãµes secundÃ¡rias desencadeadas pela imunossupressÃ£o causada pela LVH, tornando desafiador o manejo desses pacientes com infecÃ§Ã£o concomitante ao SARS-CoV-2. Objetivo: Reportar caso de infiltraÃ§Ã£o de sangue perifÃ©rico por Leishmania sp em paciente imunossuprimida com subsequente infecÃ§Ã£o por SARS-CoV-2. Metodologia: Paciente sexo feminino, 41 anos, moradora em Ã¡rea endÃªmica para LVH, portadora de Artrite Reumatoide com uso de MTX e Leflunomida em diferentes momentos. Iniciou quadro de dor abdominal associada a lesÃµes cutÃ¢neas e em mucosa oral hÃ¡ dois meses, tendo como hipÃ³tese diagnÃ³stica pÃªnfigo vulgar e prescrito corticÃ³ide em alta dose. Evoluiu com queda do estado geral, icterÃ­cia e hepatoesplenomegalia, necessitando de internaÃ§Ã£o na origem, com exames demonstrando anemia e plaquetopenia, alteraÃ§Ãµes de enzimas hepÃ¡ticas e alargamento de INR. PorÃ©m, apÃ³s piora do estado geral, caracterizada por aumento de volume abdominal e sangramento em cavidade oral, via vaginal e cutÃ¢nea, foi transferida para HC FAMEMA. Na admissÃ£o, constatou-se alteraÃ§Ã£o da ausculta pulmonar e saturaÃ§Ã£o de 90%. TC de tÃ³rax demonstrou opacidades em vidro fosco com 75% de acometimento, e RT-PCR detectÃ¡vel para SARS-CoV2.

"Ectopic ACTH by Carcinoid Tumor Mimicking Nelson Syndrome in a Patient with Bilateral Adrenalectomy","Introduction: Nelson syndrome has been reported in up to 25% of adults after bilateral adrenalectomy (BLA) for Cushingâ€™s disease (CD). It usually manifests as an expanding pituitary mass, rising adrenocorticotropic (ACTH) hormone levels and, in many patients, the development of hyperpigmentation. We review the clinical course of a patient with rising ACTH levels after BLA for presumed CD. Although the diagnosis of Nelson syndrome was considered, he was found 9 years after BLA to have an ectopic ACTH secreting bronchial carcinoid tumor as a cause for the elevated ACTH levels. Case Description: A 35 year old male was evaluated at another institution in 2010 after he presented with weight gain, new onset hypertension, muscle weakness with multiple falls, depression, irritability and emotional lability. He was diagnosed with CD and was referred to a university center where he underwent trans-sphenoidal pituitary surgery in May 2011. An adenoma was seen on frozen section but not on the final pathology. He developed transient symptoms of adrenal insufficiency on the second post-operative day. Because of persistent hypercortisolism he underwent BLA in November 2011. We started following him in 2012 and signs of hypercortisolism gradually resolved. He appeared euadrenal on hydrocortisone 10 mg am, 5 mg 12 noon and 5 mg 6 pm and fludrocortisone 0.05 mg daily. ACTH levels increased from 54 pg/ml (6-50) in 2012 to 1024 pg/ml in 2019. He had no hyperpigmentation and MRI of the pituitary from 2014-20 did not show a pituitary mass. During an evaluation for COVID-19 infection in May 2020, a chest x ray revealed a right lower lobe lung mass measuring 3.3 x 2.0 cm. He underwent right lower lobe lung lobectomy in July 2020 and pathology revealed a carcinoid tumor-spindle cell pattern which stained strongly positive for ACTH and weakly positive for chromogranin. ACTH levels after the surgery decreased to 16.3 pg/ml. Discussion: Some authors have suggested that Nelson syndrome be considered in patients with BLA who have one of the following: an expanding pituitary mass or ACTH levels &gt;500 p/ml at 3 different time points after surgery. This case highlights the need to consider ectopic ACTH syndrome as another cause for rising ACTH levels after BLA for CD especially in those patients who are not found to have a discreet adenoma after pituitary surgery.","Abdul Rauf, M.

"Work-related stress and coping methods of internists and primary care physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan: A mixed-method study","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the mental health of health care workers. This study aimed to investigate the stress factors that cause burnout in Japanese physicians and their coping methods during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We conducted a sequential explanatory mixed-method study to investigate the psychological responses of physicians in the early stages of the pandemic. A cross-sectional, web-based, anonymous survey was conducted among members of the American College of Physicians Japan Chapter to quantitatively investigate the stress factors and prevalence of burnout. An open-ended questionnaire with questions about stress factors and coping methods was additionally administered. The qualitative data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Results Among the 1173 physicians surveyed, 214 (18.2%) responded. Among the participants, 107 (50.0%) responded ?yes? to the question ?I feel or have felt very stressed at work during the COVID-19 pandemic,? and 68 (31.8%) reported burnout symptoms. Those who reported feeling stress (117 respondents) were asked to select 12 items of the stress factors related to COVID-19. The most significant stress factor related to COVID-19 was ?Perceived risk of spreading COVID-19 to family members? (nÂ =Â 47). Content analysis identified 12 categories for the stress factors and 7 for stress-coping methods corresponding to COVID-19 (Cohen's kappaÂ =Â 0.84 and 0.95, respectively).

"Stress and SARS-CoV-2: acute activation of stress response systems to the rescue","The COVID-19 pandemic strongly affects people with health disadvantages, a population that is also less responsive to vaccination. This may contribute to a long-lasting COVID-19 burden on medical systems and societies worldwide. Stress-related factors such as socio-economic status, prior mental health issues and stress perceived in everyday life may additionally impact infection and severity of disease. Present psychoneuroimmune concepts provide a bio-psychosocial knowledge framework to tackle the question, if stressassociated neuroendocrine-immune mechanisms can possibly contribute to SARS-CoV-2 infections. From this viewpoint, stress may not always be detrimental in that some types of stress could attenuate infection-risk and -progression. We intend to motivate future research efforts to clarify whether neuroendocrine stress-response regulating interventions have the potential to optimize immune responses against respiratory viral infections during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. Mediators such as cortisol, (nor)adrenaline, neuropeptides and neurotrophins and how they shape the immune defense against viral diseases will be discussed. Based on this understanding, we describe how psychoneuroimmune knowledge may be used to improve adequate care for COVID-19 and other patients with viral infections.","Peters, E. M.

"Trends in Self-reported Forgone Medical Care Among Medicare Beneficiaries During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Importance Evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative association with medical care access. As prior studies mainly focused on the initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, less is known about how trends in forgone medical care changed over time. Objective To examine trends in and reasons for forgone medical care among Medicare beneficiaries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study analyzed Medicare beneficiaries using data from 3 waves of survey data from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey COVID-19 Supplement (Summer 2020, Fall 2020, and Winter 2021). Data analyses were conducted between July and August 2021. Exposures Date of interview. Main Outcomes and Measures Self-reported forgone medical care because of COVID-19. Results A total of 23 058 Medicare beneficiaries were included (13 005 women [56.4%];10 445 [45.3%] 75 years old and older). The survey response rates for each wave were 72.6%, 78.95, and 79.6%, respectively. The rates of reported forgone medical care because of COVID-19 decreased from the week of June 7, 2020, to the week of April 4 to 25, 2021, but the largest difference in the rates was found between June 7 and July 12, 2020 (22.4% to 15.9%). Physician-driven factors accounted for about 70% of the forgone medical care. The proportion of those who reported forgoing medical care because of physician-driven factors tended to decrease from 66.2% in the week of July 7, 2020, to 44.7% in the weeks of April 4 to 25, 2021. The likelihood of forgone medical care was 4 percentage points (95% CI, 0.03-0.05) higher among those who reported feeling more stressed or anxious than those who did not, 3 percentage points (95% CI, 0.01-0.04) higher among those who reported feeling more lonely or sad than those who did not, and 3 percentage points (95% CI, 0.01-0.04) higher among those who reported feeling less socially connected than those who did not. Conclusions and Relevance The results of this cross-sectional survey study suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate existing barriers to care and lead Medicare beneficiaries to delay needed care. Policy makers must continue to identify effective means of meeting the forgone care backlog and maintaining continuity of care, especially for those with mental health problems.","Park, Sungchul, Stimpson, Jim P.","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamahealthforum.2021.4299","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: JAMA Health Forum; 2(12), 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32106,""

Design, Setting, and Participants This was a cross-sectional study and descriptive analysis of telemedicine utilization by 10.4 million fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries from 2010 to 2019. Data analysis was performed from June 6, 2019, to July 30, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures Rates of telemedicine utilization, characteristics of beneficiaries who received telemedicine in 2010 to 2019, and specialties of clinicians delivering telemedicine. Results Of 10.4 million rural Medicare beneficiaries, telemedicine was used by 91 483 individuals (age =65 years, 47 135 [51.5%];women, 51 476 [56.3%];and White, 76 467 [83.6%] individuals) in 2019. In 2010 to 2019, telemedicine visits grew by 23.1% annually. A total of 0.9% of all fee-for-service rural beneficiaries had a telemedicine visit in 2019 compared with 0.2% in 2010. In 2019, there were 257 979 telemedicine visits or 34.8 visits per 1000 rural beneficiaries and most (75.9%) of these visits were for mental health conditions. Patients with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia (3.0% of rural beneficiaries) received 40% of all telemedicine visits in 2019. Some traditionally disadvantaged and underserved groups comprised a larger share of telemedicine users than nonusers in 2019, such as those dually insured with Medicaid (56.9% of users vs 18.6% of nonusers;adjusted odd ratio, 3.83;95% CI, 3.77-3.89). In 2010 to 2019, telemedicine for mental health conditions shifted away from psychiatrists (71.2% to 35.8% of all telemedicine visits) to nonphysician clinicians, eg, nurse practitioners, psychologists, and social workers (21.4% to 57.2%). There was wide variation in telemedicine utilization in 2019 across counties: median (IQR), 16.0 (2.5-51.4) telemedicine users per 1000 beneficiaries). In 891 counties (29% of all US counties), at least 10% of beneficiaries with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia used a telemedicine service in 2019. Conclusions and Relevance In this cross-sectional study of telemedicine utilization before the COVID-19 pandemic, there was sustained growth in telemedicine visits among rural beneficiaries covered by the Medicare program, especially care delivered by nurse practitioners and other nonphysician clinicians. The prepandemic model of telemedicine provided in local health care settings may be a viable modality to maintain in rural communities.","Barnett, Michael L.; Huskamp, Haiden A.; Busch, Alisa B.; Uscher-Pines, Lori, Chaiyachati, Krisda H.; Mehrotra, Ateev","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamahealthforum.2021.3282","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: JAMA Health Forum; 2(10), 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32107,""

"Association between Frequency of Conversations and Suicidal Ideation among Medical Students during COVID-19 Pandemic in Japan","To mitigate the spread of COVID-19, universities in Japan shifted from face-to-face to online classes, which might have reduced social interaction and increased psychiatric problems among students. A self-report questionnaire was administered to fourth-year medical students in Tokyo in May 2021, during the fourth wave of the COVID-19 outbreak, to examine the association between the frequency of conversations and suicidal thoughts. The questionnaire assessed the frequency of conversations and, using part of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, suicidal ideation. Of the 113 students, 98 (86.7%) responded, of whom 20 (20.4%) had suicidal ideation. Poisson regression analysis revealed that those with less than 1 conversation per week and no conversations at all had a significantly higher risk of suicidal ideation than those with 3 conversations per week or more, after adjusting for personality, family relationship, income level, living alone, number of friends, gender, and age. These results indicate that less frequent conversations increased the risk of suicidal ideation among medical students. Mental health support for students needs to be strengthened if universities suspend face-to-face classes during a pandemic.","Yamazaki, Juri, Kizuki, Masashi, Fujiwara, Takeo","https://www.google.com/search?q=Association+between+Frequency+of+Conversations+and+Suicidal+Ideation+among+Medical+Students+during+COVID-19+Pandemic+in+Japan","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(11):6385, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32111,""
"A heuristic investigation of private ambulance paramedics and EMTs","This study was a qualitative study that used the heuristic model to investigate the life experiences of private ambulance paramedics and EMT personnel. The study has clinical relevance to mental health practitioners who may treat individuals from this profession, programmatic relevance to managers and supervisors of private ambulance companies, as well as the ability to increase awareness and sensitivity of this group among the general public. Little information was present in the professional literature about the experience of private ambulance paramedics and EMTs, pointing to the need for this study. This study reviewed the limited literature that pertained to this group. Specifically, it addressed the long history of paramedics and EMTs;the inherent role of stress, anxiety, and PTSD associated with the job;and the role of adaptive and maladaptive coping in job stress. It outlined the differences between the term first responder (typically defined as police and firefighters) and paramedics/EMT personnel. This study explored the lived experience of 12 paramedic/EMT personnel using a modified heuristic model in order to identify major themes that cut across the co-researchers. The major themes identified were: Altruism, Coping, Psychological Distress, COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2, Camaraderie, and Preparation. These themes were derived from thematic analysis and displayed in quotes from co-researchers as examples. Included are three exemplary portraits, a composite description of all themes, all co-researchers, and a creative synthesis. The study continued with a discussion of the implications of the findings to members of this group, clinicians who may have come in professional contact with these individuals, and recommendations to managers and supervisors of ambulance companies. Limitations and direction for future research are also described. The study concludes with personal reflections of the research and process.

"Effects of ADHD symptoms on state mindfulness following a mindfulness induction","Mindfulness is often conceptualized as nonjudgmental awareness of the present moment and has been utilized in a variety of mental health interventions. Mindfulness programs have recently been used in treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as attentional networks are implicated in both mindfulness practices and ADHD deficits. One theory explaining the efficacy of mindfulness programs posits that repeatedly accessing and increasing a state of mindfulness increases overall trait mindfulness, which is said to improve mental health outcomes and, more specifically ADHD-related symptoms. However, the potential impact of ADHD symptoms on achieving state mindfulness through commonly practiced means of mindfulness meditation has not been investigated. This study examined the associations between ADHD symptoms, trait mindfulness, previous mindfulness experience, and meditation compliance, in relation to improvements in self-reported state mindfulness following a mindfulness induction. The sample consisted of 1637 students in Phase I, 70 students in Phase II with 35 each for high and low ADHD symptom group, and 20 students in Phase III. Participants were recruited from a rural mid-sized mid-Atlantic public university. Results showed that the brief mindfulness induction was effective at raising state mindfulness irrespective of ADHD symptom severity. However, there were no significant differences shown between high and low ADHD symptom groups in terms of change in state mindfulness level from the induction, or effect of previous mindfulness experience on mindfulness levels. Explanations for these findings are reviewed in context of ADHD symptomatology, mindfulness experience, and participant and situational factors, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Effect van de COVID-19 pandemie op geluk in Nederland","In the media we read mainly about negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our subjective wellbeing, such as increased depression, anxiety and loneliness. There is less attention for possible positive effects and for this reason it is worth examining how the life-satisfaction of the Dutch population has developed during the pandemic. In the short run, this will help policy makers to balance loss of happiness against loss of lives and in the long run it will help to examine which policies have resulted in the lowest loss of happy life years. In this article, we describe observed effects on happiness in the Netherlands during the pandemic (until spring 2021) using three empirical approaches: 1) trend in subsequent survey studies, 2) analysis of a panel study, and 3) analysis of a dairy study in which mood during daily activities was measured. Average life-satisfaction declined by about 4% of which 3% between summer 2020 and spring 2021. Whereas in the early days of the pandemic, the Dutch population only reported a minor loss of happiness, the decline has become substantial at the end of the road.","Veenhoven, Ruut, Burger, Martijn, Pleeging, Emma","https://www.google.com/search?q=Effect+van+de+COVID-19+pandemie+op+geluk+in+Nederland","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Mens en Maatschappij; 96(3):307-330, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32114,""
"De ervaringen van jonge statushouders met de schoolsluiting vanwege COVID-19","This paper focusses on the experiences of Syrian refugee youth in Rotterdam with the first school closure (spring 2020), due to COVID-19 policy measures. Based on repeated qualitative interviews with 19 boys and girls â€“ before, during and after the school closure â€“ we examine how Syrian refugee youth have experienced the school closure, and how this influence their educational position by using the four central tasks of education of Van de Werfhorst and Mijs (2010). Syrian refugee youth in our study emphasize that online education is more difficult to understand and stress they miss their friends at school. Moreover, their circumstances at home are not ideal for online learning, and therefore reaching the appropriate level of education becomes harder. This paper highlights the importance of the social aspect of education. Whereas going to school normally also stimulate friendships and their socialization in Dutch society, the school closure makes this more challenging. Especially for refugee youth school has extra relevance for reasons of e.g. mental health, resiliency, and socialization. Through our case studies, we argue that the school closure contributes to an accumulation of risks and inequalities. We conclude that the school closure will likely increase educational inequality for young people with a refugee background and makes their educational position more vulnerable.","van der Ent, Barbara, Stam, Talitha","https://www.google.com/search?q=De+ervaringen+van+jonge+statushouders+met+de+schoolsluiting+vanwege+COVID-19","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Mens en Maatschappij; 96(3):385-410, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32115,""
"The Psychological Well-Being of Southeast Asian Frontline Healthcare Workers during COVID-19: A Multi-Country Study","Objectives: This study examined the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and job burnout among frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) across six Southeast Asian countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam) during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021. We also investigated the associated risk and protective factors. Methods: Frontline HCWs (N = 1381) from the participating countries participated between 4 January and 14 June 2021. The participants completed self-reported surveys on anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-8), and job burnout (PWLS). Multivariate logistic regressions were performed with anxiety, depression, and job burnout as outcomes and sociodemographic and job characteristics and HCW perceptions as predictors. Results: The average proportion of HCWs reporting moderate anxiety, moderately severe depression, and job burnout across all countries were 10%, 4%, and 20%, respectively. Working longer hours than usual (Odds ratio [OR] = 1.82;3.51), perceived high job risk (1.98;2.22), and inadequate personal protective equipment (1.89;2.11) were associated with increased odds of anxiety and job burnout while working night shifts was associated with increased risk of depression (3.23). Perceived good teamwork was associated with lower odds of anxiety (0.46), depression (0.43), and job burnout (0.39). Conclusion: Job burnout remains a foremost issue among HCWs. Potential opportunities to improve HCW wellness are discussed.","Teo, Irene, Nadarajan, Gayathri Devi, Ng, Sean, Bhaskar, Adithya, Sung, Sharon C.; Cheung, Yin Bun, Pan, Fang Ting, Haedar, Ali, Gaerlan, Faith Joan, Ong, Sheue Fen, Riyapan, Sattha, Do, Son Ngoc, Luong, Chinh Quoc, Rao, Vijaya, Soh, Lin Min, Tan, Hiang Khoon, Ong, Marcus Eng Hock","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Psychological+Well-Being+of+Southeast+Asian+Frontline+Healthcare+Workers+during+COVID-19:+A+Multi-Country+Study","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(11):6380, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32116,""
"Preventing burnout: the role of personality and awareness in early career mental health professionals in acute settings","Burnout among health professionals had been increasing over the last decade, but amidst the global impact of COVID-19, burnout has contributed to a national health care crisis (Bednar, 2019;Sklar et al., 2021). Due to increased demand and patient acuity, entry-level mental health professionals (MHPs) in acute settings are specifically at risk (Morse et al., 2012;Simpson et al., 2018). Moreover, unique variables related to personality disposition and emotional vulnerability from trauma can create a predisposition for burnout (Alarcon et al., 2009). This study explored the impacts of personality and emotional awareness curriculum on managing stress amidst crisis work and minimizing burnout. This study used the Big Five Inventory-2-Short Form (BFI-2-S) personality measure and curriculum in the context of a semester long graduate level course that included emotional awareness training, stress-management strategies, and peer-to-peer process groups, to explore if clinical psychology doctoral students at a private university could increase emotional awareness and applicable stress management skills. The intervention group participated in the 15-week course, was tested pre- and post-intervention and at 4 month follow-up of work in rural emergency departments using the Difficulty in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS-18) and Emotional Self Awareness Scale (ESAS) and a qualitative questionnaire to assess for long-term efficacy. Results showed statistically significant differences in the total score of the ESAS, and in subdomains for Contextualization and Decision-Making with small to very large effect sizes. However, the changes were in the opposite direction than hypothesized. It appears that students reported more confidence in their emotional self-awareness at the beginning of the intervention than at the conclusion. We failed to find a significant difference in participants' ability to regulate difficulty emotions (DERS-18) and yielded only small to no effect size. The paired sample t-test comparing subjective reports found statistically significant increase in their confidence to manage emotions with a large effect size between T1 and T2. A repeated measures ANOVA failed to find significant difference, suggesting that changes between T2 and T3 were not retained. Although not statistically significant, results showed a moderate effect size in their confidence to maintain the use of the coping strategies.

"Sociaal kapitaal als bescherming tegen de mentale gevolgen van COVID-19","The corona pandemic has a huge impact on the mental wellbeing of the Dutch population. This article, based on a large-scale internet survey (N = 22,696) on the social impact of COVID-19, firstly examines which social groups are most susceptible to the mental health impact of the virus. Secondly, we examine whether social capital provides protection against this impact. We find that the mental health impact of COVID-19 is considerable and that it increased over the course of 2020. Women, young people, respondents with low incomes and/or poor health experience relatively more fear and stress due to the virus. We do not find a difference between respondents with or without a migration background. Social capital (received support, trust in people and in institutions) has the expected effect: the more support and trust, the less fear and stress. There is a mediation effect. Older people, respondents with high incomes and/or good health experience less fear and stress, partly because they have more social capital. This is different for females. They would experience even more fear and stress, compared to men, were it not for the fact that they have more social capital. Hence we conclude that social capital indeed provides some protection against the negative mental health effects of COVID-19.","Snel, Erik, de Boom, Jan, Marianne van, Bochove, Engbersen, Godfried","https://www.google.com/search?q=Sociaal+kapitaal+als+bescherming+tegen+de+mentale+gevolgen+van+COVID-19","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Mens en Maatschappij; 96(2):213-241, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32118,""
"Future Orientation and Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression in Italian University Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Resilience and the Perceived Threat of COVID-19","Several studies have already examined the psychological impact of COVID-19 on psychological well-being in samples of the general population. However, given the importance of future orientation for university students' mental well-being, it is important to explore whether and how COVID-19 affected this vulnerable population. Therefore, the current study aims to investigate the protective role of future orientation and the mediating effect of resilience on negative emotional symptoms (anxiety and depression). An online questionnaire was administered to a sample of 244 non-infected Italian university students. The mediation analysis results indicated that resilience fully mediated the relationship between anxiety and depression. Finally, the perceived threat of death from COVID-19 moderated the association between resilience and anxiety. This study shows that university students with higher levels of future orientation exhibit higher resilience levels and, consequently, fewer symptoms of negative emotions.","Servidio, Rocco, Scaffidi Abbate, Costanza, Costabile, Angela, Boca, Stefano","https://www.google.com/search?q=Future+Orientation+and+Symptoms+of+Anxiety+and+Depression+in+Italian+University+Students+during+the+COVID-19+Pandemic:+The+Role+of+Resilience+and+the+Perceived+Threat+of+COVID-19","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(6):974, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32119,""

"Liquidity constraints and optimal annuitization","In this paper, we view an individual's annuitization decision as an American style call option whose underlying asset is financial wealth, which controls the distance to annuitization. We then derive a certain threshold of wealth over which the individual is optimal to annuitize all of her wealth. We particularly focus on the effects of liquidity constraints on the individual's optimal annuitization decision, concerning their effects on the optimal investment and consumption strategies. We show that the annuitization decision can be significantly affected by the extent to which individual borrowing is constrained. More specifically, the optimal decision is for the individual to annuitize earlier with the tighter liquidity constrains she is exposed to than initially planned. This is particularly relevant to today's pandemic situation especially with the growing concern about cutting credit limits.","Park, Seyoung","https://www.google.com/search?q=Liquidity+constraints+and+optimal+annuitization","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Derivatives and Quantitative Studies (JDQS); 30(2):125-142, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32121,""

This cross-sectional observational study assessed the sleep and psychological problems due to the COVID-19 pandemic among healthcare workers of Employees State Insurance Corporation, an organized sector under the Ministry of Labour and Employment, India. Method: Logistic regression was used to evaluate factors associated with symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia and perceived stress among 492 healthcare workers in Employees State Insurance Corporation hospitals and dispensaries in Delhi and the National Capital Territory Region, India. Results: Logistic regression determined that factors of workplace type and frequency of hand washing were associated with anxiety;workplace type, job profile, occupation, formal COVID-19 training and adequate personal protective equipment were predictors of perceived stress;job profile was a common predictor of depression and insomnia;workplace type and formal COVID-19 training were associated with depression and insomnia, respectively. Limitations: This study was limited to healthcare workers in Employees State Insurance Corporation of Delhi and NCR which limits its generalizability to other regions of India. Conclusions: Healthcare workers are exposed to increased risk in the execution of their duties and require support to secure their wellbeing.

"Leadership strategies to prevent employee substance abuse relapse and optimize business viability","Employees, who relapse from substance abuse, precipitate unnecessary costs to employers through absenteeism, production loss, turnover, and health care. Addicted employees who relapse are becoming a growing concern as substance abuse relapse and overdose rates have significantly increased during the COVID-19 Pandemic. The purpose of this qualitative phenomenological study is to explore strategies leaders use to understand the needs of addicted employees during a crisis, reduce employee substance abuse relapse rates, and ensure business viability. The conceptual framework for this study is Maslow's hierarchy of needs, Goleman's emotional intelligence theory, and emotional sobriety. The population for this study includes 10 leaders located in the United States. The participants were chosen using purposeful snowball sampling and were asked 11 open-ended questions via qualitative interviews to gather rich and detailed data to saturate this study. Through data analysis, the researcher uncovered four themes: (a) meeting employees where they are;(b) building personal connection through vulnerability;(c) diversity and inclusion;(d) strategies formed through education and practical experience. Analysis of the findings revealed that leaders who participated in addiction education and utilized individualized consideration prevented relapse and improved organizational performance by addressing employee needs. The results of this study may be adopted by leaders to effectively retain an engaged and performing workforce by enhancing corporate policy and practices related to addicted employees.

"Beware of neuroleptic malignant syndrome in COVID-19 pandemic","Comments on an article by K. Buttar et al. (see record 2021-19635-007). I read with great interest the recent article by Buttar et al. detailing fatal consequences of the chronic neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) from the United States. The authors prescribed the challenges of treating psychiatric patients with the possibility of NMS. They also indicated that ethnic groups concerning metabolic enzyme polymorphisms for antipsychotics, such as Asians and African Americans, seem to be at higher risk for NMS. I strongly agree with the article because I recently experienced a Japanese patient with schizophrenia who developed severe chronic NMS during telepsychiatry in the COVID-19 pandemic. . Our case illustrates the difficulty of suspecting NMS symptoms in telepsychiatry. The COVID-19 pandemic triggered changes across healthcare systems, with many sectors seeing significant drops in patient visits. Although rapid transition to telepsychiatry allowed for the continued delivery of mental healthcare, valuable information from face-to-face examination is capable of being overlooked. Telepsychiatry can have unintended consequences, such as missing signs and symptoms that are obvious and easily recognizable in a face-to-face examination. However, these limitations do not diminish the value of telepsychiatry, which has become increasingly popular in recent years. Telepsychiatry can overcome these disadvantages by asking not only about psychiatric symptoms but also about physical symptoms. It has been suggested that COVID-19 infection might make patients more susceptible to developing NMS. Clinicians should be alert for the development of NMS during COVID-19 pandemic, as well as for behavioral changes seen in patients with COVID-19.

"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on the Mental Health of Rural Population in Iran","The COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused anxiety and fear in humans, has negatively affected the mental health of millions of people. This study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 disease on mental health of Iranian rural households. A cross-sectional study was carried out on 375 rural households from October 2nd to 29th, 2020. Data was gathered using the Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) questionnaire. Descriptive analysis and multivariable logistic regression were performed to evaluate the factors associated with mental health. High rates of paranoid ideation disorder (64.6%), interpersonal sensitivity (59.5%), and hostility (48.1%) were recorded among the Iranian rural population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Females tended to show more symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety, and paranoid ideation. Additionally, gender, the number of children, amount of loans, loss of a family member or friend due to COVID-19, worry about food insecurity, exposure to news about COVID-19, and access to medical centers were significant predictors of mental health. These findings indicate the need for public policies centered on mental disorders in rural areas during the COVID19 pandemic and the need for measures to protect vulnerable groups in the rural population.

"SEDATIVE EFFECT OF INFUSIONS FROM FIVE LAMIACEAE MARTINOV SPECIES","The increased emotional stress and anxiety in the modern human life are common causes of mental health problems which substantially grown during the COVID-19 pandemic. Timely intake of phytosedatives could mitigate the impact of stressful situations and reduce the risk of psychosomatic diseases. Essential oil-bearing plants belonging to the Lamiaceae Martinov family are valuable sources of bioactive compounds possessing sedative effects. The aim of the study was to evaluate the sedative effects of the infusions obtained from five unofficial Lamiaceae Martinov species. Infusions were daily administered to rats intragastrically in a prophylactic mode. The observations of behavioral reactions were carried out on the 1st, 4th and 7th days of the experiment using â€œopen fieldâ€ test. The sedative effect of infusions after their single administration to animals on the 1st day of the experiment was not observed. Starting with 4 days of the experiment, a noticeable sedative effect was established for the infusions from Dracocephalum moldavica and Ocimum americanum herbs. The noticeable sedative effects of the Dracocephalum moldavica and Ocimum americanum infusions are regarded as a result of synergistic properties of a lot of their biologically active compounds. Further research would help to reveal the mechanism of their sedative effect.","Mariia, S.; Ivan, K.; Stepan, A.","https://www.google.com/search?q=SEDATIVE+EFFECT+OF+INFUSIONS+FROM+FIVE+LAMIACEAE+MARTINOV+SPECIES","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Pharmacologyonline; 3:1292-1298, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32126,""
"Positive Orientation and Fatigue Experienced by Polish Nursing Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Mediatory Role of Emotional Control","This study aimed to investigate the mediatory role of emotional control with respect to the control of anger, depression, and anxiety in the relationship between positive orientation and tiredness/fatigue occurring in a group of Polish nursing students during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study included 894 nursing students from six universities in Poland. A diagnostic survey was applied as the research method, and the data were collected using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), the Courtauld Emotional Control Scale (CECS) and the Positive Orientation Scale (SOP). The mean participant age was 20.73 years (SD = 1.81). More than half of the students in the study showed a low level of positive orientation. Correlational analyses revealed a significant negative correlation between positive orientation and tiredness/fatigue experienced by the students participating in the study (r = &minus;0.336;p &lt; 0.001), and correlation between positive orientation and the overall emotional control index (r = &minus;0.317;p &lt; 0.001), and the indices of control of anger (r = &minus;0.154;p &lt; 0.01), depression (r = &minus;0.376;p &lt; 0.001), and anxiety (r = &minus;0.236;p &lt; 0.01). Analysis of the results also revealed the occurrence of significant, positive links between the controlled emotions and their components and the tiredness/fatigue experienced by nursing students. It is important to take action associated with the prevention of tiredness/fatigue among students and to reinforce a positive orientation and the capacity to control emotions to effectively minimize the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on nursing students.","Kupcewicz, Ewa, Rachubinska, Kamila, Gaworska-Krzeminska, Aleksandra, Andruszkiewicz, Anna, Kawalec-Kajstura, Ewa, Koziel, Dorota, Basinska, Malgorzata A.; Grochans, Elzbieta","https://www.google.com/search?q=Positive+Orientation+and+Fatigue+Experienced+by+Polish+Nursing+Students+during+the+COVID-19+Pandemic:+The+Mediatory+Role+of+Emotional+Control","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Medicine; 11(11):2971, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32127,""
"The Influence of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Women's Feelings during a Hospital Stay","Introduction: The COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) affected individuals and society and caused disruption, anxiety, stress, and loneliness. Being hospitalized during the pandemic increase a patient's negative feelings. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients' feelings (loneliness, depression, hope, self-efficacy) during a hospital stay. Materials and methods: This study included 207 women, aged from 15 to 83 years (55 &plusmn;21.2) that were hospitalized during the pandemic in Bia&#322;ystok, &#321;om&#380;a, and Bia&#322;a Podlaska, Poland at internal medicine departments. The main reasons for hospitalization were cardiovascular diseases, abdominal pain, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, diabetes, and unknown fever. Respondents were asked to complete the following questionnaires: Sense of Loneliness (the DJGLS), Depression Beck Inventory (BDI), Basic Hope (BHI-12), and Self-Efficacy (GSES). Results: Most of the studied group of women had an average sense of loneliness. A greater sense of loneliness was found among hospitalized women living in the countryside-the lowest sense of loneliness and depression was among women with higher education and the highest sense of effectiveness. One-third of respondents had a moderate degree of depression. Of the respondents, 39% had a relatively high level of basic hope. The assessment of self-efficacy demonstrated that 52% of the respondents showed a high sense of self-efficacy, an average sense of self-efficacy was shown by 35.5% of the respondents, and a low sense of self-efficacy was shown by 12.6% of the respondents. Conclusions: Numerous hospitalized women during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite experiencing moderate depression, had an average sense of loneliness and a high level of hope and self-efficacy.","Kulak-Bejda, Agnieszka, Bejda, Grzegorz, Krajewska-Kulak, Elzbieta, Slifirczyk, Anna, Chilinska, Joanna, Moczydlowska, Alicja, Waszkiewicz, Napoleon, Sobolewski, Marek","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Influence+of+the+COVID-19+Pandemic+on+Women's+Feelings+during+a+Hospital+Stay","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(11):6379, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32128,""
"Intracranial Aneurysm Rupture after SARS-CoV2 Infection: Case Report and Review of Literature","Background: SARS-CoV virus infection results in a dysbalanced and severe inflammatory response with hypercytokinemia and immunodepression. Viral infection triggers systemic inflammation and the virus itself can potentially cause vascular damage, including blood&ndash;brain barrier (BBB) disruption and alterations in the coagulation system, which may result in cardiovascular and neurovascular events. Here, we review the literature and present a case of COVID-19 infection leading to an aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH). Case Description: A 61-year-old woman presented with dyspnea, cough, and fever. She had a history of hypertension and was overweight with a body mass-index of 34. There was no history of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the family. Due to low oxygen saturation (89%) she was admitted into ICU. A chest CT showed a typical picture of COVID-19 pneumonia. The PCR-based test of an oropharyngeal swab was COVID-19-positive. In addition to oxygen support she was prescribed with favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine. She experienced a sudden headache and lost consciousness on the second day. Computer tomography (CT) with CT-angiography revealed a subarachnoid haemorrhage in the basal cisterns from a ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm. The aneurysm was clipped microsurgically through a left-sided standard pterional approach and the patient was admitted again to the intensive care unit for further intensive medical treatment. Post-operatively, the patient showed slight motor dysphasia. No other neurological deficits. Conclusion: Systemic inflammation and ventilator support-associated blood pressure fluctuations may trigger aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage secondary to COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 infection could be considered as one of the possible risk factors leading to instability and rupture of intracranial aneurysm.","Khan, Dilaware, Naderi, Soheil, Ahmadi, Mostafa, Ghorbani, Askar, Cornelius, Jan Frederick, HÃ¤nggi, Daniel, Muhammad, Sajjad","https://www.google.com/search?q=Intracranial+Aneurysm+Rupture+after+SARS-CoV2+Infection:+Case+Report+and+Review+of+Literature","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Pathogens; 11(6):617, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32129,""
"Asian Australians' Experiences of Online Racism during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Between 13 November 2020 and 11 February 2021, an online national survey of 2003 Asian Australians was conducted to measure the type and frequency of self-identified Asian Australians' experiences of racism during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey also aimed to gauge the relationships between racist experiences and targets' mental health, wellbeing and sense of belonging. In this paper, we report findings on the type and frequency of online racist experiences and their associations with mental health, wellbeing and belonging. The survey found that 40 per cent of participants experienced racism during the COVID-19 pandemic. Within that group, 66 per cent experienced racism online. The demographic pattern of those most likely to experience online racism were younger age groups, males, those born in Australia, English speakers at home, non-Christians, and migrants who have been in Australia less than 20 years. Analysis also found a strong correlation between Asian Australians' experiences of online racism and poor mental health, wellbeing and belonging. The relationship between experiencing racism, non-belonging and morbidity were more pronounced for those who experienced online racism compared to those who experienced racism in other offline contexts. This points to the corrosive nature of online racism on social cohesion, health and belonging.","Kamp, Alanna, Denson, Nida, Sharples, Rachel, Atie, Rosalie","https://www.google.com/search?q=Asian+Australians'+Experiences+of+Online+Racism+during+the+COVID-19+Pandemic","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Social Sciences; 11(5):227, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32130,""
"Mental Health and Health-Related Quality of Life in German Adolescents after the Third Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic","Evaluations after the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany showed an increase in mental health problems and a reduction in health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The aim of the study was to assess those aspects after the third wave of COVID-19 in adolescents who decided to receive a vaccination. In students aged 12&ndash;17 years recruited from schools in one German region, mental health (by the strengths and difficulties questionnaire, SDQ) and HRQoL (by KIDSCREEN-10) were assessed by both a self- and parental report. Data from 1412 adolescents (mean age 14.3 years, SD = 1.64) and 908 parents were collected. The mean self-reported HRQoL was T = 53.7 (SD = 11.2), significantly higher in boys than in girls and higher in younger (12&ndash;14 years) than in older (15&ndash;17 years) adolescents. In total, 18.7% of adolescents reported clinically relevant psychological symptoms, especially peer problems (23.5%), emotional problems (17.4%), and hyperactivity (17.1%). Comparing the present data to evaluations after the first and second waves of COVID-19, adolescents rated a higher HRQoL and reported less mental health problems after the third wave. After 1.5 years of living with the pandemic, adolescents have adapted to the changes in everyday life. Further, the relaxation of restrictions, better school organization, and the prospect of the vaccination may have increased optimism, wellbeing, and contentment, leading to declining but still alarming rates of psychological symptoms.","Hussong, Justine, MÃ¶hler, Eva, KÃ¼hn, Anna, Wenning, Markus, Gehrke, Thomas, Burckhart, Holger, Richter, Ulf, Nonnenmacher, Alexandra, Zemlin, Michael, LÃ¼cke, Thomas, Brinkmann, Folke, Rothoeft, Tobias, Lehr, Thorsten","https://www.google.com/search?q=Mental+Health+and+Health-Related+Quality+of+Life+in+German+Adolescents+after+the+Third+Wave+of+the+COVID-19+Pandemic","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Children; 9(6):780, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32131,""
"TraumaPlayTM and telemental health: Innovations through the screen","The COVID-19 pandemic created an unprecedented push toward telemental health services in the mental health community. Clinicians and agencies who never would have attempted virtual services found themselves offering telemental health within a matter of days when states across the country mandated shelter-in-place orders. This experience allowed many practitioners to realize the various benefits of telemental health which will likely become a permanent aspect of mental health services for the foreseeable future. Though COVID-19 is still unfortunately present at the time of this publication, it is incredible to see TraumaPlay practitioners and the wider play therapy community come together to offer support and virtual interventions to one another. The move to telemental health was not without its challenges, but virtual sessions offered an intimate look into the home life of the families we serve and in a way that is not possible through in person sessions. In many cases, beautiful individual work was facilitated because the screen served as a titration to hard content. For others, family work became a viable option for those whose schedules would not permit these meetings in person. The wider incorporation of telemental health into play therapy will provide needed services in a more flexible manner.

"Effects of Sedentary Behavior Interventions on Mental Well-Being and Work Performance While Working from Home during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial","Sedentary behavior negatively impacts mental health, which can decrease employee productivity. Employee mental well-being and work performance may improve with sedentary reduction interventions, especially strategies that include environmental workplace modifications and behavior-changing strategies. However, such interventions have not been examined among employees working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of the Stand Up Kansas program, 95 sedentary university employees working from home were randomized into one of four intervention arms: height-adjustable desk provision (Desk Only), online sedentary behavior modification program (Program Only), Desk + Program, or Control. The outcomes were measured at a baseline (November 2020) and following the 12-week intervention (February 2021). Employees reported mood (positive and negative affect), stress, fatigue (duration, interference with activities and severity) and work performance (irritability, focus, work satisfaction, non-work satisfaction and productivity) were measured using established self-report instruments. The effect sizes, by comparing the Control arm to the Desk + Program arm, revealed large improvements in mood (positive affect, d = 1.106). Moderate improvements were also seen in fatigue (duration, d = &minus;0.533, and interference with activities, d = &minus;0.648) and several aspects of work performance (focus, d = 0.702, work satisfaction, d = 0.751, and productivity, d = 0.572). Moderate effect sizes were also seen for positive affect (d = 0.566) and fatigue severity (d = 0.577) among the Program Only arm, whereas no noteworthy effect sizes were observed among the Desk Only arm.

"Exploring Secrets by the Sea","Dyjack shares his experience attending and speaking at the American Public Health Association (APHA) state affiliate meeting. He was the sole voice of environmental public health. He had been requested to speak to the contributions of the environmental health profession to public health. This conference was primarily attended by members and supporters of the local APHA affiliate. He reminded the audience that APHA was created in 1872 by a sanitarian, Dr. Stephen Smith, to primarily address water, sanitation, and hygiene. Specifically, much of the work early in APHA's history was focused on environmental health issues such as conditions that exacerbated tuberculosis, contaminated milk, and air pollution. From there he picked up momentum as he described the core functions of public health-assessment, assurance, and policy development. Each of these pillars have environmental health embedded into them. He pointed out that environmental health is the second largest part of the public health workforce. Finally, he shared the 2012 report that describes environmental health as a foundational public health service.

"Attachment and Mental Health in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Posttraumatic Growth and Religion as Moderators","Consistent with the teachings in various religious traditions of finding meaning amidst suffering, we suspected that Posttraumatic Growth (PTG) would have a buffering effect on attachment insecurity and psychosocial outcomes. We examined the effects of anxious and avoidant attachment, PTG, and religion on psychosocial outcomes (i.e., anxiety, depression, and loneliness). Data from 466 participants recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) and a college student sample revealed that PTG served as a moderator between anxious attachment and (a) depression and (b) loneliness, and (c) PTG buffered the relationship between anxious attachment and anxiety to a greater extent among Christians, compared to non-Christians. On the other hand, (a) PTG did not moderate the link between attachment avoidance and depression, (b) PTG exacerbated the relationship between attachment avoidance and anxiety, and (c) PTG buffered the association between attachment avoidance and loneliness for non-Christians, but this link was amplified for Christians. We discuss the findings that PTG interacted with religion and offered protective effects for anxious (but not avoidant) attachment.

Some 91.0% of parents reported stress and 41.2, 26.6, and 33.7% reported symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD, respectively. Most parents (87.6%) reported cancellation of at least one child activity. Of the parents, 60.3% reported that their children participated in remote learning and the majority (70.3%) reported feeling overwhelmed by it. Having more cancelled child activities was associated with higher odds of reported mental health symptoms, with not being able to play outside associated with higher odds of anxiety (1.80 (1.26, 2.58), p = 0.001), depression (1.93 (1.29, 2.91), p = 0.002), PTSD (1.64 (1.13, 2.39), p = 0.009), and stress (2.34 (1.27, 4.44), p = 0.008). Feeling overwhelmed by remote learning was also associated with higher odds of all four outcomes. Pre-existing mental illness, lower resilience scores, and lower socioeconomic status emerged as additional factors associated with symptoms of mental illness. These findings highlight the importance of resources to minimize adverse psychological effects among vulnerable families.","Deeb, Stephanie, Madden, Devin, Ghebretinsae, Timnit, Lin, Joyce, Ozbek, Umut, Mayer, Victoria, Vangeepuram, Nita","https://www.google.com/search?q=Child+Disruptions,+Remote+Learning,+and+Parent+Mental+Health+during+the+COVID-19+Pandemic","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(11):6442, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32139,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 on Depressive Symptoms and Loneliness for Middle-Aged and Older Adults","This study examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on depressive symptoms and loneliness in older adults, using the Protection Motivation Theory Framework. Using data collected between March 2020 and May 2021 as part of the Health and Retirement Study (N = 2145 adults over age 50), the roles of threat and coping appraisals as predictors of protective health behaviors and, ultimately, mental health outcomes, were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Being at high risk for COVID-19 complications and death was associated with more depressive symptoms and loneliness. Higher levels of concern about COVID-19 were associated with more depressive symptoms while knowing someone who had died of the coronavirus was associated with less loneliness. Lower scores for perceived control over one's health and social life were associated with more depressive symptoms and higher loneliness. These results suggest that moving forward, mental health assessments should consider the impact of the pandemic and include measures specifically asking about COVID-19 concerns and experiences (e.g., death of close friends or family due to COVID-19, protective health measures). Additionally, future responses to this pandemic and other public health emergencies should consider the influence that self-efficacy has on health behaviors and mental health. The pandemic has raised public awareness of the negative consequences of social isolation and acted to destigmatize mental illness, and this greater awareness could encourage middle-aged and older adults to seek various treatments for depression and loneliness.","Curl, Angela L.; Wolf, Katie E.","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Impact+of+COVID-19+on+Depressive+Symptoms+and+Loneliness+for+Middle-Aged+and+Older+Adults","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(10):6316, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32140,""
"Symptoms of Burnout Syndrome among Physicians during the Outbreak of COVID-19 Pandemic-A Systematic Literature Review","Background: Studies in the recent decades show that the medical profession has a high risk to develop burnout due to constant exposure to mental and physical suffering or death. The pandemic period induced additional stress for healthcare professionals due to the likelihood of a high rate of infection, long working shifts, using protective equipment, staying away from family, implementing new medical procedures. The present study is focusing on assessing the prevalence of burnout among physicians working in the healthcare system during the COVID-19 pandemic, and discovering the main factors associated with burnout syndrome among the population of physicians. Material and methods: A systematic review was conducted by searching PubMed, Wiley, and Google Scholar in November 2021. A total of 35 studies were eligible for the evaluation. Results: The samples ranged from 39 to 3071 physicians, and the overall burnout ranged from 14.7% to 90.4%. Sociodemographic characteristics associated with a high prevalence of burnout were the female gender, less experienced, not having children, and single marital status, associated with high levels of anxiety, depression, and stress in the female gender. The highest level of burnout among all the studies was 90.4% on a sample of physicians from the Republic of Korea, 80.2% among psychiatrists in Saudi Arabia, followed by a study in Ireland with a 77% level of burnout among senior and specialist physicians, and 74.7 % prevalence of burnout for emergency physicians in USA. Conclusions: During the pandemic, the factors that contribute to burnout are the lack of personal protective equipment and the violence of issues related to organizational health;the high prevalence of burnout symptoms is associated with anxiety, depression, and stress.","Claponea, Roxana Mihaela, Pop, Lavinia Maria, Iorga, Magdalena, Iurcov, Raluca","https://www.google.com/search?q=Symptoms+of+Burnout+Syndrome+among+Physicians+during+the+Outbreak+of+COVID-19+Pandemic-A+Systematic+Literature+Review","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(6):979, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32141,""
"Engaging healthcare providers to coprescribe naloxone to prevent opioid-induced mortality in Arizona","Purpose: This quality improvement (QI) project utilized an educational intervention to increase healthcare providers' (HCPs) willingness to coprescribe naloxone (Narcan) as a mitigation strategy to reduce fatal opioid overdoses.Background: In the late 1990s, pharmaceutical companies issued statements that opioids were not addictive, which resulted in overprescribing of opioids, and subsequently, a rise in overdoses that has increased since the emergence of COVID-19. Methods: A 15-minute, asynchronous online educational intervention summarized the epidemiology and health disparities associated with opioid-induced overdoses, described the evidence of naloxone distribution, explained the patient criteria and applicable laws for prescribing naloxone, and provided examples of administration methods and patient-centered approaches for discussing naloxone. An anonymous pre/post-survey evaluated HCPs motivations, barriers, and intent and their willingness to coprescribe naloxone as a harm reduction strategy at one federally qualified health center (FQHC) in Arizona.Results: The seven project participants generally had positive attitudes about naloxone. Baseline motivation and comfort levels to discuss naloxone as a harm reduction strategy were high;however, communication strategies and fixed time constraints were reported as potential barriers. Perceived barriers did not impact overall willingness to coprescribe naloxone. Participants with a behavioral health background were more likely to view naloxone administration as an opportunity to seek long-term treatment than those in the primary care specialty. Additionally, this QI project incidentally found a discrepancy between local and state policies for naloxone prescribing.Conclusions: The opioid epidemic continues to have devastating consequences due to addiction and misuse, resulting in high mortality rates due to unintentional or accidental overdoses. Coprescribing naloxone, a proven antidote to reverse an opiate-induced overdose, may help combat this national health crisis. HCPs who are well informed may be more likely to coprescribe naloxone and the intervention in this QI project successfully enhanced participant familiarity with the Arizona standing orders. Primary care, compared to behavioral health, providers may need additional education to improve willingness to coprescribe naloxone. Recommendations include that the FQHC continue efforts to create a culture where naloxone prescribing, and overdose prevention education becomes a routine in clinical practice for both primary care and behavioral health specialties.

"Effects of Social Distancing on Quality of Life and Emotional-Affective Sphere of Caregivers and Older Patients Hospitalized in Rehabilitation Departments during COVID-19 Quarantine: An Observational Study","During the COVID-19 emergency, institutional social distancing conditions were established, preventing family and caregivers' access to rehabilitation departments. Our study goal was to assess inpatients' and caregivers' anxiety, depression, and Quality of Life (QoL) during the Italian lockdown due to the pandemic. We investigated anxiety, depression, and QoL in 53 patients and 51 caregivers, using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF36). These questionnaires were given to patients after one (T0) and two months (T1) since the hospitalization. The BAI showed that anxiety was moderate for 7.5% of patients and 23.5% of caregivers, and severe for 35.8% of patients and 17.6% of caregivers. The BDI found moderate depression in 11.3% of patients and 15.7% of caregivers, and severe depression in 34.0% of patients and 9.8% of caregivers. Depression was higher in patients than caregivers, while no differences were detected in anxiety. Compared to normative data, patients' QoL declined in all eight SF36 dimensions, while caregivers' QoL declined only in social, emotional, and mental components. Unexpectedly, patients still hospitalized at T1 showed significant improvements in both anxiety and three QoL subscores. These findings emphasize the importance of psychological support for patients and their families.","Aprile, Irene, Falchini, Francesca, Mili, Emiliano, Mastrorosa, Alessia, Langone, Emanuele, Mosca, Rita, Larocca, Stefano, Lategana, Michele, Aiello, Loredana, Lorusso, Angela, Siotto, Mariacristina, Giansanti, Daniele, Germanotta, Marco","https://www.google.com/search?q=Effects+of+Social+Distancing+on+Quality+of+Life+and+Emotional-Affective+Sphere+of+Caregivers+and+Older+Patients+Hospitalized+in+Rehabilitation+Departments+during+COVID-19+Quarantine:+An+Observational+Study","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Diagnostics; 12(6):1299, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32143,""

"Mental health problems among hotline callers during the early stage of COVID-19 pandemic","Background The study aims to explore the mental health of the hotline callers during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Methods Callers (N = 10,490) from the Beijing Psychological Support Hotline from January 21st to June 30th in 2019 and 2020 were enrolled and divided into two groups (during (2020) and before (2019) COVID-19 pandemic). The severity of depressive symptoms, psychological distress, hopefulness, and suicidal ideation (SI) was assessed. Demographic characteristics and major concerns were also collected. Mann-Whitney U and chi-square test were used to compare the differences in mental health conditions and major concerns between two years and between different age groups. The multivariable logistic regression was used to explore whether mental health conditions were associated with pandemic and demographic factors. Results Results from multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated that the change in suicidal ideation (OR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.21â€“1.92) was significantly different across age groups. Callers during the pandemic reported a higher level of hopefulness (OR = 1.13, 95% CI [1.03â€“1.24]), a lower level of depressive symptoms (OR = 0.81, 95% CI [0.74â€“0.89]) and psychological distress (OR = 0.89, 95% CI [0.81â€“0.98]), and were less likely to report SI (OR = 0.69, 95% CI [0.61â€“0.77]) compared with callers before the pandemic. Conclusions Compared with callers before the pandemic, hotline callers during the early stage of COVID-19 pandemic did not present significant mental health problems. Younger callers during the pandemic were more vulnerable for the presence of suicidal ideation. Hotline-based crisis interventions might provide specific psychological support to cope with troubles during the pandemic.","An, Jing, Yin, Yi, Zhao, Liting, Tong, Yongsheng, Liu, Nancy H.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Mental+health+problems+among+hotline+callers+during+the+early+stage+of+COVID-19+pandemic","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: PeerJ;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32145,""
"Outcomes of importance to children and young adults with cerebral palsy, their parents and health professionals following lower limb orthopaedic surgery: A qualitative study to inform a Core Outcome Set","IntroductionAlthough several outcomes are commonly measured to assess the effect of surgery for young people with cerebral palsy (CP), these are selected mainly by health professionals and researchers. Including the perspectives of a broader range of stakeholders is an essential step towards determining important outcomes for assessment. This qualitative study involves the development of a core outcome set (COS) for lower limb orthopaedic surgery for ambulant children with CP.ObjectiveThis study aimed to identify outcomes that matter to children and young people with CP, their parents and healthcare professionals following lower limb orthopaedic surgery.MethodsSemi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 healthcare professionals, 10 children and young people with CP and 8 parents. Interview data were analysed by content analysis supported by the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF-CY) supplemented by thematic analysis.FindingsThirty-one outcomes were identified in total, which were linked to eleven second-level ICF-CY categories. There were differences between stakeholder groups in preferences and expectations from surgical outcomes. Healthcare professionals and children with their parents identified 31 and 25 outcomes, respectively. Health outcomes valued by participants were lower limb alignment and symmetry, flexibility and muscle strength, mental health, fatigue, pain, function in life, mobility, participation, being independent, quality of life and adverse events. Compared to previous published trials, 10 new outcomes were revealed by this study.ConclusionThe researchers identified outcomes that are important to all stakeholders following lower limb orthopaedic surgery for ambulant CP. Including these outcomes in future studies would promote patient-centred care for children and young adults with CP. Findings will be used to inform an international Delphi survey and develop a COS in this field.Patient and Public ContributionThis study was informed by an advisory group including a young adult with CP and a parent of a child with CP.

"Dance as therapy in Grenada: The intersection of gender, education, and crisis","The purpose of this narrative qualitative study explores the effects of ""Dance as Therapy"" on the emotional well-being of young women in Grenada. ""Dance as Therapy"" is the combination of dance and mindfulness practices, such as meditation and reflective writing. More specifically this study will explore the role dance and mindfulness plays in regards to participants' mood, social interactions, and goals/aspirations, both prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic.This study was comprised of ten young women who were former students and/or teachers of Harmony Dance Academy (HDA);a mindful dance program on the island. The following questions guided this study: (1) What challenges do young women in Grenada face, particularly in terms of social stigmas, gender inequality, and discrimination? (2) What role(s) does dance play in the lives of young women in Grenada both in and out of school, particularly in terms of managing emotional wellness? (3) How has COVID-19 impacted young women's relationship to dance? How has this impacted their sense of emotional wellness?Through semi-structured focus groups and one-on-one interviews, three critical themes emerged during the data analysis process. Theme 1, Being Silenced, presents what young women are coping with, in terms of Cultural Stigmas, Gender Inequality, and Discrimination, and how they have been silenced by it all. Theme 2, Finding Voice: Before & Amidst a Global Pandemic, provides insight into what dance means for these young women and how their relationship with the art form has led to them finding their voice in the most unique ways. It also sheds light as to how the role of dance has changed in their lives since the inset of COVID-19. Theme 3, The Impact of Mindful Dance Programming, highlights the benefits of programs like HDA, and the impact it has had on the participants and their students.In addition, three findings emerged through in-depth focus groups and individual interviews;(1) Participants have experienced and continue to experience gender inequality within the school system, at home, and the workplace, (2) Participants have experienced and are experiencing emotional challenges (anxiety, depression, low self-esteem) as a result of discrimination, cultural stigmas, and lack of a trusted space in which to share and process their truth, (3) Participants' experiences reflect the positive impact dance and mindfulness had on their emotional, mental, and social well-being.Recommendations from this study, based on findings, are offered to the Government of Grenada, Dance Educators, Young Caribbean Women, as well as recommendations for future research.

"Preventive measures for obesity pandemic during COVID-19 quarantine;choosing the right diet","Until recently, obesity was one of the greatest public health issues. At the moment, the world is counting deaths from COVID-19, and raging obesity pandemic is not in the focus. While the quarantine is the mainstay of COVID-19 prevention, it also opposes obesity prevention. Obesity is a risk factor for severe COVID-19 infection. Treatment of obesity during quarantine is challenging;trying to lose weight without the opportunity for outdoor activity or access to fresh and healthy foods may lead to frustration, depression and overeating. Therefore, we propose that patients should focus on preventing new weight gain instead of losing weight. It can be achieved by practicing indoor physical exercise together with adequate diet. The diet should be opposite from, ""Western diet pattern'' and include foods easily obtainable during quarantine;with longer shelf life, but also rich in anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory bioactive compounds. These characteristics of the diet make it simple to implement during quarantine, it helps in the process maintaing weight and supports immune system-all what is required to possibly reduce the risk of severe COVID-19 infection. The anti-inflammatory properties from given diet have beneficial role, especially in obese patients, as they have low grade chronic inflammation which additionally may worsen clinical course of COVID-19 infection.","Leksic, G.; Baretic, M.; Karas, I.; Krznaric, Z.","https://doi.org/10.54931/2053-4787.29-S1-1","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: African Journal of Diabetes Medicine; 29(1), 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32149,""
"Long Term Impact of COVID-19 Infection on Sleep and Mental Health","Aim: To determine the long term impact of covid-19 infection on sleep and mental health. Study design: Cross-sectional study Place and duration of study: Department of Psychiatry, Ghulam Mohammad Mahar Medical College Sukkur from 1st April 2021 to 30th September 2021. Methodology: Fifty patients were enrolled after their positivity confirmation of coronavirus-19 through nasal swab test polymerase chain reaction. Categorization was done on the basis of disease severity. HRCT was performed for complete chest examination and grading of covid-19. Other laboratory tests were also done for day to day assessment of patient. Patients after their recovery were asked to follow up after six months of their disease. The demographic, gender, clinical history and clinical record were documented on a well-structured questionnaire. Co-morbidities associated were also recorded. Sleep and mental health were assessed by Pittsburgh sleep quality index. This assessment tool is used to identify sleep disturbances. The scoring techniques use seven sub scores ranging between 0-3. Results: The mean age was 49.56Â±12.2 years with almost equal males and females. In 66% of the participants of severe group and critical group were suffering from poor sleep quality followed by non severe group. Phobic anxieties were more common in non-severe and severe cases while paranoid ideation was normal in severe cases but at borderline in critical cases. Paranoid ideation was more common in married as well as single patients.

Methods: A descriptive correlation design used in the present research established that for a period from October 10th, 2021 to March 20th, 2022. The study used a probability (convenient) samples of 143 nurses who recovered from COVID-19 and were drawn from wards of educational and non-educational hospitals. The instruments of the research are adopted and modified for the purpose of this research. Results: The current study showed that less than three-quarters (102, or 71.3%) of those aged (19-29) years of age of age, and more than two-thirds (94, or 65.7%) were female. Regarding marital status, more than half of the sample of 81 (56.6%) were single, and concerning family size, less than two thirds of 89 (62.2%) were small less than six individuals. In relation to educational level, more than a fifth (58, or 40.6%) were diplomas in nursing. It also revealed that about two thirds (93, or 65%) had had (1-5) years of experience in a health setting. Conclusions: Moderate depressive disorder was more prevalent in recovered nurses from the age group (19-29), specifically females, and they had served in health institutions for 1-5 years. Recommendations: Researchers must invest more in studies to measure a larger population to generalize the results. The Department of Continuing Medical Education must provide psychological support for recovered nurses from COVID-19, especially female nurses. Increased efforts should be made to hold epidemiological training courses on how to deal with transmissible viruses, as well as to understand their dangers and modes of transmission.","Raheem, A.

"Remote Teaching (and learning) of Emergency: a study on emotions in physical education students","The objective of the study was to delve into the emotional self-perception of university students, in virtual environments because of the remote educational experience due to the COVID 19 pandemic. We worked with 41 students studying the Professorship in Physical Education of the National University of Rio Cuarto, Cordoba, Argentina, during the year 2020. Considerations were made by gender, age, year of study, experience in virtuality, work, and dependents. The EMOC-EVEA Questionnaire was used: Affective-emotional component in virtual teaching-learning environments (Garcia-Perales, & Valverde Berrocoso, 2021). The results show two ways of perceiving emotions before and during virtual activity. On the one hand, a more positive minority about the experience of virtuality, who take advantage of learning in other ways, feeling comfortable, capable and predisposed. On the other hand, a majority tendency, more pessimistic in relation to the daily challenges to connect, with the feeling of leaving the class, insecurity when interacting virtually, feeling it an obstacle to their professional training. Emotions related to overwhelm, stress, frustration, anxiety, anguish, helplessness, confusion, demotivation, and isolation appear, referring in general to processes of loss of the identity of the race due to the impossibility of practices and body to body encounters.","de la Barrera, M.

"Time Perception and Time Management during COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown","Our perception of time changes with age, but it also depends on our emotional state and physical conditions. It is not necessarily mental disorders that distort human's time perception, but threatening or dangerous situations, induced fear or sadness trigger psychological defensive mechanism that speeds up or slows down the rate of the internal clock. Fear distorted time is caused by higher (slower) pulse rate, increased (decreased) blood pressure and muscular contraction. The given research is aimed at improving our understanding of the mechanism that controls this sense, opening the way for new forms of time management. Our perception of time is dependent on our emotional state, temporal distortion caused by emotion is not the result of a malfunction in the internal biological clock, but, on the contrary, an illustration of its remarkable ability to adapt to events around us. Development of time sensitivity is very important for timing, time perception, time-management and procrastination problem solution.","Makarova, E. A.; Makarova, E. L.; Korovin, I.

"Mental and technical readiness of freshmen nursing students in an online learning modality","The Covid-19 pandemic opens more windows to online learning globally. With this, all countries have shifted their educational setup to online learning modalities due to this pandemic. This study assessed the level of mental and technical readiness in the online learning modality of freshmen nursing students in one of the catholic private institutions in the Philippines. The researchers made use of descriptive research. An adapted questionnaire was used as a data-gathering tool but subjected to a reliability test. Results revealed that most of the respondents were female, graduated from the STEM strand, and belong to poor families. It further disclosed that for the mental dimension, the students were ready, and for the technical dimension, they were only somewhat ready. Additionally, inferential statistics showed that among the student's profiles, the family's monthly income showed a significant difference specifically between the poor and the lower-middle-income group both in mental and technical dimensions. The proposed psycho-social programs were focused on the topmost indicators that obtained the lowest mean scores among indicators observed, such as the presence of distractions, spending 20-30 hours each week on an online course, and availability of reliable person around, lack of a printer, stable internet connection, and the student's device compatibility needed for online learning. Thus, the researchers highly recommend that the institution should intensify its orientation program on the use of the learning management system of an online learning modality and improve its program on mental health issues for both students, parents, and teachers.","Galecia, J.

"USF PANDEMIC RESPONSE RESEARCH NETWORK (USF-PRRN): A HIGHLY INTEGRATIVE BASIC AND RESPONSIVE RESEARCH APPROACH TO COVID-19","Pandemics represent significant threats to global health and impact all aspects of human life including physical and mental health, global economics, education, public policy and communication. The diversity of impacts associated with global pandemics as well as the speed of the resulting disease spread require multidisciplinary timely approaches to address the complex interplay of factors required for pandemic mitigation. Universities provide a critical national asset for addressing pandemic mitigation as these institutions possess broad intellectual capital that can be leveraged to guide national and global responses. Universities across the United States have approached the pandemic with a variety of strategies to link disciplinary expertise to target differing aspects of the problem. The University of South Florida adapted a rapid response research network approach that essentially integrates HIBAR principles (Highly Integrative Basic and Responsive research) to address wide ranging aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic. This description of the USF Pandemic Response Research Network (USF-PRRN) highlights the HIBAR features of the network and how the USF-PRRN concept can be applied to other global sustainability challenges.","Larsen, R.

"Zoom fatigue and its risk factors in online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic","BACKGROUND Global nations have enforced strict health protocols because of the COVID-19's high transmission, infectivity, and mortality. As shown by increased online learning and video conferencing, the employment and education sectors are shifting to home-based activities. Video conferencing as a communication medium has subtly led to zoom fatigue. This study aimed to analyze the risk factors of zoom fatigue for early prevention and treatment. METHODS This cross-sectional study was conducted on 335 Indonesian university students selected by purposive sampling in July 2021. Data were collected using a demographic questionnaire including online courses duration during the COVID-19 pandemic;Pittsburgh sleep quality index;depression, anxiety and stress scale-21;and zoom & exhaustion fatigue (ZEF) scale through Google Form (Google LLC, USA) distributed via social media and student forums. Association and correlation tests were used, and the model was developed using linear regression. RESULTS The respondents were aged 21.3 (1.8) years with 12.8 (5.1) months of online courses during the COVID-19 pandemic and a ZEF scale of 2.8 (0.9). Students with higher ZEF had irregular physical exercise, poorer sleep quality, longer video conferencing sessions, longer months of courses during the COVID-19 pandemic, and higher mental illness (i.e., stress, anxiety, and depression). Smoking negatively correlated with fatigue (r = -0.12). The model for ZEF showed good predictability for zoom fatigue (p&lt;0.001, R-2 = 0.57). CONCLUSIONS Daily exposure to video conferencing in educational settings throughout the pandemic has drastically increased zoom fatigue. The stakeholders must act immediately to minimize the risks while providing maximum benefits.","Salim, J.; Tandy, S.; Arnindita, J. N.; Wibisono, J. J.; Haryanto, M. R.; Wibisono, M.

"COVID-19 and obesity: Difficulties faced by patients in the preoperative period for bariatric surgery","Introduction: Obesity is a chronic disease that poses health risks and is associated with severe forms of COVID-19. During the COVID-19 pandemic, psychological difficulties may emerge more often in obese patients. Objective: to evaluate possible impacts when coping with the pandemic in patients in the preoperative period for bariatric surgery. Method: A cross-sectional descriptive study with a qualitative approach and data collected through semi-structured interviews. The sample was composed of patients in the preoperative period for bariatric surgery. Three main thematic axes were previously established, and after transcribing the interviews, the answers were analyzed and classified into categories. Results: Seventeen patients in the preoperative period for bariatric surgery were interviewed, 10 females and 7 males. The mean age of participants was 36.7 Â± 13.6 years, and the mean body mass index was 43.9 Â± 8.4 kg/m2. The patients had difficulties in following the nutritional protocol and performing physical activities, which are important in preparing for bariatric surgery. The moment experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic caused sequels, particularly emotional ones, in the interviewees. Conclusion: It is important to maintain frequent monitoring by multidisciplinary teams for these patients during the pandemic, even if remotely, to improve the management of their physical and mental health in the preoperative period of bariatric surgery.","Alves, A.; Carvalho, J.

"Happy hypoxia in COVID-19 patients associated with hypoxic ventilatory depression","Objective: Acute exposure to hypoxia generally increase the ventilation. However, some of COVID-19 patients who suffer from pneumonia are characterized by hypoxic ventilatory depression with loss of dyspnea which is called as happy hypoxia. This report describes the background and the clinical issues of happy hypoxia. Methods: The mechanisms to increase ventilation and dyspnea under hypoxia are explained. Further, clinical issues and characteristics in COVID-19 are reviewed. Results: Genetic factors are definitely concerned with chemosensitivity to hypoxia. Further disease factors including COVID-19 infection could influence the attenuation of the chemosensitivity. This can be attributed to either ventilatory depression due to the modulation of metabolic substrate, adenosine in the brain, or autonomic neuropathy including the dysfunction of the carotid body. Conclusions: COVID-19 patients must be carefully treated and/or monitored to avoid hypoxic ventilator depression. The clinical application of aminophylline will be an issue to be considered.","Kimura, H.","https://doi.org/10.11343/amn.65.73","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Acta Medica Nagasakiensia; 65(2):73-75, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32161,""
"Mental Health Status among the Quarantined Population during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-sectional Study from Western Rajasthan","Introduction: Although isolation and quarantine are important measures to curb the exponential growth of the prevailing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, but at same time this can impose psychological issues among the affected population and also to their family members. Aims: To evaluate the mental health problems, their severity and associated factors in quarantined population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 207 quarantined subjects at different quarantine centres of Ajmer, associated with JLN Medical College, Ajmer, from August 2020 to October 2020,after getting approval from ethics committee of the centre. All the consenting quarantined subjects who were of age 18 years and above, irrespective of their gender were enrolled in the study. For the assessment of psychiatric morbidity, participants were screened using Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) 6.0.0. Finally, the relevant psychiatric assessment tools like Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D),Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) and Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale were applied to assess the severity of the disorders. Pearson correlation analysis was used to evaluate the relationship among various clinical variables.The level of significance was considered at p-value lt;0.05. Results: Majority 85 (41%) subjects belonged to the age group 31-40 years of age. Around 116 (77.3%) participants were male. Around 51 (24.6%) presented moderate depression and 25 (12%) presented with severe depression. Also 182 (87.9%) presented with moderate anxiety. The study showed a statistically significant association between depression/anxiety and substance abuse, insomnia, co-morbidities, suicidal ideation/attempts. Conclusion: The findings of the present study concluded that a significant proportion of the quarantined population suffered from psychological issues.

"The Silent Cry of Healthcare Workers: A Cross-Sectional Study on Levels and Determinants of Burnout among Healthcare Workers after First Year of the Pandemic in Turkey","Background: Although the acute phase of the pandemic is over, healthcare workers continue to face challenges. The aim of this study was to determine burnout levels and possible related psychological processes such as psychological flexibility, moral injury, and values among healthcare workers after the first year of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed using an online survey distributed through social networks. A sample of 124 front line healthcare workers working during the pandemic, between January and April 2021, were included in the study. Multiple linear regression was used to identify predictors of all 3 burnout dimensions (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and lack of personal accomplishment). Results: While 51.6% of healthcare workers experienced high levels of emotional exhaustion, 75.8% of them were found to have experienced high levels of lack of personal accomplishment. On the contrary, 81.5% of the participants reported low levels of depersonalization. Emotional exhaustion was predicted by total Depression Anxiety Stress Scale score (P = .004) and total Moral Injury Events Scale score was the only predictor of depersonalization (P = .051). Predictors of lack of personal accomplishment were the number of days worked in COVID-19 (P = .001), total Moral Injury Events Scale (P=0.004), Valuing Questionnaire (VQ)-Obstruction (P = .009), and total Depression Anxiety Stress Scale score (P = .002). On the other hand, psychological flexibility did not predict any sub-dimension of burnout. Conclusion: Healthcare workers had high levels of burnout after 1 year with the pandemic. Our findings highlight the importance of factors such as moral injury, values, and emotional distress which need to be taken into consideration to develop future interventions to treat and prevent burnout in healthcare workers.","Ulusoy, S.; Ã‡elik, Z.","https://doi.org/10.5152/pcp.2022.21248","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatry and Clinical Psychopharmacology; 32(1):63-71, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32164,""
"Effect of Infection on Mental Health in COVID-19 Positive Cases and its Relationship with Clinical Variables","Background: While global attention has focused largely on the effects of the coronavirus on physical health, the effects of the coronavirus on mental health cannot be ignored. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effects of COVID-19 disease on mental health and its relationship with other clinical variables. Methods: In this study, adult patients over 18 years of age who were diagnosed with COVID 19 by real time-polymerized chain reaction (RT-PCR) method in our city were included. By using some psychological scales, psychological influence was determined in the study subjects. Results: DASS-21 anxiety and total scores were higher in female patients than males. COVID-19 Fear Scale, DASS-21 anxiety, depression, and total scores were higher in married patients than single ones. Patients living in rural areas had higher Fear of COVID-19 scale, DASS-21, depression, and total scores and lower Life Satisfaction Scale scores compared to those living in city centers. Patients with any chronic illness and psychiatric disorder had higher COVID-19 Fear Scale, DASS-21 anxiety, and total scores. The presence of respiratory symptoms and positive CT pneumonia were closely associated with higher scale scores. Conclusions: We suggest that the COVID-19 outbreak seems to also affect patients psychologically. This influence is more in COVID-19 positive patients who were females, married, those living in rural areas, ones with chronic medical or psychiatric disorder, and ones with respiratory symptoms and positive CT findings. Future studies with face-to-face interviews are required to prove this observation further.","Karlidag, G. E.; Kantarcioglu, A.; Toraman, Z. A.; Balci, H.

"Anxiety, knowledge, attitude, and preventive practices toward COVID-19 among patients with psychiatric illness - A comparative study from South India","Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has induced serious threats to people's mental health. There are increasing concerns about anxiety linked with COVID-19. There are very few studies conducted to understand the needs of the mentally ill during this pandemic. Aim: The study aimed to assess and compare the anxiety, knowledge, attitude, and preventive practices related to COVID-19 among people with and without psychiatric illnesses. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted among patients with psychiatric illnesses and their caregivers in the psychiatry department of a tertiary hospital. All consenting adults with a diagnosed psychiatric illness and scoring &lt; 3 in the Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale were included in the case group. All consenting adult caregivers who accompany the patients were included in the reference group. Coronavirus Anxiety Scale and Knowledge, Attitude, and Preventive Practices towards COVID-19 Questionnaire were administered. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS (19.0 version). Results: Less than 10% of the participants in both the groups had COVID-related anxiety. 98.3% of the participants in both the groups knew that isolation and treatment of COVID-19-affected individuals can prevent the spread of the virus. Avoidance of handshaking (case - 85% and reference - 81.7%) and going out of home unnecessarily (case - 83.3% and reference - 81.7%) were the predominant preventive practices in both the groups. Only, the attitude had a statistically significant difference between both the groups (P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: Patients with psychiatric illness had fair knowledge, and they followed preventive practices toward COVID-19 that are comparable with healthy individuals. There were discrepancies between their knowledge and preventive practices.","Raghuraman, P.; Simiyon, M.; Rudravaram, V.

"Telecounseling and Guided Relaxation for Addressing Patient, Student, and Health-Care Worker Distress: An Experience & nbsp;","Introduction: In the face of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the leadership of the institute felt a need for mental health interventions among patients admitted in COVID-19 isolation, university students, and health-care workers engaged in COVID-19 care. This article aims to share our experience in providing these services. Methodology: COVID-19 inpatients were telephonically counseled. Counseling protocol was based on national guidelines. Students of the university were assessed for emotional problems using a symptom checklist and Kessler 10-item Distress Scale. Subsequently, the faculty assigned as mentors were trained in providing telephonic psychological first aid (PFA) to the students. Psychosocial help was offered to health-care workers through daily guided relaxation sessions. Results: Forty-two of 69 COVID-19 inpatients were telephonically contacted. New-onset mental health problems were found in 40%. Half of the COVID-19 confirmed patients and half of the females had a higher prevalence of mental health problems. On the symptom checklist, 330 students were responded. Worry about the future, contagion, and boredom were reported by the majority of students. On the Kessler 10-item Distress Scale, 272 students were responded. Thirty-seven percent had likely mental disorders (22 males and 79 females). Twenty-two students contacted psychiatrists through mentors and were provided teleconsultation. Eighty health-care workers attended guided relaxation sessions. Twenty-nine responded on the feedback form. Most respondents felt guided relaxation was useful in reducing stress, with strongly agree (n = 12) and agree (n = 14) responses. Conclusions: Emotional problems were significantly prevalent among students and COVID-19 patients. Training faculty in PFA can help address students in distress. Guided relaxation may help frontline workers manage stress.& nbsp;","Naik, S.; Prabhakaran, A.; Mahida, A.; Singh, S.

"Mental health problems in health-care workers of tertiary level COVID-19 care centers in Central India","Background: The health-care workers (HCWs) who are overburdened during the COVID-19 pandemic are at increased risk of developing psychological disorders. Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the magnitude of psychological problems such as depression, anxiety, and fear of COVID-19 among the HCWs and to study their correlates. Material and Methods: The study is an online multicentric cross-sectional survey of mental health problems in the HCWs of three tertiary level COVID care centers in Central India. HCWs were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7), and Fear of COVID-19 Scale. Results: Out of 467 HCWs assessed, 25.5% of the participants had depression (defined by PHQ-9 score of more than 5), whereas anxiety was present in 24.4% of the study subjects (defined by GAD-7 score of more than 5). Forty-six percent of the participants had medium-to-high levels of fear of COVID-19. Female gender, working in the nonclinical department, direct involvement in care of COVID-19 patients, perceived worsening of physical health status following the pandemic outbreak, and past history of psychiatric problem were the factors significantly associated with presence of depression as well as anxiety. Age of the participant had a positive correlation with fear of COVID-19 and a negative correlation with depression and anxiety levels. Conclusion: HCWs serving in COVID hospitals are vulnerable to develop mental health problems and appropriate screening measures and interventions should be designed so as to preserve mental health of this vital task force.","Mahajan, S.

"Managing a COVID-Positive Health-Care Worker with Recent Suicide Attempt through Telepsychiatry","COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as a major problem for the health-care workers (HCWs). Many HCWs are facing adverse psychological outcomes, during the COVID pandemic. HCWs are not only expected to carry out duties in COVID areas but are also expected to stay in isolation during the period of quarantine. Various models have been proposed to address the psychological issues in HCWs using telepsychiatry. However, there are no clear-cut guidelines, for managing people with suicidal behavior. In this report we present a HCW, diagnosed with recurrent depressive disorder, current episode severe depression without psychotic symptoms, who attempted self-harm and was shortly diagnosed with COVID-19 infection leading her to getting admitted in the COVID-19 ward. She was managed with supportive psychotherapy during her COVID ward stay through telepsychiatry.

"The mental health of the health care professionals in India during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in dramatic challenges to healthcare systems worldwide. There has been an increased awareness to protect frontline workers from COVID-19 exposure and its consequences. To assess the prevalence of healthcare professionals in India during the COVID-19, a cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted with healthcare professionals from medical colleges and hospitals from different states across the country. The study comprised 772 healthcare professionals aged &gt;= 18 years. The main outcome measures studied were anxiety, depression, and stress. Among the healthcare professionals, 37.17%, 33.68%, and 23.7% were reported to have anxiety, depression, and stress respectively. The physicians, female, aged population, and professionals sleeping less than 7 hours are more prone to psychological problems. The results of this study predict the high levels of anxiety, depression, and stress among healthcare professionals in different states of India. Increased COVID-19 cases, high pressure, workload, and lack of training are the main reasons for the psychological problems in healthcare professionals. Proper strategies must be followed in healthcare settings to reduce the burden of stress.","Nayak, B. S.; Surapaneni, K.; Sahu, P. K.; Bhoi, P.; Dhananjay, K. V.

"The Prevalence of Depression Symptoms among Pregnant Women during the Second Wave of COVID-19","BACKGROUND: Pregnant women are vulnerable to depression. We hypothesized that the COVID-19 pandemic would increase depression in pregnancy leading to complications to both mother and fetus. AIM: This study is aimed to identify antenatal depression symptoms during the second wave COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This was a community-based, cross-sectional study conducted from 10 to 21 June 2021. A number of 130 pregnant women were recruited through both convenience and snowball sampling. An online survey with self-administered Whooley questions was used to assess antenatal depression symptoms. RESULTS: We found elevated antenatal depression symptoms similar to other countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. The prevalence of pregnant women with depression symptoms was 42.3%. The majority of pregnant women who had antenatal depression symptoms had the following characteristics: About 44.75% lived outside Jakarta, 60% had low education (Junior high school and below), 42.9% aged 20â€“35 years, and 44.8% of them were housewives. CONCLUSION: In Indonesia, the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic affected increasing symptoms of depression among pregnant women. Positive protective factors should be taken to prevent negative impacts of both unidentified and untreated antenatal depression among the pregnant women for the sake of maternal and child health.","Sari, D.

"Is There Business Potential for Sustainable Shipping? Price Premiums Needed to Cover Decarbonized Transportation","The shipping sector is encountering remarkable costs concerning decarbonization of the maritime business. Both the International Maritime Organization and the European Union are developing tools to limit greenhouse gas emissions of shipping. Given all the tools and planned regulations, it seems that energy efficiency and cost cutting would be a feasible strategy of the future. However, in addition to cost cutting, shipping with net-zero or zero emission fuels might be a way to promote sustainable shipping services. A growing consumer segment is ready to pay for sustainability-marketed consumer goods, and it is possible that people would be ready to pay for net-zero or zero emission shipping as well. Our objective is to pinpoint, how big price premiums would be needed to cover the costs of shipping with sustainable, and typically more expensive, maritime fuels. We do this by calculating the amounts of fuel needed to ship specific good categories at first, and then we estimate the costs of shipping these goods with alternative fuels. We analyze Finnish maritime foreign trade during the year 2018, the time prior to the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. We estimate fuel consumption to the value and quantities of goods. Our findings indicate that a shift to low carbon and carbon neutral fuels would have a limited effect to the price of most goods.","Schwartz, Henry, Solakivi, Tomi, Gustafsson, Magnus","https://doi.org/10.3390/su14105888","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(10):5888, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32181,""
"Intolerance of Uncertainty and Risk Perception during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Mediating Role of Fear of COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic, a period of uncertainty and risk, has presented a threat to people's physical and mental health worldwide. Previous research has shown that pandemic-related uncertainty can contribute to individuals' psychological distress and coping responses. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and risk perception (i.e., individual's perceived likelihood of becoming infected both for themselves and people in one's own country and perceived severity of the infection), and the mediating role of fear of COVID-19. This two-wave longitudinal study (T1 = April 2020;T2 = May 2020) involved 486 young adults (age range = 18&ndash;29 years;Mage = 23.84 &plusmn;2.94). Participants provided demographic data as well as measures of intolerance of uncertainty, fear of COVID-19, and risk perception. Structural equation modeling showed that intolerance of uncertainty was indirectly related to risk perception through fear of COVID-19. The study confirms the central role of IU in fear management and, consequently, in determining individuals' risk estimates.","Graffeo, Maria Teresa, Albano, Gaia, Salerno, Laura, Di Blasi, Maria, Lo Coco, Gianluca","https://doi.org/10.3390/psych4020023","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psych; 4(2):269-276, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32182,""
"Cognitive Networks Extract Insights on COVID-19 Vaccines from English and Italian Popular Tweets: Anticipation, Logistics, Conspiracy and Loss of Trust","Monitoring social discourse about COVID-19 vaccines is key to understanding how large populations perceive vaccination campaigns. This work reconstructs how popular and trending posts framed semantically and emotionally COVID-19 vaccines on Twitter. We achieve this by merging natural language processing, cognitive network science and AI-based image analysis. We focus on 4765 unique popular tweets in English or Italian about COVID-19 vaccines between December 2020 and March 2021. One popular English tweet contained in our data set was liked around 495,000 times, highlighting how popular tweets could cognitively affect large parts of the population. We investigate both text and multimedia content in tweets and build a cognitive network of syntactic/semantic associations in messages, including emotional cues and pictures. This network representation indicates how online users linked ideas in social discourse and framed vaccines along specific semantic/emotional content. The English semantic frame of 'vaccine';was highly polarised between trust/anticipation (towards the vaccine as a scientific asset saving lives) and anger/sadness (mentioning critical issues with dose administering). Semantic associations with 'vaccine,';'hoax';and conspiratorial jargon indicated the persistence of conspiracy theories and vaccines in extremely popular English posts. Interestingly, these were absent in Italian messages. Popular tweets with images of people wearing face masks used language that lacked the trust and joy found in tweets showing people with no masks. This difference indicates a negative effect attributed to face-covering in social discourse. Behavioural analysis revealed a tendency for users to share content eliciting joy, sadness and disgust and to like sad messages less. Both patterns indicate an interplay between emotions and content diffusion beyond sentiment. After its suspension in mid-March 2021, 'AstraZeneca';was associated with trustful language driven by experts. After the deaths of a small number of vaccinated people in mid-March, popular Italian tweets framed 'vaccine';by crucially replacing earlier levels of trust with deep sadness. Our results stress how cognitive networks and innovative multimedia processing open new ways for reconstructing online perceptions about vaccines and trust.","Stella, Massimo, Vitevitch, Michael S.; Botta, Federico","https://doi.org/10.3390/bdcc6020052","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Big Data and Cognitive Computing; 6(2):52, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32183,""

"Real-world effectiveness of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for the treatment of hepatitis C virus in prison settings","Plain language summary Achievement of elimination of HCV as a major public health threat requires focus on vulnerable populations such as people in prison. The prison population is at high risk of HCV infection but their treatment is complicated by social issues such as mental health disorders and drug use. Simple and effective treatment regimens are required to increase access to treatment and improve cure rates. This real-world analysis across Europe and Canada analyzed data from 20 prison populations. HCV-infected individuals were treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, a once daily treatment which requires minimal monitoring. This regimen achieved high cure rates in the prison population despite the existence of complicating social issues. Background: People in prison are at high risk of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and often have a history of injection drug use and mental health disorders. Simple test-and-treat regimens which require minimal monitoring are critical. Methods: This integrated real-world analysis evaluated the effectiveness of once daily sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) in 20 prison cohorts across Europe and Canada. The primary outcome was sustained virological response (SVR) in the effectiveness population (EP), defined as patients with a valid SVR status. Secondary outcomes were reasons for not achieving SVR, adherence and time between HCV RNA diagnosis and SOF/VEL treatment. Results: Overall, 526 people in prison were included with 98.9% SVR achieved in the EP (n = 442). Cure rates were not compromised by drug use or existence of mental health disorders. Conclusion: SOF/VEL for 12 weeks is highly successful in prison settings and enables the implementation of a simple treatment algorithm in line with guideline recommendations and test-and-treat strategies.","Rosati, S.; Wong, A.; Di Marco, V.; Perez-Hernandez, P.; Macedo, G.; Brixko, C.; Ranieri, R.; Campanale, F.; Bascia, A.; Fernandez-Rodriguez, C.; de Ledinghen, V.; Maida, I.; Teti, E.; Mangia, A.; Vanstraelen, K.; Hernandez, C.; Mertens, M.; Ntalla, I.; Ramroth, H.; Jimenez, E.","https://doi.org/10.2217/fvl-2022-0016","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Future Virology;: 10, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32185,""
"Novel ecosystemic awareness: Singing-dancing-laughing with Earth","When was the last time you danced and sang together with other people, just for the joy of it? As the COVID pandemic exacerbates mental health issues, we are seeing also a rise in so-called eco-anxiety. Awareness of humans forming part of larger ecologies can no longer be ignored as a medically relevant topic. Can contemporary eco-somatic practices contribute to shifting eco-anxieties, and to shaping human awareness of ecosystemic diversity and embeddedness? Singing-dancing together are time-honoured ways of maintaining and restoring individual or group health and happiness, and engendering embeddedness. Drawing on research with egalitarian Baka groups in Central Africa and with shifting-sliding fascia connective tissues, the proposition made here is to activate singing-dancing-laughing, not only as a method of somatic vocal training or pedagogy, but also as a way o f shaping community and honouring ecosystemic nestedness.

"A PRISMA systematic review of adolescent gender dysphoria literature: (2) Mental health","It is unclear whether the literature on adolescent gender dysphoria (GD) provides sufficient evidence to inform clinical decision making adequately. In the second of a series of three papers, we sought to review published evidence systematically regarding the extent and nature of mental health problems recorded in adolescents presenting for clinical intervention for GD. Having searched PROSPERO and the Cochrane library for existing systematic reviews (and finding none), we searched Ovid Medline 1946-October week 4 2020, Embase 1947-present (updated daily), CINAHL 1983-2020, and PsycInfo 1914-2020. The final search was carried out on the 2nd November 2020 using a core strategy including search terms for 'adolescence' and 'gender dysphoria' which was adapted according to the structure of each database. Papers were excluded if they did not clearly report on clinically-likely gender dysphoria, if they were focused on adult populations, if they did not include original data (epidemiological, clinical, or survey) on adolescents (aged at least 12 and under 18 years), or if they were not peer-reviewed journal publications. From 6202 potentially relevant articles (post deduplication), 32 papers from 11 countries representing between 3000 and 4000 participants were included in our final sample. Most studies were observational cohort studies, usually using retrospective record review (21). A few compared cohorts to normative or population datasets;most (27) were published in the past 5 years. There was significant overlap of study samples (accounted for in our quantitative synthesis). All papers were rated by two reviewers using the Crowe Critical Appraisal Tool v1.4 (CCAT). The CCAT quality ratings ranged from 45% to 96%, with a mean of 81%. More than a third of the included studies emerged from two treatment centres: there was considerable sample overlap and it is unclear how representative these are of the adolescent GD community more broadly. Adolescents presenting for GD intervention experience a high rate of mental health problems, but study findings were diverse. Researchers and clinicians need to work together to improve the quality of assessment and research, not least in making studies more inclusive and ensuring long-term follow-up regardless of treatment uptake. Whole population studies using administrative datasets reporting on GD/gender non-conformity may be necessary, along with inter-disciplinary research evaluating the lived experience of adolescents with GD.","Thompson, L.; Sarovic, D.; Wilson, P.; Samfjord, A.; Gillberg, C.","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgph.0000426","","Database: CAB Abstracts; Publication type: article; Publication details: PLoS Global Public Health; 2(4), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32187,""
"Status of psychological health of students following the extended university closure in Bangladesh: results from a web-based cross-sectional study","Students' severe affective mental distress has emerged as significant public health attention globally because of the disastrous effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The current study aimed at exploring the prevalence of two alarming psychological distresses, depression and anxiety, among university students following a prolonged shutdown of educational institutions in Bangladesh. A cross-sectional online-based study was conducted by deploying two standard scales to assess the depression and anxiety among Bangladeshi students from various universities amid the 2nd stream of the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 568 Bangladeshi university students participated in this questionnaire-based survey through various social media platforms. Frequency and percentage distribution as univariate, chi-square (X2) test as bivariate, and logistic regression as multivariate analyses were applied to investigate the prevalence of depression and anxiety and their associated various sociodemographic factors. After cleaning and eliminating the partial data, we analyzed 465 responses, where 42% were female and 64.3% were from public universities. Both mental disorders were prevalent in more than 50% of Bangladeshi university students. The students from the private universities were two times and 2.7 times more depressed and anxious, respectively than the students from the public universities. In addition, the students who became incomeless had significantly more anxiety (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.711;p = 0.018) than those who did not lose income source during the COVID-19 lockdown.

"Staff perspectives on the impact of COVID 19 on the delivery of specialist domestic abuse services in the UK: a qualitative study","Domestic abuse is a significant public health issue effecting 2.4 million adults in England and Wales each year. In March 2020 the World Health Organisation declared a global pandemic following the outbreak of COVID-19. As a result, the UK moved to a period of lockdown. There is growing evidence that highlights the unintended negative consequences of lockdown, particularly in households where abuse is present. The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of frontline specialist domestic abuse staff who continued to support victims during the period of lockdown to understand the impact of COVID-19 on service delivery. Ten, one to one, semi structured qualitative interviews were carried out with staff from a specialist domestic abuse service that operates in regions across the north-east of England. All participants had been involved in service delivery for a minimum of 12 months prior to March 2020 and had continued to deliver services throughout the UK initial lockdown period between March and July 2020. Each interview was transcribed verbatim, anonymised, then subjected to thematic analysis. Six themes were developed from the data covering: emergency support for victims;wider service efficiencies;victim safety;group work versus one-to-one support;criminal and family courts;and workforce development. While lockdown resulted in increased levels and severity of referrals, the switch to remote working brought a range of service efficiencies including time and money saved by negating the need to travel. Remote working also enhanced support offered to male victims and those with mental health issues but not those in rural locations with poor connectivity and those effected by the digital divide. Services should not underestimate the long-term benefits of peer support both to clients and staffs.","Riddell, H.; Haighton, C.","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgph.0000310","","Database: CAB Abstracts; Publication type: article; Publication details: PLoS Global Public Health; 2(4), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32189,""
"Factors associated with antenatal depression in the Kingdom of Jordan during the COVID-19 pandemic","Fear of infection and measures taken to mitigate infection, such as social distancing, lockdown and isolation can lead to anxiety and depression across the life course, but especially in pregnancy. We set out to identify the prevalence of depression in pregnancy, using Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) during national quarantine and to examine women's knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) in regard to potential COVID-19-related depression. Following ethical approval, an observational design, with an online questionnaire and snowball sampling was used to recruit 546 pregnant women (231 primi and 315 multiparous) in Jordan via common social media platforms (facebook, WhatsApp). Over one third (36.7%) reported depressive symptoms. There were significantly lower depression scores among pregnant women who exhibited more knowledge about COVID-19 (in high [vs low] knowledge groups, mean EPDS = 10.8 [vs 12.2];p = 0.007). Depression scores were not significantly associated with attitude nor with practice. This suggests that enhanced knowledge levels may protect pregnant women against depression. Our findings contribute to understanding of the experience of pregnant women in developing countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare Professionals should provide health education to all pregnant women and timely services to pregnant women with depressive symptoms. This may lead to the prevention of serious symptoms and reduce negative consequences on the next generation, not only in Jordan, but worldwide.","Abujilban, S.; Mrayan, L.; Al-Obeisat, S.; Tanash, M.; Sinclair, M.; Kernohan, W.

"Socioeconomic predictors of COVID-19-related health disparities among United States workers: a structural equation modeling study","The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted the physical and mental health, and the economic stability, of specific population subgroups in different ways, deepening existing disparities. Essential workers have faced the greatest risk of exposure to COVID-19;women have been burdened by caretaking responsibilities;and rural residents have experienced healthcare access barriers. Each of these factors did not occur on their own. While most research has so far focused on individual factors related to COVID-19 disparities, few have explored the complex relationships between the multiple components of COVID-19 vulnerabilities. Using structural equation modeling on a sample of United States (U.S.) workers (N=2800), we aimed to (1) identify factor clusters that make up specific COVID-19 vulnerabilities, and (2) explore how these vulnerabilities affected specific subgroups, specifically essential workers, women and rural residents. We identified 3 COVID-19 vulnerabilities: financial, mental health, and healthcare access;9 out of 10 respondents experienced one;15% reported all three. Essential workers [standardized coefficient (beta)=0.23;unstandardized coefficient (B)=0.21, 95% CI=0.17, 0.24] and rural residents (beta=0.13;B=0.12, 95% CI=0.09, 0.16) experienced more financial vulnerability than non-essential workers and non-rural residents, respectively. Women (beta=0.22;B=0.65, 95% CI=0.65, 0.74) experienced worse mental health than men;whereas essential workers reported better mental health (beta=-0.08;B=-0.25, 95% CI=-0.38, -0.13) than other workers. Rural residents (beta=0.09;B=0.15, 95% CI=0.07, 0.24) experienced more healthcare access barriers than non-rural residents. Findings highlight how interrelated financial, mental health, and healthcare access vulnerabilities contribute to the disproportionate COVID-19-related burden among U.S. workers. Policies to secure employment conditions, including fixed income and paid sick leave, are urgently needed to mitigate pandemic-associated disparities.","Capasso, A.; Kim, SooYoung, Ali, S.

"COVID-19 Onset, Parental Status, and Psychological Distress among Full-time Employed Heterosexual Adults in Dual-earning Relationships: The Explanatory Role of Work-family Conflict and Guilt","We propose that the COVID-19 pandemic and the restrictions to daily life that followed had greater negative impact on the mental health, as measured by psychological distress, of employed parents than nonparents, because of an associated increase in both directions of work-family conflict and work-family guilt among this group of the population. To test this argument, we examined pooled data from two cross-sectional online surveys administered to heterosexual adults in dual-earning relationships living in the United States. The first data set was collected before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (N = 616), and the second data set was collected during the early months of the pandemic (N = 454). Results of multivariate analyses show that distress increased between the two surveys, but only among parents, as compared with nonparents, irrespective of gender of the respondent, or age of the youngest child. This association is due to a change in work-family conflict and guilt between the two surveys: among parents, the COVID-19 onset was associated with higher family-to-work conflict, work-to-family guilt, and family-to-work guilt;among nonparents the pandemic was associated with lower work-to-family conflict and work-to-family guilt. Our results suggest that the COVID-19 onset had contrasting effects on the lives of employed parents and nonparents.","Montazer, Shirin, Brumley, Krista M.; Pineault, Laura, Maguire, Katheryn, Baltes, Boris","https://doi.org/10.1177/21568693221096189","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: Society and Mental Health;: 21568693221096189, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32192,""

"Bingo was a No-Go!","Background: Social isolation increases the risk of developing mental health disorders or exacerbate underlying psychiatric conditions. In older adults, conditions such as severe depression can be confused for hypoactive delirium, prompting extensive medical work up and unnecessary treatments. Herein we describe an older adult who was repeatedly hospitalized for decreased responsiveness due to prolonged isolation in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic. Case: A 94 years-old -female with a history of sensorineural hearing loss and mixed dementia who was frequently transferred to the hospital when nursing staff was unable to arouse the patient upon repetitive physical and verbal stimulation. While no acute cause for her symptoms was revealed after each admission, a pattern emerged of frequent periods of unresponsiveness which only occurred upon return to her long-term care facility (LTCF). Initially, her symptoms were attributed to hypoactive delirium, but these would abate whenever she would have more frequent contact with healthcare staff or family members. On this admission, she was started on antidepressant medication and discharged back to her LTCF with the recommendation to utilize social activities and group interactions. Regrettably, she could not interact with others, play bingo, or have visitors at her facility due to strict quarantine policies. Ironically, the policies designed to prevent COVID-19 exposure ultimately accelerated her return to the hospital where the risk of exposure was much greater. Discussion: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic goes far beyond the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. There is significant collateral damage that social isolation has brought to the older adult population. This raises concerns about a fine balance between protecting from life-threatening illnesses while maintaining mental health and honoring human dignity. The enforcement of quarantining within LTCFs worsened an already fragile healthcare delivery system, resulting in a lack of communication, discontinuity of care, and inadequate attention to patients' basic needs and social supports. Conclusion: The impact of social isolation used to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among the older adult population in LTCFs cannot be ignored. More research is needed to assess the impact of isolation to help develop patient-centered, holistic treatment plans which prioritize quality of life alongside diagnostic evaluations and therapeutic interventions.","Warraich, F.

"The impact of spiritual leadership on workplace spirituality in the light the COVID-19 pandemic in the governmental health sector","Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine how the spiritual leadership (SL) of the leader is perceived by workers in the public health sector in the Assiut region of Egypt. In other words, this study investigates the work-related workplace spirituality (WPS) of public health workers in this context. Design/methodology/approach - An online survey was conducted among a sample of 333 employees working in the public health sector in Assiut. Findings - The empirical results indicate that the SL of the leader (especially altruism and vision), as evaluated by employees, positively influence work-related WPS. The results confirm that strengthening SL is a promising pathway to improve WPS, which may ultimately have some benefits, such as helping to improve individual and institutional performance in the public health sector. Originality/value - The authors hope that the theoretical insights gained through the findings of this study will encourage researchers to explore how and when to enhance SL and WPS for employees.","Mohammed, S.

"The effects of COVID-19 on intoxications in the pediatric emergency room","Objectives: The purpose of this study was to describe the impact of the pandemic on poisonings in children under 18 years of age who presented to a pediatric tertiary emergency department in Canada. Methodology: We used surveillance data from the Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (CHIRPP) to identify children who presented to the Hospital for Sick Children for intoxication during 2 time periods: pre-pandemic (March 11 to December 31, 2018, and 2019) and during the pandemic (March 11 to December 31, 2020). The primary endpoints were the change from total ED visits in the proportion of total intoxications, accidental intoxications, recreational drug use, and intentional self-harm. We also examined the variation between before and during the pandemic in the proportion of intoxications by age, sex, type of drug, and admission requirements. Results: The proportion to total ED visits significantly increased for total intoxication (122.5%), accidental intoxication (127.8%), recreational drug use (160%), and intentional intoxication (self-harm;104.2%). The proportion of all intoxication cases also increased significantly during the pandemic for cannabis (44.3%), vaping (134.6%), other recreational drugs (54.5%), multiple drug use (29.3%), and intoxication admissions (44.3%).Conclusion: Despite an overall decrease in ED visits during the pandemic, there was a significant increase from pre-pandemic levels in presentations for poisoning to our ED. Our results will help to better guide care delivery and public health interventions for pediatric poisonings.","Zhang, E. W.

"Is the Italian government debt sustainable? Scenarios after the Covid-19 shock","The sustainability of the Italian government debt has been under close scrutiny since the launch of the Euro Area, and even more so after the Global Financial Crisis. The Covid-19 crisis in 2020 has depressed the Italian economy further and negatively affected the government budget. Despite the rebound in 2021, the state of the economy and government debt in Italy remain precarious. Building on Pasinetti's work, this paper examines the sustainability of the Italian government debt through a medium-scale, stock-flow consistent, structural macroeconometric model. The model has been coded and calibrated using the R package Bimets developed by the Bank of Italy. Our findings show that the Italian government debt is unlikely to enter a sustainable trajectory in the next few years. While the Next Generation EU and the other fiscal and monetary measures are helping the Italian economy to recover, in the coming years, a greater effort on the part of the European authorities-including an intervention of the ECB in controlling the yield curve-seems necessary to stabilize the debt to GDP ratio in Italy.","Canelli, R.; Fontana, G.; Realfonzo, R.; Passarella, M.

"Cross-National Study of Mental Health and Employment Status Nine Months Post Social Distancing Implementation Practices","This cross-national study (Norway, the UK, the USA and Australia) examined the mental health between those individuals working and not working nine months post initial COVID-19 social distancing implementation. The sample (N=3,474) was recruited through social media (e.g. Facebook, Twitter). Respondents completed an online survey in October/November 2020. Individuals who were working were significantly more likely to experience better mental health, were younger, report high levels of education and significantly less likely to worry about their own situation, health or financial situation than individuals who were not working. If individuals were retired, they reported better mental health than individuals who were not working for other reasons (e.g. laid off/dismissed, receiving benefits, studying). Based on the findings of this study social workers and other health service providers need to address ways to enhance mental health services especially for individuals who are not working when social distancing protocols are in place.

"Prevalence of Child Maltreatment during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-sectional Survey of Rural Hubei, China","The prevalence of child maltreatment is quite high during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in rural Hubei province, and children from vulnerable families are at greater risk of self-harm behaviours. The impact of lockdown measures in Wuhan, China during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on child maltreatment remains unknown. The present study attempted to estimate the prevalence of child maltreatment during this period, to identify risk factors, and the influence of child maltreatment. A representative sample of 1,062 school-aged children in rural Hubei province was surveyed. Results indicated that the prevalence of family violence, physical violence, emotional abuse and neglect during the lockdown period were 13.9, 13.7, 20.2 and 7.3 percent, respectively, and that of lifetime prevalence were 17.0, 13.9, 14.6 and 6.9 percent, respectively. And most victims did not seek official help. Boys were more likely to experience physical violence. Children from separated/divorced families tended to report more emotional abuse. Those having family members with a history of drug abuse and mental illness were more likely to experience neglect during the lockdown period. All types of child maltreatment were positively associated with self-harm behaviours. These findings highlight the importance of identifying at-risk children immediately and implementing timely intervention programmes to prevent self-harm behaviours for social workers and health professionals.","Zhang, H.

"Psychological distress of COVID-19: using a positive psychology approach for mental health promotion in the general population","<U+03A4>he present study aimed to generate evidence on the role of core elements of positive psychology interventions (PPIs) such as empathy, resilience, gratitude and hope in mitigating the psychological distress of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (NÂ =Â 203) were recruited from the island of Ireland (mean ageÂ =Â 37.7Â years, Â± 13.2) and completed an online questionnaire including measures of resilience, hope, gratitude, empathy, depression, stress, anxiety and the subjective distress of COVID-19. A four-step hierarchical regression model was applied. Resilience showed positive significant correlations with gratitude, hope and empathy. Age, gender, presence/absence of a chronic health condition (CHC) and country of residence were not predictors of the subjective distress of COVID-19. Resilience and empathy were a negative and a positive predictor of the subjective distress respectively, while gratitude and hope had no predictive value in this model. Upon adding depression, stress and anxiety, the explained variance in scores of the distress of COVID-19 increased considerably from 16% to 55%. Individuals who experience higher levels of depression and anxiety without necessarily the presence of a CHC and regardless of age, gender, and country of residence, may be more susceptible to experience the subjective distress of COVID-19. These findings can be used to inform the design and delivery of PPIs either as a public health prevention measure or as a treatment programme within a broader context of a public mental health promotion strategy to tackle the psychological impact of this pandemic in adults of the general population.

"The impact of the COVID-19 restrictions on nursing home residents: An occupational perspective","Background: In Ireland, stringent restrictions were implemented to protect nursing home residents from contracting COVID-19. There is limited empirical research on how restrictions impacted residents' occupational engagement or well-being. This study explored the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on the occupational engagement of nursing home residents and considered implications for occupational science. Methods: Using qualitative descriptive design, semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with five residents in one nursing home. Two online focus groups were conducted with seven nursing home staff working across five sites. Data were analysed using interpretive thematic analysis. Results: Three overarching themes emerged regarding residents' occupational engagement. 'Loss of valued occupation' related to residents' reduced engagement in social and leisure occupations, with an erosion of the quality and meaning of their routine daily activities. 'Counting the costs of restrictions on residents' well-being' revealed profound impacts on residents' physical and mental health, including reduced mobility, weight loss, reduced independence, low mood and increased fear, anxiety, and frustration. 'Finding resilience in the face of adversity' indicated some hopeful adaptive and coping strategies among residents. Conclusions and implications: This study brings an occupational perspective to the impact of COVID-19 on nursing home residents by highlighting issues beyond infection control and virus transmission. Findings contribute to occupational science knowledge by highlighting issues of occupational deprivation, occupational disruption and reduced occupational choice, and ripple effects on well-being. Nursing home residents' perspectives must be prioritised in future research and policy decision-making in responding and adapting to pandemics.","Richardson, G.; Cleary, R.; Usher, R.","https://doi.org/10.1080/14427591.2022.2066158","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Occupational Science;: 16, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32204,""
"Risk Spillover of Global Treasury Bond Markets in the Time of COVID-19 Pandemic","We employ the state-dependent local projection method to identify the dynamic risk aggravation effects on Treasury market volatilities and risk spillovers under both local and global COVID-19 pandemic shocks. We find that emerging markets suffer more instability as risk receivers during the pandemic. Local pandemic shock sharpens the risk spillover mainly in the short run, especially when global risk is high, while global pandemic shock aggravates spillover in the medium run led by economic depression expectations. The results are not only helpful to encourage governments to deepen cooperation in combating the pandemic but also alert authorities to pay more attention to imported financial risk.","Fang, Y.; Wang, Y.

"Virtual reality for surgical planning, training and patient engagement in the field of congenital heart disease: a single centre experience","Introduction: The treatment of congenital heart disease (CHD) is complex and often requires a personalised approach involving several surgical interventions. Despite advancements in imaging, understandingCHDin 3D can still be a major challenge, especially for atypical cases spanning multiple pathologies. Virtual reality (VR) is a rapidly growing technology allowing the user to be completely immersed within a simulated environment. At our centre, we pioneered the use of VR for CHD to: (i) aid surgical planning (ii) enhance teaching and (iii) improve patient communication. Methods: A VR application has been designed in house specifically to meet these aims over the last year at our centre. The VR software allows the user to import multiple models of patient-specific anatomies reconstructed from medical images. The application uses a commercial headset with controllers to allow the user to interact with the virtual heart. Different tools were implemented to help the planning (measuring, cutting, device interaction), improve teaching (labelling, ultrasound simulators, multi-user experiences) and patient engagement (labelling, colours, splitting). The development was a collaborative process between clinicans, engineers and educators, allowing for tailored tools to be developed to address the clinical/educational needs. Results: In clinical practice, our VR app was successfully used for planning more than 20 cases, including: (i) double-outlet right ventricle repairs (ii) aortic root replacements for Marfan syndrome (iii) percutaneous pulmonary valve implantations (iv) stenting of pulmonary arteries. In an educational setting, VR has been routinely added to a specialised cardiac morphology course for healthcare professionals, over 90% of whom found it â€œextremely/very usefulâ€ in aiding their understanding of CHD. In addition, it was implemented in an undergraduate course during COVID- 19 to support remote learning, with the use of online multi-user teaching. Over the course of two years, more than 100 students were taught using VR. Finally, our app was found to be particularly engaging by patients and their families in understanding the complexity of CHD during public events held at our Centre. Conclusions: Our preliminary research with in-house developed VR software showed how this can be used in facilitating the understanding of CHD for treatment planning, education and communication.","Pajaziti, E.; Milano, E.; Schievano, S.; Khambadkone, S.; Kostolny, M.; Marek, J.; Cook, A.; Capelli, C.","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1047951122000087","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Cardiology in the Young; 32(SUPPL 1):S41-S42, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32206,""
"The impact of US presidents on market returns: Evidence from Trump's tweets","We analyze President Trumpâ€™s Twitter posts on the COVID-19 pandemic to quantitatively construct his sentiment proxy to examine its predictive power in industry-level equity returns. With the growing influence of social media, some â€œspecialâ€ people have been able to use their celebrity status for wielding significant market influence, thereby causing a new modern crisis. This study parsed words from 2,574 tweets from President Trumpâ€™s Twitter account to explore the predictive power of his sentiments on the US market during the pandemic. After controlling for rigorous factors, result shows that an industry-level negative tone in general content is unlikely to be predictive of stock returns. Furthermore, the consumer goods industry exhibited a negative return when Trump displayed a negative attitude toward the pandemic. Industries adversely affected by the pandemic because of travel restrictions, consumption shocks, and public health issues are statistically correlated with Trumpâ€™s negative tone on the pandemic.","Pham, Duong Phuong Thao, Quang, Anh Huynh Ngoc, Duong, Duy","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ribaf.2022.101681","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Research in International Business and Finance;: 101681, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32207,""
"En temps dâ€™Ã©pidÃ©mie et de vie ordinaireÂ : le monde de la vieillesse dans lâ€™Å“uvre dâ€™Albert Camus","RÃ©sumÃ© En rÃ©ponse Ã  lâ€™absurditÃ© du monde, Albert Camus a souhaitÃ© que la rÃ©volte nâ€™enferme pas les Ãªtres humains dans la passivitÃ© mais les porte Ã  agir pour dÃ©fendre la libertÃ©, la justice et pour soulager les souffrances. Camus a souhaitÃ© ainsi illustrer dans ses Å“uvres une Ã©thique de la comprÃ©hension. Le roman La Peste raconte une Ã©pidÃ©mie sâ€™abattant sur une ville et qui dÃ©cime toutes les gÃ©nÃ©rations. Quâ€™en fut-il alors de la place des personnes Ã¢gÃ©es dans ce drameÂ ? Lâ€™expÃ©rience de la pandÃ©mie Ã  SARS-CoV-2Â qui, elle, a frappÃ© Ã©lectivement les personnes Ã¢gÃ©es incitait Ã  explorer cette question qui, au-delÃ  de la pandÃ©mie, questionne sur la vision dâ€™une sociÃ©tÃ© sur les personnes Ã¢gÃ©es et sur les relations intergÃ©nÃ©rationnelles. Il Ã©tait alors tentant de parcourir lâ€™ensemble de lâ€™Å“uvre de Camus pour sâ€™interroger sur le regard quâ€™il portait sur les vieux, lui, rÃ©voltÃ© contre un monde absurde mais soucieux de rÃ©sister, lui qui faisait dire au Docteur Rieux, parcourant la ville pour visiter ses malades, quâ€™un monde sans amour Ã©tait comme un monde mort. Le regard que porte Camus sur les vieux et les vieilles mÃ©rite dâ€™Ãªtre mÃ©ditÃ© dans le monde dâ€™aujourdâ€™hui. Summary In reaction to the absurdity of the world, Albert Camus hoped that revolt would not imprison human beings in passivity but would lead them to act in defence of freedom, justice and the relief of suffering. Camus thus aimed in his writings to set out â€œan ethic of understandingâ€. His novel The Plague tells of an epidemic that strikes a city and decimates all generations. What was the place of the elderly in this catastrophe? The experience of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which mainly affected the elderly, prompted us to explore this issue, which, beyond the pandemic, raises questions about a society's view of the elderly and about intergenerational relationships. It was then tempting to peruse the whole of Camus's writings and to explore the way he viewed the elderly - he who rose up against an absurd world but was intent on resisting it, he who had Doctor Rieux, visiting his patients across the city, say that a world without love was like a dead world. Camusâ€™ view of old people deserves to be pondered in today's world.","Gil, R.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.npg.2022.02.005","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: NPG Neurologie - Psychiatrie - GÃ©riatrie;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32208,""
"The impact of COVID-19 on people with multiple sclerosis: A comparison of Italian and United States cohorts","Background/Objectives The present cross-national study addressed the relationship among three pandemic-related variables and multiple sclerosis (MS) disability outcomes among people with MS in Italy and the United States (US). Methods This cross-sectional web-based study was administered to 708 patients with MS from the US and Italy in late Spring through mid-Summer of 2020. Pandemic-related variables assessed worry, self-protection, and post-traumatic growth. The Performance ScalesÂ© assessed MS disability. Multivariate multiple regression models addressed, separately by country, the relationship among worry, protection, and post-traumatic growth with MS disability, after covariate adjustment. Results The Italian sample (n=292) was younger and less disabled than the US group (n=416). After covariate adjustment, all three pandemic-related variables were associated with MS disability outcomes in the US sample, but only worry and post-traumatic growth were associated in the Italian sample. Worse cognitive and depression symptoms were associated with worry, and lesser mobility disability was associated with endorsed growth in both countries. More disability variables were associated with worry and growth in the Italian sample. Conclusions The pandemic's negative aspects were associated with worse disability in both countries, and reported post-traumatic growth was associated with lesser disability. These findings may suggest directions for clinical intervention.","Schwartz, Carolyn E.; Rapkin, Bruce D.; Bonavita, Simona, Bossa, Michela, Buscarinu, Maria Chiara, Grasso, Maria Grazia, Luca, Maria, Nozzolillo, Agostino, Nocentini, Ugo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2022.103888","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders;: 103888, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32209,""
"Behavioural activation in nursing homes to treat depression (BAN-Dep): Results from a clustered, randomised, single-blinded, controlled clinical trial","Objectives To determine if behavioural activation (BA) delivered by trained staff decreases prevalence of clinically significant symptoms of depression among older adults living in residential aged care facilities (RACFs). Methods Clustered, randomised, single-blinded, controlled trial of BA for adults aged over 60 years living permanently in a RACF with symptoms of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9 = 5). BA was delivered over 8-12 weeks using a structured workbook. The proportion of residents with PHQ-9 = 10 at weeks 12, 26 and 52, as well as anxiety symptoms (GAD-7), physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) quality of life, loneliness, and loss to follow-up were main outcomes of interest Results We recruited 54 RACFs (26 intervention) and 188 of their residents (89 intervention). Participants were aged 61-100 years and 132 (70.2%) were women. PHQ-9 = 10 interacted with BA at week 12 (OR=0.34, 95%CI=0.11-1.07), but differences between the groups were not statistically significant at any time-point. GAD-7 = 10 interacted with BA at week 26 (OR=0.12, 95%CI=0.02-0.58), but not at any other time-point. Overall, the intervention had no effect on the scores of the PHQ-9, GAD-7, PCS, MCS, and loneliness scale. Loss to follow-up was similar between groups. Adherence to all stages of the intervention was poor (36.2%). Conclusions Disruption by the COVID-19 pandemic and staffing issues in RACFs undermined recruitment and adherence. In such a context, a BA program delivered by RACF staff was not associated with better mental health outcomes for residents over 52 weeks.","Almeida, Osvaldo P.; Patel, Hema, Velasquez, Diana, Kelly, Rachael, Lai, Rhoda, Ford, Andrew H.; Curran, Eleanor, Flicker, Leon, Chong, Terence W.

"Mental health problems, digital aging, and risk mitigation in the older people with liver disease","Introduction: Indonesia is entering an aging society with an older people population reaching 26.82 million people (9.92%) of the total population in 2020 and it will be one-fifth in 2045. The senior citizen is the covid-19 most at risk due to comorbidities and low digital literacy. Liver disease is one of the highest comorbid factors in increasing the risk of death by 13.5 times and increasing to 16.8 times in the elderly due to COVID-19 (Indonesian Covid-19 Task Force, 2020) This condition increases the aging market in Indonesia but low digital literacy will affect the lower QoL. Method: Using data from the 2014 Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS), this study aims to analyze mental health problems and mobile phone ownership in older adults (60+) with Liver disease. Result: The analysis shows that older people with liver disease reach 4,07% and 59,18% are male. 57,5% of them experienced mental health problems and the percentage is higher in men. However, the percentage of elderly with liver disease experiencing mental health problems will decrease by 6,78% when they have a cellphone. The elderly SES in Indonesia has a fairly diverse distribution between provinces. As much as 46,6% of the elderly with liver disease have mobile phones and 55,8% of them are still working. Nearly half of older peopleâ€™s education attainment is elementary school, which reaches 46.05 percent. In general, the elderly with higher digital literacy prefer to seek treatment at a formal health facility than traditional practitioners (shamans). They tend to seek outpatient care treatment at a community health center or Puskesmas (44,11%), specialist (29,41%), and private hospital (11,76%). Conclusion: Increasing digital aging encourages elderly health literacy, as well as decreasing mental health problems. Mainstreaming the digital aging issue can help various information and services needed by the elderly to be healthier, independent, and with dignity.","Pebrianti Purba, R.

"Effectiveness of ketofol versus propofol induction on hemodynamic profiles in adult elective surgical patients: A Randomized Controlled Trial","Background: Most of the time propofol and ketamine have been used as an induction agent in adult surgical patients but propofol may cause cardiorespiratory depression while ketamine increases heart rate and arterial blood pressure. On the other hand, the clinical effects of propofol and ketamine seem to be complementary. Ketofol is most commonly used for procedural sedation hence exploring its effectiveness for induction will be paramount for the clinical care of surgical patients. Objective: This study aims to compare the hemodynamic changes between ketofol and propofol within 30 min after induction of general anesthesia for elective surgical patients. Methodology: A Double-blind Randomized Controlled Trial was done on 62 patients aged between 18 and 65 years and the American Society of Anesthesiologist class I & II those have been allocated randomly into ketofol and propofol groups. A change in systolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, and heart rate within 30mins was followed for both groups. After the normal distribution of data was tested analytic statistics were calculated for variables in the study using Mixed ANOVA, Independent samples T-test, and Mann Whitney U test as appropriate, and for categorical data Chi-square test or fisher's exact test was used for analysis. P-value &lt; 0.05 is considered statistically significant with a power of 90%. Results: Both the mean systolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure were significantly decreased in the propofol group immediately after induction, at 5th minute, 10th minute, and 15th minute compared to the baseline value with a statistically significant value of (p &lt; 0.05). There was a significant increase in mean heart rate in the ketofol group immediately after induction and on the 5th minute after induction compared to the baseline value (p = 0.001 and p = 0.022 respectively). Conclusion and recommendations: We conclude the administration of ketofol (0.75 mg/kg of ketamine and 1.5 mg/kg of propofol) for induction of general anesthesia has better hemodynamic stability than propofol during the first 30 min after induction. We recommend to researchers to do further randomize controlled trials, with invasive blood pressure measurement and multicenter study.","Hailu, S.; Getachew, H.; Hailu, S.; Abebe, T.; Seifu, A.; Regassa, T.; Girma, T.; Dastew, B.; Zemedkun, A.; Neme, D.; Teshome, D.; Tadesse, M.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijso.2021.100392","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Surgery Open; 37, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32212,""
"A 59-year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus with severe neuropsychiatric manifestations due to COVID-19 infection","Introduction: Hyperglycemia in diabetes patients is associated with an increased risk for neuropsychiatric complications. SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 is a serious pathogen with further exacerbation of neurological manifestations in patients with diabetes with a high risk for morbidity and mortality. Case Description: We present a case of a 59-year-old man with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (T2DM) for 16 years, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. His recent hemoglobin A1c is 7.9%. Past psychiatric history includes well-controlled anxiety and depression. He suddenly developed lethargy, excessive sleepiness, forgetfulness, confusion, and altered behavior. He tested positive for COVID-19 despite having received two doses of the vaccine a few months earlier but he did not develop respiratory symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging study findings were largely suggestive of a global infectious or inflammatory process. He is improving overall but continues to have neurological deficits including weakness on the right side of his body and altered mood. Currently, he has social, economic, and psychological burdens from his ailment. Discussion: A literature review revealed variable presentation of neurological manifestations in patients with COVID-19 infection. T2DM patients have higher rates of anxiety and depression scores as well as a higher risk of developing Parkinsonâ€™s disease and Alzheimerâ€™s dementia as compared to non-diabetic individuals. Studies suggest that in T2DM patients with long-term hyperglycemia, the coronavirus binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme -2 (ACE2) receptors which may exacerbate the development of neuropsychiatric disorders via direct tissue injury, viral entry to neuronal pathways, hypoxia, and immune response. We conclude that patients with diabetes are susceptible to further brain injury with COVID-19 viral infection with a higher risk of morbidity and mortality. We stress the importance of COVID-19 vaccination in all diabetic patients.","Iturburu, A.; Pradhan, K.; Phudong, A.; Rahima, M.

"Utilizing a Quality of Life (QOL) Tool to Examine the Presence of Fatigue in Subjects with Diabetes Mellitus","Objective: Chronic fatigue significantly affects the aging population, especially individuals with chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus (DM). Patients with DM experience a range of comorbidities and complications that may impact quality of life (QOL). Current QOL tools are not specific to problems associated with diabetes and aging. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of DM on fatigue using the Norfolk QOL-Fatigue (QOL-F), a 35-item validated questionnaire sensitive to physical, cognitive and emotional aspects of fatigue. We hypothesize that cognitive and physical measures of fatigue are increased in DM patients. Methods: Subjects 18 to 79 years old, with type 1 or 2 DM from Hampton Roads, Virginia were recruited. Participants were administered the Norfolk QOL-F questionnaire, both in person and, during the COVID pandemic, online through Redcap survey interface. The questionnaire is divided into 5 domains (physical and cognitive problems from fatigue, subjective fatigue, reduced regular activities, activities of daily life (ADLs) and depression). Demographic and clinical information were collected. Participants with DM were compared with matched healthy controls (HC). Presence of neuropathy was assessed with the validated Norfolk QOL-Diabetic Neuropathy (DN) questionnaire. Results: Four hundred DM and 80 age, gender and race matched HC subjects were included. DM subjects had higher BMI (32.23Â±7.77 vs. 29.02Â±5.17 p=0.0011). DM participants reported significantly higher QOL-F scores (50.01Â±28.59 vs. 25.42Â±19.32 p&lt; 0.0001). These differences were observed in all domains of the QOL-F (p&lt; 0.0001 for all comparisons). Within the DM group, participants with DN where significantly more fatigued than those without DN (59.25Â±26.87 vs 27.65Â±18.59 p&lt; 0.0001). These differences were observed in all fatigue domains. On multivariate regression analysis, only younger age and female gender were correlated with higher fatigue scores. Subjects interviewed after COVID pandemic were significantly more fatigued than subjects interviewed before the pandemic. However, these two groups were not well matched. Discussion/Conclusion: This study shows that the Norfolk QOL-F questionnaire can identify increased levels of fatigue in patients with chronic diseases such as DM. This may be especially relevant to physicians as they address the main concerns of this patient population, including physical limitations, disruption of ADLs and depression. Paradoxically, older subjects reported better fatigue scores. Potential explanations include differences in perception of fatigue symptoms and generational differences in everyday responsibilities and life stressors. These findings warrant further investigation.","Casellini, C.; Bard, J.; Forte, S.; Ingram, A.; Pettaway, J.; Sears, T.; Siraj, E.; Wintringham, J.; Parson, H.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eprac.2022.03.104","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Endocrine Practice; 28(5):S38, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32214,""
"Buprenorphine Implementation at Syringe Service Programs following Waiver of the Ryan Haight Act in the United States","Introduction Among people with an opioid use disorder in the United States, only 10% receive buprenorphine treatment. The Ryan Haight Act is a federal law that has regulated buprenorphine delivery, requiring an in-person examination between a patient and provider before initiating treatment. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, federal agencies waived in-person examination requirements for buprenorphine treatment initiation. We examined whether Ryan Haight Act waiver improved implementation of telehealth buprenorphine within syringe service programs (SSPs) â€“ organizations that serve people with historically low access to treatment. Methods We surveyed all known SSPs operating in the US in 2021 (N=421) of which 77% responded (n=325). We calculated the prevalence and accompanying 95% confidence intervals (CI) for implementation of telehealth buprenorphine inductions at SSPs in 2020. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess differences in implementing telehealth buprenorphine inductions by organizational characteristics. Results In 2020, the prevalence of implementing buprenorphine inductions via telehealth was 24% (95% CI:19-30%). Non-governmental SSPs had a higher odds of telehealth buprenorphine inductions (adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=2.92;95% CI:1.22-7.00;p=0.016), compared to governmental SSPs. Furthermore, the larger the organizationâ€™s annual budget, the higher the odds of telehealth buprenorphine implementation (aOR=2.00 per quartile (95% CI:1.33-2.99;p=0.001). SSPs located in states with higher opioid overdose mortality rates did not have significantly higher likelihood of telehealth buprenorphine implementation. Conclusion A substantial number of SSPs implemented telehealth buprenorphine after waiver of the Ryan Haight Act. Permanent adoption of this waiver will be critical and providing financial resources to SSPs is vital to support implementation of new innovations.","Lambdin, Barrot H.; Bluthenthal, Ricky N.; Tookes, Hansel E.; Wenger, Lynn, Morris, Terry, LaKosky, Paul, Kral, Alex H.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2022.109504","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Drug and Alcohol Dependence;: 109504, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32215,""
"Cancer during a pandemic: A psychosocial telehealth intervention for young adults","The SARS-II COVID-19 pandemic has posed pronounced global health threats and prompted assorted transformations in societal engagement and clinical service delivery. For cancer survivors, many of whom are immune-compromised, these pandemic-related health threats pose greater challenges, warranting extra precautions within everyday living. Young adult (YA) cancer survivors already confront many unique physical and emotional challenges specific to their demographic. Already comfortable with assorted technologies, the pandemic presented an opportunity to provide virtual intervention that targeted social isolation and distress in an effort to facilitate healthy coping. Within this context, we created an 8-week virtual intervention for YAs (age 18-39) comprised of 60-minute sessions with interventions derived from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and Meaning-Centered Psychotherapy. Participants reported a reduction in anxious preoccupation, helplessness/hopelessness, and psychological inflexibility and provided rich qualitative feedback on their experiences.

"A two-week gaming abstinence reduces Internet Gaming Disorder and improves mental health: An experimental longitudinal intervention study","Since the COVID-19 outbreak, digital gaming has become a welcome pastime and distraction for many people. However, this phenomenon can have severe consequences;intensive digital gaming can foster the Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) and negatively affect mental health. The present experimental longitudinal study investigated the consequences of a conscious abstinence from gaming in a German sample. The experimental group (NÂ =Â 131;age: MÂ =Â 26.21, SDÂ =Â 7.70) did not engage in gaming for two weeks;the control group (NÂ =Â 140;age: MÂ =Â 25.10, SDÂ =Â 4.94) maintained its gaming time and habits. Gaming-related variables and mental health-related variables were assessed via online surveys at five measurement time points (baseline, intermediate status, post-intervention, one-month follow-up, three-month follow-up). The intervention significantly reduced gaming time, gaming flow, IGD, daily stress, and anxiety symptoms. Moreover, we found a significant improvement in positive mental health. The effects were stable over the three months of the investigation. Thus, we could show that a conscious and controlled, short-term abstinence from gaming leads to reduced IGD and a better mental health. The present results emphasize that conscious periods of gaming abstinence could be an effective step in the clinical context and in mental health prevention programs, especially during a pandemic such as the COVID-19 outbreak.","Brailovskaia, Julia, Meier-Faust, Julius, Schillack, Holger, Margraf, JÃ¼rgen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2022.107334","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Computers in Human Behavior; 134:107334, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32217,""
"Prenatal maternal distress during the COVID-19 pandemic and associations with infant brain connectivity","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has caused substantially elevated distress in pregnant individuals, which has the potential to impact the developing infant brain. Our main objective was to understand how prenatal distress was related to infant brain structure and function, and whether social support moderated the associations. Methods This Pregnancy during the COVID-19 Pandemic cohort study collected Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System anxiety, Edinburgh Depression Scale, and Social Support Effectiveness Questionnaire from a population-based sample of pregnant individuals living in Canada (N=8602). For a sub-sample of participants, their infants (N=75) underwent MRI at 3-months of age to examine whether prenatal maternal distress was associated with infant brain architecture, including the role of social support as a potential protective factor. Results 33.4% participants demonstrating clinically elevated depression symptoms and 47.1% of participants demonstrating clinically elevated anxiety symptoms. Importantly, we identified lower social support significantly predicts clinically elevated prenatal maternal distress (T=-22.3, p&lt;0.001). After image quality control, we retained 63 image datasets (40M/23F, 92+/-14 days old). We found significant relationships between prenatal maternal distress and infant amygdala-prefrontal microstructural and functional connectivity measures, and demonstrate for the first time that social support moderates these relationships. Conclusions Our findings suggest a potentially long-lasting impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and show that social support acts as a possible mediator not just for pregnant individuals, but also developing infants. These findings provide timely evidence to inform clinical practice and policy surrounding the care of pregnant individuals and highlight the importance of social support.","Manning, Kathryn Y.; Long, Xiangyu, Watts, Dana, Tomfohr-Madsen, Lianne, Giesbrecht, Gerald F.; Lebel, Catherine","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2022.05.011","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Biological Psychiatry;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32218,""
"Coping with COVID-19 in Patients with Lung Cancer","Background/Purpose: Prior to the pandemic, patients with lung cancer commonly experienced stigmatization, high symptom burden, and unmet supportive care needs, placing them at increased risk for psychosocial morbidities during COVID-19. These risks necessitate investigation into how lung cancer patients have been coping during the pandemic. Methods: This study investigated COVID-19-related burden and behavioral coping utilized by 65 lung cancer patients receiving treatment at an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center between August 2020 and June 2021. Measurements included selfreport demographics, COVID-19 burden (Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic in Cancer Survivors Questionnaire, Penedo et al., 2020), psychosocial well-being (PROMIS Anxiety4a and Depression4a), and coping strategies (Brief COPE, Carver 1997). Results: Most participants identified as female (n = 43), non- Hispanic White (n = 53), partnered (n = 38), and diagnosed with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (n = 45);and most reported feeling anxious about contracting COVID-19 (n = 38;58.5%) and concerned that their cancer status increased their risk of dying (n = 47;72.3%). However, average PROMIS T-scores for anxiety (M = 53.59, SD = 9.05) and depression (M = 51.19, SD = 8.30) were similar to normed national averages. Participants primarily endorsed acceptance, active coping, and the use of emotional support coping strategies. Higher total COVID-19 burden was associated with greater use of venting, behavioral disengagement, and self-blame coping strategies. Higher total COVID-19 burden was associated with greater anxiety (r = 0.489;p &lt; 0.001) and depression (r = 0.414;p &lt; 0.001). Greater anxiety was associated with higher use of religion, venting, denial, substance use, and selfblame coping strategies. Greater depression was associated with greater reliance on instrumental support, venting, denial, substance use, and self-blame strategies. Conclusions and Implications: Participants recognized their heightened risks and utilized effective coping strategies during COVID-19. Use of acceptance, active coping, and emotional support may impact lung cancer patients' appraisals of COVID-19 and psychosocial wellbeing.","Ver Hoeve, E.; Price, S.; Torres, T.; Hamann, H.; Garland, L.","https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.5872","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psycho-Oncology; 31(SUPPL 1):101, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32219,""

"Profiles of Resilience and Risk in Chronic Pain: Loneliness, Mindfulness, and Optimism Coming Out of the Pandemic","Individuals experience variable degrees of severity and interference from chronic pain. While clinical diagnosis and pain symptomology may importantly inform treatment options, person-level characteristics may also impact treatment efficacy. The biopsychosocial model of pain includes several pain-modulatory factors which may inform meaningful categorization, or clustering, of individuals with chronic pain, and help predict pain outcomes. In this observational, longitudinal study conducted approximately shortly after the onset of social distancing, patients with chronic pain (N=94) completed validated assessments of known psychosocial (depression, stress, sleep, catastrophizing) pain modulators and pain intensity, which were used to empirically cluster patients into 3 groups using a two-step hierarchical approach. Subsequently, at 1 year later, degree of pain interference, loneliness, social support, mindfulness, and optimism were compared between these 3 groups using ANOVAs. Participants clustered empirically into three groups: 1) Global Elevation Symptoms (GES), characterized by high psychological distress and moderate pain intensity;2) Pain Intensity Predominant (PIP), characterized by high pain intensity, but average psychological distress;and 3) Less Elevated Symptoms (LES), characterized by low pain intensity and psychological distress. At the 1-year follow-up, patients in the GES cluster reported significantly greater pain interference than the other two clusters, as well as greater feelings of loneliness and lower mindfulness and optimism compared to the LES cluster. This study supports prior research suggesting that psychosocial-based clustering of patients can be used to identify distinct groups of chronic pain patients. In particular, patients identified as belonging to the GES cluster (high psychological distress, high pain intensity early after onset of social distancing) were at greater risk of suffering from pain a year later, as well as loneliness and less mindfulness and optimism. Patient clustering techniques may help identify high risk patients and suggest behavioral interventions to improve pain by addressing psychosocial modulators of pain.

"Impact of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) on the quality of life of people with ME/CFS and their partners and family members: an online cross-sectional survey","ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to assess the impact of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) on the quality of life (QoL) of people with ME/CFS and their relative or partner (family member).DesignA patient-partner, multinational, subject-initiated, cross-sectional online survey.SettingInternational survey using ME/CFS charities, support groups and social media.ParticipantsParticipants were self-selected with recruitment via social media. Inclusion criteria were aged 18 years or over and reported diagnosis of ME/CFS by health professional. 1418 people with ME/CFS and their 1418 family members from 30 countries participated in the survey. Participants with ME/CFS had a mean age of 45.8 years (range 18â€“81) and were predominantly women (1214 (85.6%) of 1418). Family members had a mean age of 51.9 years (range 18â€“87) and were predominantly men (women: 504 (35.5%) of 1418). 991 (70%) family members were partners of the people with ME/CFS.InterventionsEuroQoL-5 Dimension (EQ-5D-3L), completed by people with ME/CFS, and Family Reported Outcome Measure (FROM-16) questionnaire, completed by family members.ResultsThe mean overall health status on a Visual Analogue Scale for people with ME/CFS was 33.8 (0=worst, 100=best). People with ME/CFS were most affected by ability to perform usual activities, pain, mobility, self-care and least impacted by anxiety. For family members, the overall mean FROM-16 score was 17.9 (0=no impact, 32=worst impact), demonstrating a major impact on QoL. Impact on QoL was significantly correlated between the person with ME/CFS and their family member (p&lt;0.0001). Family members were most impacted emotionally by worry, frustration and sadness and personally by family activities, holidays, sex life and finances.ConclusionsTo the best of our knowledge, this is the largest study on the impact of the QoL of persons with ME/CFS and their family members.

"SATISFACTION WITH THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN A HOME FOR THE ELDERLY DURING THE PANDEMIC COVID-19","The appearance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus caused a pandemic that had a huge impact on life, but also brought about changes in the lifestyle of all the inhabitants of the planet Earth. The pandemic particularly affected the elderly population living in homes for the elderly and infirm. This has caused a number of problems and misfortunes that have been tried to overcome in the best possible way for users of nursing home services. Therefore, there is a need to research satisfaction with the quality of life of home users for the elderly and infirm during the pandemic COVID-19. The research was conducted by empirical testing on a sample of 102 elderly respondents who use home accommodation services for the elderly and infirm. The aim of the research is to find out whether the users of services in the home for the elderly and infirm are satisfied with the quality of life during the pandemic COVID-19. The tasks of the research are to acquire knowledge about satisfaction with instructions and information during a pandemic, feelings of tension, nervousness, fear, depression and sadness due to separation (isolation) from their loved ones. Research on the quality of life of home users for the elderly and infirm during the pandemic showed that respondents are satisfied with the quality of life, have no strong sense of fear, are satisfied with epidemiological guidelines, but not measures because they show extreme dissatisfaction, isolation and inability to visit loved ones. In general, it can be concluded that users of homes for the elderly and infirm are satisfied with the quality of life, but as respondents seem to be a very vulnerable group in society, their quality of life should be frequently checked and improved in every way.","Stipic, Valentina Vinsalek, Sisak, Andela, Baic, Marina","https://www.google.com/search?q=SATISFACTION+WITH+THE+QUALITY+OF+LIFE+IN+A+HOME+FOR+THE+ELDERLY+DURING+THE+PANDEMIC+COVID-19","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Economic and Social Development: Book of Proceedings;: 164-173, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32224,""

"The impact of age and psychosocial factors on cognitive and auditory outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)","Objectives. Hearing loss is the leading potentially modifiable risk factor for dementia. A potential mediator in the relationship between hearing loss and increased dementia risk is the psychosocial pathway, which suggests that increased social isolation and mental health factors associated with hearing loss causes increased dementia risk and exacerbates dementia symptoms. In March 2020, the UK government announced social restriction measures to reduce the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19, with older adults who were considered clinically vulnerable needing to isolate. This study aimed to determine the impact of psychosocial factors, including loneliness, depression, and engagement in various recreational lifestyle activities, on hearing and cognitive function in younger and older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was hypothesised that auditory and cognitive function would be significantly predicted by age, psychosocial factors, and time since the start of the first UK COVID-19 lockdown. Additionally, auditory function was hypothesised to be associated with cognitive functioning.Design. Participants included 112 older adults (62 female) aged 60-83 (M = 70.75, SD = 5.88), and 121 younger adults (85 female) aged 18-30 (M = 21.04, SD = 2.75). Participants took part online from June 2020 - February 2021 and completed a series of questionnaires assessing loneliness, depression, auditory and lifestyle engagement, and subjective hearing ability. They also completed a series of behavioural tasks assessing speech perception, short-term and working memory, processing speed, and executive function, providing composite measures of global cognitive functioning and auditory functioning.Results. Multiple regression analyses found that, of the variables examined, age significantly predicted both global cognitive and auditory function, with older adults displaying poorer auditory and cognitive performance. While age was the only significant predictor in the model predicting cognitive performance, in the model predicting auditory function increased depressive symptoms were a significant predicter alongside age. Further, auditory function did not significantly predict cognitive function.Conclusions. These data suggest that that loneliness and socialisation do not contribute to reductions in cognitive or auditory functioning, nor did time since the start of the first UK lockdown. Thus, suggesting that hearing and cognition may not have been adversely affected by social restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. This provides important implications for understanding whether the relationship between hearing loss and cognitive decline is mediated by the psychosocial pathway. However, the study represents only cross-sectional data collected from a potentially biased sample of higher socio-economic position. Future work should seek to address if these conclusions are also valid in populations with different socio-economic characteristics.","Slade, Kate, Davies, Rob, Pennington, Charlotte Rebecca, Plack, Chris, Nuttall, Helen","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/rqfjy","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32226,""
"Social bonding boosts health behaviour and psychological wellbeing (preprint)","At times of turmoil â€“ such as during natural disasters, social upheavals or pandemics â€“ our social bonds can be key to receiving support and gaining certainty about the right course of action. In an analysis combining two global datasets (N= 13,264) collected during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, this study examined how social bonds with close social circles (i.e., family, friends) and extended groups (i.e., country, government, humanity) relate to engagement in health behaviours and psychological wellbeing. Results revealed that only family bonding promoted engagement in health behaviours. Being strongly bonded with both close circles and extended groups predicted less anxiety and depression and better wellbeing, particularly for those who were bonded with a greater number of groups. These findings highlight that close and extended social bonds offer different sources of support and direction during challenging circumstances, and that continuous investment is needed to forge and maintain both.","Tuncgenc, Bahar, van Mulukom, Valerie, Newson, Martha","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/r7pd2","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32227,""

"Prevention and screening during the COVID-19 pandemic: Qualitative findings from the BETTER WISE project (preprint)","Background:  The COVID-19 pandemic challenged healthcare systems worldwide and disrupted primary care, particularly prevention, screening, and lifestyle counselling. BETTER WISE is a comprehensive and structured approach that proactively addresses cancer and chronic disease prevention and screening (CCDPS), including cancer survivorship and screening for poverty and lifestyle risks for patients aged 40 to 65. Patients from 13 primary care clinics (urban, rural, and remote) in Alberta, Ontario, and Newfoundland & Labrador, Canada were invited for a 1-hour visit with a prevention practitioner (PP), a member of the primary care team with specialized training in CCDPS to provide patients an overview of eligible screening and assist with lifestyle counselling. This qualitative sub-study describes how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted BETTER WISE in a constantly changing medical landscape. Methods: : We conducted 17 focus groups and 48 key informant interviews with a total of 132 primary care providers (PPs, physicians, allied health professionals, and clinic staff) over three different data points to better understand their perspectives on the BETTER WISE project. We also received 585 patient feedback forms of the 1,005 patients who agreed to participate in the study. We also collected field notes and memos and employed thematic analysis using a constant comparative method focused on the impact of the pandemic on BETTER WISE. Results: : We identified four themes related to how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the BETTER WISE study: 1) Switch of in-person visits to visits over the phone;2) Lack of access to preventive care and delays of screening tests;3) Changes in primary care providersâ€™ availability and priorities;4) Impact of the pandemic on patientsâ€™ and primary care providersâ€™ mental health. Conclusions: : The COVID-19 pandemic had and, at the time of writing, continues to have an impact on primary care, particularly on prevention, screening, and lifestyle counselling. Despite structural and procedural challenges throughout different waves of the pandemic, the primary care clinics participating in BETTER WISE were able to complete the study.

"RuralCovidLife: A new resource for the impact of the pandemic on rural Scotland (preprint)","RuralCovidLife is part of Generation Scotlandâ€™s CovidLife project, investigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and mitigation measures on people in Scotland. The RuralCovidLife project focuses on Scotlandâ€™s rural communities, and how they have been impacted by the pandemic. During survey development, Generation Scotland consulted with people living or working in rural communities, and collaborated with a patient and public involvement and engagement (PPIE) group composed of rural community leaders. Through this consultation work, the RuralCovidLife survey was developed to assess the issues most pertinent to people in rural communities, such as mental health, employment, transport, connectivity, and local communities. Between 14th October and 30th November 2020, 3,365 participants from rural areas in Scotland took part in the survey. Participant ages ranged from 16 to 96 (mean = 58.4, standard deviation [SD] = 13.3), and the majority of the participants were female (70.5%). Over half (51.3%) had taken part in the original CovidLife survey. RuralCovidLife includes a subsample (n = 523) of participants from the Generation Scotland cohort. Pre-pandemic data on health and lifestyle, as well as biological samples, are available for these participants. These participantsâ€™ data can also be linked to past and future healthcare records, allowing analysis of retrospective and prospective health outcomes. Like Generation Scotland, RuralCovidLife is designed as a resource for researchers. RuralCovidLife data, as well as the linked Generation Scotland data, is available for use by external researchers following approval from the Generation Scotland Access Committee. RuralCovidLife can be used to investigate mental health, well-being, and behaviour in participants living in rural areas during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as comparisons with non-rural samples. Moreover, the sub-sample with full Generation Scotland data and linkage can be used to investigate the long-term health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic in rural communities.","Stevenson, Anna, Huggins, Charlotte, Forbes, Alison, Hume, Jim, Fulton, Grant, Thirlwall, Claire, Miles, Janet, Fawns-Ritchie, Chloe, Campbell, Archie, Nangle, Clifford, Dawson, Rebecca, Edwards, Rachel, Flaig, Robin, Hartley, Louise, Levein, Christie, McCartney, Daniel, Deary, Ian, Hayward, Caroline, Marioni, Riccardo, McIntosh, Andrew, Sudlow, Cathie, Porteous, David","https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.17325.2","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32232,""

Methods: : We developed a search for MOOC courses aimed at the general population on health education, health promotion, and prevention in different available MOOC platforms. We executed a descriptive analysis of the main characteristics of the selected MOOCs.Â Terms such as healthy living, physical activity, healthy eating, mental health, and variants aimed at the general population were explored. We did not include advanced or specialized studies aimed only at professionals that required prior knowledge. A descriptive analysis of the main characteristics of the selected MOOCs was performed. Results: : There were 117 MOOCs chosen on health education, promotion, and prevention for the general population. Coursera (40.3%) was the platform that offered the highest quantity of MOOCs;more than half of the MOOCs were in English (52.9%). The median (interquartile range) duration of the selected MOOCs was 11 (6â€“15) hours. The predominant themes were ""Health promotion"" (43%) and ""Food and nutrition"" (31%), and the origin was mainly from Europe (37.8%). Conclusions: : Â Potentially MOOCs could improve access to massive open online public health courses. Adaptation to different languages and topics needed for each context could increase access to important health promotion messages, even outside of ""times of pandemic and enforced social isolation"".","Dolores-Maldonado, Gandy, CaÃ±ari-CasaÃ±o, Jorge, Montero-Romainville, Rosalia, Malaga, German","https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.52049.2","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32233,""
"Exploring barriers and facilitators to physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study (preprint)","Objectives Quantitative data show that physical activity (PA) reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic, with differential impacts across demographic groups. Qualitative research is limited, so reasons for this have not been explored in-depth. This study aimed to understand barriers and facilitators to PA during the pandemic, focusing on groups more likely to have been affected by restrictions, and to map these onto the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation Model of Behaviour (COM-B). Design Semi-structured qualitative interview study. Methods One-to-one telephone/videocall interviews were conducted with younger (aged 18-24) and older adults (aged 70+), those with long-term physical health conditions or mental health conditions, and parents of young children, probing about their experiences of PA. Barriers and facilitators were identified using reflexive thematic analysis, and themes were mapped onto COM-B dimensions. Results 116 participants were included (18-93 years old, 61% female, 71% White British). Key themes were the importance of the outdoor environment, impact of COVID-19 restrictions, fear of contracting COVID-19, and level of engagement with home exercise. Caring responsibilities and conflicting priorities were a barrier. PA as a method of socialising, establishing new routines, and the importance of PA for protecting mental health were motivators. Most themes mapped onto the physical opportunity (environmental factors) and reflective motivation (evaluations and plans) COM-B domains. Conclusions Future interventions should increase physical opportunity and reflective motivation for PA during pandemics, to avoid further negative health outcomes following periods of lockdown. Strategies could include tailoring PA guidance depending on location and giving education on the health benefits of PA. Statement of Contribution What is already known on this subject? Physical activity (PA) levels reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent of this reduction varied across demographic groups. Very few qualitative studies have explored reasons for these changes. What does this study add? Novel interview data, giving context to existing quantitative data. Insight into which themes were important for different demographic groups. Suggestions for increasing PA in future pandemics, by mapping findings to a theoretical framework.","Roche, Charlotte, Fisher, Abigail, Fancourt, Daisy, Burton, Alexandra","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.05.18.22275240","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32234,""
"Biopsychosocial response to the COVID-19 lockdown in people with major depressive disorder and multiple sclerosis (preprint)","ABSTRACT Background Changes in lifestyle, finances and work status during COVID-19 lockdowns may have led to biopsychosocial changes in people with pre-existing vulnerabilities such as Major Depressive Disorders (MDD) and Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Methods Data were collected as a part of the RADAR-CNS (Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse â€“ Central Nervous System) programme. We analyzed the following data from long-term participants in a decentralized multinational study: symptoms of depression, heart rate (HR) during the day and night;social activity;sedentary state, steps and physical activity of varying intensity. Linear mixed-effects regression analyses with repeated measures were fitted to assess the changes among three time periods (pre, during and post-lockdown) across the groups, adjusting for depression severity before the pandemic and gender. Results Participants with MDD (N=255) and MS (N=214) were included in the analyses. Overall, depressive symptoms remained stable across the three periods in both groups. Lower mean HR and HR variation were observed between pre and during lockdown during the day for MDD and during the night for MS. HR variation during rest periods also decreased between pre-and post-lockdown in both clinical conditions. We observed a reduction of physical activity for MDD and MS upon the introduction of lockdowns. The group with MDD exhibited a net increase in social interaction via social network apps over the three periods. Conclusions Behavioral response to the lockdown measured by social activity, physical activity and HR may reflect changes in stress in people with MDD and MS.","Siddi, S.; GinÃ©-VÃ¡zquez, I.; Bailon, R.; Matcham, F.; Lamers, F.; Kontaxis, S.; Laporta, E.; Garcia, E.; Arranz, B.; Dalla Costa, G.; Guerrero PÃ©rez, A.

"Have the COVID-19 Pandemic and Lockdown Affected Childrenâ€™s Mental Health in the Long Term? A Repeated Cross-Sectional Study (preprint)","ABSTRACT Objective The study aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms in children and adolescents. Design Cross-sectional surveys were carried out on the mental health of children;one survey was conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic and one into the pandemic, 15 months after the implementation of lockdown, social distancing, and school closures. Demographic data and COVID-19 pandemic-related data were collected from specific parent-report and self-report questionnaires. Participants Participants included children and adolescents between ages 6-16 years, attending a tertiary care hospital without any diagnosed major psychiatric disorder or chronic disorder. Analysis Data was collected at two points (before the COVID-19 pandemic and during it) and compared. Levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms were compared and tested for statistically significant differences between these two points using appropriate statistical tests. Regression models were constructed to predict the factors affecting increased anxiety levels and depressive symptoms in the COVID-19 period. Results 832 and 1255 children/adolescents were included in the study during the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 times, respectively. The median age of the participants was 10 years [Interquartile Range (IQR) = 4 years). The median (IQR) Spence Childrenâ€™s Anxiety Scale score was 24 (12) at the pre-COVID-19 point and 31 (13) during the COVID-19 pandemic (p&lt;0.001, r=-0.27). 11% and 16% of children reported being depressed at these two-time points, respectively (p=0.004, f c =-0.063). Regression analysis showed that many factors, including the duration of smartphone use, female gender, and only child status, were associated with increased anxiety or depression levels. Conclusion A large proportion of children had elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms during the pandemic relative to before the pandemic, suggesting a need for measures to engage children in healthy habits to protect childrenâ€™s mental health and continuous monitoring of children during such scenarios. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS With the availability of pre-pandemic data, the repeated cross-sectional study design allowed us to compare the anxiety symptoms and prevalence of depression in children and adolescents during and before the COVID-19 lockdown and school closures. The study is one of the few studies from low-to-middle income countries on this topic with large sample size. The data was collected hospital setting, and all of the participants were attending a hospital, which could have resulted in a sampling bias. Although it is a tertiary care hospital, all of the patients included in the study came to us for primary care and were not referred. We used standardised scales that are usually used for screening and evaluation purposes and not for diagnostic purposes. We were unable to perform a longitudinal study with a follow-up that would offer clear evidence of any fluctuation in mental health during the course of the pandemic.","Pustake, Manas, Mane, Sushant, Ganiyani, Mohammad Arfat, Mukherjee, Sayan, Sayed, Misba, Mithbavkar, Varada, Memon, Zaid, Momin, Abdus Samad, Deshmukh, Krishna, Chordia, Ayush, Parida, Sabyasachi, Bhagwat, Ajit, Johnson, Alan, Varma, Deepankar, Warghade, Sanket","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.05.10.22272976","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32236,""
"Mental-health before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in adults with neurodevelopmental disorders (preprint)","The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted mental health globally. Individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), are at elevated risk of mental health difficulties. Therefore, we investigated the impact of the pandemic on anxiety, depression and mental wellbeing in adults with NDDs using longitudinal data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children study (n=3,058). Mental health data were collected pre-pandemic (age 21-25) and at three timepoints during the pandemic (ages 27-28) using the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire, Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment-7, and Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale. ADHD and ASD were defined using validated cut-points of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and Autism Spectrum Quotient, self-reported at age 25. We used multi-level mixed-effects models to investigate changes in mental health in those with ADHD and ASD compared to those without. Prevalences of depression, anxiety and poor mental wellbeing were higher at all timepoints (pre-pandemic and during pandemic) in those with ADHD and ASD compared to those without. Anxiety increased to a greater extent in those with ADHD (ÃŸ=0.8 [0.2,1.4], p=0.01) and ASD (ÃŸ=1.2 [-0.1,2.5], p=0.07), while depression symptoms decreased, particularly in females with ASD (ÃŸ=-3.1 [-4.6,-1.5], p=0.0001). On average, mental wellbeing decreased in all, but to a lesser extent in those with ADHD (ÃŸ=1.3 [0.2,2.5], p=0.03) and females with ASD (ÃŸ=3.0 [0.2,5.9], p=0.04). To conclude, anxiety disproportionately increased in adults with NDDs during the pandemic, however, the related lockdowns may have provided a protective environment for depressive symptoms in the same individuals.","Shakeshaft, Amy, Blakey, Rachel, Kwong, Alex S.

"How Did Veterans Fare Over the COVID-19 Pandemic? the Role of Health Equity and Access to Care (preprint)","Historically, United States Veterans have represented an at-risk group for a variety of social ailments, including homelessness, disability, depression, anxiety, substance use disorder, and suicide, among others. This paper presents descriptive evidence on the economic and subjective well-being of Veterans during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a combination of novel administrative and survey data, we find no deviation in the trend in weekly wages or labor supply for Veterans relative to non-Veterans during COVID-19. Conditional on working, Veterans still earn about 1.8% more, but they are 5.4 percentage points less likely to be employed. These pre-pandemic cross-sectional differences cannot be explained by demographics (e.g., age or education), income, or either industry or occupational composition. During the pandemic, Veterans exhibit a 0.116 standard deviation (sd) higher level of current life satisfaction, a 1.6 percentage point (pp) higher probability of thriving, and a 0.074 sd higher level of personal finances. Along economic and subjective well-being dimensions, we conclude that Veterans have not be disproportionately harmed by COVID-19. We present suggestive evidence that access to healthcare may serve as an important mechanism behind these results. We find that Veterans living an additional 10 miles from a Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) have a 0.062 sd lower level of current life satisfaction and a 2.5 pp lower probability of thriving.","Makridis, Christos, Darden, Michael, Alterovitz, Gil","https://www.google.com/search?q=How+Did+Veterans+Fare+Over+the+COVID-19+Pandemic?+the+Role+of+Health+Equity+and+Access+to+Care+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32240,""

However, adult learners and non-traditional students who are currently at their quarter and midlife during the pandemic, remain underrepresented in well-being research. Moreover, the unique sociocultural and historical contexts specific to generational cohorts may have an impact on the way they experience and cope with the challenges brought about by the pandemic. This study sought to determine the relationships among generational identity, mental well-being and life satisfaction among Millennial and Generation X Filipino adult learners. A total of 543 adult learners participated in this online cross-sectional study. Findings suggest that young millennials reported lower levels of mental well-being and life satisfaction compared to old millennials and Gen Xers. Moreover, mental well-being was found to be a predictor of life satisfaction among Filipino adult learners, regardless of their generational identity.

The experiment has been subject to even harsh criticism, which involved the Italian Red Cross, to which the health service on board was outsourced;in fact, on the ships a forced coexistence is being temporarily created and it has characteristics similar to those of total institutions analysed in the past.

"Psychological impact and mental health effect of COVID-19 among Jordanian population","Background During public health emergencies, the major efforts of policy makers are directed towards physical and medical consequences, and little is directed towards the psychological impact of these outbreaks. Aim To assess the psychological impact and mental health effects of the current pandemic of Corona virus (COVID 19) on the general population in Jordan. Methodology A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online survey directed towards the general population in Jordan during the period March 25th to April 2nd, 2020. Mental health effect was measured using the Arabic version of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), while the psychological impact was measured using questions from the Arabic version of the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). Total number of respondents was 1946. Results The levels of depression, anxiety and stress as measured by DASS-21 questionnaire showed that 13% had severe depression, 10% had severe anxiety, and 6.3% had severe stress. There was more psychological impact compared with mental health effects on the study population, as more than quarter of the sample (26.7%) reported severe psychological impact (score &gt;38). Factors associated with higher psychological impact and mental health effects include younger age group, being female, childless, living in the remote areas, being a bachelor's degree student or graduate, having low monthly income and having physical symptoms in the 14 days prior to the study. Conclusion Findings of this study can inspire health projects at the national level to better deal with these psychological issues in response to the current or any future health emergencies in Jordan.","Qasem, N.; Al-Ali, M.

"Compassion fatigue, burnout, compassion satisfaction and depression among emergency department physicians and nurses: a cross-sectional study","ObjectivesEmergency department physicians and nurses are at high risk of compassion fatigue, burnout and depression. The purpose of this study was to examine the inter-relationship between compassion fatigue, burnout, compassion satisfaction and depression in emergency department physicians and nurses.DesignA cross-sectional study.SettingThis study was conducted in five tertiary hospitals in five different cities across the province of Sichuan, China, in 2021.ParticipantsA total of 342 emergency department physicians and nurses participated in the study.Main outcome measuresCompassion fatigue, burnout, compassion satisfaction and depression scores.ResultsAmong the study participants, 100% were found to have depressive symptoms, 27.8% had low compassion satisfaction, 2.3% had high burnout and 3.8% had compassion fatigue. In the final multiple linear regression model, marital status (p=0.008;95% CI â€“5.205 to â€“0.789), history of chronic disease (p=0.003;95% CI â€“6.461 to â€“1.386), compassion satisfaction (p&lt;0.001;95% CI 0.593 to 1.274), burnout (p=0.019;95% CI 0.084 to 0.930) and compassion fatigue (p&lt;0.001;95% CI â€“1.527 to â€“1.053) among emergency department physicians and nurses were considered to be significant predictors of depression.ConclusionsThe prevalence of depression among emergency department physicians and nurses is high in the province of Sichuan, China. Compassion fatigue, burnout and compassion satisfaction were significantly associated with depression in emergency department physicians and nurses.

"Telehealth for Dialectical Behavioral Therapy: A Commentary on the Experience of a Rapid Transition to Virtual Delivery of DBT","Telehealth has been rapidly adopted to provide continuity of delivery of mental health services in light of COVID-19. However, the remote implementation of intensive treatments like dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) has been vastly understudied. The aim of the current commentary is to describe potential obstacles, propose solutions, and discuss advantages of transitioning from traditional in-person to a virtual delivery format for full model DBT. We speak to these points at multiple levels of relevance to clinical scientists and practitioners: (1) considerations about the virtual delivery format, (2) considerations for the virtual delivery of DBT specifically, and (3) person-level considerations (e.g., client, clinician). We illustrate the commentary using examples of obstacles encountered and solutions identified during our DBT team's rapid transition to telehealth in response to COVID-19-related shut-downs and discuss considerations for the extension of telehealth delivery of DBT going forward. We are hopeful that the rapid transition to telehealth delivery of mental health services in response to COVID-19 serves as a call to action for clinicians to adapt and leverage technology to deliver DBT on a broader scale to improve patient health outcomes.","Hyland, K.

"Using digital health tools for the Remote Assessment of Treatment Prognosis in Depression (RAPID): a study protocol for a feasibility study","IntroductionDigital health tools such as smartphones and wearable devices could improve psychological treatment outcomes in depression through more accurate and comprehensive measures of patient behaviour. However, in this emerging field, most studies are small and based on student populations outside of a clinical setting. The current study aims to determine the feasibility and acceptability of using smartphones and wearable devices to collect behavioural and clinical data in people undergoing therapy for depressive disorders and establish the extent to which they can be potentially useful biomarkers of depression and recovery after treatment.Methods and analysisThis is an observational, prospective cohort study of 65 people attending psychological therapy for depression in multiple London-based sites. It will collect continuous passive data from smartphone sensors and a Fitbit fitness tracker, and deliver questionnaires, speech tasks and cognitive assessments through smartphone-based apps. Objective data on sleep, physical activity, location, Bluetooth contact, smartphone use and heart rate will be gathered for 7 months, and compared with clinical and contextual data. A mixed methods design, including a qualitative interview of patient experiences, will be used to evaluate key feasibility indicators, digital phenotypes of depression and therapy prognosis. Patient and public involvement was sought for participant-facing documents and the study design of the current research proposal.Ethics and disseminationEthical approval has been obtained from the London Westminster Research Ethics Committee, and the Health Research Authority, Integrated Research Application System (project ID: 270918). Privacy and confidentiality will be guaranteed and the procedures for handling, processing, storage and destruction of the data will comply with the General Data Protection Regulation. Findings from this study will form part of a doctoral thesis, will be presented at national and international meetings or academic conferences and will generate manuscripts to be submitted to peer-reviewed journals.Trial registration numberhttps://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/PMYTA","de Angel, Valeria, Lewis, Serena, Munir, Sara, Matcham, Faith, Dobson, Richard, Hotopf, Matthew","https://www.google.com/search?q=Using+digital+health+tools+for+the+Remote+Assessment+of+Treatment+Prognosis+in+Depression+(RAPID):+a+study+protocol+for+a+feasibility+study","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BMJ Open; 12(5), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32253,""

"Clinical characteristics based homeopathic Remedy Profiling of COVID-19 Patients: A Retrospective Cohort Study","Objective: The objective of the study was to recognize core symptoms associated with COVID-19 positivity, its impact on mental health of patients and to identify indicated homeopathic remedies for COVID-19. Methods: In this pilot study, 25 confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted at Dedicated COVID Hospital (DCH) established under Dr. D Y Patil Vidyapeeth campus took part in survey questionnaire entitled as ""Health impact survey for clinical features and patient profiles of COVID 19: Based on Homoeopathic perspective"" observed by three independent observers. Based on the survey, specificity and sensitivity of symptoms was analyzed by three independent physicians to perform remedy analysis in order to identify indicated homeopathic medicines for COVID-19 in mild to moderate cases. Results: A total of 25 patients were included in study. Out of 25, 16 patients did not have any comorbidity while 9 patients had diabetes, blood pressure or thyroid as one of the co-morbidities. The mean age of the patients was 39.4 years +/- 12.6 where mean age of patients without co-morbidity was significantly lower than the patients with co-morbidities. The major symptoms were found to be fever (76%), cough (76%), shortness of breath (72%), sore throat (56%), fatigue (80%), loss of smell (40%) and Loss of taste(48%). Likelihood ratio of a positive test was found to be higher for Loss of smell, Loss of taste and Cough. Mixed and contrasting responses were reported by the study subjects on mental health impact. Majority of patients showed mild negative impact on mental health. In remedy analysis total 6 homeopathic medicines were observed with most commonly indicated being Carbo vegetabilis (70.66%), Antimonium tartaricum (10.66%), Arsenic album (9.33%) and Bryonia alba Linn.

"Variation in Use of High-Flow Nasal Cannula and Noninvasive Ventilation Among Patients With COVID-19","The use of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and noninvasive ventilation (NIV) for hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are recommended by critical-care guidelines; however, apprehension about viral particle aerosolization and patient self-inflicted lung injury may have limited use. We aimed to describe hospital variation in the use and clinical outcomes of HFNC and NIV for the management of COVID-19. This was a retrospective observational study of adults hospitalized with COVID-19 who received supplemental oxygen between February 15, 2020, and April 12, 2021, across 102 international and United States hospitals by using the COVID-19 Registry. Associations of HFNC and NIV use with clinical outcomes were evaluated by using multivariable adjusted hierarchical random-effects logistic regression models. Hospital variation was characterized by using intraclass correlation and the median odds ratio. Among 13,454 adults with COVID-19 who received supplemental oxygen, 8,143 (60%) received nasal cannula/face mask only, 2,859 (21%) received HFNC, 878 (7%) received NIV, 1,574 (12%) received both HFNC and NIV, with 3,640 subjects (27%) progressing to invasive ventilation. The hospital of admission contributed to 24% of the risk-adjusted variation in HFNC and 30% of the risk-adjusted variation in NIV. The median odds ratio for hospital variation of HFNC was 2.6 (95% CI 1.4-4.9) and of NIV was 3.1 (95% CI 1.2-8.1). Among 5,311 subjects who received HFNC and/or NIV, 2,772 (52%) did not receive invasive ventilation and survived to hospital discharge. Hospital-level use of HFNC or NIV were not associated with the rates of invasive ventilation or mortality. Hospital variation in the use of HFNC and NIV for acute respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 was great but was not associated with intubation or mortality. The wide variation and relatively low use of HFNC/NIV observed within our study signaled that implementation of increased HFNC/NIV use in patients with COVID-19 will require changes to current care delivery practices.

"Pre-hospital Emergency Service Challenges in the Face of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Iran","With the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the workload of the Iran's health care system along with Pre-hospital Emergency Service (PHES) increased significantly so that Iranian fledgling emergency system had never experienced such a crisis. With regard to the importance of the function of PHES as the front line staff of Iran's health system and its role in controlling the recent epidemic crisis, this study was conducted to identify the challenges of PHES function in the face of COVID-19 pandemic. The study was conducted with qualitative approach through content analysis in 2021. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect data. Sampling was purposive and continued until data saturation. After 24 interviews, the data were saturated. The extracted codes were thoroughly prepared as a data pool. After encoding all available data, the related codes were categorized into a single theme. After extracting the themes, a network of themes, related to the research topic, was drawn, and then, the relationship between the themes was analyzed. Data analysis undertaken for the qualitative study resulted in the identification of four main themes included: challenges related to facilities and equipment, living with uncertainty, professional and organizational capabilities, and burnout. PHES personnel have an important and key role in providing care to patients during COVID-19 epidemic period. Individual and systemic challenges were among the most important issues in the experiences of these personnel. These challenges require organizational planning and special attention of health policy makers to maintain the staff's physical and mental health during the pandemic and the possible crises ahead.","Heidari, Aliakbari, Heydarpoor, Nehrir, Yadollahi","https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2022.141","20220607","COVID-19; Iran; Pre-hospital emergency service (PHES)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32259,""
"Trajectories of mental health status during the early phase pandemic in China: A longitudinal study on adolescents living in the community with confirmed cases","Sufficient research reports that individuals living in the community with confirmed COVID-19 cases are more likely to exhibit poor mental health condition. However, little is known about the longitudinal trajectories of mental health status among these people who are exposed to increased risk of contracting COVID-19. Using a 3-wave longitudinal survey between February and June 2020, data has been collected from 2,352 adolescents living in the community with confirmed cases. Depressive/anxiety symptoms, soc-demographic, and other psychological factors of interest (e.g., social support) were measured. Using latent growth mixture modeling, we identified two subgroups (Resistance vs. Dysfunction) of adolescents based on their depressive and anxiety symptoms. More social support and positive coping are identified as protective factors for mental health, whereas higher level of negative coping predicts unfavorable outcomes. These findings suggested that adolescents living in the community with confirmed cases of COVID-19 are a group to which researchers should pay more attention when studying the impacts of quarantine on mental health. It is also crucial to emphasize the role of social support and positive coping in planning psychological interventions for adolescents.","Wang, Zhao, Zhai, Chen, Liu, Fan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114646","20220607","Anxiety; COVID-19; Coping style; Depression; Social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32260,""
"Changes in suicidal ideation and related influential factors in college students during the COVID-19 lockdown in China","This study aims to investigate the patterns and predictors of suicidal ideation (SI) trajectories among college students during extended lockdowns in China. A three-wave survey was conducted during the outbreak period, remission period, and prevention period of COVID-19. Distinct patterns of SI trajectories were established by grouping respondents based on temporal changes in SI. Multivariate logistic regressions were performed to examine predictors for delay-occurrence and persistent SI. From a total of 35,516 college students included in the study, rates of SI increased significantly from T1 to T2 (7.3% v. 9.4%) and from T2 to T3 (9.4% v. 12.6%). Five SI trajectories were observed: resilient (80.5% of the sample), recovery (3.6%), relapsing/remitting (4.8%), persistent dysfunction (2.3%) and delayed dysfunction (8.7%). Further, junior-year undergraduates, postgraduates, only-child families, mental health history, confirmed cases in the community of residence, depressive symptoms, and negative coping strategies were significant predictors of distinct SI trajectories, whereas greater social support, more positive coping strategies, and better family functioning were associated with a lower probability of developing delayed or persistent dysfunction during the lockdown period.

To determine whether clinician beliefs regarding telehealth quality and ease of use were associated with the proportion of care delivered via video, phone, and in-person across specialties. This survey study used a voluntary, anonymous survey conducted from August to September 2021 in the Department of Veterans Affairs New England Healthcare System (VANEHS). Mental health (MH), primary care (PC), and specialty care (SC) clinicians were invited to participate. Data were analyzed from October 2021 to January 2022. Participation in a 32-item survey. The main outcomes were clinicians' views on relative quality of video, phone, and in-person care; factors contributing to clinicians' modality choice; telehealth challenges; and clinician modality preferences and utilization when treating new and established patients. There were 866 survey respondents (estimated 64% response rate); 52 respondents reported no video or phone telehealth use in the 3 months prior to survey completion and were excluded, resulting in a final sample of 814 respondents. Respondents were divided among MH (403 respondents [49.5%]), PC (153 respondents [18.8%]), and SC (258 respondents [31.7%]). Compared with PC and SC clinicians, MH clinicians rated the quality of video care the highest (eg, compared with in-person care with masks when treating new patients: Ãâ€¡2Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°147.8; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and were more likely to prefer video over phone when treating both new (Ãâ€¡2Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°26.6; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and established (Ãâ€¡2Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°100.4; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) patients remotely. PC and SC clinicians were more likely to rate phone care as being at least equivalent in quality to video for both new (Ãâ€¡2Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°26.3; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and established (Ãâ€¡2Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°33.5; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) patients. PC and SC clinicians were also more likely to endorse challenges of video care, including patient barriers and the inability to conduct a physical examination (Ãâ€¡2Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°292.0; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). Most PC and SC clinicians either had no preference (46 PC respondents [36.2%]; 59 SC respondents [28.4%]) or preferred phone (36 PC respondents [28.3%]; 67 SC respondents [32.2%]) for remote care of established patients. Findings aligned with utilization rates within VANEHS, with MH clinicians conducting significantly more of their encounters via video (36Ã¢â‚¬Â¯734 encounters [40.3%]) than PC (3201 encounters [3.9%]) and SC (1157 encounters [4.9%]) clinicians. These findings suggest that clinician attitudes regarding telehealth quality and ease of use were associated with utilization rates. Moving forward, clinician use of telehealth may be impacted by additional data regarding the relative effectiveness of modalities as well as improvements in video telehealth workflows.","Connolly, Miller, Gifford, Charness","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.16401","20220607","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32262,""
"Challenges in virtual collection of patient-reported data: a prospective cohort study conducted in COVID-19 era","Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, patients attending ambulatory clinics at cancer centers in Ontario completed the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) at each visit. At our center, completion was via touchpad, with assistance from clinic volunteers. As of March 2020, clinic appointments were conducted virtually when possible and touch pads removed. We anticipated a negative impact on the collection of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and the recognition of severe symptoms. We performed a prospective cross-sectional cohort study to investigate remote ESAS completion by patients with appointments at a weekly surgical oncology clinic. Patients in the initial study cohort were asked to complete and return the ESAS virtually (V). Given low completion rates, the ensuing cohort was asked to complete a hard-copy (HC) ESAS. For the final cohort, we provided remote, personal mentorship by a member of the care team to support virtual electronic ESAS completion (virtual-mentored (VM) cohort). Between May and July 2020, a total of 174 patient encounters were included in the study. For the V cohort, 20/46 patients (44%) successfully completed and returned the electronic ESAS, compared to 49/50 (98%) for the HC cohort. For the VM cohort, the overall completion rate was 74% (58/78); however, 12 of these 58 patients did not independently complete a virtual ESAS. Virtual questionnaire completion was not predicted by age, sex, or tumor site, although patients who completed the ESAS were more likely to be in active management rather than surveillance (p = 0.04). Of all completed forms, 42% revealed a depression score of Ã¢â€°Â¥2, and 27% an anxiety score of Ã¢â€°Â¥4. We identified significant barriers to the virtual completion of ESAS forms, with a lack of predictive variables. The severe degree of psychological distress reported by ~50% of respondents demonstrates the need for ongoing regular collection/review of these data. Innovative solutions are required to overcome barriers to the virtual collection of PROs.","Kazazian, Bogach, Johnston, Ng, Swallow","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-022-07191-3","20220607","COVID-19; Cancer; ESAS; Electronic; Pandemic; Patient-reported outcomes; Virtual","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32263,""
"Differences in the delivery of medications for opioid use disorder during hospitalization by racial categories: A retrospective cohort analysis","<i>Background</i>: As the drug-related overdose crisis and COVID-19 pandemic continue, communities need increased access to medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) (i.e., buprenorphine and methadone). Disparities in the type of MOUD prescribed or administered by racial and ethnic categories are well described in the outpatient clinical environment. It is unknown, however, if these disparities persist when MOUD is provided in acute care hospitals. <i>Methods</i>: This study assessed differences in the delivery of buprenorphine versus methadone during acute medical or surgical hospitalizations for veterans with opioid use disorder (OUD) by racial categories (Black Non-Hispanic or Latino vs. White Non-Hispanic or Latino). Data were obtained retrospectively from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) for federal fiscal year 2017. We built logistic regression models, adjusted for individual and hospital-related covariates, and calculated the predicted probabilities of MOUD delivery by racial categories. <i>Results</i>: The study cohort (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1,313 unique patients; <i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°107 VHA hospitals) had a mean age of 57 (range 23 to 87Ã¢â‚¬â€°years), was predominantly male (96%), and composed entirely of Black (29%) or White (71%) patients. White patients were 11% more likely than Black patients to receive buprenorphine than methadone during hospitalization (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.010; 95% CI: 2.7%, 20.0%). Among patients on MOUD prior to hospitalization, White patients were 21% more likely than Black patients to receive buprenorphine (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.000; 95% CI: 9.8%, 31.5%). Among patients newly initiated on MOUD during hospitalization, there were no differences by racial categories. <i>Conclusion</i>: We observed disparities in the delivery of buprenorphine versus methadone during hospitalization by racial categories. The observed differences in hospital-based MOUD delivery may be influenced by MOUD received prior to hospitalization within the racialized outpatient addiction treatment system. The VHA and health systems more broadly must address all aspects of racism that contribute to inequitable MOUD access throughout all clinical contexts.","Priest, King, Englander, Lovejoy, McCarty","https://doi.org/10.1080/08897077.2022.2074601","20220607","Racism; buprenorphine; healthcare disparities; hospitals; methadone; opiate substitution treatment; opioid-related disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32264,""
"Exploring adolescents' perspectives on social media and mental health and well-being - A qualitative literature review","Many quantitative studies have supported the association between social media use and poorer mental health, with less known about adolescents' perspectives on social media's impact on their mental health and wellbeing. This narrative literature review aimed to explore their perspectives, focusing on adolescents aged between 13 and 17. It reviewed qualitative studies published between January 2014 and December 2020, retrieved from four databases: APA Psychinfo, Web of Science, PubMed and Google Scholar. The literature search obtained 24 research papers. Five main themes were identified: 1) Self-expression and validation, 2) Appearance comparison and body ideals, 3) Pressure to stay connected, 4) Social engagement and peer support and 5) Exposure to bullying and harmful content. This review has highlighted how social media use can contribute to poor mental health - through validation-seeking practices, fear of judgement, body comparison, addiction and cyberbullying. It also demonstrates social media's positive impact on adolescent wellbeing - through connection, support and discussion forums for those with similar diagnoses. Future research should consider adolescent views on improvements to social media, studying younger participants, and the impact of COVID-19 on social media use and its associated mental health implications.","Popat, Tarrant","https://doi.org/10.1177/13591045221092884","20220607","Social media; adolescent perspective; connection; cyberbullying; mental health; social media addiction; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32265,""
"Fear of COVID-19, stress and depression: A meta-analytic test of the mediating role of anxiety","The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the lives of millions of individuals physiologically, behaviorally, socially, and/or psychologically. Moreover, there is now much empirical evidence that mental health problems have increased during the pandemic period and these problems have various consequences. The changes in the mood states of individuals due to the pandemic underpins the rationale of the present study. The aim of the study was to identify the cross-sectional associations between fear of COVID-19, stress, anxiety, and depression by using two stage-meta-analytic structural equation modeling (TS-MASEM). This is a meta-analytic structural equation modelling study. A systematic literature review initially identified 4840 studies. As a result of applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 25 studies comprising 28 samples (reporting 120 effect sizes) were eligible for inclusion in the current TS-MASEM (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 16,452). The results showed significant associations between fear of COVID-19, stress, anxiety, and depression. Additionally, the mediation role of anxiety in the association between depression and fear of COVID-19 and stress was explored. Although the results did not allow for causal inferences regarding depression, they provide insight into the possible consequences of fear of COVID-19 and comorbid problems for clinicians and researchers.","Ãƒâ€¡Ã„Â±krÃ„Â±kÃƒÂ§Ã„Â±, Ãƒâ€¡Ã„Â±krÃ„Â±kÃƒÂ§Ã„Â±, Griffiths","https://doi.org/10.1111/papt.12406","20220607","anxiety; depression; fear of COVID-19; meta-analytic structural equation modelling; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32266,""
"Impact of COVID-19 lockdown on quality of life in a literate population in Pakistan","Early in the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan, complete lockdown was imposed from 24 March 2020: offices, shopping malls, market places, etc. were affected. On 25 March, further restrictions were imposed: hospital outpatient departments were closed and there was a ban on public and private gatherings. The lockdown significantly slowed down economic activities, and halted recreational, educational and religious activities and social gatherings. To assess the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on the quality of life of literate individuals in Pakistan. A cross-sectional, descriptive study was conducted from 25 April to 15 May, 2020 among literate Pakistani who understand the English language, aged 10+ years and had internet access. We selected 500 individuals to complete the McGill questionnaire online. The response rate was 73% (n = 365): 49% males and 51% females. Around one third reported a moderate effect on overall quality of life. Financial life was moderately affected in 45% and both physical life and emotional life in 43% of participants. Spiritual life was excellent in 69%. However, social life was severely affected in 56%. Mild depression was felt by 47% of respondents and 48% felt strongly supported during the COVID-19 lockdown. The COVID-19 lockdown made little difference to the quality of life of the literate population of Pakistan. A few aspects were moderately affected and social life was badly affected. Spiritual life improved for most individuals.

"Impact of COVID-19 on mental health and psychosocial support services in the Eastern Mediterranean Region - results of a rapid assessment","Mental health has been identified by the World Health Organization as an integral component of the COVID-19 response. This study aimed to estimate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental, neurological and substance use disorders (MNS) services in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. The assessment was conducted through a web-based survey that was completed by national mental health focal persons and was analysed between June and August 2020. School and workplace mental health services were wholly or partially disrupted in more than 70% of reporting countries. Fewer than 20% of the countries in the Region reported full operations of mental health services for children and adolescents or for older adults. The main reasons were travel restrictions, decreases in inpatient volumes due to the cancellation of elective care, decreases in outpatient volumes due to patients not presenting, and health authority directives for the closure of outpatient services. The majority (85%) of countries responded by establishing MNS helplines using telemedicine/teletherapy and digital psychological interventions. The fragile and conflict-affected states relied mostly on implementing infection prevention and control measures at MNS service facilities. Gaps were identified in the areas of addictive behaviours, substance use and neurology research related to the pandemic. The assessment highlights the need to strengthen capacities for monitoring changes in service delivery and utilization, and documents evidence on what works in different settings during the different phases of the pandemic to facilitate informed decisions related to the nature and timing of adaptations to service delivery.

In a qualitative thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews conducted July 2020 to August 2021, we examined the pandemic's impact on participants' (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°25) experiences with self-perception and coping. All had moderate or complex disease; median age 32 years. The pandemic altered some participants' self-perception, including increased vulnerability beyond heart-attributed risk.

"A longitudinal study of the mental health of autistic children and adolescents and their parents during COVID-19: Part 1, quantitative findings","Autistic children and adolescents, and their parents/carers, tend to experience more symptoms of anxiety and depression compared to those with other special educational needs and disabilities. The rapid change in society as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have disproportionately affected autistic young people and their parents/carers. We investigated how the mental health of autistic young people, and their parents/carers, developed during the first lockdown in the United Kingdom and how it changed once schools fully reopened for face-to-face teaching approximately 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°months later. Parents/carers completed online standardised questionnaires about their own and their child's mental health at four time points between March 2020 and October 2020. We found that, throughout this period, autistic young people experienced more symptoms of anxiety and depression compared to those with other special educational needs and disabilities. Anxiety levels decreased as lockdown progressed and schools reopened for face-to-face teaching but only for those with other special educational needs and disabilities. For autistic young people, both anxiety and depression symptoms remained high throughout. There were no differences in the mental health of parents/carers of autistic children compared to those with other special educational needs and disabilities. These findings suggest that the mental health of autistic children and adolescents is likely to have been disproportionately affected during and after the first lockdown in the United Kingdom. In the second part of this article (Asbury &amp; Toseeb, 2022), we attempt to explain these trends using qualitative data provided by parents during the same period.","Toseeb, Asbury","https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613221082715","20220607","COVID-19; autism; longitudinal; mental health; mixed-methods; qualitative; quantitative; special educational needs","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32271,""
"A longitudinal study of the mental health of autistic children and adolescents and their parents during COVID-19: Part 2, qualitative findings","We know that autistic children and young people, and their caregivers, are at increased risk of mental ill health. We asked whether the first 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°months of COVID-19 exacerbated that risk, and whether the implications were different for autistic pupils and their caregivers, than for those with other special educational needs and difficulties. In a linked paper, we found that caregivers of autistic pupils reported higher levels of depression and anxiety symptoms in their children than parents of children with other special educational needs and difficulties (Toseeb &amp; Asbury, 2022). For pupils with other special educational needs and difficulties, their parent-reported anxiety symptoms eased over time while remaining high throughout for autistic pupils. There were no differences in mental health and wellbeing between caregivers of autistic pupils and those with other special educational needs and difficulties. Here, we used parents' written descriptions of their own and their child's mental health during the first 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°months of COVID-19 to explore these linked findings in greater depth. We identified strong evidence of worry and distress for all, but most prominently autistic children and young people. Our finding that worry and distress declined over time for pupils with other special educational needs and difficulties, but not for autistic pupils, was supported and we observed a few differences between caregivers. We also found evidence of wellbeing throughout the sample, and examples of some (mainly autistic) pupils benefitting from a reduction in demands (e.g. going to school). This has implications for our understanding of the school experience for autistic pupils. Findings suggest that the mental health of autistic children and young people may have been disproportionately affected during the first 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°months of COVID-19 and that careful consideration of optimal support, from both health and education perspectives, is vital.","Asbury, Toseeb","https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613221086997","20220607","COVID-19; autism; longitudinal; mental health; mixed-methods; qualitative; quantitative; special educational needs","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32272,""
"[Influence of screen time on the sleep quality of students]","The restorative effects of sleep are essential for physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral daily performance in college. In addition to the stress of everyday student life, the use of screen devices at the forefront of pandemic-related online teaching is also increasing dramatically. Particularly during evening and nighttime hours, increased screen use may contribute to physical, psychological, and cognitive activation, which in turn may negatively affect students' sleep quality. To determine possible associations between screen use in online teaching and its effects on sleep hygiene and quality, 216Ã‚Â students at Magdeburg-Stendal University of Applied Sciences anonymously and voluntarily participated in the online survey in May 2021. The positive ethics vote is available. The general sleep quality of the student body can be rated as poor in 68.9% (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬â€°149) of the surveyed students. In particular, students who worked predominantly on screen devices in the evening or at nighttime for their studies, and thus had aÃ‚Â chronobiological tendency to be a night person, tended to have poorer sleep. The effects of long screen time in the evening and nighttime hours can have far-reaching consequences on sleep patterns and awareness of physical needs for breaks and sleep. Online teaching in times of the COVID-19 pandemic in particular led to an increase in screen time alongside equally high levels of personal use. This could result in aÃ‚Â continued negative impact on sleep hygiene and quality, not only at the expense of daytime concentration and performance but rather of physical and mental health.","Nestler, BÃƒÂ¶ckelmann","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11818-022-00357-5","20220607","COVID-19 pandemic; Chronotype; Media usage; Online teaching; Sleep prevention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32273,""
"The Biological Functions and Clinical Significance of SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Corcern","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is continuing to evolve, emerging novel variants with spike protein mutations. Although most mutations emerged in the SARS-CoV-2 genome are neutral or mildly deleterious, a small number of mutations can affect virus phenotype that confers the virus a fitness advantage. These mutations can enhance viral replication, raise the risk of reinfection and blunt the potency of neutralizing antibodies triggered by previous infection and vaccination. Since December 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 has emerged five quickly spreading strains, designated variants of concern (VOCs), including the Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant, the Beta (B.1.351) variant, the Gamma (P.1) variant, the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant and the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant. These variants have a high number of the mutations in the spike protein that promotes viral cell entry through the angiotensin-converting enzyme -2 (ACE2). Mutations that have arisen in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein are of great concern due to their potential to evade neutralizing antibodies triggered by previous infection and vaccines. The Alpha variant emerged in the United Kingdom in the second half of 2020 that has spread quickly globally and acquired the E484K mutation in the United Kingdom and the United States. The Beta and Gamma variants emerged in South Africa and Brazil, respectively, that have additional mutations at positions E484 and K417 in the RBD. SARS-CoV-2 variants containing the combination of N501Y, E484K, and K417N/T mutations exhibit remarkably decreased sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies mediated by vaccination or previous infection. The Gamma variant may result in more severe disease than other variants do even in convalescent individuals. The Delta variant emerged in India in December 2020 and has spread to many countries including the United States and the United Kingdom. The Delta variant has 8 mutations in the spike protein, some of which can influence immune responses to the key antigenic regions of RBD. In early November 2021, the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant was first detected in Botswana and South Africa. The Omicron variant harbors more than 30 mutations in the spike protein, many of which are located within the RBD, which have been associated with increased transmissibility and immune evasion after previous infection and vaccination. Additionally, the Omicron variant contains 3 deletions and one insertion in the spike protein. Recently, the Omicron variant has been classified into three sublineages, including BA.1, BA.2, and BA.3, with strikingly different genetic characteristics. The Omicron BA.2 sublineage has different virological landscapes, such as transmissibility, pathogenicity and resistance to the vaccine-induced immunity compared to BA.1 and BA.3 sublineages. Mutations emerged in the RBD of the spike protein of VOCs increase viral replication, making the virus more infectious and more transmissible and enable the virus to evade vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies. Unfortunately, the emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 VOCs has tempered early optimism regarding the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. This review addresses the biological and clinical significance of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs and their impact on neutralizing antibodies mediated by existing COVID-19 vaccines.","AkkÃ„Â±z","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2022.849217","20220607","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; the Alpha variant; the Beta variant; the Delta variant; the Gamma variant; the Omicron variant; variant of concern","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32274,""
"Association Between Social Support and Perceived Stress: A Cross-Sectional Study on Staffs of the Epidemic Prevention During the Covid-19 Epidemic in China","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown considerably affects people's life in China, both physically and mentally. Staffs of the epidemic prevention and control in the community have played an irreplaceable role during community lockdown period in Wuhan. However, few studies have focused on their health status during epidemic prevention. This study aimed to appraise the available evidence of health conditions of them and explore the influencing factors. Used a multistage sampling method, we conducted a survey in staffs of the epidemic prevention and control in the community (<i>N</i> = 503). Descriptive analysis was used to characterize the respondents. <i>T</i>-test and analysis of variance were for group differences analysis. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to verify the scale validity, correlation analysis and pathway analysis and Structural equation model (SEM) was used to study the relationship between stress perception, social support, mental resilience and sleep quality. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 26.0, R version 4.1.3 and Mplus 8.3. The mean Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score of the respondents was 13.28 Ã‚Â± 7.31 and 51.1% had higher PSS score than the normal. In the absence of social support, people's sleeping quality and psychological resilience may decrease, their perceived stress may elevate and compromise mental health correspondingly. Social support could affect perceived stress directly, while Sleep quality and psychology resilience played significant partial mediating roles in social support affecting perceived stress. The mediating effects accounted for 50.8% of the total. Staffs of the epidemic prevention and control in the community suffered from poor sleep quality and high level of stress perception. Establishment of good social support may effectively reduce their stress and this effect is mediated by sleep quality and psychological resilience. Physical health status would affect the staffs' mental health and they more attention should be paid to those with poor physical health.","Zhang, Fu, Xu, Zhang, Peng, Tan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.844139","20220607","COVID-19; psychological resilience; sleep quality; social support; stress perception","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32275,""

"Predict, prevent and manage moral injuries in Canadian frontline healthcare workers and leaders facing the COVID-19 pandemic: Protocol of a mixed methods study","Moral injuries can occur when perpetrating, failing to prevent, or bearing witness to acts that transgress deeply held moral beliefs and expectations. The COVID-19 crisis highlighted the fact that psychosocial stressors at work, such as high emotional demands, are placing Canadian healthcare workers at risk of moral injuries. Evidence linking psychosocial stressors at work to moral injuries are needed to better predict, prevent and manage moral injuries, as these stressors are frequent and modifiable occupational risk factors. This protocol presents a study aiming to: 1) understand workplace events having the potential to either cause or reduce moral injuries, 2) predict the risk and severity of moral injuries using a disease prevention model, 3) identify biological signatures (biomarkers) associated with psychosocial stressors at work and moral injuries and 4) elaborate preliminary guidelines of organizational practices for frontline healthcare workers to reduce and manage moral injuries. This study is a mixed methods research with three components: qualitative, quantitative and biological. The data collection has been completed and because of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was adjusted to allow for gathering qualitative and quantitative data remotely. Frontline healthcare workers and leaders were included. Through focus groups and individual interviews, and an online questionnaire, events and psychosocial working conditions that may increase the risk of moral injuries will be documented. In addition, blood samples which were collected from a sub-sample of volunteer participants will measure an innovative set of biomarkers associated with vulnerability to stress and mental health. Data analyses are ongoing. We anticipate to identify workplace events that may trigger moral injuries. We expect that potential predictors of moral injury risk occurrence and severity will be identified from psychosocial stressors at work that can be improved by implementing organizational practices. We also expect to observe a different mental health state and biological inflammation signature across workers exposed compared to workers not exposed to psychosocial stressors at work. Based on these future findings, we intend to develop preliminary recommendations of organizational practices for managers. This research will contribute to expand our knowledge of the events in the workplace likely to generate or lessen the impact moral injuries, to build a model for predicting the risk of moral injuries at work, all in the specific context of the COVID-19 health crisis among healthcare workers.","Gilbert-Ouimet, Zahiriharsini, Biron, Langlois, MÃƒÂ©nard, Lebel, Pelletier, Duchaine, Beaulieu, Truchon","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmmh.2022.100124","20220607","COVID-19 pandemic; Healthcare workers; Mental health; Moral injuries; Psychosocial stressors at work","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32277,""
"Machine learning approach for anxiety and sleep disorders analysis during COVID-19 lockdown","The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 virus caused COVID-19 pandemic has led to various kinds of anxiety and stress in different strata and sections of the society. The aim of this study is to analyse the sleeping and anxiety disorder for a wide distribution of people of different ages and from different strata of life. The study also seeks to investigate the different symptoms and grievances that people suffer from in connection with their sleep patterns and predict the possible relationships and factors in association with outcomes related to COVID-19 pandemic induced stress and issues. A total of 740 participants (51.3% male and 48.7% female) structured with 2 sections, first with general demographic information and second with more targeted questions for each demographic were surveyed. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and General Anxiety Disorder assessment (GAD-7) standard scales were utilized to measure the stress, sleep disorders and anxiety. Experimental results showed positive correlation between PSQI and GAD-7 scores for the participants. After adjusting for age and gender, occupation does not have an effect on sleep quality (PSQI), but it does have an effect on anxiety (GAD-7). Student community in spite of less susceptible to COVID-19 infection found to be highly prone to psychopathy mental health disturbances during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study also highlights the connectivity between lower social status and mental health issues.

"Uncertainty and psychological distress during COVID-19: What about protective factors?","The present study examined the relationship between perceived uncertainty and depression/ anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic and it tested the moderating roles of resilience and perceived social support in this relationship. A cross-sectional study was conducted between March 31st and May 15th, 2020, using an online, multi-language, international survey built within Qualtrics. We collected data on sociodemographic features, perceived uncertainty, perceived social support, depression and anxiety symptoms, and resilience. A moderation model was tested using model 2 of Hayes' PROCESS macro for SPSS. The study included 3786 respondents from 94 different countries, 47.7% of whom reported residence in the United States of America. Results demonstrated that higher perceived uncertainty was associated with more symptoms of depression and anxiety. Higher resilience levels and higher perceived social support were associated with fewer depression and anxiety symptoms. The moderation hypotheses were supported; the relationship between uncertainty and symptoms of depression and anxiety decreased as levels of resilience increased and as perceived social support increased. The results suggest that resilience and social support could be helpful targets to reduce the negative effects of uncertainty on depression and anxiety symptoms.

"Emergency Medical Services Prehospital Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic in the US: A Brief Literature Review","This study aimed to analyze prehospital Emergency Medical Services (EMS) response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the US through a brief systematic review of available literature in context with international prehospital counterparts. An exploration of the NCBI repository was performed using a search string of relevant keywords which returned n=5128 results; articles that met the inclusion criteria (n=77) were reviewed and analyzed in accordance with PRISMA and PROSPERO recommendations. Methodical quality was assessed using critical appraisal tools, and the Egger's test was used for risk of bias reduction upon linear regression analysis of a funnel plot. Sources of heterogeneity as defined by P &lt; 0.10 or I^2 &gt; 50% were interrogated. Findings were considered within ten domains: structural/systemic; clinical outcomes; clinical assessment; treatment; special populations; dispatch/activation; education; mental health; perspectives/experiences; and transport. Findings suggest, EMS clinicians have likely made significant and unmeasured contributions to care during the pandemic via nontraditional roles, ie, COVID-19 testing and vaccine deployment. EMS plays a critical role in counteracting the COVID-19 pandemic in addition to the worsening opioid epidemic, both of which disproportionately impact patients of color. As such, being uniquely influential on clinical outcomes, these providers may benefit from standardized education on care and access disparities such as racial identity. Access to distance learning continuing education opportunities may increase rates of provider recertification. Additionally, there is a high prevalence of vaccine hesitancy among surveyed nationally registered EMS providers. Continued rigorous investigation on the impact of COVID-19 on EMS systems and personnel is warranted to ensure informed preparation for future pandemic and infectious disease responses.","Ventura, Denton, David, Schoenfelder, Mela, Lumia, Rudi, Haldar","https://doi.org/10.2147/OAEM.S366006","20220607","COVID-19; EMS; EMT; pandemic response; paramedic; prehospital","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32280,""
"Stressful Life Events and Depression During the Recurrent Outbreak of COVID-19 in China: The Mediating Role of Grit and the Moderating Role of Gratitude","COVID-19 has been exerting tremendous influence on an individual's physical behavior and mental health. In China, prolonged isolation may lead to depression among college students during the recurrent outbreak of COVID-19. We conducted this study to explore the relationship among stressful life events, grit, gratitude, and depression in college students during the recurrent outbreak of COVID-19. We investigated 953 college students from across China, with an average age of 20.38 (<i>SD</i>=1.39) years. Participants completed four scales (Stressful Life Events Scale, Oviedo Grit Scale, Gratitude Questionnaire, and Patients' Health Questionnaire Depression Scale-9 item). The present study found that (1) stressful life events were positively correlated with depression in college students; (2) grit mediated the positive relationship between stressful life events and depression; (3) gratitude moderated the relationship between grit and depression, and such that there was a stronger association between grit and depression for college students with high gratitude. This study was of great significance for studying the relationship between stressful life events and depression in Chinese college students during the recurrent outbreak of COVID-19. Results indicated that grit and gratitude of college students may be the main targets of depression prevention and intervention. The research conclusion has theoretical and reference value for solving and preventing depression in college students during the recurrent outbreak of COVID-19.","Liu, Ye, Hu","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S360455","20220607","COVID-19; Chinese college students; depression; gratitude; grit; stressful life events","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32281,""
"[Distress and resilience of Paris-Saclay medical students during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic]","In France, during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, all care workers have been mobilized. Despite this, the strong demand for care has put the health system under great strain. To overcome this overload of world, 86 medical students of Paris-Saclay University came to help some hospital services. They replaced caregivers, nurses or stretcher bearers under ""degraded care"" conditions. At the university level, the closure of the faculty due to generalized lockdown disrupted the training of these future doctors who were in second, third or fourth year of training (pre-clinical). This exploratory study proposes to collect the impact of the experience of these students during the first wave of the pandemic in order to better understand the difficulties they encountered, as well as the resources they exploited during this period. Using a mixed approach, both quantitative on the one hand and qualitative on the other hand, medical students from Paris-Saclay were interviewed through a retrospective questionnaire distributed in December 2020. The quantitative part of the questionnaire assessed their psychological distress (6-item Kessler scale) and their resilience (Brief Resilience Scale). The qualitative part of the questionnaire included various open questions concerning the motivations to participate, the difficulties encountered, the impact of the situation on their interpersonal relationships or their university course. A total of 46 responses from medical students from the University of Paris-Saclay were collected. This constitutes a response rate of 55%. Half of them were second or third year medical students. They were assigned to emergency departments, resuscitation or units dedicated to the care of patients with COVID-19. The average psychological distress score is 7.13. The average resilience score is 3.14. From these results, several categories of students were analyzed according to the elements found in their answers to the open questions. Almost all the students reported wanting to contribute to the collective effort and help hospital services. For some students, it was also a way of making themselves useful while escaping lockdown. The students were exposed to difficult working conditions, the distress of families and the deaths of numerous patients. Their involvement also had an impact on their relationships with their families: they could feel more isolated, or be afraid of infecting them. Their university work was very disrupted by their investment in the hospital: fatigue, concentration problems, lack of motivation could lead them to a form of dropping out of university. The results of this study are part of the context of a particular health crisis. They show medical students exposed to significant psychosocial risks in a period of stress. It seems important to identify what leads some students to develop good resilience capacities. The COVID-19 pandemic acts as an indicator of difficulties that were already present but that it is exacerbating: the link between the faculty, the student and the hospital, mentoring, supervision, support, university workload, hospital working conditions, psycho-pedagogical support for students and support for most struggling studentsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ These results invite us to rethink the educational engineering of medical studies so that they make it possible, even in a health crisis, to ensure the quality of training and the quality of life of medical students.","Rolland","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2022.05.004","20220607","Medical education; Medical students; Mental health; Psychological stress; Psychosocial risks; Resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32282,""
"A synthesis of surveys examining the impacts of COVID-19 and emergency remote learning on students in Canada","During the COVID-19 pandemic numerous institutions around the world have surveyed students to gain an understanding of their experiences. While these surveys are valuable at a local institutional level, it is unclear as to which findings from individual surveys reflect the broader higher education environment, and which patterns may be consistent across student surveys. It is worthwhile to synthesize survey findings in order to explore patterns and potentially new understandings that may arise from such analysis. In this paper, we reviewed and synthesized 21 surveys examining the impacts of COVID-19 and emergency remote learning on approximately 155,000 student respondents in Canada. Findings reveal that the impacts of COVID-19 and emergency remote learning on students centered around (1) educational experiences, (2) mental health and wellbeing, (3) financial concerns, (4) impact on future plans, and (5) recommendations for future practice.","Houlden, Veletsianos","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12528-022-09323-4","20220607","COVID-19; Canada; Emergency remote learning; Relational approach; Student surveys; Synthesis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32283,""
"The prospective relationship between loneliness, life satisfaction and psychological distress before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK","Mental wellbeing in the UK seems to have deteriorated significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the rates of loneliness, life satisfaction and psychological distress taking longer to return to the pre-pandemic levels than elsewhere. Nevertheless, there is little knowledge about the interactions between these outcomes, or the factors that played a role in the rates of change. The current study aims to address this gap by simultaneously investigating changes in loneliness, life satisfaction and psychological distress in the UK from pre-pandemic levels to those between April and November 2020, while critically assessing the role of a range of social ecological influencing factors. Longitudinal data from Understanding Society (N=3475) were used to explore the changes in loneliness, life satisfaction and psychological distress from pre-pandemic levels (2017-2019) through November 2020, the interactions between these outcomes, and the role of individual, social, community and geographic factors in the rates of change, using multivariate latent growth curve model. Loneliness, life satisfaction and psychological distress deteriorated minimally between April and November 2020, compared to the pre-pandemic levels (2017-2019), while the rate of change in each outcome influenced the rates of change in the other two. Key individual (age, gender, physical health), social (number of friendsÃ‚Â and similarity to them), and environmental (neighbourhood quality) variables influenced baseline scores and the rates of change. Considering significant dynamic associations between loneliness, life satisfaction and psychological distress, we argue that interventions to tackle any one of the outcomes may have beneficial effects on others, while highlighting malleable factors and individual and community-level interventions to tackle loneliness.","Milicev, Qualter, Goodfellow, Inchley, Simpson, Leyland, Kharicha, Long","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10389-022-01719-x","20220607","interventions; mental health; neighbourhoods; social ecological model","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32284,""
"A systematic review and meta-analysis of long term physical and mental sequelae of COVID-19 pandemic: call for research priority and action","The long-term physical and mental sequelae of COVID-19 are a growing public health concern, yet there is considerable uncertainty about their prevalence, persistence and predictors. We conducted a comprehensive, up-to-date meta-analysis of survivors' health consequences and sequelae for COVID-19. PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library were searched through Sep 30th, 2021. Observational studies that reported the prevalence of sequelae of COVID-19 were included. Two reviewers independently undertook the data extraction and quality assessment. Of the 36,625 records identified, a total of 151 studies were included involving 1,285,407 participants from thirty-two countries. At least one sequelae symptom occurred in 50.1% (95% CI 45.4-54.8) of COVID-19 survivors for up to 12 months after infection. The most common investigation findings included abnormalities on lung CT (56.9%, 95% CI 46.2-67.3) and abnormal pulmonary function tests (45.6%, 95% CI 36.3-55.0), followed by generalized symptoms, such as fatigue (28.7%, 95% CI 21.0-37.0), psychiatric symptoms (19.7%, 95% CI 16.1-23.6) mainly depression (18.3%, 95% CI 13.3-23.8) and PTSD (17.9%, 95% CI 11.6-25.3), and neurological symptoms (18.7%, 95% CI 16.2-21.4), such as cognitive deficits (19.7%, 95% CI 8.8-33.4) and memory impairment (17.5%, 95% CI 8.1-29.6). Subgroup analysis showed that participants with a higher risk of long-term sequelae were older, mostly male, living in a high-income country, with more severe status at acute infection. Individuals with severe infection suffered more from PTSD, sleep disturbance, cognitive deficits, concentration impairment, and gustatory dysfunction. Survivors with mild infection had high burden of anxiety and memory impairment after recovery. Our findings suggest that after recovery from acute COVID-19, half of survivors still have a high burden of either physical or mental sequelae up to at least 12 months. It is important to provide urgent and appropriate prevention and intervention management to preclude persistent or emerging long-term sequelae and to promote the physical and psychiatric wellbeing of COVID-19 survivors.","Zeng, Zhao, Yan, Li, Lu, Liu, Ni, Mei, Yuan, Shi, Li, Fan, Yuan, Vitiello, Kosten, Kondratiuk, Sun, Tang, Liu, Lalvani, Shi, Bao, Lu","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-022-01614-7","20220607","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32285,""
"A systematic review and meta-analysis on prevalence of and risk factors associated with depression, anxiety and insomnia in infectious diseases, including COVID-19: a call to action","Infectious disease epidemics have become more frequent and more complex during the 21<sup>st</sup> century, posing a health threat to the general public and leading to psychological symptoms. The current study was designed to investigate the prevalence of and risk factors associated with depression, anxiety and insomnia symptoms during epidemic outbreaks, including COVID-19. We systematically searched the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, OVID, Medline, Cochrane databases, bioRxiv and medRxiv to identify studies that reported the prevalence of depression, anxiety or insomnia during infectious disease epidemics, up to August 14<sup>th</sup>, 2020. Prevalence of mental symptoms among different populations including the general public, health workers, university students, older adults, infected patients, survivors of infection, and pregnant women across all types of epidemics was pooled. In addition,Ã‚Â prevalence of mental symptoms during COVID-19 was estimated by time using meta-regressionÃ‚Â analysis. A total of 17,506 papers were initially retrieved, and a final of 283 studies met the inclusion criteria, representing a total of 948,882 individuals. The pooled prevalence of depression ranged from 23.1%, 95% confidential intervals (95% CI: [13.9-32.2]) in survivors to 43.3% (95% CI: [27.1-59.6]) in university students, the pooled prevalence of anxiety ranged from 25.0% (95% CI: [12.0-38.0]) in older adults to 43.3% (95% CI: [23.3-63.3]) in pregnant women, and insomnia symptoms ranged from 29.7% (95% CI: [24.4-34.9]) in the general public to 58.4% (95% CI: [28.1-88.6]) in university students. Prevalence of moderate-to-severe mental symptoms was lower but had substantial variation across different populations. The prevalence of mental problems increased over time during the COVID-19 pandemic among the general public, health workers and university students, and decreased among infected patients. Factors associated with increased prevalence for all three mental health symptoms included female sex, and having physical disorders, psychiatric disorders, COVID infection, colleagues or family members infected, experience of frontline work, close contact with infected patients, high exposure risk, quarantine experience and high concern about epidemics. Frequent exercise and good social support were associated with lower risk for these three mental symptoms. In conclusion, mental symptoms are common during epidemics with substantial variation across populations. The population-specific psychological crisis management are needed to decrease the burden of psychological problem and improve the mental wellbeing during epidemic.","Yuan, Zheng, Wang, Sun, Gong, Huang, Chen, Liu, Zhong, Su, Gao, Lu, Wang, Liu, Que, Yang, Zhang, Jing, Yuan, Zeng, Vitiello, Patel, Fazel, Minas, Thornicroft, Fan, Lin, Yan, Shi, Shi, Kosten, Bao, Lu","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-022-01638-z","20220606","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32286,""
"The impact of COVID-19-related quarantine on psychological outcomes in patients after cardiac intervention: a multicenter longitudinal study","Mandatory quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic had substantial negative consequences on psychological health in the general population. Depression, anxiety, and insomnia were reported to increase the morbidity and mortality risk in cardiac patients after cardiac interventions. Nonetheless, a gap in the evidence appeared regarding the effects of COVID-19-related quarantine on psychological outcomes in patients after cardiac interventions. The present study aimed to longitudinally investigate the effects of quarantine on depressive, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms in a group of patients who underwent cardiac intervention. Seventy-three patients admitted for cardiac rehabilitation completed a psychological assessment before and a reassessment after the quarantine and were included in the quarantine group. The control group included 76 patients who completed both evaluations before the quarantine. Depressive (Beck Depression Inventory-II; BDI-II), anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory-II; BAI), and insomnia (Sleep Condition Indicator; SCI) symptoms were evaluated in both groups at one (assessment) and eight (reassessment) months after cardiac intervention. The statistical analyses revealed that at reassessment, the quarantine group showed higher global depressive, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms than the control group and increased cognitive symptoms of depression. A higher presence of clinically relevant depressed patients was seen in the quarantine group. The present results showed that the COVID-19-related mandatory quarantine negatively affected psychological outcomes in patients after cardiac intervention, increasing the probability for these patients to be depressed. This, in turn, could influence patients' health in a critical period for morbidity and mortality risk. This underlines the priority of integrating and improving targeted mental health support as the pandemic continues, especially for cardiac patients.","Patron, Messerotti Benvenuti, Ponchia, Del Piccolo, Gentili, Palomba","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-022-01984-0","20220606","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32287,""

We compared demographic and clinical characteristics of children with mental health ED visits before and during the pandemic. We conducted an interrupted time series analysis to determine changes in visit rates. We identified 8,127 pediatric mental health ED visits (58.5% female, 54.3% White, Not Hispanic/Latino and 42.4% age 13-15). During the pandemic, visits for suicide or self-injury increased 6.69% (95% CI 4.73, 8.65), and visits for disruptive, impulse control, conduct disorders increased 1.94% (95% CI 0.85, 3.03). Mental health ED visits by children with existing mental health diagnoses increased 2.29% (95% CI 0.34, 4.25). Mental health ED visits that resulted in medical admission increased 4.32% (95% CI 3.11, 5.53). The proportion of mental health ED visits at community hospitals increased by 5.49% (95% CI 3.31, 7.67). Mental health ED visit rates increased at the onset of the pandemic (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] 1.27, 95% CI 1.06, 1.50), followed by a monthly increase thereafter (aIRR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02, 1.06).

"Changes in appetite during quarantine and their association with pre-COVID-19 mental and physical health","The COVID-19 Pandemic resulted in high levels of fear, anxiety, and stress. People with pre-existing physical and mental health conditions may have been more affected by the sudden changes in daily habits during the initial months of global quarantine imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic. We designed the Quarantine, Anxiety, and Diet (QUAD) Survey to investigate the effect of pre-existing health conditions on the relationship of COVID-19 stress and food behavior. The anonymous survey was distributed online and only adults were eligible to participate. The results showed that responders with pre-existing health conditions differed from healthy participants in eating behavior during this time of stress. Compared to those classified as healthy, fewer people with pre-existing physical illness showed an increase in appetite with stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Responders with pre-existing psychiatric illness were more likely to show increases or decreases in appetite with stress compared to healthy responders. Furthermore, higher BMI was associated with higher rate of increased appetite, whereas low BMI showed a higher rate of decreased appetite, both compared to normal BMI. The QUAD Survey demonstrated that individuals with pre-COVID-19 psychiatric conditions are at a higher risk of maladaptive food behavior under stress.

"A community-based feasibility randomized controlled study to test food-specific inhibitory control training in people with disinhibited eating during COVID-19 in Italy","The aim of this study was to expand the evidence on the feasibility and impact of food-specific inhibitory control training in a community sample of people with disinhibited eating. Recruitment and data collection were conducted during the COVID-19 outbreak, in Italy. Ninety-four adult individuals with disinhibited eating were randomised to one of two conditions: App-based food-specific inhibitory control training or waiting list. Participants were assessed at baseline, end of intervention (2Ã‚Â weeks following baseline) and follow-up (oneÃ‚Â week later). The assessment measures included questionnaires about eating behaviour and mood. Seventy-three percent of the sample reported a diagnosis of binge eating disorder, and 20.4% a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa. Retention rates were 77% and 86% for the food-specific inhibitory control training and the waiting list conditions, respectively. Almost half of the participants allocated to the training condition completed the ""recommended"" dose of training (i.e., 10 or more sessions). Those in the training condition reported lower levels of wanting for high-energy dense foods (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05), a trend for lower levels of perceived hunger (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.07), and lower levels of depression (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Binge eating symptoms, disinhibition, wanting for high-energy dense foods, stress and anxiety were significantly lower at end of intervention, compared to baseline (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05). Findings corroborated the feasibility of food-specific inhibitory control training, and its impact on high-energy dense foods liking. The study expands the evidence base for food-specific inhibitory control training by highlighting its impact on perceived hunger and depression. The mechanisms underlying these effects remain to be clarified.

"Effect of a group-based acceptance and commitment therapy program on the mental health of clinical nurses during the COVID-19 sporadic outbreak period","To develop and implement of a group-based acceptance and commitment therapy program in helping clinical nurses with mental health problems during the sporadic COVID-19 outbreak period. In the face of the continuing COVID-19pandemic, clinical nurses have a high risk of mental health issues. A quasi-experimental design was used. 226 nurses were recruited from four general hospitals to receive 10 sessions of acceptance and commitment therapy program. The symptom checklist-90, perceived stress scale and Connor-Davidson resilience scale were used to assess nurses' mental health symptom, perceived stress and psychological resilience at pre-intervention and 4-week post-intervention. The mean attendance sessions was 5.78. The symptom checklist-90 score was significantly lower at post-intervention than pre-intervention (P&lt;0.01), and there were no significant changes of perceived stress and psychological resilience. There were significant correlations among the changed rates of mental health, perceived stress, psychological resilience (P&lt;0.01). The acceptance and commitment therapy program was effective in relieving mental health symptoms for clinical nurses, and could protect clinical nurses' perceived stress and psychological resilience. However, a randomized controlled trial is needed to confirm the findings. To facilitate clinical nurses' psychological health in crisis situation, nursing management team should provide and allocated appropriate resources to support the health care providers.","Jing, Zhang, Liu, Zhang, Zhang, Tang, Bi","https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13696","20220606","COVID-19; acceptance and commitment therapy; mental health; nurse; psychological support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32293,""
"Loneliness and depressive symptoms differ by sexual orientation and gender identity during physical distancing measures in response to COVID-19 pandemic in Germany","During the COVID-19 pandemic, physical distancing measures to prevent transmission of the virus have been implemented. The effect of physical distancing measures on loneliness especially for vulnerable groups remained unclear. Thus, we aimed to investigate loneliness in relation with depressive symptoms among lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, inter, asexual, and queer (LGBT) persons compared with cis-heterosexual persons during the pandemic. We conducted an online survey during the first two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. The survey contained self-categorizations regarding sexual orientation and gender identity, questions on loneliness, social contacts, depressive symptoms, and healthcare. Descriptive and regression analysis and propensity score matching across cohorts was conducted using R; 2641 participants took part in first wave of the survey and 4143 participants in the second wave. The proportion of lonely people was higher in the second wave compared with the first wave. LGBT persons were more lonely than cis-heterosexual persons. In both waves, being LGBT was associated with depressive symptoms, but loneliness mediated the effect, even when adjusting for social contacts. Psychologists and other practitioners should be aware that LGBT clients might have an increased risk for loneliness and depressive symptoms and of the potential burden of the pandemic measures.","Herrmann, Oeser, Buspavanich, Lech, Berger, Gellert","https://doi.org/10.1111/aphw.12376","20220606","LGBT; depressive symptoms; loneliness; minority stress; physical distancing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32294,""
"Mental Health Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Therapists at Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility","Healthcare workers have faced extraordinary work-related stress in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology providers at inpatient rehabilitation facilities may represent a distinct at-risk subgroup for work-related stress during the pandemic due to the usual nature of their job duties, including close physical contact and extended treatment times. To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on work-related stress and occurrence of depression and anxiety in physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech-language pathologists during the first surge of COVID-19 hospitalizations. Cross-sectional survey. Academic, freestanding inpatient rehabilitation facility. Survey responses were collected from 38 therapists. A 26-item electronic questionnaire containing a mix of multiple-choice and open-ended questions. Positive screens for depression or anxiety as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the General Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale, respectively. Seven individuals (19%) scored at or above the clinically significant cutoff of 10 on each the PHQ-9 and GAD-7, corresponding to increased risk for depression and anxiety. Therapists under 30-years-old had significantly higher GAD-7 scores compared to therapists between 30-39Ã¢â‚¬â€°years-old (p&lt;0.05). Occupational stress was attributed to a number of causes including concerns for health and safety, unpredictable changes in hospital protocols and work assignments, acquisition of additional work duties, concerns about the ability to provide high-quality patient care in a restricted environment, and the psychological toll of caring for patients with or recovering from COVID-19. This cross-sectional survey highlights the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on occupational stress and mental health of therapists working at an inpatient rehabilitation facility during the first surge of COVID-19 hospitalizations.

"Screening for SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Students at the Medical University of Warsaw, Poland Between November 15 and December 10, 2021 Using a Single Lateral Flow Test, the PanbioÃ¢â€žÂ¢ COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test","BACKGROUND Education was significantly affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Online learning affects the quality of learning as well as the mental health status of students. Regular screening for COVID-19 may be crucial to provide practical classes during the pandemic. The present study aimed to analyze the usefulness of rapid antigen tests for on-campus COVID-19 screening in real-life conditions at a medical university in Poland. MATERIAL AND METHODS This screening study was carried out among students attending practical classes at the Medical University of Warsaw, Poland between November 15 and December 10, 2021, during which a series of rapid antigen tests (PanbioÃ¢â€žÂ¢ COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device, nasal) were performed by healthcare professionals (nurses). Out of 104 student groups selected for the study (n=1847 students), 423 individuals from 63 student groups were tested at least once (22.9% response rate). A total of 2295 samples were collected. RESULTS Among the participants, 3.4% (n=15) had positive test results. Out of 15 COVID-19 cases, 14 were vaccinated. At least 1 positive COVID-19 case was detected in 8 student groups. In 3 student groups, we observed Ã¢â€°Â¥2 infections that occurred at intervals, which may suggest student-to-student SARS-CoV-2 transmission. CONCLUSIONS This study produced real-world data from a COVID-19 screening study and confirmed the usefulness of the rapid antigen test (PanbioÃ¢â€žÂ¢ COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device nasal) for on-campus COVID-19 screening prior to practical classes. Maintaining a high percentage of participants is crucial to ensuring the effectiveness of on-campus COVID-19 screening.","Gujski, Mularczyk-Tomczewska, Raciborski, Samel-Kowalik, SamoliÃ…â€žski, Olczak-Kowalczyk, Jankowski","https://doi.org/10.12659/MSM.936962","20220606","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32296,""

"Experiences, Challenges, and Coping Strategies of Frontline Healthcare Providers in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic in Kelantan, Malaysia","In the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, frontline healthcare providers who are engaged in the direct diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients face a high risk of infection and inadequate protection from contamination, overwork, frustration, and exhaustion. These impose significant psychological and mental health concerns for frontline healthcare providers. This study aimed to explore the experiences and challenges faced and coping strategies adopted by frontline healthcare providers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Kelantan, Malaysia. This phenomenological approach to qualitative study used a telephone-based in-depth interview that followed a semistructured interview guide. The number of frontline healthcare providers was based on saturation theory. All the participants recruited fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria from May to July 2020 in Raja Perempuan Zainab II Hospital. All interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic data analysis using NVIVO version 10 was performed. The 10 respondents involved in this study consisted of doctors, medical assistants, and nurses. The findings were divided into four main themes: invaluable experiences during the pandemic, challenges, coping strategies, and future expectations. The providers responded well in facing the disease even though they felt psychologically disturbed at the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare providers perceived themselves as being more resilient and less vulnerable to psychological impacts than they were before the pandemic.","Che Yusof, Norhayati, Azman","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2022.861052","20220606","COVID-19; healthcare providers; pandemic; psychological; qualitative","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32298,""
"What kinds of social networks protect older adults' health during a pandemic? The tradeoff between preventing infection and promoting mental health","When the coronavirus emerged in early 2020, older adults were at heightened risk of contracting the virus, and of suffering mental health consequences from the pandemic and from the precautions designed to mitigate it. In this paper, we examine how social networks <i>prior</i> to the pandemic helped to shape health beliefs, behaviors, and outcomes among older adults during its onset, focusing on (1) perceived risk of COVID-19, (2) preventative health behaviors, and (3) mental health, including loneliness, perceived stress, depression, and anxiety. Drawing on the longitudinal Social Networks in Alzheimer Disease study, we find that networks high in <i>bridging social capital</i> predict greater perceived risk and more precautions taken, but worse mental health. In contrast, networks high in <i>bonding social capital</i> predict less perceived risk and fewer precautions taken, but better mental health. We discuss this apparent tradeoff between physical and mental health.","Coleman, Manchella, Roth, Peng, Perry","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2022.05.004","20220606","Bonding; Bridging; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Mental health; Older adults; Pandemic; Physical health; Social capital; Social networks","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32299,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on mental health and emotional well-being of older adults","Older adults faced unique challenges in the pandemic due to their increased vulnerability to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its complications. Pandemic-related restrictions such as physical distancing, stay-at-home orders, lock-down, and mandatory face cover affected older adults in unique ways. Additionally, older adults experienced psychosocial concerns related to discrimination based on ageism and emotional distress from exposure to conflicting messages in the media. They experienced several forms of loss and associated grief and survivor guilt. Pandemic added to their loneliness and social isolation. Furthermore, older adults experienced the fear and anxiety related to COVID and the fear of contracting the disease and dying from it. Pandemic experience included events potential to generate the desire and capability for suicide. Several studies report varying symptoms such as loneliness, anxiety, and depression among older adults during the pandemic. However, during the initial months of the pandemic, there were reports on coping and resilience among this population. The impact of COVID-19 on older adults' mental health may have long-term implications. This narrative review examines the impact of COVID-19 on older adults' mental health and psychosocial wellbeing.

"Educational, psychosocial, and clinical impact of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic on medical students in the United States","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered education, exams, and residency applications for United States medical students. To determine the specific impact of the pandemic on US medical students and its correlation to their anxiety levels. An 81-question survey was distributed <i>via</i> email, Facebook and social media groups using REDCap<sup>TM</sup>. To investigate risk factors associated with elevated anxiety level, we dichotomized the 1-10 anxiety score into low (Ã¢â€°Â¤ 5) and high (Ã¢â€°Â¥ 6). This cut point represents the 25<sup>th</sup> percentile. There were 90 (29%) shown as low anxiety and 219 (71%) as high anxiety. For descriptive analyses, we used contingency tables by anxiety categories for categorical measurements with chi square test, or mean Ã‚Â± STD for continuous measurements followed by <i>t</i>-test or Wilcoxson rank sum test depending on data normality. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator was used to select important predictors for the final multivariate model. Hierarchical Poisson regression model was used to fit the final multivariate model by considering the nested data structure of students clustered within State. 397 medical students from 29 states were analyzed. Approximately half of respondents reported feeling depressed since the pandemic onset. 62% of participants rated 7 or higher out of 10 when asked about anxiety levels. Stressors correlated with higher anxiety scores included ""concern about being unable to complete exams or rotations if contracting COVID-19"" (RR 1.34; 95%CI: 1.05-1.72, <i>P</i> = 0.02) and the use of mental health services such as a ""psychiatrist"" (RR 1.18; 95%CI: 1.01-1.3, <i>P</i> = 0.04). However, those students living in cities that limited restaurant operations to exclusively takeout or delivery as the only measure of implementing social distancing (RR 0.64; 95%CI: 0.49-0.82, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.01) and those who selected ""does not apply"" for financial assistance available if needed (RR 0.83; 95%CI: 0.66-0.98, <i>P</i> = 0.03) were less likely to have a high anxiety. COVID-19 significantly impacted medical students in numerous ways. Medical student education and clinical readiness were reduced, and anxiety levels increased. It is vital that medical students receive support as they become physicians.

"New life, new feelings of loss: Journaling new motherhood during Covid-19","In this article we analyze the longitudinal journals of 32 Pandemic Journaling Project (PJP) participants who were pregnant, planned a pregnancy, or gave birth between January 2020 and July 2021. Employing a grounded theory approach, we coded journals in NVivo for emerging themes related to the influence of the Covid-19 pandemic on perinatal experiences in North America and Europe. In the paper we first provide some brief background on perinatal mental health and on the particular conditions for pregnancy and birth during Covid-19, before introducing major themes that emerged from the data, along with three in-depth case studies. We argue that the new mothers and prospective mothers in our sample associated new life with new feelings of loss during Covid-19. New motherhood during Covid-19 has meant for PJP participants a loss of seemingly irretrievable opportunities and moments that they see as necessary to establish themselves as mothers and integrate their babies into their families through a process of ""kinning"" (Howell, 2003). Feelings of loss associated with disruptions to kinning may be partially responsible for the increase in perinatal mental distress observed during the pandemic.","Larotonda, Mason","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmmh.2022.100120","20220606","Covid-19; Kinning; Motherhood; Pandemic journaling project; Perinatal mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32303,""
"Depressive, Anxiety Symptom Frequency and Related Factors Among Prisoners During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Northeastern Ethiopia, a Cross-Sectional Study","Among the more than 10 million people imprisoned around the world, the rate of mental illness is higher than among the general population for various reasons. Although rates of mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety in this population may have changed as a response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak and other factors, to our knowledge, no related studies have been conducted related to depression and anxiety in this population during the pandemic. Therefore, this study aimed to assess depression, anxiety, and associated factors among Dessie City prisoners during the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak. An institution-based cross-sectional survey was conducted in October 2020. A total of 420 prisoners were selected <i>via</i> a systematic sampling technique. PHQ-9 depression scale, generalized anxiety disorder-7 questionnaire, Oslo 3-item social support scale, insomnia severity index, and Brief COPE scale were used. Data were entered by using Epi-Data version 3.1 and finally exported to Statistical Package for Social Science Software version 21 for analysis. We fitted a multiple binary logistic regression model. Finally, an adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was reported and factors with a <i>p</i>-value &lt; 0.05 were considered as significant for depression and anxiety. This study showed that 279 (66.4%) of imprisoned people had major depressive disorder with 95% CI of (61.4, 70.6), while 281 (66.9) had generalized anxiety disorder with 95% CI of (61.9, 71.9).

"Improving University Students' Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence From an Online Counseling Intervention in Italy","The mental health of university students is significantly affected when faced with public health emergencies and requires specific interventions to help support and prevent any long-lasting effects that the pandemic may have on their mental health status. This study aims to evaluate the impact of an online individual counseling intervention provided by the University of Foggia and carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health status of a sample of university students. 32 Italian undergraduate students took part in a one-group pretest-posttest research design. The data was gathered in two times: before the start of the counseling intervention (T1), positive and negative affect, satisfaction with life, global mental distress, anxiety, stress, and future time perspective were collected, at the end of the counseling intervention (T2), the same dimensions were measured. A one-way repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was performed, and single Bonferroni-corrected dependent <i>t</i>-tests were conducted on variables showing a significant change over time. The results showed that positive affect, subjective well-being, and future time perspective increased significantly after the intervention. In contrast, the participants reported significantly lower levels of negative affect, global mental distress, state and trait anxiety, as well as perceived stress over time. The study demonstrates the promising impact of online counseling intervention and its efficient contribution in promoting the well-being of university students. The results contribute to the ongoing debate concerning the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on young adults, helping professionals develop more efficient clinical and psychological interventions.","Celia, Tessitore, Cavicchiolo, Girelli, Limone, Cozzolino","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.886538","20220606","COVID-19 pandemic; Italy; anxiety; mental distress; mind-body therapies; stress; time perspective; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32305,""
"COVID-19 and Youth Psychopathological Distress in Umbria, Central Italy: A 2-Year Observational Study in a Real-World Setting","Adolescents and young adults represent a vulnerable population in the context of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The present retrospective study aims to investigate the pandemic's psychological impact on adolescents and young adults by analyzing data from an outpatient mental health service dedicated to youths in Umbria, central Italy. The clinical charts of subjects aged 14-24 who first accessed the service in the timeframe between March 1st, 2019, and February 28th, 2021, were reviewed. Subjects were divided into two subgroups according to the period of time when they accessed the service (pre-COVID-19 vs. during- COVID-19 outbreak). Bivariate analyses were performed using the Chi-square test and the Welch's <i>t</i>-test. A secondary analysis was performed considering only subjects suffering from psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, data concerning individuals who were already followed by the service before the pandemic were analyzed by the McNemar's test and the <i>t</i>-paired test to assess changes in treatment features. The number of new accesses during the pandemic period remained stable. After the emergency onset, youths accessing the service showed a higher prevalence of anxiety disorders (<i>p</i> = 0.022). During the COVID-19 period, services were more frequently delivered by using a digital mental health approach (<i>p</i> = 0.001). Psychopharmacological treatment was more frequently prescribed among subjects that were referred to the service after the pandemic onset (<i>p</i> = 0.033).

"Self-Sacrifice in a Distressful and Threatening Environment: The Consequences of the COVID-19 Crisis in Intensifying Workplace Violence","The stress and mental pressure resulting from the challenges posed by the COVID-19 crisis exacerbated occupational stressors such as workplace violence against nurses even though nurses were endangering their lives to provide high-quality care and reduce patients' suffering. Therefore, the present study aimed to explain Iranian nurses' experiences of workplace violence during the COVID-19 crisis. This study was conducted using a qualitative approach. Twenty-five semi-structured interviews were conducted with nurses who had experienced workplace violence at COVID-19 referral centers in Kerman during the COVID-19 crisis. Conventional content analysis was used to analyze the data, and the research was reported <i>via</i> the COREQ checklist. Analysis of the findings led to one main category, ""nurses' self-sacrifice in a distressful and threatening environment,"" and four subcategories, which included ""omitting entertainment and fun activities,"" ""having challenging duties in unsafe conditions,"" ""receiving insufficient support,"" and ""nurses' toleration of disrespect."" Crises can exacerbate workplace violence toward nurses. Thus, it is necessary to design educational programs and prevention strategies to manage the destructive psychological and occupational impact of the crises on nurses. Nurses should receive training in crisis management to cope with the intensified aggressive behavior of managers, colleagues, patients, and patient companions during the crisis. Policy-makers must be prepared to deal with crises, and they should take measures to improve nurses' mental health and quality of care.","Ebrahimi Rigi, Mangolian Shahrbabaki, Ahmadi, Ravari","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.848059","20220606","COVID-19; crisis; nurses; self-sacrifice; workplace violence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32307,""
"Relationship Between Mental Health and Death Anxiety During COVID-19 Pandemic in Dental Staff and Students: A Cross-Sectional Study","We aimed to determine the mental health and death anxiety among dental staff and students in school of dentistry during COVID-19 pandemic. It was a cross-sectional study among students (<i>n</i> = 300) and staff (<i>n</i> = 60) in School of dentistry in Ahvaz University of Medical Sciences during 2020. The instruments were a demographic questionnaire, Death Anxiety Scale, and Kessler Questionnaire. Data was analyze by using SPSS version 22, in all tests, the significance level was set at &lt;0.05. The mean age of dental students and personnel was 23.96 and 40.08 years, respectively. The mean scores of death anxiety were higher in dental staff (8.53) than students (6.02) and the mean scores of mental health status were higher in students (14.78) than personnel (9.18). This indicates that death anxiety was higher in Dental staff, while students were in better mental health status. The correlation coefficient between death anxiety and mental health status was 0.366 among students (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), while it was 0.429 among dental staff (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), showing a medium relationship between death anxiety and mental health in both groups. The overall findings represent a significant but contradictory relationship between mental health status and death anxiety among dental staff and students during the prevalence of COVID-19 pandemic. This suggests the impact of confounding factors in this area, which can be studied by future researchers and policy makers to design health promotion interventions.","Jazaiery, Rezaeifar, Sayyah, Cheraghi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.849868","20220606","COVID-19; Iran; death anxiety; dental staff and students; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32308,""
"The Protective Effect of Health Literacy on Reducing College Students' Stress and Anxiety During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic threatens people's health and well-being all around the world, resulting in increased stress and anxiety. Existing literature has found health literacy has a protective effect on health, and the study has taken a closer look at the effects of health literacy on perceived stress and anxiety among Chinese college students. With structural questionnaires, a cross-sectional survey was conducted to collect the responses of 1,251 participants from different universities in Hubei and Guangdong, China. Participants' health literacy and perceived stress and anxiety symptoms were evaluated. Only 11.83% of the participants reported sufficient health literacy. Compared with college students from Hubei and Guangdong with a major in medicine showed a higher percentage of having sufficient literacy. Moreover, having sufficient health literacy showed a protective effect in reducing the risk of stress (OR = 0.14, 95%CI= 0.01-0.04; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and anxiety (OR = 0.02, 95%CI = 0-0.61; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Health literacy was found to have a protective effect in reducing anxiety and stress among college students. This effect has remained among students from different majors and locations. However, it is noteworthy that the overall level of health literacy is relatively low among college students, particularly among those from Hubei Province or with non-medical majors. Therefore, more effort should be put into developing health education programs promoting health literacy and mental health on campus.","Ying, Jing, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.878884","20220606","COVID-19; anxiety; college students; health literacy; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32309,""
"Satisfaction with activity-support and physical home-workspace characteristics in relation to mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","Previous research indicates that employees' mental health might be influenced by their satisfaction with physical office characteristics, such as noise, daylight, and ventilation. However, similar research on mental health in relation to working from home (WFH) is limited. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the relationships between satisfaction with physical home workspace characteristics and support of work activities and mental health while WFH during the COVID-19 pandemic. Relationships were analysed using a path analysis approach, based on a sample of 1219 office workers, who had to work fully from home. The internal relationships between the ten considered mental health variables were also studied. Results showed that satisfaction with daylight, artificial light, greenery, and views outside were directly related to one of the mental health variables and indirectly to several others. Surprisingly, satisfaction with temperature, noise, ventilation, and air quality did not seem to play a role at the home workplace. In addition, unlike at the office, personal characteristics did not relate to workspace satisfaction nor perceived support of activities at home. Furthermore, all mental health variables were related to at least one other mental health variable. Workplace managers could use these insights to formulate recommendations for employees on how to design their home-workspace.","Bergefurt, Weijs-PerrÃƒÂ©e, Appel-Meulenbroek, Arentze, de Kort","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2022.101826","20220606","COVID-19; Mental health; Office; Physical workspace characteristics; Well-being; Working from home","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32310,""
"Exploring characteristics of increased suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan using provisional governmental data","The Japanese age-standardised death rate of suicide (SDR) had decreased during 2009-2019, but increased in 2020-2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to explain the trend change in the SDR during the pandemic, disaggregated by prefecture, gender, suicide method and household, as compared to predicted SDR derived from pre-pandemic data, using linear mixed-effect and hierarchical linear regression models with robust standard error analyses. The SDR was lower during March-June 2020 (during the first wave of the pandemic), but higher during July-December 2020 than the predicted SDR. In 2021, males' SDR was nearly equal to the predicted SDR, whereas females' SDR in the metropolitan-region (17.5%: 95% confidence interval: 13.9-21.2%) and non-metropolitan-region (24.7%: 95% confidence interval: 22.8-26.7%) continued to be higher than the predicted SDR. These gender- and region-dependent temporal fluctuations of SDR were synchronised with those of SDRs caused by hanging, at home and single-person-households. Additionally, the rising number of infected patients with the SARS-CoV-2 and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnostic examinations were positively (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.024) and negatively (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>Ã‚Â =-0.002) related to the SDR during the pandemic, respectively.

"COVID-19 Misinformation on Social Media: A Scoping Review","Social media allows for easy access and sharing of information in real-time. Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, social media has been used as a tool for public health officials to spread valuable information. However, many Internet users have also used it to spread misinformation, commonly referred to as ""fake news."" The spread of misinformation can lead to detrimental effects on the infrastructure of healthcare and society.Ã‚Â The purpose of this scoping review was to identify the sources and impact of COVID-19 misinformation on social media and examine potential strategies for limiting the spread of misinformation. A systemized search of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science electronic databases using search terms relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic, social media, misinformation, or disinformation was conducted. Identified titles and abstracts were screened to select original reports and cross-checked for duplications. Using both inclusion and exclusion criteria, results from the initial literature search were screened by independent reviewers. After quality assessment and screening for relevance, 20 articles were included in the final review. The following three themes emerged: (1) sources of misinformation, (2) impact of misinformation, and (3) strategies to limit misinformation about COVID-19 on social media. Misinformation was commonly shared on social media platforms such as Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, messaging applications, and personal websites. The utilization of social media for the dissemination of evidence-based information was shown to be beneficial in combating misinformation.Ã‚Â The evidence suggests that both individual websites and social media networks play a role in the spread of COVID-19 misinformation. This practice may potentially exacerbate the severity of the pandemic, create mistrust in public health experts, and impact physical and mental health. Efforts to limit and prevent misinformation require interdisciplinary, multilevel approaches involving government and public health agencies, social media corporations, and social influencers.","Joseph, Fernandez, Kritzman, Eaddy, Cook, Lambros, Jara Silva, Arguelles, Abraham, Dorgham, Gilbert, Chacko, Hirpara, Mayi, Jacobs","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.24601","20220606","coronavirus; covid-19; disinformation; facebook; misinformation; pandemic; sars-cov-2; social media; twitter; youtube","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32312,""
"Did the COVID-19 Pandemic Affect the Management of Patients With Acute Appendicitis?","Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed the lives and habits of people all over the world. In this study, it was planned to investigate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the diagnosis and treatment duration of acute appendicitis (AA), morbidity and mortality. Methods The data of patients who were operated on with the diagnosis of AA in our clinic between March 2019 and March 2021, divided into pre-COVID and post-COVID periods, were analyzed. Patients diagnosed with AA, who had the only appendectomy perioperatively, and who had complete preoperative blood analysis and radiological imaging data were included in the study. Results The time from the onset of symptoms to the time of admission to the hospital was statistically significantly longer than in the post-COVID group (p=0.04). During the COVID-19 pandemic period, the use of ultrasonography was statistically significantly reduced (p&lt;0.01); computed tomography use increased (p&lt;0.001). Laparoscopic appendectomy as a surgical technique decreased statistically significantly during the pandemic period (p=0.02). Postoperative complications and the postoperative complication severity degrees were not statistically significant between periods (p=0.24, p=0.68). The risk for the occurrence of postoperative complications in COVID-19 positive patients was statistically higher (p=0.01) (OR: 9.38 95% CI: 1.96 - 44.88). Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic had caused delays in the admission and diagnosis of patients who might need surgery due to AA. Postoperative complication frequency and complication severity classification were not affected. COVID-19 positivity was a risk factor for complex AA presenting with periappendicular abscess, gangrenous and perforated appendix.","Tazeoglu, Esmer, Arslan, Dag","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.24631","20220606","appendicitis; complication; covid-19 pandemic; laparoscopic appendectomy; open appendectomy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32313,""
"Do Attitudes, Mental Health Status, and Interpersonal Factors Predict COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy at the Early Phase of the Pandemic? A Longitudinal Study in Chinese College Students","The present study examined whether and how attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine (i.e., safety, efficacy, and price), mental health statuses (i.e., perceived stress and depression), and interpersonal factors (i.e., online social support, perceived social support) would predict COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. The two-wave longitudinal surveys were conducted in December 2019 and 2020 in Chinese medical college students (<i>N</i> = 194). Well- validated measures were used, including the Perceived Stress Scale, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, the Online Social Support Questionnaire, and the Perceived Social Support Scale. Perceived safety, efficacy, price of COVID-19 vaccine, vaccine hesitancy, and actual intake were also measured. Only 2.1% of participants had been vaccinated against COVID-19 in the early stages of the pandemic; 13.4% intended to get vaccinated in the next 3 months, and 66% intended to have it in the next 12 months upon follow-up. Multiple regression analyses revealed that perceived stress (ÃŽÂ²m = -0.15, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and depression (ÃŽÂ²m = -0.15, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) were risk factors for positive attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine; online social support (ORm = 1.41, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) and positive attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine (ORm = 1.83, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) were protective factors of intention to get vaccinated in future.

"Coping and Resilience Among Endurance Athletes During the COVID-19 Pandemic","COVID-19 lockdowns constrained the training opportunities of athletes resulting in physical and mental hardship. In this study, athletes involved in the outdoor endurance sports of running, cycling or swimming were recruited through Facebook groups and using online mailing lists. The final sample (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3,551) consisted of 576 female respondents (16.2%), and 2,975 male respondents (83.8%). The mean age of participants was 44.13Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°years (minÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°16, maxÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°83, and <i>SD</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°9.84). An online survey was designed to measure variables relevant to athletes' mental health; resilience and emotion regulation strategies; mobility restrictions; training routines; personal involvement in endurance sports; age; gender; and country of residence. Overall, the results of our study indicate that during lockdown, decreases in training volume, lower lockdown-specific resilience, and holding more negative perceptions about lockdown mobility restrictions (perceived strictness) all contributed to perceived barriers to training. In the analysis, athletes' relative observance of mobility restrictions was controlled for. Athletes exhibiting high personal commitment to their sports displayed: greater lockdown resilience, a greater use of adaptive coping strategies, and lower levels of perceived barriers to training.","Harman, Dessart, Puke, Philippe","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.811499","20220606","COVID-19; athletes; coping; endurance; pandemic; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32315,""
"The Effectiveness of the Digital Environment and Perfectionism on Anxiety and Depression in the Light of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Northern Iraq","This investigation is intended to explore the effect of the digital environment as well as perfectionism during the COVID-19 pandemic on anxiety and depression. The study used a mixed-methods design; a mixed research methodology was used regarding explanatory design by using a qualitative sub-sample from quantitative sample data. The researcher conducted the study on a sample of 980 students and non-students smartphone and internet users using both qualitative (self-reported) and quantitative (questionnaires) approach. Three different questionnaires were used: The Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale, Beck Depression (BD), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BA). On the other hand, the researcher designed a self-reported interview for the qualitative part that included 5 major questions and 10 sub-questions. The gathered data were investigated using SPSS version 22 to analyze the collected data for this study, and simple descriptive statistics and coding were used. The results denote that the digital environment is significantly correlated with multidimensional perfectionism in a low positive manner for students. However, the correlation effects for non-students are significantly high as evidenced by a significant positive correlation.

"The Experiences of Parents and Infants Using a Home-Based Art Intervention Aimed at Improving Wellbeing and Connectedness in Their Relationship","During the period of COVID-19 restrictions, we offered vulnerable families with 0 to 3 year old children boxes of art resources and guided creative activities to do together at home. This paper explores families' experiences of this intervention, highlighting their perceptions of change in wellbeing and attachment. There is a developing case for the social benefits of art, including the impact of arts on mental health and on the wellbeing of children. However, we know that social factors impact upon arts participation, and existing inequalities and mental health difficulties have been exacerbated in the context of the pandemic. This project aimed to adapt to restrictions, to provide a meaningful remote intervention, supporting parent-infant dyads to have positive interactions through art making. We sought to explore the benefits of this intervention for infants and parents with a view to understanding more about the psychological benefits of art participation and about ways to engage families into art making, as well as thinking about how best we can evidence these kinds of arts in health interventions. Preliminary findings showed promising outcomes from the art boxes and this paper brings together the full results, primarily based on interviews with sixteen parents and four referrers alongside collected feedback. We highlight potential mechanisms for change within the intervention and detail the perceived impact of the art boxes in supporting attachment. Parents felt that the art-boxes facilitated changes in their own wellbeing that would make them more available to connection, and recognised changes for babies that reflected their increased capacity to mentalise about their child. Importantly, there were also concrete changes for the dyad that represented improved connection, such as more playful time together and increased shared attention and eye contact. Our observations suggest that the quality of the parent-infant relationship benefited from home-based art intervention, and we speculate about the potential efficacy of this approach beyond the pandemic.","Armstrong, Ross","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.732562","20220606","art; attachment; connection; dyads; infant; parent; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32317,""
"Patients' Responses to COVID-19 Pandemic: The Relationship Between Potential Pandemic-Induced Disruptions, Ontological Security, and Adaptive Responses in Taizhou, China","The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the social environment of most individuals around the world and has profoundly impacted people's lives, ontological security, and behavior. Among them, the patients are one of the groups most influenced by the pandemic. The present research aimed to study the relationship of COVID-19 pandemic-induced disruption to patients' daily lives, ontological security, and patients' responses to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and explore the role of ontological security. This article was based on an online structured questionnaire study conducted among hospitalized patients in Taizhou Hospital of Zhejiang Province, Taizhou, China, from 8 July to 11 August 2021. We analyzed the data using the multivariate regression model and mediation analysis method. The results showed that the higher the pandemic-induced disruption to inpatients' lives, the better behavior would be taken by hospitalized patients to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and the perceived scarcity of ontological security played a mediating role in this process. Higher pandemic-induced disruption to patients' lives increased the ontological insecurity which further, in turn, reduced patients' good practice toward measures to prevent the novel coronavirus. These findings provided direct evidence for the relationship between pandemic-induced disruption, scarcity of ontological security, and patients' prevention behavior. It suggested that there was a need to emphasize patients' ontological security. Overall, these findings suggested that it is important to emphasize the mental health among patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, and implement strategies to offer psychological support when needed.","Luo, Wu, Wang, Zhang, Cheng, Chen, Tung","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.865046","20220606","COVID-19; adaptive practice; ontological security; pandemic control; pandemic-induced disruption","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32318,""
"Coping Strategy, Life Style and Health Status During Phase 3 of Indian National Lockdown for COVID-19 Pandemic-A Pan-India Survey","The implementation of timely COVID-19 pan-India lockdown posed challenges to the lifestyle.

This is a pan-India cross-sectional survey study. CHAS was designed by 11 experts in 3 Delphi rounds (CVR = 0.85) and was circulated through various social media platforms, from 9th May to 31st May 2020, across India by snowball circulation method. CHAS forms of 23,760 respondents were downloaded from the Google forms. Logistic regression using R software was used to compare vulnerable (&gt;60 years and with chronic diseases) with non-vulnerable groups. There were 23,317 viable respondents. Majority of respondents included males (58Ã‚Â·8%). Graduates/Postgraduates (72Ã‚Â·5%), employed (33Ã‚Â·0%), businessmen (6Ã‚Â·0%), and professionals (9Ã‚Â·7%). The vulnerable group had significantly (OR 1.31, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) higher representation of overweight individuals as compared to non-vulnerable group. Regular use of tobacco (OR 1.62, <i>p</i> = 0.006) and other addictive substances (OR 1.80, <i>p</i> = 0.039) showed increased vulnerability. Respondents who consume junk food (OR 2.19, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and frequently snack (OR 1.16, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) were more likely to be vulnerable.

"Intelligent Recognition and Analysis of Negative Emotions of Undergraduates Under COVID-19","The outbreak and spread of COVID-19 has brought a tremendous impact on undergraduates' study and life, and also caused anxiety, depression, fear and loneliness among undergraduates. If these individual negative emotions are not timely guided and treated, it is easy to cause the amplification of social negative emotions, resulting in individual and collective irrational behavior, and ultimately destroy social stability and trust foundation. Therefore, how to strengthen the analysis and guidance of negative emotions of undergraduates has become an important issue to be urgently solved in the training of undergraduates. This paper presents a weight and structure double-determination method. Based on this method, a Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBFNN) classifier is constructed for recognizing negative emotions of undergraduates. After classifying the input psychological crisis intervention scale samples by the RBFNN classifier, recognition of negative emotions for undergraduates are divided into normal, mild depression, moderate depression and severe depression.

"Social and Economic Factors Associated With Subthreshold and Major Depressive Episode in University Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Depression is one of the most frequent mental health disorders in college students and variations according to social and economic factors have been reported, however, whether social and economic variations also exist in subthreshold depression is still unknown, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of subthreshold depressive episode (SDE) and major depressive episode (MDE) and to examine the association between social and economic factors with SDE and MDE in undergraduate students during the COVID-19 pandemic. The participants were 1,577 college students from a university in the south of Chile (64.6% females, 22 years old on average). The participants took an online survey in November 2020 which collected information about social and economic variables, depressive symptoms, and perceived social support. Bivariate and multinomial logistic regression analysis were used. The results showed a high prevalence of SDE (14.3%) and MDE (32.3%) in the sample. Belonging to a social group and perceiving positive social support were the only variables examined that were associated with SDE. Instead, female sex, poorer quintiles, living with other relatives but not parents, economic difficulties due to the pandemic, being a parent, and perceiving positive social support were associated with MDE. Subthreshold and threshold depressive symptoms are frequent in college students, and associations with social and economic factors differ according to the level of such symptoms. These results should be considered in the development of tailored preventive and early interventions for depression in college students.","Langer, Crockett, Bravo-Contreras, Carrillo-Naipayan, Chaura-MariÃƒÂ³, GÃƒÂ³mez-Curumilla, HenrÃƒÂ­quez-Pacheco, Vergara, Santander, AntÃƒÂºnez, Baader","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.893483","20220606","college students; depression; social support; socioeconomic; subthreshold depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32321,""
"The Use of Photovoice Methodology to Assess Health Needs and Identify Opportunities Among Migrant Transgender Women in the US-Mexico Border","Psychosocial, social and structural conditions have rarely been studied among transgender women in the U.S.-Mexico Border. This study used Photovoice methodology to empower migrant transgender women of color (TWC) to reflect on realities from their own perspectives and experiences and promote critical dialogue, knowledge, and community action. Sixteen participants documented their daily experiences through photography, engaged in photo-discussions to assess needs and identify opportunities, and developed a community-informed Call to Action. Four major themes emerged from the participants' photographs, discussions, and engagement: (1) mental health, (2) migration experiences and challenges, (3) stigma, discrimination, and resiliency, and (4) impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Through active community engagement, a Call to Action was developed. A binational advisory committee of decision makers and scholars reviewed a set of recommendations to better respond to the needs of TWC in the U.S.-Mexico Border. Photovoice served as an empowerment tool for TWC to assess the myriad of syndemic conditions, including mental health, stigma, discrimination and COVID-19, affecting them daily and identify initiatives for change.","Chavez-Baray, Martinez, Chaparro, Moya","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.865944","20220606","Photovoice; U.S.-Mexico border; health; mental health; migrants; transgender","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32322,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on China's Stock Market Volatility, During and After the Outbreak: Evidence From an ARDL Approach","In this study, we empirically investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on China's stock price volatility during and after its initial outbreak, using time-series daily data covering the period from July to October, 2020 and 2021, respectively. In the estimation, the ARDL bounds test approach was employed to examine the existence of co-integration and the relationship of long-run and short-run between the new infection rates and stock price volatility, as stable and unstable variables are mixed. The inner-day and inter-day volatility, based on the Shanghai (securities) composite index, are estimated in separate empirical models. In addition, the Inter-bank overnight lending rate (IBOLR) is controlled in order to consider the effect of liquidity and investment cost. We find that in the initial year (2020) of the epidemic, the new infection rate is negatively correlated to stock prices in the short-term, whereas no significant evidence existed in the long-term, regardless of model specifications. However, after the epidemic's outbreak (2021), the result depicts that new infections increased stock prices in the long-term, and depressed its inner-day volatility in the short-term, which is inconsistent with most investigations. This phenomenon may be due to the fact that investors were more concerned about the withdrawal of monetary easing and fiscal stimulus, which were introduced to fight against the epidemic's impact on economy, than the epidemic itself. This study complements the limitations of most existing studies, which just focus on the period of the epidemic's outbreak, and provides insight into macroeconomic policy making in the era of the post COVID-19 epidemic such as the structural and ordered exit of the stimulating policies, intervention in IBOLR and balance social and economic sustainability.","Jin","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.810102","20220606","ARDL bounds test; COVID-19; IBOLR; policy withdraw; stock volatility","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32323,""
"A Moderated Mediation Model Explaining the Relationship Between Risk-Group Membership, Threat Perception, Knowledge, and Adherence to COVID-19 Behavioral Measures","COVID-19 is a threat to individual and global health, thus, reducing the disease's spread is of significant importance. However, adherence to behavioral measures against the spread of COVID-19 is not universal, even within vulnerable populations who are at higher risk of exposure to the virus or severe COVID-19 infection. Therefore, this study investigates how risk-group membership relates to adherence to COVID-19 behavioral measures, whether perceived threat of COVID-19 is a mechanism explaining this relationship, and whether knowledge about COVID-19 moderates these effects. We conducted a web-based survey (<i>N</i> = 4,096) representative of the adult population in Germany with regard to gender, age (18 to 74), and province. Therein, we assessed risk group membership with two indicators (risk of exposure to COVID-19 and risk of severe COVID-19 infection), perceived COVID-19 threat with the Perceived Coronavirus Threat Questionnaire, knowledge about COVID-19 with a knowledge test; and adherence to six behavioral measures to protect against the spread of COVID-19 (e.g., keeping distance, using mouth-nose protection, and following contact restrictions). We used moderated mediation models to test whether perceived threat mediates the relationship between risk-group membership and adherence and whether knowledge about COVID-19 moderates this relationship. We found that risk group members had more perceived COVID-19 threat and that knowledge about COVID-19 increased perceived threat. Moreover, risk group membership had a positive direct effect on adherence to most behavioral measures and risk group members with less knowledge about COVID-19 violated measures more frequently. Risk-group membership also had positive indirect effects on adherence via perceived COVID-19 threat. The moderated indirect effects of threat indicate that threat led to more adherence when knowledge was low, but lost relevance as knowledge increased. The results may help to evaluate disease-regulation measures and to combat the pandemic more effectively. For example, increasing COVID-19 knowledge in the general population could increase adherence to COVID-19 behavioral measures. However, policy makers should be mindful that this could also have negative mental health implications as knowledge increases perceived COVID-19 threat.","Sattler, Taflinger, Ernst, Hasselhorn","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.842368","20220606","COVID-19; adherence to COVID-19 measures; knowledge; non-pharmaceutical intervention; perceived COVID-19 threat; public health; risk group membership","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32324,""

This research explores the relationship between mental health-related problems and undergraduate students' dropout rates amid the COVID-19 pandemic and within a civil engineering program. The study is quantitative descriptive, with a non-experimental and longitudinal design. Results show that the dropout rates of civil engineering students from a private university have increased, comparing before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily due to mental health-related problems. Three strong tendencies within these rates have been detected, directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Mental health impact of the Middle East respiratory syndrome, SARS, and COVID-19: A comparative systematic review and meta-analysis","Over the last few decades, 3 pathogenic pandemics have impacted the global population; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2. The global disease burden has attributed to millions of deaths and morbidities, with the majority being attributed to SARS-CoV-2. As such, the evaluation of the mental health (MH) impact across healthcare professionals (HCPs), patients and the general public would be an important facet to evaluate to better understand short, medium and long-term exposures. To identify and report: (1) MH conditions commonly observed across all 3 pandemics; (2) Impact of MH outcomes across HCPs, patients and the general public associated with all 3 pandemics; and (3) The prevalence of the MH impact and clinical epidemiological significance. A systematic methodology was developed and published on PROSPERO (CRD42021228697). The databases PubMed, EMBASE, ScienceDirect and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were used as part of the data extraction process, and publications from January 1, 1990 to August 1, 2021 were searched. MeSH terms and keywords used included <i>Mood disorders, PTSD, Anxiety, Depression, Psychological stress, Psychosis, Bipolar, Mental Health, Unipolar, Self-harm, BAME, Psychiatry disorders and Psychological distress</i>. The terms were expanded with a 'snowballing' method. Cox-regression and the Monte-Carlo simulation method was used in addition to <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> and Egger's tests to determine heterogeneity and publication bias. In comparison to MERS and SARS-CoV, it is evident SAR-CoV-2 has an ongoing MH impact, with emphasis on depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. It was evident MH studies during MERS and SARS-CoV was limited in comparison to SARS-CoV-2, with much emphasis on reporting symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress and sleep disturbances.

"Virtual versus Face-to-Face Cognitive Behavioral Treatment of Depression: Meta-Analytic Test of a Noninferiority Hypothesis and Men's Mental Health Inequities","Global rates of depression have increased significantly since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unclear how the recent shift of many mental health services to virtual platforms has impacted service users, especially for the male population which are significantly more likely to complete suicide than women. This paper presents the findings of a rapid meta-analytic research synthesis of 17 randomized controlled trials on the relative efficacy of virtual versus traditional face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in mitigating symptoms of depression. Participants' aggregated depression scores were compared upon completion of the therapy (posttest) and longest follow-up measurement. The results supported the noninferiority hypothesis indicating that the two modes of CBT delivery are equally efficacious, but the results proved to be significantly heterogeneous indicating the presence of moderating effects. Indirect suggestive evidence was found to support moderation by gender; that is, depressed males may benefit more from virtual CBT. Perhaps, this field's most telling descriptive finding was that boys/men have been grossly underrepresented in its trials. Future trials ought to oversample those who have been at this field's margins to advance the next generation of knowledge, allowing us to best serve people of all genders, those who live in poverty, Indigenous, Black, and other Peoples of Colour, as well as any others at risk of being marginalized or oppressed in contemporary mental health care systems.","Charron, Gorey","https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/2972219","20220607","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32331,""

Seventy percent of participants reported sleep disturbances and 80% reported symptoms of anxiety during the pandemic. Help-seeking behavior was found only in one third of them. Hours of sleep reduced from 7.12 to 6.2h, which can be related with the increase in 28.2% of dissatisfaction with sleep duration during the pandemic. The highest frequency of complaints related to sleep was difficulty to fall asleep three or more times a week (going from 27.6% before the pandemic to 58.9% during the pandemic; p&lt;0.001).

"Nutrition, Epigenetics, and Major Depressive Disorder: Understanding the Connection","Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a complex, multifactorial disorder of rising prevalence and incidence worldwide. Nearly, 280 million of people suffer from this leading cause of disability in the world. Moreover, patients with this condition are frequently co-affected by essential nutrient deficiency. The typical scene with stress and hustle in developed countries tends to be accompanied by eating disorders implying overnutrition from high-carbohydrates and high-fat diets with low micronutrients intake. In fact, currently, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has drawn more attention to this underdiagnosed condition, besides the importance of the nutritional status in shaping immunomodulation, in which minerals, vitamins, or omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (Ãâ€°-3 PUFA) play an important role. The awareness of nutritional assessment is greater and greater in the patients with depression since antidepressant treatments have such a significant probability of failing. As diet is considered a crucial environmental factor, underlying epigenetic mechanisms that experience an adaptation or consequence on their signaling and expression mechanisms are reviewed. In this study, we included metabolic changes derived from an impairment in cellular processes due to lacking some essential nutrients in diet and therefore in the organism.

"COVID-19 presenting after Elective Off-pump Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting and Lessons Learned","Cases of COVID-19 presenting after elective cardiac surgery are rare. Published literature suggests that such cases have a high morbidity and mortality rate. Here, we report a case of COVID-19 presenting after an elective, isolated off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB). A 65-year-old obese, hypertensive, hypothyroid lady, with moderate left ventricular dysfunction, presenting with unstable angina, tested negative for COVID-19 at admission, having undergone thrombolysis for a recent inferior wall myocardial infarction, at an outside centre, and coronary angiography revealing left main triple vessel disease, developed signs and symptoms of COVID-19, four days after OPCAB. She was diagnosed with moderate COVID-19 infection. Subsequent contact tracing revealed that her husband was suffering from mild COVID-19 infection and was managed in home isolation. Isolation and early supportive management with moist oxygen, steroids, intravenous antibiotics, zinc and vitamin C helped the patient recover. She was followed up at one month, six months, one year and at eighteen months and has been doing well. A strong clinical suspicion and repeat testing for COVID-19 is required as the diagnosis may often be missed with COVID-19 mimicking the signs and symptoms of post-cardiotomy syndrome. Preferentially dealing with such cases off-pump, thereby avoiding cardio pulmonary bypass-related complications, may improve outcomes. Isolation and early supportive management help. Adequate follow-up is required in all such cases as cardiovascular complications are common, alongside known long-term sequelae, like anxiety, depression, cardio-respiratory complications, venous thromboembolism and even postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.","Bhattacharya, Bandyopadhyay, Pahari, Das, Dey","https://doi.org/10.1186/s43044-022-00286-6","20220607","COVID-19; Case report; Coronary artery bypass; Coronary artery disease; Off-pump","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32335,""
"Impact of the Early COVID-19 Pandemic on Burn Care: A Multi-National Study","This qualitative study documents and analyzes COVID-19's impacts on burn care in twelve nations. Burn care saw valuable improvements in surgical techniques, skin grafting, and other acute treatments during the decades before the COVID-19 pandemic which increased severely burned patients' survival rates and quality of life. Detailed interviews, conducted in the twelve nations reveal that the COVID-19 pandemic greatly affected the delivery of acute and rehabilitation services for burn patients. Resources have been suctioned away from non-COVID healthcare and burn care has not been spared. Acute, post-acute rehabilitation, and mental health services have all suffered. Weak preparation has deeply burdened health care services in most nations, resulting in lower access to care. Access problems have accelerated innovations like telehealth in many nations. The spread of misinformation through social and traditional media has contributed to the varied responses to COVID-19. This compounded problems in health care delivery. Burn care providers delivered services for survivors during extremely difficult circumstances by continuing to furnish acute and long-term services for patients with complex disease.

"Mental distress before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal study among communities affected by Ebola virus disease in the DR Congo","Associated with high mortality rate, fear, and anxiety, Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) is a significant risk factor for mental distress. This longitudinal study aims to investigate the prevalence and predictors associated with mental distress among populations affected by EVD outbreaks in the Province of Equateur in DR Congo. Surveys were administered in zones affected by the 2018 EVD outbreak in Equateur Province with a 16-month interval. Measures assessed sociodemographic characteristics, mental distress (GHQ-12), COVID-19 and EVD exposure and related stigmatization, and Resilience. Models of logistic regression and path analysis were used to estimate factors related to mental distress outcomes. Prevalence of mental distress decreased from Wave 1 to Wave 2 (Mental distress<sub>T1</sub>= 57.04%, Mental distress<sub>T2</sub>= 40.29%, x<sup>2</sup>= 23.981, p&lt;.001). Clinical mental distress score at follow-up was predicted by greater levels of exposure to Ebola at baseline (B= .412, p&lt;.001) and at Wave 2 (B= .453, p&lt;.001) as well as Ebola stigmatization at baseline (B= .752, p&lt;.001), and Protestant religion (B= .474, p=.038). Clinical mental distress score at follow-up was significantly associated with higher levels of exposure to COVID-19 (B= .389, p=.002) and COVID-19 related stigmatization (B= .480, p&lt;.001). COVID-19 related stigmatization partially mediated the association between exposure to EVD (Time 1) and mental distress (B= .409, p&lt;.001). Although a decrease in mental distress symptoms was observed, its prevalence remains high. The results show that mental health programs need to develop better health and education communication strategies to reduce stigmatization.","CÃƒÂ©nat, Farahi, Dalexis, Darius, Bukaka, Balayulu-Makila, Luyeye, Derivois, Rousseau","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114654","20220606","COVID-19; Democratic Republic of the Congo; Ebola virus disease; Mental distress; Stigmatization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32337,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Mental Health of Users with Mental Illness of Home Visit Nursing Services in Japan","This study aims to clarify the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of users with mental illness of home visit nursing services. We sent a questionnaire to 1,740 home visit nursing station managers, 374 (21.5%) of whom responded. The total number of valid responses was 328, which amounted to 87.7% of the returned surveys. In total, 103 (31.4%) stations reported that their users' mental health deteriorated owing to the spread of COVID-19. Eighty-nine (86.4%) stations reported that their users' anxiety increased. More than 80% of the stations explained infection control measures to their users, but 194 (59.1%) stations answered that their users found it challenging to practice cleanliness. A total of 207 (63.1%) stations answered that the promotion of strategies for coping with stress is necessary for their users. Users with mental illness are vulnerable to stress and have a higher risk of death due to COVID-19. Thus, they should be carefully observed and referred to facilities if required. Home visit nursing staff have an important role to play in the preservation of the well-being of their users with mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kodama, Takaki","https://doi.org/10.7888/juoeh.44.151","20220607","COVID-19; home visit nursing; infection control; mental health; stress coping.","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32338,""
"Hypertension is associated with antibody response and breakthrough infection in health care workers following vaccination with inactivated SARS-CoV-2","Several types of vaccines have been developed to prevent the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is important to understand whether demographic and clinical variables affect the effectiveness of various types of vaccines. This study analysed the association between demographic/clinical factors, antibody response and vaccine effectiveness in healthcare workers vaccinated with inactivated virus. We enrolled 101 healthcare workers who received two doses of inactivated viral vaccine (CoronaVac). Blood samples were analysed at 1, 3, and 5Ã‚Â months after the second dose of vaccination. Data regarding demographic characteristics, medical histories, and clinical parameters were collected by interview and medical examination. In a separate retrospective study, we analysed the incidence of vaccine breakthrough infection on 2714 healthcare workers who received two doses of inactivated viral vaccine. Medical histories and demographic data were collected using a structured self-reported questionnaire. We found that antibody titres markedly increased at 1Ã‚Â month after vaccination but gradually decreased at 3-5Ã‚Â months post-vaccination. We observed a significant association between age (Ã¢â€°Â¥40Ã‚Â years) and antibody level, whereas sex and body mass index (BMI) exhibited no effect on antibody titres. Amongst clinical variables analysed, high blood pressure and history of hypertension were significantly correlated with lower antibody titres. Consistently, we found a significant association in the retrospective study between hypertension and the incidence of breakthrough infection. In conclusion, our results showed that hypertension is associated with lower antibody titres and breakthrough infection following COVID-19 vaccination. Thus, blood pressure control might be important to improve the efficacy of inactivated virus vaccine.","Soegiarto, Wulandari, Purnomosari, Dhia Fahmita, Ikhwan Gautama, Tri Hadmoko, Edwin Prasetyo, Aulia Mahdi, Arafah, Prasetyaningtyas, Prawiro Negoro, Rosita Sigit Prakoeswa, Endaryanto, Gede Agung Suprabawati, Tinduh, Basuki Rachmad, Astha Triyono, Wahyuhadi, Budi Keswardiono, Elyana Wardani, Mayorita, Kristiani, Baskoro, Fetarayani, Kartika Nurani, Oceandy","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.05.059","20220606","Antibody response; Breakthrough infection; COVID-19; Comorbidity; Hypertension; Inactivated viral vaccine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32339,""
"Longitudinal changes in mental health following the COVID-19 lockdown: Results from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe","To limit the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, different restriction measures were implemented aiming to ensure social distancing and isolation. However, it is well known that such measures may lead to adverse effects on mental health. Data from 36,478 adults aged 50+ from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) was used to investigate the longitudinal changes in mental health from pre-COVID-19 to during the pandemic (summer 2020), considering national restriction levels across the 27 SHARE countries. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to assess changes in feeling 'sad or depressed', sleeping problems, and loneliness. Compared with the mental health status before the COVID-19 outbreak, participants had a lower risk of feeling 'sad or depressed' (-14.4%) and having sleeping problems (-9.9%), while the risk of feeling lonely slightly increased (1.2%). However, for individuals in countries with high restriction levels, the risk of feeling 'sad or depressed' was attenuated and the risk of loneliness was greater compared to countries with low restriction levels. Older people felt less depressed and had fewer sleeping problems during the pandemic as compared to before the pandemic, while the risk of loneliness increased slightly. Stricter policy measures attenuated the otherwise positive impact on mental health. Future studies are needed to investigate the long-term effects of COVID-19 on mental health.","Wester, Bovil, Scheel-Hincke, Ahrenfeldt, MÃƒÂ¶ller, Andersen-Ranberg","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annepidem.2022.05.010","20220606","COVID-19; Europe; SHARE; loneliness; mental health; sad or depressed; sleeping problems; stringency index","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32340,""

"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on depression and hopelessness in infertile women","COVID-19 has negative and sometimes irreversible effects on infertile women. This study aimed to investigate hopelessness and depression in infertile women whose treatment has been delayed due to COVID-19. This case-control study was conducted online on 172 infertile women. The case group included infertile women under treatment whose treatment was delayed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the control group was selected from infertile women who were not under infertile treatment. This study was conducted between April and December 2021 in Jahrom, Iran. Beck hopelessness standard questionnaire (BHS) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were used to collect data, and <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05 was considered significant.

"Associations between COVID-19 lockdown and post-lockdown on the mental health of pregnant women, postpartum women and their partners from the Queensland family cohort prospective study","There are very few developed countries where physical isolation and low community transmission has been reported for COVID-19 but this has been the experience of Australia. The impact of physical isolation combined with low disease transmission on the mental health of pregnant women is currently unknown and there have been no studies examining the psychological experience for partners of pregnant women during lockdown. The aim of the current study was to examine the impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown in March 2020 and post lockdown from August 2020 on the mental health of pregnant women or postpartum women and their partners. Pregnant women and their partners were prospectively recruited to the study before 24Ã‚Â weeks gestation and completed various questionnaires related to mental health and general wellbeing at 24Ã‚Â weeks gestation and then again at 6Ã‚Â weeks postpartum. The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) were used as outcome measures for the assessment of mental health in women and DASS-21 was administered to their partners. This analysis encompasses 3 time points where families were recruited; before the pandemic (Aug 2018-Feb 2020), during lockdown (Mar-Aug 2020) and after the first lockdown was over (Sept-Dec 2020). There was no significant effect of COVID-19 lockdown and post lockdown on depression or postnatal depression in women when compared to a pre-COVID-19 subgroup. The odds of pregnant women or postpartum women experiencing severe anxiety was more than halved in women during lockdown relative to women in the pre-COVID-19 period (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.47; 95%CI: 0.27-0.81; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.006). Following lockdown severe anxiety was comparable to the pre-COVID-19 women. Lockdown did not have any substantial effects on stress scores for pregnant and postpartum women. However, a substantial decrease of over 70% in the odds of severe stress was observed post-lockdown relative to pre-COVID-19 levels. Partner's depression, anxiety and stress did not change significantly with lockdown or post lockdown. A reproductive age population appear to be able to manage the impact of lockdown and the pandemic with some benefits related to reduced anxiety.","Clifton, Kumar, Borg, Rae, Boyd, Whittingham, Moritz, Carter, McPhail, Gannon, Ware, Dixson, Bora, Hurst","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-022-04795-9","20220607","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Mental health; Postpartum; Pregnancy; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32344,""

"History of childhood mistreatment and the psychological health consequences of COVID-19 for older adults","We examine the associations between childhood mistreatment (emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, and emotional neglect) and older adults' changes in depressive symptoms from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic (September 2018-June 2020). Using a community-based sample of older adults in North Florida (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°581), we used ordinary least-squares regression to estimate associations between childhood mistreatments and depressive symptoms in June 2020, controlling for baseline symptoms and demographic characteristics. Additional models tested whether emotion regulation and social support attenuated associations between childhood mistreatments and depressive symptoms. Older adults exposed to emotional neglect in childhood saw a greater increase in depressive symptoms than those who did not experience childhood mistreatment. Those reporting childhood physical abuse had higher baseline depressive symptoms, but they did not increase during the pandemic. These associations remained stable after controlling for emotion regulation and social support, coping resources thought to contribute to linkages between childhood mistreatment and psychological health in adulthood. Childhood mistreatment might inform the psychological consequences of major stressors in later life. Thus, early life interventions for children experiencing mistreatment could be especially important for long-term psychological health outcomes and responses to major stressful events. Identifying older people with histories of childhood mistreatment could also help clinicians gauge patients' risk of psychological decline during times such as the COVID-19 pandemic and tailor psychological health interventions.","Bruefach, Carr, Sachs-Ericsson","https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2022.2084713","20220606","COVID-19; Child mistreatment; abuse/neglect; lifespan; sensitive period","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32349,""
"COVID-19 lockdown - who cares? The first lockdown from the perspective of relatives of people with severe mental illness","Informal care is vital to many people with severe mental illness under normal circumstances. Little is known about how extraordinary circumstances affect relatives with a family member with mental illness. This study investigated the consequences of the first COVID-19 lockdown in Norway from the perspective of relatives of persons with psychotic- and/or bipolar disorders: What were the challenges and for whom? Relatives were invited to complete an online survey shortly after the first lockdown was initiated. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected concerning experiences of relatives' own and their affected family members' health and situation. Two hundred and seventy-nine relatives completed the survey, mostly mothers and partners. One-third of the relatives reported considerable deterioration in their family members' mental health, and a substantial minority worried about severe self-harm or suicide. Main themes in the qualitative analyses were ""Isolation and its effects on mental health"", ""Worrying about the pandemic and its consequences"", ""Increased symptomatology"" and ""Suicide"". Being a relative during the lockdown put heavy strain on the relatives' own health, in particular disturbance of sleep, concentration, and the ability to take care of others in the family. Relatives of family members with psychotic bipolar disorder, not currently in treatment, or living with their family experienced the situation especially challenging.

"A virtual reality home-based training for the management of stress and anxiety among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial","Healthcare workers represent one of the most affected categories by the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. Excessive stress and anxiety are critical factors that could compromise work performance. Besides, high levels of stress and anxiety may have long-term physical and psychological consequences. Recent studies investigated virtual reality to reduce stress and anxiety among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the proposed virtual reality interventions have important limitations related to their location (i.e., research lab and hospitals) and content (i.e., virtual experiences only for relaxation). Within this context, this randomized controlled trial aims to investigate the efficacy and acceptability of a brief home-based virtual reality training for managing stress and anxiety during the COVID-19 crisisÃ‚Â in a sample of Italian healthcare workers. The study is a randomized controlled trial. It includes two groups of 30 individuals recruited from healthcare workers: (1) the experimental group and (2) the control group. Participants in the experimental group will receive a training consisting of three home sessions performed in a week. In each session, participants will try through an immersive virtual reality standalone system (i.e., Oculus Quest 2) a virtual psychoeducation experience on stress and anxiety (i.e., MIND-VR). Subsequently, they will try the virtual relaxation content (i.e., The Secret Garden). The control group will receive no training and will be reassessed oneÃ‚Â week and oneÃ‚Â month after the initial evaluation. If the proposed brief home-based virtual reality training will result helpful and easy to use, it could become an empirically assessed viable option for protecting healthcare workers' mental health both during the COVID-19Ã‚Â pandemic and once it will be over. Furthermore, the intervention might be easily adapted for other categories of people who need support in managing stress and anxiety.

"Depression secondary to vision loss in old age and an effective rapid screening tool for undiagnosed cases","Zenebe et al. recently stated that despite depression being a common mental health problem in the elderly population, it is underdiagnosed in over half of the cases (Zenebe et al. in Ann Gen Psychiatry, 2021). They described an extensive list of risk factors associated with geriatric depression. However, we noted that they did not include ophthalmic conditions in this list which have previously been identified as an important risk factor for depression in the elderly. To determine the extent of undiagnosed anxiety and depression in our elderly population with vision loss, we screened a cohort of our patients, over 60Ã‚Â years with vision loss secondary to macular disease for both conditions. Our cohort included 104 patients with mean best corrected visual acuity 0.58 LogMAR (Snellen equivalent 6/24). In this group, we identified 29.8% (31/104) and 28.8% (30/104) of patients with at least one depression or anxiety-related symptom, respectively, in the past 2 weeks. We identified 7.7% (8/104) and 3.8% (4/104) who had significant symptoms of depression and anxiety, respectively, that warranted further follow-up. Only two of these patients had previously been diagnosed with anxiety or depression with the majority having no previous history of either condition. Patients from our cohort who screened for depression or anxiety often cited frustration completing tasks and loss of independence secondary to declining vision. They also complained that the vision loss resulted in a lack of confidence which in turn resulted in social isolation and loneliness. Most of the patients welcomed referral to their GP for follow-up for input regarding their mental health and they also stated an interest in attending hospital optometry low vision services and counselling support. With increasing time pressures on healthcare services and the rising use of virtual clinics especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is still essential to screen efficiently for depression in those elderly patients who are at significant risk. There is a considerable burden of major depressive disease in the geriatric population, and we would recommend that physicians (Geriatricians, GPs, Ophthalmologists etc.) screen elderly patients with vision loss for depression using the rapid screening tool which we suggest.","Clancy, Aslam, Cackett","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12991-022-00396-0","20220602","Anxiety; Depression; Macula; Vision loss","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32352,""
"Factors associated with COVID-19 Infection among a national population of individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in the United States","Individuals with schizophrenia are a vulnerable and under-served population who are also at risk for severe morbidity and mortality following COVID-19 infection. Our research was designed to identify factors that put individuals with schizophrenia at increased risk of COVID-19 infection. This study was a retrospective cohort analysis of medical and pharmacy claims among 493,796 individuals residing in the United States with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, between January 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020. A confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 infection by September 30, 2020 was regressed on demographics, social determinants, comorbidity, and pre-pandemic (December 2019 - February 2020) healthcare utilization characteristics. A total of 35,249 (7.1%) individuals were diagnosed with COVID-19. Elevated odds of COVID-19 infection were associated with age, increasing consistently from 40-49 years (OR: 1.16) to 80+ years (OR:5.92), male sex (OR: 1.08), Medicaid (OR: 2.17) or Medicare (OR: 1.23) insurance, African American race (OR: 1.42), Hispanic ethnicity (OR: 1.23), and higher Charlson Comorbidity Index. Select psychiatric comorbidities (depressive disorder, adjustment disorder, bipolar disorder, anxiety, and sleep-wake disorder) were associated with elevated odds of infection, while alcohol use disorder and PTSD were associated with lower odds. A pre-pandemic psychiatry (OR:0.56) or community mental health center (OR:0.55) visit were associated with lower odds as was antipsychotic treatment with long-acting injectable antipsychotic (OR: 0.72) and oral antipsychotic (OR: 0.62). Among individuals with schizophrenia, risk of COVID-19 infection was substantially higher among those with fewer economic resources, with greater medical and psychiatric comorbidity burden, and those who resided in African American or Hispanic communities. In contrast, individuals actively engaged in psychiatric treatment had substantially lower likelihood of infection. These results provide insights for healthcare providers that can translate into improved identification of at-risk individuals and interventions to reduce the risk and consequences of COVID-19 infection.","Liberman, Pesa, Petrillo, Ruetsch","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-04026-7","20220606","COVID-19; Risk factors; Schizophrenia; Social determinants; Adult; Aged; Antipsychotic Agents; COVID-19; Humans; Male; Medicare; Middle Aged; Psychotic Disorders; Retrospective Studies; Schizophrenia; United States","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32353,""
"Tweet topics and sentiments relating to distance learning among Italian Twitter users","The outbreak of COVID-19 forced a dramatic shift in education, from in-person learning to an increased use of distance learning over the past 2 years. Opinions and sentiments regarding this switch from traditional to remote classes can be tracked in real time in microblog messages promptly shared by Twitter users, who constitute a large and ever-increasing number of individuals today. Given this framework, the present study aims to investigate sentiments and topics related to distance learning in Italy from March 2020 to November 2021. A two-step sentiment analysis was performed using the VADER model and the syuzhet package to understand the overall sentiments and emotions. A dynamic latent Dirichlet allocation model (DLDA) was built to identify commonly discussed topics in tweets and their evolution over time. The results show a modest majority of negative opinions, which shifted over time until the trend reversed. Among the eight emotions of the syuzhet package, 'trust' was the most positive emotion observed in the tweets, while 'fear' and 'sadness' were the top negative emotions. Our analysis also identified three topics: (1) requests for support measures for distance learning, (2) concerns about distance learning and its application, and (3) anxiety about the government decrees introducing the red zones and the corresponding restrictions. People's attitudes changed over time. The concerns about distance learning and its future applications (topic 2) gained importance in the latter stages of 2021, while the first and third topics, which were ranked highly at first, started a steep descent in the last part of the period. The results indicate that even if current distance learning ends, the Italian people are concerned that any new emergency will bring distance learning back into use again.","Stracqualursi, Agati","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-12915-w","20220606","Attitude; COVID-19; Education, Distance; Humans; Italy; Social Media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32354,""
"Prevalence and correlates of psychological distress and coronavirus anxiety among hospital essential services workers in Singapore","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected almost all populations, with frontline workers experiencing a higher risk of mental health effects compared to other groups. Although there are several research studies focusing on the mental health effects of the pandemic on healthcare workers, there is little research about its impact on workers in outsourced hospital essential services. This study aims to examine the prevalence and correlates of psychological distress and coronavirus anxiety among staff working in 3 outsourced hospital essential services-housekeeping, porter service and maintenance services. A cross-sectional study was conducted among outsourced hospital essential services workers in a tertiary hospital. Data on demographics, medical history, lifestyle factors, psychosocial factors and mental well-being were collected using self-administered questionnaires. Robust logistic regression was used to determine risk factors associated with psychological distress and dysfunctional anxiety related to COVID-19. A total of 246 hospital essential services workers participated in the study. The prevalence of psychological distress was 24.7%, and dysfunctional anxiety related to COVID-19 was 13.4%. Social support and workplace support were found to be independently associated with a lower risk of psychological distress, and social connectivity was associated with a lower risk of dysfunctional anxiety related to COVID-19. These findings highlight the crucial roles of communities and workplaces in combating the mental health consequences of the pandemic. Public health programmes that aim to tackle the emerging mental health crisis in hospital essential services workers should incorporate strategies to address psychosocial factors, in addition to traditional self-care approaches.","Khaing, Lim, Soon, Oh","https://www.google.com/search?q=Prevalence+and+correlates+of+psychological+distress+and+coronavirus+anxiety+among+hospital+essential+services+workers+in+Singapore.","20220607","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32355,""

"Psychological distress reported by healthcare workers in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study","Few studies have considered the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). We estimated the prevalence and severity of psychological distress and characterized predisposing risk factors among HCWs in KSA during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of 1,985 HCWs from 6 hospitals across the country designated with caring for COVID-19 patients between April 16 and June 21, 2020. Our data analysis was performed using logistic regressions. Ordered logistic regressions were also performed using forward stepwise model selection to explore the effects of risk factors on psychological distress. The prevalence of psychological distress reported by HCWs in KSA was high, ranging from mild-moderate to severe in severity. Younger HCWs, women, those in contact with COVID-19 patients, and those who either had loved ones affected or who were themselves affected by COVID-19 were the most at-risk of psychological distress. Risk factors such as insomnia, loneliness, fear of transmission, and separation from loved ones most significantly predicted elevated levels of distress among HCWs. Increasing psychological distress was commonly reported by HCWs during the early months of COVID-19 pandemic in KSA. Public health policy makers and mental health professionals must give special attention to risk factors that predispose HCWs in KSA to psychological distress.","Altwaijri, Bilal, Almeharish, BinMuammar, DeVol, Hyder, Naseem, Alfattani, AlShehri, Almatrafi","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0268976","20220607","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32358,""
"Knowledge, practice, and impact of COVID-19 on mental health among patients with chronic health conditions at selected hospitals of Sidama regional state, Ethiopia","COVID-19 causes worse outcomes and a higher mortality rate in adults with chronic medical conditions. In addition, the pandemic is influencing mental health and causing psychological distress in people with chronic medical illnesses. To assess the knowledge, practice, and impact of COVID-19 on mental health among chronic disease patients at selected hospitals in Sidama regional state. A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted. A total of 422 study subjects were enrolled in the study using a two-stage sampling technique. Data were coded and entered using Epi Data version 3.1 and exported to SPSS-20 for analysis. Descriptive analysis was used to present the data using tables and figures. Bivariate and multivariate logistic analyses were used to identify factors associated with the initiation of preventive behavior of COVID-19. Variables with a P-value of less than 0.25 in bivariate analysis were considered as candidate variables for multivariable analysis. The statistical significance was declared at a P-value less than 0.05. More than half 237 (56.2%, 95% CI: 50.7-60.9) of the study participants had good knowledge of COVID-19.

"Changes in the identification and management of mental health and domestic abuse among pregnant women during the COVID-19 lockdown: regression discontinuity study","Domestic violence and abuse (DVA) and mental illness during pregnancy have long-lasting and potentially serious consequences, which may have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. To investigate how the UK COVID-19 lockdown policy influenced the identification of DVA and depressive symptoms during pregnancy in health services in South-East London in Spring 2020, using eLIXIR (Early-Life Data Cross-Linkage in Research) maternity and mental routine healthcare data. We used a regression discontinuity approach, with a quasi-experimental study design, to analyse the effect of the transition into and out of the COVID-19 lockdown on the rates of positive depression screens, DVA recorded in maternity and secondary mental health services, and contact with secondary mental health services during pregnancy. We analysed 26 447 pregnancies from 1 October 2018 to 29 August 2020. The rate of DVA recorded in maternity services was low throughout the period (&lt;0.5%). Within secondary mental health services, rates of DVA dropped by 78% (adjusted odds ratio 0.219, <i>P</i> = 0.012) during lockdown, remaining low after lockdown. The rate of women screening positive for depression increased by 40% (adjusted odds ratio 1.40, <i>P</i> = 0.023), but returned to baseline after lockdown lifted. Rates of DVA identification in secondary mental health services dropped during and after lockdown, whereas overall rates of DVA identified in maternity services were concerningly low.

Further research is vital to address the longer-term impact on women's mental health caused by the increase in depression during the lockdown.","Hildersley, Easter, Bakolis, Carson, Howard","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.66","20220607","Perinatal psychiatry; depressive disorders; epidemiology; out-patient treatment; statistical methodology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32360,""
"Impact of active and latent concerns about COVID-19 on attention","The interactions between emotion and attention are complex due to the multifaceted nature of attention. Adding to this complexity, the COVID-19 pandemic has altered the emotional landscape, broadly heightening health and financial concerns. Can the heightened concerns about COVID-19 impair one or more of the components of attention? To explore the connection between heightened concerns about COVID-19 and attention, in a preregistered study, we collected survey responses from 234 participants assessing levels of concerns surrounding COVID-19, followed by four psychophysics tasks hypothesized to tap into different aspects of attention: visual search, working memory, sustained attention, and cognitive control. We also measured task-unrelated thoughts. Results showed that task-unrelated thoughts, but not survey reports of concern levels, negatively correlated with sustained attention and cognitive control, while visual search and working memory remained robust to task-unrelated thoughts and survey-indicated concern levels. As a whole, these findings suggest that being concerned about COVID-19 does not interfere with cognitive function unless the concerns are active in the form of task-unrelated thoughts.","Sisk, Toh, Jun, Remington, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1186/s41235-022-00401-w","20220607","COVID-19; Emotion; Mental health; Selective attention; Sustained attention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32361,""

"Alcoholic consumption of young Italians during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic","The international health emergency caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which, at the end of 2019, hit the world, forced the governments of all countries to adopt stringent restrictive measures to contain the spread of the virus. Several studies have revealed worsening levels of anxiety, depression and perceived stress related to these restrictions and the resulting lifestyle changes. Some studies have also confirmed the presence of a relationship between SARS-CoV-2-related emotional distress and drinking behavior. Indeed, is a well-known fact that alcohol consumption is one of the behavioral strategies used to reduce negative emotional states. However, it was documented that young people developed different responses to alcohol use during the pandemic than adults. The aim of this work was to investigate the consumption habits of young Italians and how the consumption and purchase of alcoholic beverages have changed following the pandemic. New ways of drinking alcohol were also interesting to observe, such as online. Young people between 18 and 35 years old were subjected to an anonymous questionnaire of 22 questions on the adoption of forms of behavior at risk through alcohol consumption, on the quantity and occasions of preferential consumption, and on the methods and quantities of alcoholic beverage purchase, before and during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The subjects who declared themselves ""non-drinkers"" were not included in the statistical survey. About 33% of the enrolled ""drinkers"" (268/823), adopted risky forms of alcoholic behavior. Males reported a higher average habit of drinking wine or alcohol (M = 1.9953 Ã‚Â± 1.39743, F = 1.7373 Ã‚Â± 1.36688, p &lt;0.005); an increased frequency of drinking (M = 2.3025 Ã‚Â± 0.80610 F = 2.0494 Ã‚Â± 0.75043 p &lt;0.001); a higher average number of drinks consumed (M = 1.5182 Ã‚Â± 0.85646, F = 1.2618 Ã‚Â± 0.53292, p &lt;0.001) and binge drinking to the greatest extent (M = 1.1933 Ã‚Â± 0.96522 F = 0.8176 Ã‚Â± 0.85446 p &lt;0.001). Education and employment were significantly correlated with the frequency of alcohol consumption (r = 0.107 p &lt;0.005 and r = 0.120 p = 0.001 respectively).

"Pandemic or Not, Worker Subjective Wellbeing Pivots About the Living Wage Point: A Replication, Extension, and Policy Challenge in Aotearoa New Zealand","Recent pre-pandemic research suggests that living wages can be pivotal for enhancing employee attitudes and subjective wellbeing. This article explores whether or not the present COVID-19 pandemic is impacting pivotal links between living wages and employee attitudes and subjective wellbeing, with replication indicating robustness. Twin cohorts each of 1,000 low-waged workers across New Zealand (NZ), one pre- (2018), and one present-pandemic (2020) were sample surveyed on hourly wage, job attitudes, and subjective wellbeing as linked to changes in the world of work associated with the pandemic (e.g., job security, stress, anxiety, depression, and holistic wellbeing). Using locally estimated scatter-point smoothing, job attitudes and subjective wellbeing scores tended to pivot upward at the living wage level in NZ. These findings replicate earlier findings and extend these into considering subjective wellbeing in the context of a crisis for employee livelihoods and lives more generally. Convergence across multiple measures, constructs, and contexts, suggests the positive impacts of living wages are durable. We draw inspiration from systems dynamics to argue that the present government policy of raising legal minimum wages (as NZ has done) may not protect subjective wellbeing until wages cross the living wage Rubicon. Future research should address this challenge.","Carr, Haar, Hodgetts, Jones, Arrowsmith, Parker, Young-Hauser, Alefaio","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.828081","20220603","decent work; job attitude; living wage; minimum wage; pandemic; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32364,""
"COVID-19-related Stigma Among the Affected Individuals: A Cross-Sectional Study From Kerala, India","The studies and case reports from various parts of the world are showing discrimination and stigma associated with COVID-19. Stigma can directly worsen the mental health of people and also worsen physical health indirectly. This study is aimed to assess the anticipatory and experienced stigma associated with COVID-19 in affected individuals. This was a cross-sectional study conducted at Palakkad District in Kerala. Study participants were patients diagnosed with COVID-19. The sampling method was convenience sampling and snowball sampling. COVID-19 Related Stigma Survey Questionnaire was prepared by experts from the field of Psychiatry and Community Medicine. The responses were collected via an online survey and telephonic interview. Among the total participants (N=303) 119 participants (39.3%) wanted to keep the illness a secret. Eighty-one participants (26.7%) had fear of discrimination from others. Eighty-nine participants (29.4%) had experienced stigma related to their COVID-19 infection. Seventy-five (24.8%) participants' family members had experienced stigma. Few stigma parameters were significantly higher among the younger people. The participants belonging to the below poverty line category and the participants with lesser education showed significantly more worry about rejoining society after the isolation. Below poverty line category also had significantly more worry about discrimination towards their family members. Participants with lower education had significantly more worry about affecting their job due to the illness. Health care workers had significantly high worry regarding others attitudes towards them. There is a high level of stigma associated with COVID-19 in society. Definite measures need to be taken to reduce the stigma related to COVID-19 infection.","Chandran, Vinuprasad V G, Sreedevi C, Sathiadevan, Deepak K S","https://doi.org/10.1177/02537176221086983","20220603","Anticipatory Stigma; COVID-19; Experienced Stigma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32365,""
"Factor Structure of the Telugu Version of the COVID-19 Pandemic-Related Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10-C) Administered on Grassroots Frontline Health Care Workers of Rural Telangana","During the COVID-19 pandemic, perceived stress is an important determinant of mental health problems, especially in health care workers (HCW). By and large, regional language tools to assess perceived stress in the context of the pandemic have not been validated in India. We aim to explore the factor structure of the Telugu translated version of the COVID-19 pandemic-related Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10-C) administered on grassroots frontline HCW of rural Telangana, India. Data relating to 311 grassroots frontline HCW consisting of accredited social health activists (ASHA), multipurpose health workers (MPHW), and auxiliary nurse and midwives (ANMs) working in rural primary health centers (PHC) in five districts of Telangana were analyzed. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted to identify latent factors. Convergent validity was assessed by computing Pearson product-moment correlations between the scores of PSS-10-C and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scales. The principal component analysis showed that the 10 items of the scale were significantly loaded by two latent factors with eigen values of 2.792 and 2.009, respectively. Factor solution showed that six and four items correlated with each of the two factors, respectively. Significant correlations between PSS-10-C, GAD-7, and PHQ-9 scores showed convergent validity. The two factors may represent substantive factors ""perceived self-efficacy"" and ""perceived helplessness."" There may be an influence of the reverse-coded method on the factor solution.

"Suicidality Related to the COVID-19 Lockdown in Romania: Structural Equation Modeling","Suicidality is a serious public health concern at a global scale. Suicide itself is considered to be preventable death; worldwide, suicide rates and their trends are under constant scrutiny. As part of the international COMET-G cross-sectional study, we conducted a national level investigation to examine the individual disturbances (such as anxiety, depression, or history of life-threatening attempts) and contextual factors (such as adherence to conspiracy theories or Internet use) associated with suicidality related to the COVID-19 lockdown in a lot of Romanian adults. One thousand four hundred and forty-six adults responded to an anonymous on-line questionnaire, with mean age Ã‚Â± standard deviation of 47.03 Ã‚Â± 14.21 years (1,142 females, 292 males, 12 identified themselves as non-binary). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and structural equation modeling (SEM). Univariate analysis showed strong significant correlation between anxiety and depression scorings among the respondents (Spearman R = 0.776, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Both the suicidality scorings and the Internet use correlated fairly with anxiety and depression, with two-by-two Spearman coefficients between R = 0.334 and R = 0.370 (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001 for each). SEM analysis substantiated the emotional disturbances, previous life-threatening attempts, and younger age as significant predictors for suicidality. The patterns of reality reading (including religious inquiries, Internet use, and beliefs in conspiracy theories) did not reach the statistical significance as influential factors in the suicidality of these respondents. There was no covariance between the Internet use and belief in conspiracy theories. The study confirmed the suicidality risk initially hypothesized as being associated with the history of life-threatening attempts, increased depression within the younger population, and higher anxiety during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic and its related lockdown. National strategies for effective interventions at various levels of the healthcare system should be developed.","Panfil, Lungeanu, Tamasan, Bredicean, Papava, Smirnova, Fountoulakis","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.818712","20220603","SEM; anxiety; depression; self-harm behavior; suicidal ideation; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32367,""
"Factors Associated with Anxiety and Depression Among Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprise Restaurant Entrepreneurs Due to Thailand's COVID-19-Related Restrictions: A Cross-Sectional Study","COVID-19 has become a global pandemic. Since the Thai government announced its pandemic-related restrictions, economic indicators have inevitably been impacted. Micro, small, and medium enterprise (MSME) entrepreneurs have adapted to the unexpected changes, undoubtedly requiring government assistance. Therefore, this study assessed the prevalence of anxiety and depression in MSME restaurant entrepreneurs after the government announced its COVID-19-related restrictions. An online questionnaire was developed and distributed to MSME entrepreneurs' restaurants in Songkhla province, southern Thailand, in November 2021. Thai Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales (Thai HADS) were used to assess the prevalence of anxiety and depression. Multiple logistic regression was used to analyze the factors associated with depression and anxiety, and the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for both variables was reported at a <i>P</i>-value &lt; 0.05 for significance. In total, 181 MSME restaurant entrepreneurs responded to our online questionnaire in November 2021. The prevalence of anxiety and depression was 12.2% and 11.6%, respectively. Participants with a family history of psychological disorders (OR 34.9, <i>P</i>-value 0.003), an underlying disease (OR 7.14, <i>P</i>-value 0.032), a high debt-to-income ratio (OR 73.75, <i>P</i>-value 0.007), or a low education level were more likely to have anxiety. Similarly, participants who had an underlying disease (OR 14.29, <i>P</i>-value 0.032) and lacked access to supportive measures from the government (OR 6.94, <i>P</i>-value 0.009) were more likely to suffer from depression. The period of restrictive policies during the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on MSME restaurant entrepreneurs' mental health. The factors that were significantly associated with anxiety were debt-to-income ratio and concern about COVID-19 prevention and treatment. The factors that were significantly associated with depression included inadequate access to government aid. Hence, the government should focus on providing and allocating healthcare resources during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sornsenee, Kongtragulsub, Watcharajiranich, Chantanuwat, Aungchayakul, Mangkhalathat, Laparojkit","https://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S359507","20220603","COVID-19; COVID-19 restrictions; MSMEs; anxiety and depression and; entrepreneurs; micro, small, and medium enterprises","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32368,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicide rates in Japan through December 2021: An interrupted time series analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic is negatively impacting mental health globally. While increased social cohesion may have initially decreased suicide risk, there are few reports on the long-term impact. We examined the impact of the pandemic on suicide by gender and age through December 2021 in Japan. We analyzed trends in monthly suicide rates by age and gender from January 2016 to December 2021 using provisional mortality data in an interrupted time series analysis. We also considered linear trends in the pre-pandemic period and seasonal variations. Pandemic onset was defined as from April 2020. Estimated excess deaths by suicide that occurred during the pandemic were calculated. Excess number of suicide deaths during the pandemic period was estimated to be 1208 for men and 1825 for women. While there was no statistically significant increase in suicide rates overall for both men and women during the pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic, age-specific analyses showed a statistically significant increase in men 20-29 and 40-49 years, and in women of all age groups, except those under 20, 40-49 and over 80 years. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on suicide rates in Japan and the impact is most pronounced in women and younger age groups. Subgroup analyses are needed, with a particular focus on those considered to be vulnerable and at increased suicide risk.

"Prevalence of Anxiety and Depression Among the General Population in Africa During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","Medical and socio-economic uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic have had a substantial impact on mental health. This study aimed to systematically review the existing literature reporting the prevalence of anxiety and depression among the general populace in Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic and examine associated risk factors. A systematic search of the following databases African Journal Online, CINAHL, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted from database inception until 30th September 2021. Studies reporting the prevalence of anxiety and/or depression among the general populace in African settings were considered for inclusion. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Meta-analyses on prevalence rates were conducted using Comprehensive Meta-analysis software. Seventy-eight primary studies (62,380 participants) were identified from 2,325 studies via electronic and manual searches. Pooled prevalence rates for anxiety (47%, 95% CI: 40-54%, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 99.19%) and depression (48%, 95% CI: 39-57%, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 99.45%) were reported across Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sex (female) and history of existing medical/chronic conditions were identified as major risk factors for anxiety and depression. The evidence put forth in this synthesis demonstrates the substantial impact of the pandemic on the pervasiveness of these psychological symptoms among the general population. Governments and stakeholders across continental Africa should therefore prioritize the allocation of available resources to institute educational programs and other intervention strategies for preventing and ameliorating universal distress and promoting psychological wellbeing. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42021228023, PROSPERO CRD42021228023.","Bello, Kannan, Chutiyami, Salihu, Cheong, Miller, Pun, Muhammad, Mahmud, Jalo, Ali, Kolo, Sulaiman, Lawan, Bello, Gambo, Winser","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.814981","20220606","Africa; COVID-19; anxiety; depression; pandemics; Africa; Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Female; Humans; Pandemics; Prevalence; United States","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32370,""
"Proactive Coping and Mental Health Among Airline Pilots During China's Regular Prevention and Control of COVID-19: The Role of Perceived Stress and Social Support","Mental health has always been a prominent public health concern, and it has become more important in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The mental health of airline pilots plays a significant role in their occupational health and overall performance. It is also vital for ensuring the safe operation of aircrafts. Therefore, it is crucial to identify the factors that may improve the mental health of pilots. This study investigates the relationship between proactive coping, perceived stress, social support, and mental health among airline pilots during China's regular prevention and control of COVID-19. Using a sample consisting of 285 Chinese commercial airline pilots, we tested a moderated mediation model to explore whether, how, and when proactive coping affects the mental health of pilots. The results show that proactive coping has a direct and positive effect on pilots' mental health, as well as an indirect effect on mental health through its influence on perceived stress. Social support was found to weaken the relationship between perceived stress and mental health. It also weakened the indirect relationship between proactive coping and mental health through perceived stress. These findings advance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that affect the mental health of pilots. It also provides empirical evidence for effective mental health interventions for airline pilots during regular prevention and control of COVID-19.","Xu, Wu, Ji, Wang, Pan, Ma, You","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.890145","20220606","airline pilots; mental health; perceived stress; proactive coping; social support; Adaptation, Psychological; COVID-19; China; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pilots; Social Support; Stress, Psychological","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32371,""
"Mental Health Conditions Among E-Learning Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has forced the education system to undergo changes, which have also affected universities. E-learning became the main form of education, reducing interpersonal contacts, which could affect the mental wellbeing of students. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of depressive symptoms and the level of perceived stress during e-learning among Polish students and to identify the factors for predicting higher levels of depression symptoms. The study included 753 participants with a mean age of 22.47 (Ã‚Â±4.02) years. The Perception of Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) were used to measure the severity of stress and level of depression. Furthermore, our own survey was used to assess the impact of e-learning on various aspects of life. To examine how much stress can explain a statistically significant amount of variance in depression, three-step hierarchical multiple regression was used. In addition, our own questionnaire was used to assess the impact of e-learning on education, social contacts and technical abilities. A total of 58% of the students characterized by an increased level of stress. 56% show symptoms of depression and 18% of the participants had suicidal thoughts. The most significant predictor of depression is high stress levels and factors related to e-learning: isolation from friends and acquaintances, negative impact on level of knowledge, reduced motivation to learn, and worsening grades. This predictors may explain about 66% of the variance of depression. Universities should implement interventions and educational programmes, providing ad <i>hoc</i> assistance in the form of individual or group meetings with a psychologist (also in a remote form) and organizing workshops and webinars on strategies for managing stress.","Rutkowska, CieÃ…â€ºlik, Tomaszczyk, SzczepaÃ…â€žska-Gieracha","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.871934","20220606","COVID-19; Poland; anxiety; depression; e-learning; mental health; Adult; COVID-19; Computer-Assisted Instruction; Depression; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Students; Young Adult","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32372,""
"An exhaustive comprehension of the role of herbal medicines in Pre- and Post-COVID manifestations","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has relentlessly spread all over the world even after the advent of vaccines. It demands management, treatment, and prevention as well with utmost safety and effectiveness. It is well researched that herbal medicines or natural products have shown promising outcomes to strengthen immunity with antiviral potential against SARS-COV-2. Our objective is to provide a comprehensive insight into the preventive and therapeutic effects of herbal medicines and products (Ayurvedic) for pre-and post-COVID manifestations. The database used in the text is collected and compiled from Scopus, PubMed, Nature, Elsevier, Web of Science, bioRxiv, medRxiv, American Chemical Society, and clinicaltrials.gov up to January 2022. Articles from non-academic sources such as websites and news were also retrieved. Exploration of the studies was executed to recognize supplementary publications of research studies and systematic reviews. The keywords, such as ""SARS-COV-2, coronavirus, COVID-19, herbal drugs, immunity, herbal immunomodulators, infection, herbal antiviral drugs, and WHO recommendation"" were thoroughly searched. Chemical structures were drawn using the software Chemdraw Professional 15.0.0.160 (PerkinElmer Informatics, Inc.). A plethora of literature supports that the use of herbal regimens not only strengthen immunity but can also treat SARS-COV-2 infection with minimal side effects. This review summarizes the mechanistic insights into herbal therapy engaging interferons and antibodies to boost the response against SARS-COV-2 infection, several clinical trials, and in silico studies (computational approaches) on selected natural products including, Ashwagandha, Guduchi, Yashtimadhu, Tulsi, etc. as preventive and therapeutic measures against COVID. We have also emphasized the exploitation of herbal medicine-based pharmaceutical products along with perspectives for unseen upcoming alike diseases. According to the current state of art and cutting-edge research on herbal medicines have showed a significant promise as modern COVID tools.

"The attitudes of healthcare professionals in Turkey toward the coronavirus vaccine","To identify healthcare professionals' attitudes toward the coronavirus vaccine. Controlling the coronavirus pandemic depends on achieving a high level of herd immunity. Accordingly, it is very important that healthcare professionals become role models by displaying positive attitudes toward vaccination. This cross-sectional study was conducted between March and April 2021 with a total of 309 healthcare professionals. Data were collected via an online surveys using an ""Introductory Information Form"" and ""Attitudes Towards the COVID-19 Vaccine Scale."" One-way variance analysis and Bonferroni correction were used for the comparison of nonnormally distributed quantitative variables between more than two groups. The Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn-Bonferroni test were used to compare non-normally distributed quantitative variables between more than two groups. Pearson correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the relationships between the quantitative variables. Regarding the healthcare professionals' attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccine, the average score of positive attitudes was 3.52 Ã‚Â± 0.87, and the average score of negative attitudes was 3.39 Ã‚Â± 0.68. A statistically significant weak relationship was found between the ages of the participants and the average score of their positive attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccine. The negative attitude score of the individuals who wanted to get the coronavirus vaccine was significantly higher than those who were undecided or did not want to get the vaccine. Healthcare professionals completely agreed with the opinion ""I would persuade everyone around me to get the coronavirus vaccine,"" and completely disagreed with the opinion ""I believe that they will inject microchips to people with the coronavirus vaccine."" Healthcare professionals have positive attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine. COVID-19-vaccinated participants' positive and negative attitude scores were found higher than those who were not vaccinated.

Mental distress was measured via symptoms of depression, feeling anxious\nervous, and loneliness. Older adults who suffered from PTSD-depression comorbidity prior to the pandemic showed the highest risk of feeling more depressed, anxious\nervous, and lonelier than those with no pre-pandemic symptoms.

"Longitudinal impact of psychosocial status on children's mental health in the context of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions","Emerging research suggests that the prevalence of child and adolescent mental health problems has increased considerably during the COVID-19 crisis. However, there have been few longitudinal studies on children's mental health issues according to their social determinants in this context, especially in Europe. Our aim was to investigate the association between family socioeconomic status (SES) and children' mental health during the period of school closure due to COVID-19. Longitudinal data came from 4575 children aged 8-9Ã‚Â years old in 2020 and participating in the ELFE population-based birth cohort that focuses on children's health, development and socialization. Parents completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) when children were (a) 5Ã‚Â years of age and (b) 9Ã‚Â years of age, which corresponded to the period of school closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic in France. We retrieved data from the ELFE cohort collected on children from birth to age 5Ã‚Â years (birth, 1Ã‚Â year, 2Ã‚Â years, 3,5Ã‚Â years and 5Ã‚Â years). Socioeconomic status (SES) was measured based on information obtained when the child was 5Ã‚Â years old. Data were analyzed using multinomial logistic regression models. Children's elevated levels of symptoms of Attention-deficit/Hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) during the period of school closure were significantly associated with prior low family SES (aOR 1.26, 95% CI 1.08-1.48). Children's elevated symptoms of hyperactivity/inattention and of emotional symptoms were associated with decline in income during the COVID crisis (respectively, aOR 1.38, 95% CI 1.16-1.63 and aOR 1.23, 95% CI 1.01-1.51). Moreover, when testing interactions, a low prior SES was significantly associated with a higher risk of emotional symptoms aOR 1.54 (1.07-2.21), only for children whose families experienced a decline in income, while gender, parental separation and prior mental health difficulties were not associated. This study underlines the impact of the financial crisis related to the COVID-19 epidemic on children's mental health. Both pre-existing family SES before lockdown and more proximal financial difficulties during the COVID crisis were negatively associated with children's psychological difficulties during the period of school closure.

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and family situation of clinically referred children and adolescents in Switzerland: results of a survey among mental health care professionals after 1 year of COVID-19","The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental well-being of clinically referred children and adolescents and on their families from the perspective of mental health care professionals in Switzerland during the first year of the pandemic. Psychiatrists and psychologists for children and adolescents participated in an anonymous survey conducted online in April/May 2021. The survey was completed by 454 mental health care professionals, most of them working in outpatient clinics for child and adolescent psychiatry or in independent practices. Most participants indicated an important increase of referrals for depression (86.8% of respondents), anxiety disorders (81.5%), crisis interventions (76.2%), psychosomatic disorders (66.1%), suicidality (63.8%), and behavioral addictions, e.g., excessive gaming (64.6%). In contrast, referrals or treatment demands for disorders such as autism spectrum disorder or psychosis showed no substantial change or a slight decrease, respectively. According to 69% of respondents, patients experienced the highest psychological burden in January/February/March 2021. Family problems very frequently reported by mental health professionals were parents' worries about loneliness/isolation of the child (49%), child's education and academic future (33%), increased media use due to missing options of recreational activities (37.6%), as well as multiple stresses of mothers (36.3%). To conclude, the pandemic has substantially changed the pattern of disorders and the number of clinical referrals of children and adolescents with mental health problems, which has serious consequences for the treatment supply in Switzerland.","Werling, Walitza, Eliez, Drechsler","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00702-022-02512-6","20220602","Adolescents; COVID-19; Children; Clinical referral; Mental disorders; Psychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32379,""
"Affect, dis/ability and the pandemic","The pandemic has heightened anxieties, impacted mental health and threatened to create an overwhelming sense of existential dread. We recognise the material ways in which disabled people have been differentially impacted by Covid-19 and make a case for understanding the affective dimensions of the pandemic. We develop a theoretical approach - cutting across medical sociology and critical disability studies - that understands affect as a social, cultural, relational and psychopolitical phenomenon. We introduce a public engagement project that took place in March and April of 2020 that garnered blogspots from around the world to capture the pandemic's impact on the lives of disabled people. Our data analysis reveals three key affective themes: fragility, anxiety and affirmation. To understand the emotional impacts of Covid-19 upon the lives of disabled people we embed critical analyses of affect in the dual processes of disablism and ableism: the dis/ability complex. We conclude by considering how we might conceive of a post-pandemic recovery that places the health and well-being of disabled people at the centre of proceedings.","Goodley, Lawthom, Liddiard, Runswick-Cole","https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-9566.13483","20220602","affect; affirmation; anxiety; dis/ability; fragility; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32380,""

We compared the characteristics of suicide-related patients who visited the ED between the ""COVID-19 period"" and the ""pre-COVID-19 period"". The mean age of patients was younger after COVID-19 pandemic. In comparison by age group, the proportion of patients during the COVID-19 period increased in their teens and 20s, and the rest of the age groups decreased. The proportion of patients who requested help was higher during the COVID-19. The authenticity of suicide attempts showed a higher proportion of patients during the pre-COVID-19.

"Chlorpheniramine, an Old Drug with New Potential Clinical Applications: A Comprehensive Review of the Literature","Chlorpheniramine Maleate (CPM), also known as chlorphenamine, is a potent alkylamine first-generation H1 antihistamine that has been around since the 1950s. CPM is a widely popular drug commonly used to treat allergic conditions, given its antihistamine properties. Although mainly used in over-the-counter treatment for cough and colds, various studies discuss a wide range of CPM's clinical uses, such as treating asthma, plasma cell gingivitis, chronic urticaria, depression, among others. This antihistamine is usually taken orally; however, intravenous, intramuscular, and subcutaneous routes have been documented. Intranasal routes have recently been explored, especially due to its antiviral properties against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Accordingly, given CPM's extensive medical and safety profile, the present review explores this versatile drug's current and potential clinical applications. Although it is widely used mainly for treating common colds and aforementioned allergic conditions, it can be concluded that CPM can be considered to be used for other clinical indications. The repurposing of CPM for other clinical indications such as COVID-19 needs to be further explored through more extensive studies.","Rizvi, Ferrer, Khawaja, Sanchez-Gonzalez","https://doi.org/10.2174/2772432817666220601162006","20220602","Chlorpheniramine; allergy; intranasal; rhinitis; urticarial; viral infections","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32382,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with mental health problems and the differences among diagnostic categories","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in a total upending of our daily lives. While anxiety and depression were frequently reported among the general population, the pandemic's impact on patients with mental health problems remains unknown. A cross-sectional questionnaire survey involving 1,166 patients was conducted at one psychiatric hospital and one mental health clinic. Symptom deterioration was reported in 23% to 34% of the patients and 9% to 20% reported increase in drug dosage. No significant differences were reported in these items among diagnostic categories. Patients with <i>F</i>3 (mood disorders) reported more psychological stress during the pandemic's beginning and during the emergency. Patients with <i>F</i>2 (schizophrenia, schizotypal, and delusional disorders) did online shopping and meetings less frequently, and reported poorer adherence of 3C's, while mask management was stricter in patients with <i>F</i>4 (neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders). Symptom deterioration was significantly associated with increase in drug dosage, new physical symptoms, anxiety unrelated to COVID-19, stress at the beginning of pandemic, stress during the 'state of emergency', poor adaptability to environmental change, daily life changes, decrease in sleeping time, and decrease in time spent outside. One third of patients reported symptom deterioration during the pandemic, which was associated with stress and daily life changes. Patients with good adaptability to environmental changes might resilient against symptom deterioration. Providing continuous support to help patients manage their daily life in this COVID-19 era may minimize the risk of symptom deterioration.","Mashima, Koizumi, Minegishi, Miyakoshi, Okada, Ogyu, Kusudo, Kiyohara, Kitada, Koyanagi, Suzuki, Nozaki, Oda, Hirai, Nakane, Onaya, Oda, Koreki","https://doi.org/10.1177/00207640221097509","20220602","Anxiety; COVID-19; depression; resilience; risk; schizophrenia; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32383,""
"Technostress, anxiety, and depression among university students: A report from Paraguay","Although technologies (including information, e-learning, and communication) have been daily employed by University students in the last years, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a considerable increase in their use. Technostress is a modern term referring to levels of stress caused by the prolonged exposure to technology. The aim of this study is to assess the technostress and related anxiety and depression among Paraguayan University students, describing their sociodemographic characteristics and relevant associations. A cross-sectional and descriptive study has been conducted. Participants were recruited through an Internet-based survey. Technostress, anxiety, and depression have been assessed with the Technostress Questionnaire (TechQ), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaire, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), respectively. A total of 378 participants were included, 74.1% of whom were women. According to the TechQ scores, 47.4% of the participants reported a low/moderate level of technostress whereas 5.2% showed severe scores. About 58.5% of participants reported a GAD-7 score Ã¢Â©Â¾10, meeting diagnostic criteria for generalized anxiety. About 60.3% scored Ã¢Â©Â¾3 at the PHQ-2 reporting significant levels of depression.

Data from 557,668 rural and 1,384,093 urban veterans (collected July 2019-October 2020) from the Veterans Health Administration Corporate Data Warehouse were examined with interrupted time-series models to determine rural versus urban VVC use before and during the initial 7 months of the pandemic. Before COVID-19, rates of VVC use as percentages of all mental health care were higher among rural veterans. After implementation of pandemic restrictions, rural veteran VVC use continued to increase, but this increase was surpassed by that of urban veterans.

"Sedation Practices in the PICU: An Unexpected Casualty of COVID-19","Pediatric intensivists often use an ""analgosedation"" approach in mechanically ventilated children. By prioritizing analgesia and minimizing sedation, patients experience less delirium. However, when COVID-19 surged, our pediatric intensive care unit providers were tasked with caring for adults with severe acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF). As documented in the literature, adults with COVID-19-AHRF received significantly higher doses of sedatives than matched cohorts with non-COVID-19 AHRF. Surprisingly, when the pediatric intensive care unit returned to caring for children, a quality review showed that we were unintentionally using far more sedatives than that prior to COVID-19. This experience is not unique to our institution, or to COVID-19. Lingering effects of crisis care can persist beyond the event itself. We seek to share our experience in order to extend the conversation regarding the unexpected effects of crises on best practices and to stress the need for high-quality research on interventions to support mental health and resilience in frontline healthcare providers.","Pumphrey, Bouzaher, Achuff, Traube","https://doi.org/10.1097/CCE.0000000000000713","20220602","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32388,""
"Challenges and Approaches to Green Social Prescribing During and in the Aftermath of COVID-19: A Qualitative Study","The last decade has seen a surge of interest and investment in green social prescribing, however, both healthcare and social enterprise has been impacted by the COVID-19 crisis, along with restricted access to public green spaces. This study examines the challenges and opportunities of delivering green social prescribing during and in the aftermath of COVID-19, in the light of goals of green social prescribing to improve mental health outcomes and reduce health inequalities. Thirty-five one-to-one interviews were conducted between March 2020 and January 2022. Interviewees included Link Workers and other social prescribers, general practitioners (GPs), managers, researchers, and volunteers working in urban and rural Scotland and North East England. Interview transcripts were analyzed in stages, with an inductive approach to coding supported by NVivo. Findings revealed a complex social prescribing landscape, with schemes funded, structured, and delivered diversely. Stakeholders were in general agreement about the benefits of nature-based interventions, and GPs and volunteers pointed out numerous benefits to participating in schemes such as parkrun. Link Workers were more circumspect about suggesting outdoor activities, pointing out both psychological and practical obstacles, including health anxieties, mobility issues, and transport deficits. Exacerbated by the pandemic, there was a way to go before older and/multi-morbidity clients (their largest cohort) would feel comfortable and safe to socialize in open air spaces. Our findings support the premise that time spent in open green spaces can alleviate some of the negative mental health effects compounded by the pandemic. However, the creation of healthy environments is complex with population health intrinsically related to socioeconomic conditions. Social disadvantage, chronic ill health and health crises all limit easy access to green and blue spaces, while those in the most socially economically deprived areas receive the lowest quality of healthcare. Such health inequities need to be borne in mind in the planning of schemes and claims around the potential of future nature-based interventions to reduce health inequalities.","Fixsen, Barrett","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.861107","20220602","COVID-19; green prescribing; health inequalities; mental health outcomes; social prescribing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32389,""
"Virtual Lifelong Learning Among Older Adults: Usage and Impact During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Social isolation and loneliness are major health concerns for older adults, with the current prevalence of social isolation amongÃ‚Â older adults estimated to be as high as 43%. In older adults, loneliness and social isolation have both been linked with poor health outcomes including falls, re-hospitalizations, dementia, and all-cause mortality. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic,Ã‚Â older adults constituted one of the most at-risk groups and were faced with some of the strictest and earliest social distancing recommendations, which were associated with increased feelings of loneliness and increased rates of depression and anxiety, upwards of 12%. The objective of this study was to identify the impact of online social connection on feelings of isolation and companionship among older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines in March 2020, two South Florida social and educational programs for older adults adopted online programming utilizing the Zoom platform. A research team worked collaboratively with senior stakeholders to develop and administer a survey to understand the impact of online social connections on feelings of social isolation. One year later in 2021, the survey was reviewed, modified, and re-administered. Respondents of the survey included 211 older adults (mean age 75.5 years old). Notable findings included a strong association between frequency of online class attendance and increased feelings of connectedness (p&lt;0.001), improved spirits (p&lt;0.001), and decreased feelings of social isolation (p&lt;0.001). These results underscore the importance and contribution of online programming among older adults during times of social isolation.

"Prevalence and correlates of suicidal behaviours in a representative epidemiological youth sample in Hong Kong: the significance of suicide-related rumination, family functioning, and ongoing population-level stressors","Young people are most vulnerable to suicidal behaviours but least likely to seek help. A more elaborate study of the intrinsic and extrinsic correlates of suicidal ideation and behaviours particularly amid ongoing population-level stressors and the identification of less stigmatising markers in representative youth populations is essential. Participants (n = 2540, aged 15-25) were consecutively recruited from an ongoing large-scale household-based epidemiological youth mental health study in Hong Kong between September 2019 and 2021. Lifetime and 12-month prevalence of suicidal ideation, plan, and attempt were assessed, alongside suicide-related rumination, hopelessness and neuroticism, personal and population-level stressors, family functioning, cognitive ability, lifetime non-suicidal self-harm, 12-month major depressive disorder (MDD), and alcohol use. The 12-month prevalence of suicidal ideation, ideation-only (no plan or attempt), plan, and attempt was 20.0, 15.4, 4.6, and 1.3%, respectively. Importantly, multivariable logistic regression findings revealed that suicide-related rumination was the only factor associated with all four suicidal outcomes (all p &lt; 0.01). Among those with suicidal ideation (two-stage approach), intrinsic factors, including suicide-related rumination, poorer cognitive ability, and 12-month MDE, were specifically associated with suicide plan, while extrinsic factors, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) stressors, poorer family functioning, and personal life stressors, as well as non-suicidal self-harm, were specifically associated with suicide attempt. Suicide-related rumination, population-level COVID-19 stressors, and poorer family functioning may be important less-stigmatising markers for youth suicidal risks. The respective roles played by not only intrinsic but also extrinsic factors in suicide plan and attempt using a two-stage approach should be considered in future preventative intervention work.","Wong, Ip, Hui, Suen, Wong, Chang, Chan, Lee, Lui, Chan, Wong, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291722001519","20220601","COVID-19; epidemiological study; family functioning; risk factors; suicidal behaviours; suicide-related rumination; youth mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32391,""

"Initial findings on RESTORE for healthcare workers: an internet-delivered intervention for COVID-19-related mental health symptoms","Many healthcare workers on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic are experiencing clinical levels of mental health symptoms. Evidence-based interventions to address these symptoms are urgently needed. RESTORE (Recovering from Extreme Stressors Through Online Resources and E-health) is an online guided transdiagnostic intervention including cognitive-behavioral interventions. It was specifically designed to improve symptoms of anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) associated with COVID-19-related traumatic and extreme stressors. The aims of the present study were to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of RESTORE in healthcare workers on the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted an initial uncontrolled trial of RESTORE in 21 healthcare workers who were exposed to COVID-19-related traumatic or extremely stressful experiences in the context of their work and who screened positive for clinical levels of anxiety, depression, and/or PTSD symptoms. RESTORE was found to be feasible and safe, and led to statistically significant and large effect size improvements in anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms over the course of the intervention through follow-up.

At the time of the survey, 27.9% of the participants were out of the labor force (95% CI 23.5 to 32.9) and 78.6% reported a decrease in family income after restrictions imposed due to the pandemic (95% CI 74.0 to 82.6). The prevalence of maternal common mental disorder symptoms was 32.5% (95% CI 27.8 to 37.6). Follow-up visits are planned to occur every 6 months for the next five years (2021-2025). Additional topics will be included in future waves (eg, food insecurity and parenting practices). Communication strategies for bonding, such as picture cards, pictures of mothers with their children and phone calls to the participants, will be used to minimise attrition. Results of this prospective cohort will generate novel knowledge on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal and child health and parenting practices in a population of women and children living in fifth largest city of Brazil.","Castro, FarÃƒÂ­as-AntÃƒÂºnez, AraÃƒÂºjo, Penna, Oliveira, de Aquino, Lima Neto, de Sousa, Tavares Machado","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-060824","20220603","covid-19; epidemiology; public health; Birth Cohort; Brazil; COVID-19; Child; Child Health; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Pandemics; Parenting; Prospective Studies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32395,""
"Burnout and resilience in intensive care Nursing professionals in the face of COVID-19: A multicenter study","to analyze the relationship between the Burnout dimensions and the work resilience of intensive care Nursing professionals in the COVID-19 pandemic in four hospitals from southern Brazil. this is a multicenter and cross-sectional study, composed of 153 nurses and nursing technicians of the Intensive Care Units. Sociodemographic, health and work-related questions were collected, and the Maslach Burnout Inventory and Resilience at Work Scale 20 instruments were applied. The data were submitted to descriptive analysis and to bivariate and partial correlations (network analysis). work resilience presented an inverse correlation to emotional exhaustion (r=-0.545; p=0.01) and depersonalization (r=-0.419; p=0.01) and a direct one to professional achievement (r=0.680; p=0.01). The variable with the greatest influence on the correlation network was the perception of the impact of the pandemic on mental health. resilience interferes in the emotional exhaustion and low professional achievement domains of Burnout. Emotional exhaustion is conducted through minor psychological disorders, with an impact on the workers' physical and mental health variables. The development of institutional resilience should be encouraged in order to moderate the illness. analisar a relaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o entre as dimensÃƒÂµes do Burnout e a resiliÃƒÂªncia no trabalho dos profissionais de enfermagem de terapia intensiva na pandemia de COVID-19, em quatro hospitais do Sul do Brasil. trata-se de um estudo multicÃƒÂªntrico, de delineamento transversal, composto por 153 enfermeiros e tÃƒÂ©cnicos de enfermagem das Unidades de Terapia Intensiva.

"Palliative care to cancer patients: how COVID-19 pandemic could affect quality of care","To evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the care delivered to hospitalized cancer patients in end-of-life. A retrospective analysis of data of hospitalized patients with advanced solid tumors, who died under exclusive palliative care during first wave (March 2020 to July 2020) compared with the period previous pandemic (January 2018 to February 2020). A total of 190 oncologic patients were included, 161 patients before the pandemic, and 29 in the period from March 2020 to July 2020. The average hospitalization was 497.2 patients per month, before the pandemic, and dropped to an average of 46.5 in the pandemic, whereas the death rate decreased from an average of 6.3 patients per month to 4.8. Considering the benchmarks for quality of care during end-of-life care, preferences on life assistance were discussed prior to hospitalization for 34.4%, before the pandemic, and 13.8% during the pandemic (p=0.0298); 9.3% received chemotherapy 15 days prior to the date of death, before the pandemic, and 20.7%, in the pandemic (p=0.1012). Based on the present results, despite the decrease in oncology admissions, the advanced-stage cancer patients continued to seek hospital for end-of-life care. However, we could observe in our benchmarking analyses for palliative quality of care that talks about prognosis occurred less often during the pandemic.","Todaro, Nogueira, Conte, Kaliks","https://doi.org/10.31744/einstein_journal/2022AO6459","20220603","Benchmarking; COVID-19; Humans; Neoplasms; Palliative Care; Pandemics; Retrospective Studies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32397,""

Cross-sectional study of 125 COVID-19 survivors. The test-retest reliability of the web-based form was assessed at 7 days after the first evaluation. We collected symptoms, functional status (PCFS scale), health-related quality of life (EuroQol-5D questionnaire, EQ-5D-5L), activities of daily living limitations [Barthel Index and Global Activity Limitation Index, GALI] and psychological state (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS). The paper- and web-based forms of the Spanish PCFS scale showed adequate construct validity, and the web-based form provided substantial test-retest reliability (kappa = 0.63). The percentage of agreement between the web-based and paper-based forms was high (88%). Functional status showed a high correlation with EQ-5D-5L (inverse) and GALI (direct) (both; Rho Ã¢â€°Â¥ .743), a moderate correlation with HADS (Rho Ã¢â€°Â¥ .409) and a low correlation with the Barthel Index (Rho &lt; .30).

"Investigating Psychological Differences Between Nurses and Other Health Care Workers From the Asia-Pacific Region During the Early Phase of COVID-19: Machine Learning Approach","As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, challenges in frontline work continue to impose a significant psychological impact on nurses. However, there is a lack of data on how nurses fared compared to other health care workers in the Asia-Pacific region. This study aims to investigate (1) the psychological outcome characteristics of nurses in different Asia-Pacific countries and (2) psychological differences between nurses, doctors, and nonmedical health care workers. Exploratory data analysis and visualization were conducted on the data collected through surveys. A machine learning modeling approach was adopted to further discern the key psychological characteristics differentiating nurses from other health care workers. Decision tree-based machine learning models (Light Gradient Boosting Machine, GradientBoost, and RandomForest) were built to predict whether a set of psychological distress characteristics (ie, depression, anxiety, stress, intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal) belong to a nurse. Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) values were extracted to identify the prominent characteristics of each of these models. The common prominent characteristic among these models is akin to the most distinctive psychological characteristic that differentiates nurses from other health care workers. Nurses had relatively higher percentages of having normal or unchanged psychological distress symptoms relative to other health care workers (n=233-260 [86.0%-95.9%] vs n=187-199 [74.8%-91.7%]). Among those without psychological symptoms, nurses constituted a higher proportion than doctors and nonmedical health care workers (n=194 [40.2%], n=142 [29.5%], and n=146 [30.3%], respectively). Nurses in Vietnam showed the highest level of depression, stress, intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal symptoms compared to those in Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Nurses in Singapore had the highest level of anxiety. In addition, nurses had the lowest level of stress, which is the most distinctive psychological outcome characteristic derived from machine learning models, compared to other health care workers. Data for India were excluded from the analysis due to the differing psychological response pattern observed in nurses in India. A large number of female nurses emigrating from South India could not have psychologically coped well without the support from family members while living alone in other states. Nurses were least psychologically affected compared to doctors and other health care workers. Different contexts, cultures, and points in the pandemic curve may have contributed to differing patterns of psychological outcomes amongst nurses in various Asia-Pacific countries. It is important that all health care workers practice self-care and render peer support to bolster psychological resilience for effective coping. In addition, this study also demonstrated the potential use of decision tree-based machine learning models and SHAP value plots in identifying contributing factors of sophisticated problems in the health care industry.","Dong, Yeo, Tham, Danuaji, Nguyen, Sharma, Rn, Pv, Tai, Ahmad, Tan, Ho, Chua, Sharma","https://doi.org/10.2196/32647","20220602","COVID-19; health care workers; machine learning; nurses; psychological outcome","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32399,""
"Investigating the Efficacy of an 18-Week Postpartum Rehabilitation and Physical Development Intervention on Occupational Physical Performance and Musculoskeletal Health in UK Servicewomen: Protocol for an Independent Group Study Design","Postpartum women are at an increased risk of pelvic floor dysfunction, musculoskeletal injury, and poor psychological health and have reduced physical fitness compared to before pregnancy. There is no formal, evidence-based rehabilitation and physical development program for returning UK servicewomen to work following childbirth. This study aims to examine the efficacy of a rehabilitation and physical development intervention for returning postpartum UK servicewomen to occupational fitness. Eligible servicewomen will be assigned to a training or control group in a nonrandomized controlled trial 6 weeks after childbirth. Group allocation will be based on the location of standard pregnancy and postpartum care. The control group will receive standard care, with no prescribed intervention. The training group will start an 18-week core and pelvic health rehabilitation program 6 weeks post partum and a 12-week resistance and high-intensity interval training program 12 weeks post partum. All participants will attend 4 testing sessions at 6, 12, 18, and 24 weeks post partum for the assessment of occupational physical performance, pelvic health, psychological well-being, quality of life, and musculoskeletal health outcomes. Occupational physical performance tests will include vertical jump, mid-thigh pull, seated medicine ball throw, and a timed 2-km run. Pelvic health tests will include the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification system, the PERFECT (power, endurance, repetitions, fast, every contraction timed) scheme for pelvic floor strength, musculoskeletal physiotherapy assessment, the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory-20 questionnaire, and the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Vaginal Symptoms. Psychological well-being and quality of life tests will include the World Health Organization Quality of Life questionnaire and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Musculoskeletal health outcomes will include body composition; whole-body areal bone mineral density; tibial volumetric bone mineral density, geometry, and microarchitecture; patella tendon properties; muscle architecture; muscle protein and collagen turnover; and muscle mass and muscle breakdown. Data will be analyzed using linear mixed-effects models, with participants included as random effects, and group and time as fixed effects to assess within- and between-group differences over time. This study received ethical approval in April 2019 and recruitment started in July 2019. The study was paused in March 2020 owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. Recruitment restarted in May 2021. The results are expected in September 2022. This study will inform the best practice for the safe and optimal return of postpartum servicewomen to physically and mentally demanding jobs.

"Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Buprenorphine and Extended-Release Naltrexone Filled Prescriptions During the COVID-19 Pandemic","COVID-19 disrupted delivery of buprenorphine and naltrexone treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), and during the pandemic, members of racial and ethnic minority groups experienced increased COVID-19 and opioid overdose risks compared with White individuals. However, whether filled buprenorphine and naltrexone prescriptions varied across racial and ethnic groups during the COVID-19 pandemic remains unknown. To investigate whether disruptions in filled buprenorphine and naltrexone prescriptions differed by race and ethnicity and insurance status or payer type. This cross-sectional study used retail pharmacy claims from May 2019 to June 2021 from the Symphony Health database, which includes 92% of US retail pharmacy claims, with race and ethnicity data spanning all insurance status and payer categories. Interrupted time series were used to estimate levels and trends of dispensed buprenorphine and naltrexone prescriptions before and after pandemic onset. Included individuals were those who filled buprenorphine and extended-release naltrexone prescriptions. Data were analyzed from July 2021 through March 2022. Weekly rates of dispensed buprenorphine and extended-release naltrexone prescription fills per 1000 patients and proportion of longer (ie, Ã¢â€°Â¥14 days' supply) buprenorphine prescription fills were calculated. Analyses were stratified by patient race and ethnicity and further by insurance status and payer type for White and Black patients. A total of 1Ã¢â‚¬Â¯556Ã¢â‚¬Â¯860 individuals who filled buprenorphine prescriptions (4359 Asian [0.3%], 94Ã¢â‚¬Â¯657 Black [6.1%], 55Ã¢â‚¬Â¯369 Hispanic [3.6%], and 664Ã¢â‚¬Â¯779 White [42.7%]) and 127Ã¢â‚¬Â¯506 individuals who filled extended-release naltrexone prescriptions (344 Asian [0.3%], 8186 Black [6.4%], 5343 Hispanic [4.2%], and 53Ã¢â‚¬Â¯068 White [41.6%]) from May 6, 2019, to June 5, 2021, were analyzed. Prepandemic increases in buprenorphine fill rate flattened for all groups after COVID-19 onset (30.5 percentage point difference in trend; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) compared with prepandemic trends. Significant level decreases in buprenorphine fills (ranging from 2.5% for Black patients; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.009 to 4.0% for Hispanic patients; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.009) at pandemic onset were observed for members of racial and ethnic minority groups but not White patients. At pandemic onset, rate of buprenorphine fills decreased in level for Medicare and cash-paying patients but with greater decreases for Black patients (Medicare: 10.0%; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001; cash: 20.0%; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) than White patients (Medicare: 3.5%; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.004; cash: 15.0%; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). No decreases were found among Medicaid patients. Unlike buprenorphine, extended-release naltrexone had uniform level (from 10.0% for White patients with private insurance; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001 to 23.3% for Black patients with Medicare; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and trend (from 15.5 percentage points for White patients with Medicaid; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001 to 52.0 percentage points for Black patients with private insurance; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) decreases across groups. This study found that the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with immediate decreases in filled buprenorphine prescriptions by members of racial and ethnic minority groups but not White individuals. These findings suggest that members of racial and ethnic minority groups had larger losses in buprenorphine access during the pandemic across payer types.","Nguyen, Ziedan, Simon, Miles, Crystal, Samples, Gupta","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.14765","20220603","Aged; Buprenorphine; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Ethnicity; Humans; Medicare; Minority Groups; Naltrexone; Pandemics; Prescriptions; United States","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32401,""
"A National Study of Zoom Fatigue and Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Implications for Future Remote Work","Overuse of videoconferencing for work may contribute to what has been called ""Zoom fatigue"": feeling anxious, socially isolated, or emotionally exhausted due to lack of social connection. Given implications for employee well-being, this study investigated Zoom fatigue at work and its potential link to mental health symptoms. A national survey of mental health symptoms was conducted in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic in August 2020. Adults (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°902) endorsing a shift at work to videoconferencing completed an online survey; survey criteria included an age minimum of 22 years and reported annual gross income of <u>&lt;</u>$75,000. Statistical raking was employed to weight the sample using U.S. census data on geographic region, age, gender, race, and ethnicity. A three-item Zoom Fatigue Scale measuring perceived stress, isolation, and depression associated with videoconferencing at work showed good internal consistency (ÃŽÂ±Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.85). Higher scores on this scale were related to being married, nonwhite race, post-high school education, severe mental illness, greater loneliness, lower social support, lacking money for food, and more weekly videoconference calls. Depressive symptoms demonstrated a significant association with Zoom fatigue, even when adjusting for demographic, psychosocial, and clinical covariates. The study findings indicated that employers and employees should consider a complex array of individual-level and environment-level factors when assessing how videoconferencing at work may engender stress, social isolation, and emotional exhaustion. This impact could adversely impact mental health, work productivity, and quality of life, even after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Elbogen, Lanier, Griffin, Blakey, Gluff, Wagner, Tsai","https://doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2021.0257","20220601","Zoom fatigue; mental health; remote work; social support; videoconferencing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32402,""
"Virtual Reality-Induced Dissociative Symptoms: A Retrospective Study","<b><i>Objective:</i></b> The use of virtual reality (VR) has been increasing worldwide, as devices are becoming more sophisticated and provide an escape from reality during the COVID-19 lockdown. This recent rise in the use of VR leads to new side effects being reported, such as dissociative symptoms that may or may not constitute a mental health concern. This retrospective study investigated the prevalence and intensity of dissociative symptoms in VR users, as well as some potential predisposing conditions that may trigger them, and their impact on the subjects' wellbeing. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> We conducted a survey (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°358) that was posted on VR Facebook groups. This survey was approved by the University of Lisbon Medical Faculty's IRB, and comprised a modified version of the Clinician-Administered Dissociative State Scale (CADSS) and questions regarding potential risk factors known to induce dissociative disorders or experiences. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Data analysis revealed that 83.9% participants reported dissociative symptoms, with varying intensity according to CADSS (<mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>X</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>ÃŒâ€ž</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>7</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mn>6</mml:mn><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>;</mml:mo><mml:mstyle/><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>7</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mn>8</mml:mn><mml:mn>9</mml:mn></mml:math>).

Nonetheless, most participants categorized the symptoms as nonanxiogenic (85.8%) and minute lasting (77.4%). <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> In conclusion, this study revealed that although VR can induce dissociative experiences, they seem to be short lasting and nonthreatening to the individual's wellbeing and might be predicted or attenuated by managing other known risk factors for dissociative phenomena.","Taveira, SÃƒÂ¡, Rosa","https://doi.org/10.1089/g4h.2022.0009","20220601","depersonalization; derealization; dissociation; virtual reality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32403,""
"Effects of COVID-19 pandemic on stress level of residents and fellows during ophthalmology training","To evaluate the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the mental health of residents and fellows in ophthalmology. A questionnaire composed of 42 questions was applied to Brazilian residents and fellows in Ophthalmology. The questionnaire addressed the demographics of participants, their working conditions before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10). The study had a total of 271 participants in Ophthalmology training, from which 100 were fellows and 171 were residents. Before the pandemic, Ophthalmology residents and fellows had a higher workload (P &lt; 0.001), and residents worked more hours than fellows (P = 0.001). During the pandemic, the workload of both residents and fellows decreased and equalized (P = 0.195). No correlation was found between the working hours during the pandemic and their stress level were observed (P = 0.760). Higher stress scores were identified in women ophthalmologists (P = 0.001) as well as in residents and fellows that had their surgical training interrupted during the pandemic (P &lt; 0.001). The stress level of residents and fellows during the COVID-19 pandemic was similar, however, those that had their surgical training interrupted during the pandemic presented higher level of stress.

"Insights into the molecular triggers of parosmia based on gas chromatography olfactometry","Parosmia is a debilitating condition in which familiar smells become distorted and disgusting, with consequences for diet and mental health. It is a feature of post-infectious olfactory loss, particularly resulting from COVID-19. There is currently little understanding of its pathophysiology, and the prevailing hypothesis for the underlying mechanism is aberrant growth of regenerating olfactory sensory neurons after damage. We use gas-chromatograph olfactometry to individually present components of a complex olfactory mixture as a rapid screening tool for assessment of both quantitative and qualitative olfactory dysfunction in those with and without parosmia. This allows them to report the associated sensory effects and to identify those molecules which are altered or parosmic in nature. Here we show 15 different molecular triggers of this symptom. These trigger molecules are common to many in the parosmic volunteer group and share certain characteristics such as extremely low olfactory threshold and common molecular structure. We posit that specific highly odour-active molecules are the cause of the parosmic symptom in most cases and initiate the sense of disgust, suggesting that parosmia is, at least in part, a receptor-level phenomenon.","Parker, Kelly, Gane","https://doi.org/10.1038/s43856-022-00112-9","20220602","Brain injuries; Central nervous system infections; Chemical biology; Health sciences; Olfactory receptors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32405,""
"Maternal psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic and structural changes of the human fetal brain","Elevated maternal psychological distress during pregnancy is linked to adverse outcomes in offspring. The potential effects of intensified levels of maternal distress during the COVID-19 pandemic on the developing fetal brain are currently unknown. We prospectively enrolled 202 pregnant women: 65 without known COVID-19 exposures during the pandemic who underwent 92 fetal MRI scans, and 137 pre-pandemic controls who had 182 MRI scans. Multi-plane, multi-phase single shot fast spin echo T2-weighted images were acquired on a GE 1.5Ã¢â‚¬â€°T MRI Scanner. Volumes of six brain tissue types were calculated. Cortical folding measures, including brain surface area, local gyrification index, and sulcal depth were determined. At each MRI scan, maternal distress was assessed using validated stress, anxiety, and depression scales. Generalized estimating equations were utilized to compare maternal distress measures, brain volume and cortical folding differences between pandemic and pre-pandemic cohorts. Stress and depression scores are significantly higher in the pandemic cohort, compared to the pre-pandemic cohort. Fetal white matter, hippocampal, and cerebellar volumes are decreased in the pandemic cohort. Cortical surface area and local gyrification index are also decreased in all four lobes, while sulcal depth is lower in the frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes in the pandemic cohort, indicating delayed brain gyrification. We report impaired fetal brain growth and delayed cerebral cortical gyrification in COVID-19 pandemic era pregnancies, in the setting of heightened maternal psychological distress. The potential long-term neurodevelopmental consequences of altered fetal brain development in COVID-era pregnancies merit further study.","Lu, Andescavage, Wu, Kapse, Andersen, Quistorff, Saeed, Lopez, Henderson, Barnett, Vezina, Wessel, du Plessis, Limperopoulos","https://doi.org/10.1038/s43856-022-00111-w","20220602","Brain imaging; Epidemiology; Paediatric research; Stress and resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32406,""
"Relationships Between Resilience, Mental Well-Being, and COVID-19 Worries in Collegiate Student-Athletes","The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with robust declines in well-being for collegiate student-athletes. Worries about COVID-19 have frequently been associated with worsening well-being; therefore, it is important to examine protective factors against well-being decrements. Resilience, one's ability to respond to stress and adversity, may be one such factor. Despite this possible influence, resilience has not yet been studied in student-athletes in this context as the pandemic has progressed. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the moderating role of resilience on the relationship between COVID-19 worries and well-being. In this cross-sectional design, National Collegiate Athletic Association Division III athletes (<i>N</i> = 91) at one university completed surveys on COVID-19 worries, resilience, and well-being between February and March 2021. All competitions had been postponed until the Spring 2021 semester. The findings revealed a negative correlation between COVID-19 worries and well-being (<i>r</i> = -0.21, <i>p</i> = 0.05) and a positive correlation between resilience and well-being (<i>r</i> = 0.44, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Additionally, multiple regression and simple slopes analyses showed that individuals with higher resilience endorsed greater scores of well-being, even when COVID-19 worries increased (ÃŽÂ² = 0.38, <i>p</i> = 0.02). In conclusion, our results suggest that resilience had a moderating effect on the relationship between COVID-19 worries and well-being.","Watts, Hilliard, Graupensperger","https://doi.org/10.3389/fspor.2022.890006","20220602","COVID-19 anxiety; Division III; flourishing; mental health; resilience; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32407,""
"The psychological distress and COVID-19 pandemic during lockdown: A cross-sectional study from United Arab Emirates (UAE)","The pandemic resulted in the societal changes as conflicts and instability were the common concerns experienced by families because of the lockdown. However, the psychological impact of the COVID-19 on the United Arab Emirates (UAE) population is not studied extensively. The study evaluates the psychological impact of lockdown during the pandemic on the people in the UAE. This study was cross-sectional in nature and was conducted using a questionnaire consisting of 35-items. The questions were related to social, psychological, and personal aspects. Multivariate Linear regression was used to find the outcomes between independent variables. The mean value of social phobia was 2.56 Ã‚Â± .620, followed by the mean score of anxiety (2.47 Ã‚Â± .666), stress (2.44 Ã‚Â± .631), and depression (2.42 Ã‚Â± .682). The higher the respondents experienced the scores, the more depression, anxiety, and stress. Demographics such as marital status, age, and occupation and education level have a statistically significant association with social phobia, anxiety, depression, and stress. The study concludes that the lockdown more psychologically impacted males, older people, and unemployed individuals during the pandemic.","Abdelrahman, Ismail","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e09422","20220602","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Lockdown; Pandemic; Psychological effects; Social phobia; Stress; UAE","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32408,""
"Coping with COVID: pandemic narratives for Australian children","The experience of the COVID-19 pandemic can be recognised as traumatic for the way in which its sudden and unexpected onset disrupted a sense of ordinary life for so many around the world. Adults, and far less so children, were unable to prepare for the danger of the rapidly spreading disease. As such, both were left vulnerable to the experience of trauma and anxiety that surrounds the threat of COVID. Whereas adults, however, have access to a range of resources and strategies for mental health protection, children of various ages need targeted resources to enable them to understand, prepare for, and come to terms with a trauma situation. A great deal of research exists around the value of children developing their own narratives as a means of coming to terms with trauma, such that storytelling is identified as a primary coping device. Similarly, literature exists that compares parental narratives of trauma with those of their children. Moreover, the use of the fairy tale as a cautionary tale has long been examined. What has not been established is the way in which contemporary multimedia narratives - such as television programmes, animations, and digital stories - can be used to develop coping strategies in children and to mitigate anxiety in young people experiencing global or collective trauma. This article examines a selection of such narratives produced for Australian children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through a cross-disciplinary framework, this work considers how these resources can help (or hinder) mental health recovery in young children under the age of five, as well as strategies for best practice in the future development of trauma-informed resources for this age group.","Gildersleeve, Cantrell, Bryce, Daken, Durham, Mullens, Batorowicz, Johnson","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e09454","20220602","COVID-19; Children's health; Children's wellbeing; Digital stories; Emergency and disaster recovery; Pandemic narratives; Storytelling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32409,""
"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Patients with Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Diseases: Disruptions in Care and Self-Reported Outcomes","The COVID-19 pandemic presented a challenge to the care of patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs). The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on the care of RMDs patients and their health and well-being. This cross-sectional study involved 120 RMDs patients at the rheumatology department at Suez Canal University Hospital in Ismailia, Egypt, in July 2020. Patients were interviewed for sociodemographic and disease-related history. Further assessments were performed using Kessler 6-items, fears of COVID-19, and COV19-impact on quality of life scales. Rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus represented the majority of our sample of RMDs patients (72.5% and 19.2%, respectively). About 50% of patients reported experiencing limitations in the access to rheumatologic care, and a similar percentage had changed or discontinued their medications. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs shortage and concerns about the increased risk of COVID-19 infection due to immunosuppressive drugs were the most frequently reported reasons for nonadherence. The percentage of patients with uncontrolled disease had significantly increased from 8.3% prior to the COVID-19 pandemic to 20% during the pandemic. About 60% of patients reported a high level of psychological distress. In conclusion, the pandemic negatively influenced mental health, quality of life, adherence to medications, access to rheumatology care, and the degree of disease control of RMDs patients.","Fouad, Elotla, Elkaraly, Mohamed","https://doi.org/10.1177/23743735221102678","20220602","COVID-19; RMDs; healthcare access; medication adherence; mental health; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32410,""
"15-Month Health Outcomes and the Related Risk Factors of Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients From Onset: A Cohort Study","The long-term impact of COVID-19 on patient health has been a recent focus. This study aims to determine the persistent symptoms and psychological conditions of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 15 months after onset, that patients first developed symptoms. The potential risk factors were also explored. A cohort of COVID-19 patients discharged from February 20, 2020 to March 31, 2020 was recruited. Follow-ups were conducted using validated questionnaires and psychological screening scales at 15 months after onset to evaluate the patients' health status. The risk factors for long-term health impacts and their associations with disease severity was analyzed. 534 COVID-19 patients were enrolled. The median age of the patients was 62.0 years old (IQR 52.0-70.0) and 295 were female (55.2%). The median time from onset to follow-up was 460.0 (451.0-467.0) days. Sleep disturbance (18.5%, 99/534) and fatigue (17.2%, 92/534) were the most common persistent symptoms. 6.4% (34/534) of the patients had depression, 9.2% (49/534) were anxious, 13.0% (70/534) had insomnia and 4.7% (25/534) suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Multivariate adjusted logistic regression analysis showed that glucocorticoid use during hospitalization (OR 3.58, 95% CI 1.12-11.44) was significantly associated with an increased risk of fatigue. The OR values for anxiety and sleep disorders were 2.36 (95% CI 1.07-5.20) and 2.16 (95% CI 1.13-4.14) in females to males. The OR value of PTSD was 25.6 (95% CI 3.3-198.4) in patients with persistent symptoms to those without persistent symptoms. No significant associations were observed between fatigue syndrome or adverse mental outcomes and disease severity. 15-month follow-up in this study demonstrated the need of extended rehabilitation intervention for complete recovery in COVID-19 patients.","Sun, Wang, Wang, Pan, Luo, Liu, Jiang, Zhuang, Lin, Li, Zhao, Wang, Wang, Wang, Shan, Chen, Chen, Xu, Bai, Huang, Xie","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2022.854788","20220602","COVID-19; PTSD; long-term health consequence; mental health; persistent symptom","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32411,""
"Lessons From COVID-19: Physical Exercise Can Improve and Optimize Health Status","The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused increasing challenges for healthcare systems globally. The disease spread rapidly from Wuhan to the rest of the world, involving more than 400 million individuals and including more than 5 million deaths. In dealing with the pandemic, China and other countries took protective measures such as promoting social distancing, canceling public gatherings, closing schools, quarantining, and imposing lockdowns. All these measures lead to physical inactivity. Being physically inactive has significant repercussions on the status of physical and mental wellbeing, and it is associated with anxiety, stress, increased chronic disease risk, and worsening of chronic conditions. In this sense, the relevance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle through physical exercise has been outlined by the World Health Organization (WHO). The aim of this mini review is to discuss the importance of physical activity in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the benefits of physical activity and exercise that could be potentially effective treatment strategies for comorbid chronic conditions, long covid syndrome (LCS), and symptoms such as depression and anxiety.","Cerasola, Argano, Corrao","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2022.834844","20220602","health status; life style; mental status; physical activity; post COVID-19","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32412,""
"Social Capital and Lifestyle Impacts on Mental Health in University Students in Colombia: An Observational Study","For young adults, the first year of higher education represents a transition period into adulthood associated with an increased risk of developing depression, anxiety, and stress, contributing to deteriorating physical and mental health. The present study aimed to analyze the relationship between depressive symptoms and social capital and lifestyles among Colombian university students. In 2020, a longitudinal repeated measures study was conducted on first year students at Universidad de los Andes in Bogota, Colombia. The study was conceptualized and approved by the university before the COVID-19 pandemic appeared. Each student completed a self-administered questionnaire including questions on sociodemographic characteristics, depressive symptoms, perceived stress, social capital, and lifestyles. The study's pilot was conducted in November 2019, and the two measurement points were in January 2020 (wave 1, before the COVID-19 pandemic was declared) and in August 2020 (wave 2, during the COVID-19 pandemic). A binary logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship between depressive symptoms, perceived stress, social capital, and lifestyles. A total of 609 first year students (response rate = 58.11%) participated in wave 1, and 42% of the participants showed signs of clinically relevant depressive symptoms. In wave 2, despite the difficulties encountered in collecting data due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 216 students from wave 1 participated (35.47%). An increase in a sedentary lifestyle was observed (31.49%). We found that cognitive and behavioral social capital levels decreased by 12.03 and 24.54%, respectively. In addition, we observed a 6.5% increase in students with clinically relevant depressive symptoms compared to wave 1. A low level of behavioral [<i>OR</i>: 1.88; 95% CI (1.16, 3.04)] social capital was associated with clinically relevant depressive symptoms. The health of university students continues to be a public health concern. The study suggests that social capital may play an important role in preventing depressive symptoms. Therefore, universities should put effort into programs that bring students together and promote the creation of social capital.","SotaquirÃƒÂ¡, Backhaus, SotaquirÃƒÂ¡, Pinilla-Roncancio, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-Uribe, Bernal, Galeano, Mejia, La Torre, Trujillo-Maza, SuÃƒÂ¡rez, Duperly, Ramirez Varela","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.840292","20220603","depressive symptoms; lifestyles; mental health; social capital; university students; Adult; COVID-19; Colombia; Depression; Humans; Life Style; Mental Health; Pandemics; Social Capital; Students; Universities; Young Adult","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32413,""

"Cellular and Molecular Machinery of Neuropathic Pain: an Emerging Insight","Neuropathic pain (NP) has been ubiquitously characterized by lesion and its linked somatosensory system either the central nervous system (CNS) or peripheral nervous system (PNS) This PNS episode is the most prevalent site of NP origin and is found to be associated with afferent nerve fibers carrying pain signals from injured/trauma site to the CNS including the brain. Several kinds of pharmacotherapeutic drugs shuch as analgesics, anti-convulsants, and anti-depressants are being employed for the its possible interventions. The NP has been a great interest to follow different pathophysiological mechanisms which are often considered to correlate with the metabolic pathways and its mediated disease. There is paucity of knowledge to make such mechanism via NP. Most notably, recent pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 has also been reported in chronic pain mediated diabetes, inflammatory disorders, and cancers. There is an increasing incidence of NP and its complex mechanism has now led to identify the possible investigations of responsible genes and proteins via bioinformatics tools. The analysis might be more instrumental as collecting the genes from pain genetic database, analyzing the variants through differential gene expression (DEG) and constructing the protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and thereby determining their upregulating and downregulating pathways. This review sheds a bright light towards several mechanisms at both cellular and molecular level, correlation of NP-mediated disease mechanism and possible cell surface biomarkers (receptors), and identified genes could be more promising for their pharmacological targets.","Ameenudeen, Kashif, Banerjee, Srinivasan, Pandurangan, Waseem","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40495-022-00294-9","20220601","CIRD; DEG; In vitro models COVID-19; In vivo models; Na/K ion channel; Neuropathic pain; Pharmacological targets","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32415,""
"Canadian perspectives of digital mental health supports: Findings from a national survey conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic","The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on population mental health has highlighted the potential for digital mental health to support the needs of those requiring care. This study sought to understand the digital mental health experiences and priorities of Canadians affected by mental health conditions (i.e. seekers, patients, and care partners). A national cross-sectional electronic survey of Canadians was administered through a market research firm's survey panel. Seekers, patients, and care partners were asked about their digital mental health experiences (e.g. uptake, barriers to access) and priorities. Survey responses were summarized using descriptive statistics. Overall, 1003 participants completed the survey. 70.2% of participants routinely use digital mental health supports to support themselves or those they care for; however, only 28.6% of participants are satisfied with the available digital mental health supports. Most participants (73.3%) have encountered some barriers when accessing digital mental health supports. Awareness of digital mental health supports was a top barrier identified by participants. The top digital mental health priorities consisted of digital mental health curation, navigation, and a digital mental health passport. Most participants use digital mental health supports for themselves or others, however, many are unaware of digital mental health supports available. Efforts to improve navigating access to digital and in-person mental health services are seen as a top priority, highlighting the need to enable seekers, patients, and care partners to find the appropriate support and make decisions on how to best improve their mental health.","Shen, Kassam, Chen, Ma, Wang, Boparai, Jankowicz, Strudwick","https://doi.org/10.1177/20552076221102253","20220602","COVID-19 pandemic; Canada; Digital health; digital interventions; eMental health; health services research; mental health; population health; psychology; public health; telepsychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32416,""
"Tuberculosis and comorbidities: treatment challenges in patients with comorbid diabetes mellitus and depression","Tuberculosis is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, primarily affecting low- and middle income countries and individuals with limited-resources within fractured health care systems. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has only served to aggravate the already existing diagnostic gap, decreasing the number of people who get diagnosed and thereby complete successful treatment. In addition to this, comorbidities act as an external component that when added to the TB management equation, renders it even more complex. Among the various comorbidities that interact with TB disease, diabetes mellitus and depression are two of the most prevalent among non-communicable diseases within the TB population and merits a thoughtful consideration when the healthcare system provides care for them. TB patients with diabetes mellitus (TB-DM) or depression both have an increased risk of mortality, relapse and recurrence. Both of these diseases when in presence of TB present a 'vicious-circle-like' mechanism, meaning that the effect of each disease can negatively add up, in a synergistic manner, complicating the patient's health state. Among TB-DM patients, high glucose blood levels can decrease the effectiveness of anti-tuberculosis drugs; however, higher doses of anti-tuberculous drugs could potentially decrease the effects of DM drugs. Among the TB-depression patients, not only do we have the adherence to treatment problems, but depression itself can biologically shift the immunological profile responsible for TB containment, and the other way around, TB itself can alter the hormonal balance of several neurotransmitters responsible for depression. In this paper, we review these and other important aspects such as the pharmacological interactions found in the treatment of TB-DM and TB-depression patients and the implication on TB care and pharmacological considerations.","CÃƒÂ¡ceres, Calderon, Ugarte-Gil","https://doi.org/10.1177/20499361221095831","20220602","comorbidities; depression; diabetes; therapy; tuberculosis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32417,""

"Movement behaviors and posttraumatic stress disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic: A retrospective study of Chinese university students","This study aimed to examine the associations between physical activity (PA), sedentary behavior, sleep and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among undergraduate students during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in China. A total of 3178 university students responded to an online questionnaire between December 2020 and January 2021. Participants self-reported the time they spent on PA, screen time and sleep after (over the past seven days) and during the outbreak peak (from January to March 2020). Their sleep quality was measured using the Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The Chinese version of the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist - Civilian Version was used to measure PTSD. Logistic regressions and generalized linear mixed models were conducted. The final analysis included data from 2070 university students (20.2Ã¢â‚¬Â¯Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.3 years old, 37.0% males). The prevalence of PTSD was 7.1%. Better sleep quality both during and after the outbreak peak, and longer sleep duration after the outbreak peak were associated with a lower odds ratio of having PTSD and lower re-experiencing, avoidance and hyperarousal scores. Higher total PA levels during the outbreak peak were associated with a higher odds ratio of having PTSD and higher levels of re-experiencing and avoidance. Sleep quality and duration were negatively associated with PTSD among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. The associations between PA, screen time and PTSD require further examination. Future interventions to enhance mental health could consider targeting university students' sleep hygiene.","Feng, Lau, Shi, Huang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesf.2022.05.002","20220603","COVID-19; Physical activity; Posttraumatic stress disorder; Screen time; Sleep; Undergraduate","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32419,""
"Examining the Impact of COVID-19 Experiences on Reported Psychological Burden Increase in Older Persons: The Effects of Illness Severity and Social Proximity","Previous findings have provided indications that experience of COVID-19 illness of self and other affect mental health unfavorably. However, prior studies do not satisfactorily differentiate according to severity of COVID-19 illness or social proximity, which are both hypothesized to be relevant factors for increased psychological burden. This study provides an in-depth examination of the impact of Covid-19 experience of self and other on mental health, considering illness severity as well as proximity to the infected person (self, close and distant network). It used data on an older population (50+ years) from 28 European countries (<i>n</i> &gt; 40 000 persons) surveyed in summer of 2021 using the Survey of Health and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). Aside from bivariate analyses, a logistic regression model was computed to test the effects of illness severity by personal proximity over and above other stressors of life in the pandemic. Severity of illness was shown to be a contributor to psychological burden increase with the strongest effects among persons who reported own illness experiences or experiences in the close network. Regression analysis confirmed the impact of severe Covid-19 experience in self, close and distant relations. Moreover, even a less severe course impacted burden unfavorably when experienced in the own person and more distant relations. These results prove troubling. Psychological burden is impacted by infection, with experiences in self or close persons being strongest, while even 'lighter' experiences in the distant network also have an unfavorable effect, emphasizing the need to gain control of the present pandemic.","Heidinger, Richter","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.884729","20220602","COVID-19; infection; psychological burden; severity; social network","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32420,""
"Sociohistorical Analysis of Normative Standards of Masculinity in the Pandemic of COVID-19: Impacts on Men's Health/Mental Health","This study aims to analyze sociohistorically how the normative patterns of hegemonic masculinity produced impacts on men's health/mental health in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. A qualitative study from a socio-historical perspective was conducted with 50 men based on an online survey. A semistructured form was applied. The data were analyzed by the Collective Subject Discourse method, interpreted in the light of the context of epidemic disease and hegemonic masculinity. The experience of the pandemic exposed the normative patterns of masculinities from the consummation of acts representative of the pandemic context, which incited men to deny the existence of COVID-19 disease and to delay the understanding and adoption of measures to protect and control COVID-19. As a repercussion, men presented conflicts in the regulation of emotions; presented emotional suppression; were more reactive; felt threatened regarding the loss of the role of family provider, virility; and revealed a sense of invulnerability, added to the weakening of self-care. The discourse revealed that the men's behaviors are consistent with the characteristics of hegemonic masculinity, but express signs of recognition that this behavior causes harm to themselves and their health.","de Sousa, Moreira, da Silva Santana, AraÃƒÂºjo, Borges, Almeida, das MercÃƒÂªs, da Silva, Teixeira, LourenÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o, Gomes, de Santana Carvalho, de Sousa, de Almeida, Viana, Pereira","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.775337","20220602","COVID-19; masculinities; mental health; mental health care; menÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s health; pandemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32421,""
"Family Thriving During COVID-19 and the Benefits for Children's Well-Being","Although the COVID-19 pandemic has raised deserved concern regarding adverse impacts on parents' and children's mental health, regulations like ""sheltering-in-place"" may have afforded parents novel opportunities to foster positive family connections, thereby bolstering well-being. Using latent profile analysis (LPA), we (a) distinguished family thriving during shelter-in-place (May-June 2020) from other patterns of family functioning, (b) tested potential predictors of family functioning profiles, and (c) examined if family thriving predicted subsequent child adjustment (September-October 2020). 449 parents in two-parent U.S. families with children aged 2-18 years completed online surveys assessing (a) parent-child relationship quality, parents' positive psychological adjustment, children's emotional well-being, and parenting efficacy and satisfaction as family functioning indicators, (b) financial, marital, parental psychosocial assets, and child (age, gender, and temperament) predictors of family functioning, and (c) child adjustment. LPA identified four family functioning profiles: Thriving, Managing, Struggling, and Distressed. Thriving families evinced higher scores on all functioning indicators. Logistic regressions revealed that parents in Thriving families reported significantly lower financial anxiety, less dissatisfaction with partner's help, less child emotionality, and greater use of cognitive reappraisal, as well as more positive child adjustment in Fall 2020. These findings underscore the multidimensional nature of coping and well-being during COVID-19. Utilizing these levers to promote mental health in families languishing during comparable future crises could promote resilience, thereby protecting children's well-being.","Partington, Mashash, Hastings","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.879195","20220602","COVID-19; family functioning; resilience; thriving; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32422,""
"COVID-19 Impacts Across Multiple Life Domains of Vulnerable Socio-Demographic Groups Including Migrants: A Descriptive Cross-Sectional Study","<b>Objectives:</b> We assessed the impacts of COVID-19 on multiple life domains across socio-demographic groups in Netherlands. <b>Methods:</b> After the first COVID-19 wave, we distributed online questionnaires among 13,031 participants of the multi-ethnic HELIUS cohort. Questionnaires contained questions on changes in income status, healthy behaviors, mental health, and access to non-COVID-19 health care. We then calculated differences in adjusted proportions of participants that reported negative changes across multiple life domains by migration background, age, sex, education, and occupation. <b>Results:</b> 4,450 individuals (35%) responded, of which 4,294 were included. Older populations and men seemed to be less vulnerable to negative changes in multiple life domains during the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to the pre-pandemic period, while populations with a migration background and lower education/occupation groups seemed to be more vulnerable to negative changes. <b>Conclusion:</b> Not all populations vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality are also more vulnerable to COVID-19 impacts across multiple other life domains. Targeted interventions are needed in socio-demographic groups that are most impacted by COVID-19 in various life domains to prevent a further increase of their already increased risk of chronic diseases after the pandemic.","Chilunga, Coyer, Collard, Leenstra, Galenkamp, Agyemang, Prins, Stronks","https://doi.org/10.3389/ijph.2022.1604665","20220603","COVID-19; ethnic minority; impact; long-term conditions; migration; social determinants of health; vulnerable populations; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Ethnicity; Humans; Male; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Transients and Migrants","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32423,""

"The Impact of COVID-19 on the Lives of Individuals With Multiple Sclerosis: 1 Year Into the Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in implementation of restrictive public health policies requiring people to limit or avoid interaction with others. These policies also had an economic impact. Individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) already experience higher incidences of depression, anxiety, social isolation, and job loss, and the continuing pandemic may exacerbate these. Between November 2, 2020, and February 12, 2021, 233 individuals with MS completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the modified Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey, the Centers for Disease Control/National Institutes of Health Common Data Element Repository economic impact questions, and study team-designed questions about social and family relationships and adherence to public health policies. Study participants reported high rates of mask wearing, good hand hygiene, and limited interactions with those outside their homes. They felt isolated from family they did not live with, friends, and coworkers. The frequency of conflicts with their spouses/partners increased ""a little"" among 20% of respondents, but overall relationships with housemates were ""unchanged"" or ""a little better."" Ninety-one percent of participants reported experiencing no financial impact. On the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, 16.0% of 218 respondents reported depressive symptoms and 26.8% of 216 reported symptoms of anxiety above the commonly accepted clinically significant cutoff points. Only 3.4% of participants reported contracting SARS-CoV-2. During the first year of the pandemic, this study found no pronounced impact on the emotional, social, or economic stability of the individuals with MS it surveyed. It seems that these study participants adapted to the restrictions created by the pandemic and, by adhering to guidelines, protected themselves from contracting SARS-CoV-2.","Lynch, Baker, Hunt, Thuringer, Jassam, Bruce","https://doi.org/10.7224/1537-2073.2021-099","20220602","COVID-19; Employment in MS; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS); Psychological issues and MS; Psychosocial issues in MS; Quality of life in MS; Resilience and MS","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32427,""
"Factors influencing undergraduate education in an expanding virtual world during COVID-19","Moving to a virtual platform can introduce barriers beyond access and stability of technology, which may influence students' academic performance. The aim of this study was to identify factors, both personal and technology-related, that students and faculty perceived as contributors to academic performance. Enrolled students and teaching faculty in the Bachelor of Science programs at Rush University were surveyed. Analysis of survey results indicated that mental health and finances hindered students' performance, whereas faculty reported that technology accessibility and stability was the greatest contributor to students' performance. Both groups reported that at-home learning environment contributed to students' academic performance. These results provided insight into factors that impact student academic performance, allowing for appropriate changes to courses and overall curriculum to ensure undergraduates' learning and retention of course material.","Bradaric, Tresselt","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10639-022-11104-6","20220601","COVID-19; Education; Educational challenges; Undergraduate; Virtual platform","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32428,""
"COVID 19 pandemic challenges and their management: A review of medicines, vaccines, patents and clinical trials with emphasis on psychological health issues","The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID 19) paroxysm is a dominant health exigency that caused significant distress, affecting physical and mental health. Increased mortality, a stressed healthcare system, financial crisis, isolation, and new living and working styles enhanced societal commiseration leading to poor health outcomes. Though people try to maintain good physical health but unfortunately the mental affliction is still ignored. Poor psychological health has emerged as a burgeoning social issue and demands attention. Henceforth, the fundamental objective of this review article is to collate information about COVID-linked physical and psychological agony in diverse population groups with related symptoms and accessible diagnosis techniques. Recent studies have unraveled the fragile mental states of people who have either contracted COVID 19 or had near and dear ones falling prey to it. The impact of the epidemic on the human mind both in short and long-term, with possible risk and preventive factors together with suggested solutions for maintaining good health have also been discussed here. It also enlists the available medications, vaccines and investigational research in the form of patents and clinical trials. This article can be taken as an updated information sheet for COVID 19, accompanied by its management techniques with special emphasis on coping strategies for mental health. Further, it may also assist the policymakers to devise approaches that could enable the public to overcome the pandemic-driven adversity not only in the given situation but also futuristically.","Mohapatra, Ayash Kumar, Farooq, Jain, Khan, Hasan, Shamim, Javed Ansari, Alalaiwe, Aldawsari, Aamir Mirza, Iqbal","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsps.2022.05.004","20220601","COVID 19; Clinical trial; Medication; Mental health; Patents; Physical health; SARSÃ¢â‚¬ÂCoVÃ¢â‚¬Â2; Vaccine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32429,""
"College student mental health: Understanding changes in psychological symptoms in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States","The COVID-19 pandemic has altered the way higher education is structured and delivered, presenting challenges for college students that have the potential to negatively impact mental health. The current study aimed to identify potential changes in college student psychological symptoms since the onset of the pandemic. The study used analyses of covariance to examine differences in perceived stress, depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms between a sample of university students collected in Fall 2016 and a sample of students from the same university collected in Spring 2020 and Fall 2020 after the onset of the pandemic. Findings indicated that college students from the 2020 sample reported significantly higher levels of stress, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms than the 2016 sample. For stress and anxiety, there was a significant interaction between cohort (2016 vs. 2020 sample) and year in school (first year vs. advanced) indicating that the pandemic may have had a more prominent negative mental health impact on advanced students in comparison to first year students. There were no significant differences between samples on obsessive-compulsive symptoms. The current sample was somewhat homogenous demographically, consisting of primarily first-year students, thus limiting generalizability. Self-report measures were used. College students may be struggling with increased stress, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms during the pandemic. The current study provides important information to guide the development and implementation of prevention and intervention efforts to support college student mental health in the context of the pandemic.","Roche, Holdefer, Thomas","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-03193-w","20220601","Anxiety; COVID-19; College students; Depression; Obsessive-compulsive symptoms; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32430,""
"Social anxiety disorder is Associated with Vaccination attitude, stress, and coping responses during COVID-19","Individuals with Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) may be at a higher risk for negative outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic due to isolation that is both characteristic of the disorder and also potentially exacerbated by quarantine and public health restrictions. Accordingly, we evaluated emotional and behavioral responses to stress during COVID-19 and attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccine adoption in socially anxious versus non-socially anxious adults. Participants (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°84) were young adults between 18 and 24 years of age who completed a diagnostic interview and self-report measures assessing stress, anxiety and coping responses during COVID-19. Welch's <i>t</i>-tests assessed group differences on mental health outcomes between the SAD versus non-SAD group, and Pearson's Ãâ€¡2 test evaluated COVID-19 vaccination status by group. Lastly, logistic regression examined whether SAD predicted positive COVID-19 vaccination attitude. Results indicated the SAD group demonstrated significantly elevated rates of anxiety and depression as compared to individuals without SAD and had significantly increased rates of engagement in safety behaviors as well as maladaptive coping mechanisms in response to COVID-19 stress. Individuals with SAD were significantly more likely to receive or plan to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. The current study provides evidence that social anxiety may be a significant factor associated with the impact of COVID-19 as well as attitudes with vaccine compliance.

"Association of COVID-19 impact with outcomes of an integrated obesity and depression intervention: Posthoc analysis of an RCT","To examine the association between COVID-19 impact and clinical outcomes of an integrated collaborative care intervention for adults with obesity and comorbid depression. Latent class analysis identified clusters of self-reported COVID-19 impact. Cluster characteristics were examined using Fishers' least significant difference method and canonical discriminant analysis. Intervention vs. usual care effects on primary (body mass index [BMI], depressive symptoms) and secondary (anxiety symptoms and other psychosocial) outcomes stratified by cluster were examined using linear mixed models. Three clusters were identified: mental health and sleep impact (cluster 1, nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 37), economic impact (cluster 2, nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 18), and less overall impact (cluster 3, nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 20). Clusters differed in age, income, diet, and baseline coping skills. The intervention led to improvements across several health outcomes compared with usual care, with medium to large effects on functional impairments (standardized mean difference, -0.7 [95% CI: -1.3, -0.1]) in cluster 1, depressive symptoms (-1.1 [95% CI: -2.0, -0.1]) and obesity-related problems (-1.6 [95% CI: -2.8, -0.4]) in cluster 2, and anxiety (-1.1 [95% CI: -1.9, -0.3]) in cluster 3. People with obesity and comorbid depression may have varied intervention responses based on COVID-19 impact. Interventions tailored to specific COVID-19 impact clusters may restore post-pandemic health.","Kringle, Lv, Ronneberg, Wittels, Rosas, Steinman, Smyth, Gerber, Xiao, Venditti, Ajilore, Williams, Ma","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.orcp.2022.05.005","20220601","Behavioral medicine; COVID-19; Depression; Intervention; Lifestyle; Obesity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32432,""

"The moderating effect of care-burden on formal caregiver's mental health during COVID-19","Homecare organisations employ professionals (i.e. gerontologists, nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and social workers) to help their clients gain rights and supervise non-professional formal caregivers. Formal caregivers, and especially those who work closely with impaired older people, are at greater risk of infecting or being infected by SARS-Cov-2 (COVID-19). During the first waves of COVID-19, older people were encouraged to stay home; and the care-burden inflicted on their caregivers has increased. This study examined formal caregiver's mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, that is, the association between anxiety and depression symptoms and how care-burden moderated this association. A cross-sectional online survey conducted in the home care services sector throughout Israel. A sample of 400 formal caregivers of older people (M<sub>age</sub> Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 47.7, SDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 13.8) completed a questionnaire regarding their levels of care-burden, general anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms. A significant positive relationship was found between anxiety and depressive symptoms among formal caregivers. The level of care-burden moderated this relationship, showing that caregivers with higher care-burden demonstrated a stronger association between anxiety and depressive symptoms. Professionals may use ADL/IADL as a practical index to assess care-burden and the risk of mistreatment. Formal caregivers with higher care-burden should get enhanced professional's support to reduce adverse mental health outcomes.","Karni-Efrati, Palgi, Greenblatt-Kimron, Bodner","https://doi.org/10.1111/opn.12482","20220601","anxiety; care-burden; depression; formal-caregiver; home care; mistreatment; prevention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32435,""

"Occupational burnout in Iranian health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","Health care workers (HCWs), mostly frontliners, are encountering numerous physical and psychosocial stressors, and even managing some conflicts over the course of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this respect, the present study was to investigate the prevalence rate of occupational burnout (OB) in such workers during this pandemic. This cross-sectional study was conducted between April 6 and May 30, 2020, via an online survey in 31 provinces of Iran, on HCWs selected based on convenience sampling method. For data collection, a socio-demographic information form and the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) was utilized. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square test, and multivariate regression analysis were also applied to test the research hypotheses. In total, 7626 HCWs participated in the present study. Accordingly, 73.2 and 26.8% of the workers were female and male, respectively. As well, 57.8% of the respondents were nurses and 14.4% of the cases were clinicians. Moreover, 44.8% of the participants had thus far worked in isolation wards and 40.3% of these individuals reported working for 4-8Ã¢â‚¬â€°hours with COVID-19 patients. The prevalence rate of OB was 18.3%. Besides, 34.2, 48.7, and 56.1% of the respondents had severe levels of emotional exhaustion (EE), higher depersonalization (DP), and decreased sense of personal accomplishment (PA), respectively. Besides, the HCWs at the age range of 20 to 30, having female gender, no children, and a bachelor's degree, and working in isolation wards showed the higher levels of OB with reference to the Chi-square test results (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Accordingly, the statistical test outcomes demonstrated that a history of physical illnesses (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and psychiatric disorders (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.044) could be the best predictor of OB throughout the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Regarding the high prevalence rate of OB among the HCWs and the remaining COVID-19 journey in Iran, health care managers are recommended to orient the required management and coping strategies toward improving mental health in these individuals.","Kamali, Azizi, Moosazadeh, Mehravaran, Ghasemian, Reskati, Elyasi","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-04014-x","20220603","Burnout; COVID-19; Mental health; Occupational health; Burnout, Professional; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Iran; Male; Pandemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32438,""

"The moderating effects of nostalgia on mood and optimism during the COVID-19 pandemic","The initial waves of the coronavirus pandemic amplified feelings of depression, psychological fatigue and pessimism for the future. Past research suggests that nostalgia helps to repair negative moods by boosting current and future-oriented positive affect, thereby strengthening psychological resilience. Accordingly, the present study investigated whether nostalgia moderated the relationship between pandemic experience and individual differences in mood and optimism. Across two studies we assessed psychosocial self-report data from a total of 293 online participants (22-72 years old; mean age 38; 109 females, 184 males) during the first two waves of the pandemic. Participants completed comprehensive questionnaires that probed state and trait characteristics related to mood and memory, such as the Profile of Mood States, Nostalgia Inventory and State Optimism Measure. Our findings indicate that during the initial wave of coronavirus cases, higher levels of nostalgia buffered against deteriorating mood states associated with concern over the pandemic. Nostalgia also boosted optimism for participants experiencing negative mood, and optimism predicted subjective mood improvement one week later. This shielding effect of nostalgia on optimism was replicated during the second wave of coronavirus cases. The present findings support the role of nostalgia in promoting emotional homeostasis and resilience during periods of psychological distress.","Faul, De Brigard","https://doi.org/10.1080/09658211.2022.2082481","20220606","COVID-19; Nostalgia; mood; optimism","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32440,""

This study examined disparities in the perceived impacts of the pandemic on sleep, mental and physical health, social functioning, and substance use among young adults based on sexual/gender minority (SGM) status and race/ethnicity. Participants were 2,411 young adults (mean ageÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 23.6) surveyed between July 2020-July 2021. A linear regression analysis tested SGM and racial/ethnic group differences on 17 outcomes. Most young adults reported little-to-no effect of the pandemic on sleep or other indicators of health and functioning. However, SGM young adults reported more adverse effects than non-SGM young adults on their sleep and most other outcomes. Hispanic young adults reported shorter sleep duration - but less pandemic-related depression, loneliness, and relationship problems - compared to non-Hispanic white young adults. We found no evidence that young adults with multiple minority statuses had especially poor pandemic-related outcomes. While most young adults did not perceive much impact of the pandemic, results highlight disparities across certain demographic subgroups that may need to be addressed through targeted interventions and close monitoring for long-term effects.","Tucker, Dunbar, Perez, Seelam, Troxel, Davis, D'Amico","https://doi.org/10.1080/15402002.2022.2075366","20220602","Adult; COVID-19; Ethnic and Racial Minorities; Ethnicity; Humans; Pandemics; Sleep; Young Adult","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32442,""
"Physical Activity, Dietary Habits and Factors Associated with Depression Among Medical Students of Sindh, Pakistan, During the COVID-19 Pandemic","To find out the association of physical activity, dietary habits and factors associated with depression among medical students of Sindh, Pakistan, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. An online cross-sectional study was conducted between June and August, 2020, on medical students from three medical institutions of Sindh, Pakistan. The study comprised three structured questionnaires related to demographic details, physical activity, dietary and sleep habits, COVID-19 pandemic-associated factors and patient health questionnaire, PHQ-9. A total of 864 students completed the questionnaires and participated in the study. The data was analysed on SPSS version 23. Our study showed that 244 (28.2%) medical students had mild depression, 192 (22.2%) had moderate depression, 80 (9.3%) had moderately severe depression and 80 (9.3%) had severe depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. Out of 864 students, 268 (31%) had no depression. Socioeconomic status, body mass index (BMI), chronic disease/comorbidity, addiction and non-medical prescription drug use were found to be statistically significant predictors of depression among medical students. On multilogistic regression analysis, physical activity, social media/app use and sleeping habits during COVID-19 were associated with depression (p-value &lt; 0.05). The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected physical activity and sleeping habits in association with depression among medical students. Promoting healthy eating habits, adequate physical activity, and a healthy lifestyle, particularly among students during lockdowns, is a critical component of coping with mental stress and depression.

"Impact of a telemedicine system on work burden and mental health of healthcare providers working with COVID-19: a multicenter pre-post prospective study","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic impacts not only patients but also healthcare providers. This study seeks to investigate whether a telemedicine system reduces physical contact in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic and mitigates nurses' distress and depression. Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in 4 hospitals and 1 designated accommodation measured and uploaded their vital signs to secure cloud storage for remote monitoring. Additionally, a mat-type sensor placed under the bed monitored the patients' respiratory rates. Using the pre-post prospective design, visit counts and health care providers' mental health were assessed before and after the system was introduced. A total of 100 nurses participated in the study. We counted the daily visits for 48 and 69 patients with and without using the telemedicine system. The average patient visits were significantly less with the system (16.3 [5.5-20.3] vs 7.5 [4.5-17.5] times/day, <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.009). Specifically, the visit count for each vital sign assessment was about half with the telemedicine system (all <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.0001). Most nurses responded that the system was easy to use (87.1%), reduced work burden (75.2%), made them feel relieved (74.3%), and was effective in reducing the infection risk in hospitals (79.1%) and nursing accommodations (95.0%). Distress assessed by Impact of Event Scale-Revised and depression by Patient Health Questionnaire-9 were at their minimum even without the system and did not show any significant difference with the system (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.72 and .57, respectively).

"Regional Comparison of Diabetes Psychosocial Comorbidities Among Americans With Type 1 Diabetes During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The purpose of this study was to compare diabetes psychosocial comorbidities among adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) across the United States during the onset of COVID-19 pandemic. Adults with T1D from 4 main US geographic regions including South (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°367), West (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°234), Northeast (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°250), and Midwest (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°247) completed a cross-sectional online survey between April and June 2020. Data collection was done on psychosocial measures, glycemic variability, sociodemographic characteristics, and various challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Chi-square, Fisher's exact, Kruskal-Wallis tests, ordinary least squares, proportional odds, and ordinal logistic regression methods were used for data analysis. In the South, 51.2% of participants had moderate to high levels of diabetes distress, and this was significantly (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.03) higher than other regions. Northeast region had the lowest prevalence of moderate to severe diabetes burnout (19.8%), but this was not significantly different compared to the other regions. Participants in the South had also the highest mean score on the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire, with 30.3% of them reporting moderate to severe depressive symptoms. However, there were no significant differences in depressive symptoms among the regions. Glycemic control, demographic characteristics, and COVID-19-related challenges were associated with different psychosocial comorbidities in different regions. When providing information and support to individuals with diabetes in time of crisis like the COVID pandemic, providers should consider psychosocial aspects of diabetes care. Diabetes disparities and contextual factors vary geographically in the United States; these factors may impact the psychosocial comorbidities of diabetes in each region.","Abdoli, Odoi, Doosti-Irani, Fanti, Beebe","https://doi.org/10.1177/26350106221102863","20220601","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32445,""
"A case study addressing trauma needs during COVID-19 remote learning from an ecological systems theory framework","Mental health conditions related to trauma among American children are a concern, particularly because of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Children, as students, carry the trauma they encounter with them into the classroom. Students impacted by trauma learn differently due to effects on the brain that relate to several impairments, causing them to perform poorly in school. However, teachers may not always understand this issue. This case study shows how certain dynamics within the EST layers impacted one school during the pandemic. The purpose of this study was to examine how teachers at the school experienced a trauma-informed online PD and SEL program intended to improve student outcomes, teacher perceptions, and teacher-student relationships. The six participants included teachers in a K-8 low-income, minority population charter school. The assessment tools used were the Teacher-Student Relationship Scale, Teacher Perception Scale, and Student Outcomes Survey. The teachers' outlook on SEL improved, particularly online. This improvement helped the teachers implement community circles and SEL infused with mindfulness in their online classrooms, which may have helped them maintain their relationships with the students and may have helped the students with academic and stress outcomes. During unprecedented times, the maintenance, rather than the deterioration, of student outcomes and teacher-student relationships is an accomplishment and an area that necessitates further research.","Mahmud","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-022-00848-y","20220602","Online learning; Pandemic; Social emotional learning; Teacher perceptions; Teacher student relationships; Trauma; COVID-19; Child; Ecosystem; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Pandemics; Students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32446,""
"Mental health provider perspectives of the COVID-19 pandemic impact onÃ‚Â service delivery: a focus on challenges in remote engagement, suicide risk assessment, and treatment of psychosis","The COVID-19 pandemic has been impacting the need, utilization, and delivery of mental health services with greater challenges being faced by clients and providers. With many clients facing reduced access to services and social isolation, a focus on suicide risk assessment and prevention is critical. Concern is particularly increased for clients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders given data show suicide rates are disproportionately high for those with psychosis in comparison to the general population. Provider perspectives of challenges in service delivery are needed to inform efforts to improve access, feasibility, and quality of mental health care throughout the evolving pandemic. This study explored mental health provider perspectives of client challenges in service utilization and provider challenges in service delivery, including remote engagement, suicide risk assessment, and treatment of psychosis. Data were collected from social work mental health providers (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°12) in United States community mental health setting. Providers consented to participate and responded to questions about service delivery experiences in late 2020 and in relation to COVID-19. Demographic and practice-related provider data were explored descriptively using SPSS and qualitative data using open coding and grounded theory methods in Dedoose. Among the 9 providers who engaged in remote service delivery, 7 (77.8%) experienced challenges in remote engagement with clients and 8 (88.9%) experienced challenges in treatment of psychosis. Among the 7 providers who engaged in remote suicide assessment, 4(57%) experienced challenges. Qualitative themes emerged including logistic (e.g., technology access and use), engagement (e.g., virtual rapport-building and limited remote services), and clinical (e.g., difficulty assessing suicide risk, internal stimuli, abnormal involuntary movement, and affect) challenges in service delivery. Provider perspectives are essential to inform efforts to build resources and problem-solve challenges and barriers that both providers and clients face throughout various shifts in mental health service delivery. Findings emphasize the need to troubleshoot client access to technology, bolster support for providers to prevent burnout, and greater provider training to improve skills in remote engagement, assessment, and treatment, particularly in relation to psychosis and suicide prevention. Study implications are not only critical for the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, but also in preparation for ongoing shifts in service delivery as technology evolves.","Bornheimer, Li Verdugo, Holzworth, Smith, Himle","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-022-08106-y","20220602","Community mental health; Mental health; Psychosis; Risk assessment; Service delivery; Suicide; COVID-19; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Psychotic Disorders; Risk Assessment; Suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32447,""
"Growing up during a public health crisis: a qualitative study of Born in Bradford early adolescents during Covid-19","Whilst children and young people have not often been at forefront of the immediate Covid-19 pandemic health response there has been concern about the indirect consequences of Covid-19 on children's physical and mental health and what the effect of the pandemic will be throughout their lifetimes. Early adolescence is a time of transition and reorientation. This study considers the impact of the first UK Covid-19 lockdown on early adolescents. The study topic was identified through a consultation process which aimed to provide appropriate evidence to local decision makers in Bradford, UK and plan for future interventions. A group of children and their parents from the longitudinal Born in Bradford (BiB) cohort study were randomly selected and then purposively sampled by ethnicity, age, sex and deprivation. The BiB cohort is made up of 13,776 children and their families and were recruited at Bradford Royal Infirmary between 2007 and 2011. 41 interviews (with 20 families: 20 parents and 21 children) were carried out between August and September 2020. Interview data was analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. The transitional age of the children interviewed had an important influence on their experience Covid-19 and the first UK lockdown. Their age combined with lockdown and school closures meant that they missed out on key learning and social opportunities at a crucial time in their lives. Covid-19 and lockdown also disrupted their daily mental wellbeing and led to increased anxiety, lethargy and low moods, during a period of personal change and social transition. For children at the start of their adolescence undergoing change and formation, the experiences and feelings Covid-19 has set in motion will likely have an impact on their mental and cognitive functioning as they develop further. It is important to acknowledge these early adolescent experiences and continue to monitor and provide targeted support to this group of young people.","Lockyer, Endacott, Dickerson, Sheard","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-022-00851-3","20220602","Adolescence; Bradford; Covid-19; Mental Wellbeing; Adolescent; COVID-19; Child; Cohort Studies; Communicable Disease Control; Female; Humans; Pandemics; Public Health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32448,""
"An analysis of English national policy approaches to health inequalities: 'transforming children and young people's mental health provision' and its consultation process","A national policy for England, published in 2017, entitled 'Transforming Children and Young People's Mental Health Provision' aimed to address the increasing prevalence mental health problems in children and tackle inequalities. In the context of this policy's implementation as ongoing and the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, the need for appropriate, timely and ongoing national government commitment is vital. A narrative review using a problem representation evaluation [1], we critiqued the policy and related consultation documents using a social determinants of health perspective. We also reviewed wider policy discourses through engaging with stakeholder responses, providing an innovative methodological contribution to scholarship on public health policy and health inequalities. We found absences and oversights in relation to inequalities (most notably the lack of acknowledgement that mental health can cause inequalities), access, workforce capacity, and the impacts of cuts and austerity on service provision. We suggest these inadequacies may have been avoided if stakeholder responses to the consultation process had been more meaningfully addressed. We illustrate how 'problems' are discursively created through the process of policy development, justified using specific types of evidence, and that this process is politically motivated. Local policy makers have a critical role in translating and adapting national policy for their communities but are constrained by absences and oversights in relation to health inequalities. This narrative review illustrates how policy discourse frames and produces 'problems', and how the evidence used is selected and justified politically. This review contributes to the existing transdisciplinary field of knowledge about how using methods from political and social science disciplines can reveal new insights when critiquing and influencing policy approaches to health inequalities.","Griffin, Wistow, Fairbrother, Holding, Sirisena, Powell, Summerbell","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-13473-6","20220602","Children; Health inequalities; Mental health; Narrative review; National Policy; Adolescent; COVID-19; Child; Health Policy; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Referral and Consultation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32449,""
"Explaining interpersonal differences in COVID-19 disease prevention behavior based on the health belief model and collective resilience theory: a cross-sectional study from Bolivia","Governments have attempted to combat the COVID-19 pandemic by issuing guidelines for disease prevention behavior (e.g., wearing masks, social distancing, etc.) and by enforcing these guidelines. However, while some citizens have complied with these guidelines, others have ignored them or have even participated in large-scale protests. This research aims both to understand the causes of such variation in citizens' adherence to government guidelines on disease prevention behavior and to extend the scientific literature on disease prevention to account for the collective resilience of a society to diseases. Thus, this research draws on the health belief model and collective resilience theory to develop hypotheses about the determinants of a citizen's disease prevention behavior. These hypotheses deal with how citizens' vulnerability, attitudes toward disease prevention, and social orientation are associated with COVID-19 prevention behaviors. From March 24 to April 4, 2020, a cross-sectional online survey was conducted in Bolivia. It included questions on demographic characteristics, chronic health problems, emotional burden, attitudes towards preventive behaviors, trust in public institutions, and culture. Among 5265 participants who clicked on the survey, 1857 at least partially filled it out. After removing data with missing responses to any variable, the final sample consists of 1231 respondents. The collected data were analyzed using hierarchical linear modeling. Regarding a citizen's vulnerability, chronic health problems have a U-shaped association with disease prevention behavior. Moreover, age, female gender, and worries have positive associations with disease prevention behavior, whereas depression showed a negative association. Regarding attitudes toward disease prevention, trust in public institutions, and attitudes toward social distancing, a government-imposed lockdown and the enforcement of this lockdown showed positive associations with disease prevention behavior. Regarding social orientation, individualism and collectivism both have positive relationships with disease prevention behavior. In the COVID-19 pandemic, a citizen's low vulnerability, weak social orientation, and beliefs about low benefits of disease prevention behavior are associated with poor compliance with guidelines on disease prevention behavior. More research on these associations would help generalize these findings to other populations and other public health crises.","Herbas-Torrico, Frank","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-13068-1","20220602","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Disease prevention; Hygiene; Social distancing; Surgical mask; Bolivia; COVID-19; Communicable Disease Control; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Belief Model; Humans; Pandemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32450,""
"Trauma exposure and depression among frontline health professionals during COVID-19 outbreak in China: the role of intrusive rumination and organizational silence","Healthcare professionals bared particularly high risk and stress during the COVID-19 outbreak. Previous studies have demonstrated that healthcare professionals exposed to COVID-19 incurred various affective disorders including depressive symptoms, anxiety, insomnia, and distress. However, the mechanism underlying the relationship between trauma exposure and depressive symptom among frontline hospital staff has yet to be investigated. This study aims to assess the prevalence of depressive symptoms among frontline healthcare professionals in Shenzhen, China, and elucidate the complex relationship among trauma exposure, intrusive rumination, and organizational silence. The data of this study were collected through a time-lagged panel questionnaire survey with three rounds of measurements from February 2020 to May 2020 at an infectious disease hospital in Shenzhen, in which all the confirmed cases of COVID-19 patients were accommodated. Based on cluster sampling design, a total of 134 frontline healthcare professionals directly involved in providing diagnosis, treatment, and nursing services for COVID-19 patients completed three times of web survey. The depressive symptom and trauma exposure were measured via the 12-items General Health Questionnaire and the Explosion Exposure Questionnaire respectively. A moderated mediation model examined the complex interplay among the major study variables. Gender and working year were included as control variables. Trauma exposure was significantly associated with depression in frontline healthcare professionals. Intrusive rumination mediated the effect of trauma exposure on the depressive symptom, which was moderated by organizational silence. Intrusive rumination presented a more substantial impact on depression while organization silence was lower. This research demonstrates that intrusive rumination and organizational silence are imperative for predicting the depressive symptoms among the frontline healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Li, Wu, Gu, Ni","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-04011-0","20220602","COVID-19; Depression; Healthcare professional; Intrusive rumination; Organization silence; Trauma exposure; COVID-19; Depression; Disease Outbreaks; Health Personnel; Humans; Pandemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32451,""
"Prediction of PTSD related to COVID-19 in emergency staff based on the components of self-compassion and perceived social support","On March 11<sup>th</sup>, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) proclaimed Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic. In addition to severe health problems, the disease has had a major psychological impact on the public. The aim of this research was to examine the association between Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) related to COVID-19 in emergency staff and self-compassion and perceived social support. Data were collected from 222 emergency staff working in two referral educational and health centers for COVID-19 affiliated to Tabriz University of Medical Sciences. The participants were recruited six months following the first case of hospitalization for COVID-19 in these two hospitals in Tabriz, Iran. Four questionnaires were used to measure the variables, including a researcher-made demographic checklist, PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), the Multidimensional Perceived Social Support Scale (MSPSS) and the Self-Compassion Scale. The findings showed that age (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.17, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.034), self-judgment (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0. 36, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), isolation (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.44, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and over-identification (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.15, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.031) were associated with PTSD score, and there was also a statistically significant inverse relationship between the score of the self-kindness (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°= - 0.19, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.006) subscale and the overall score of PTSD in the emergency staff. During the COVID-19 pandemic, emergency staff have persistently faced potentially traumatic situations as first-line healthcare workers, suggesting the direness of this group's mental health. By identifying the predisposing factors of the psychological pathology under study, this research can be applied in clinical practice and provide useful information for designing special interventions and protocols for emergency staff.","Shahsavarinia, Amiri, Mousavi, Gilani, Saadati, Soleimanpour","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-04017-8","20220602","COVID-19; Emergency staff; PTSD; Perceived social support; Self-compassion; COVID-19; Humans; Pandemics; Self-Compassion; Social Support; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32452,""
"Self-monitoring of blood pressure among women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: a systematic review","The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends self-monitoring of blood pressure (SMBP) for hypertension management. In addition, during the COVID-19 response, WHO guidance also recommends SMBP supported by health workers although more evidence is needed on whether SMBP of pregnant individuals with hypertension (gestational hypertension, chronic hypertension, or pre-eclampsia) may assist in early detection of pre-eclampsia, increase end-user autonomy and empowerment, and reduce health system burden. To expand the evidence base for WHO guideline on self-care interventions, we conducted a systematic review of SMBP during pregnancy on maternal and neonatal outcomes. We searched for publications that compared SMBP with clinic-based monitoring during antenatal care. We included studies measuring any of the following outcomes: maternal mortality, pre-eclampsia, long-term risk and complications, autonomy, HELLP syndrome, C-section, antenatal hospital admission, adverse pregnancy outcomes, device-related issues, follow-up care with appropriate management, mental health and well-being, social harms, stillbirth or perinatal death, birthweight/size for gestational age, and Apgar score. After abstract screening and full-text review, we extracted data using standardized forms and summarized findings. We also reviewed studies assessing values and preferences as well as costs of SMBP. We identified 6 studies meeting inclusion criteria for the effectiveness of SMBP, 6 studies on values and preferences, and 1 study on costs. All were from high-income countries. Overall, when comparing SMBP with clinic-monitoring, there was no difference in the risks for most of the outcomes for which data were available, though there was some evidence of increased risk of C-section among pregnant women with chronic hypertension. Most end-users and providers supported SMBP, motivated by ease of use, convenience, self-empowerment and reduced anxiety. One study found SMBP would lower health sector costs. Limited evidence suggests that SMBP during pregnancy is feasible and acceptable, and generally associated with maternal and neonatal health outcomes similar to clinic-based monitoring. However, more research is needed in resource-limited settings.

"Pathogenesis of Viral Infections and Male Reproductive Health: An Evidence-Based Study","Viruses, being intracellular obligate parasites, can cause several congenital and sexually transmitted diseases. Depending on the site of infection, viruses can adopt various pathogenic mechanisms for their survival and to escape the host immune response. The male reproductive system is one of the attainable targets of many viruses including immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Zika virus (ZIKV), adenovirus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and infection with such viruses may cause serious health issues. Leydig cells and seminiferous tubules are the prime sites of mammalian testis for viral infection. The azoospermic condition is a common symptom of viral infection, wherein the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) axis can be disrupted, leading to decreased levels of luteinizing hormone (LH). Furthermore, oxidative stress (OS) is a major contributing factor to viral infection-associated male infertility. The likelihood of direct and indirect infection, as well as sex-based variability in the vulnerability pattern to viral infections, has been observed. However, there appears to be a long-term impact of viral infection on male reproductive performance due to testicular tissue pathogenicity - a process that requires thorough investigation. The present study aimed to explore how the viruses affect the male reproductive system, including their distribution in tissues and body fluids, possible targets as well as the effects on the endocrine system. We used the major electronic databases such as MEDLINE and SCOPUS. Google Scholar was also consulted for additional literature search related to the topic. Obtained literatures were sorted based on the content. The articles that reported the pathogenesis of viruses on male reproductive health and were published in the English language were included in the present study.","Sarkar, Dutta, Roychoudhury, Poduval, Jha, Dhal, Roychoudhury, Kesari","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-89340-8_14","20220602","Epidemic; Male reproductive system; Oxidative stress; Reproductive endocrinology; Sexual transmission; Viral infection; Animals; COVID-19; Humans; Male; Mammals; Reproductive Health; SARS-CoV-2; Virus Diseases; Viruses; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32454,""
"A New Pandemic of Loneliness","Loneliness is the subjective feeling people experience when they feel less socially connected to others than they desire. Beyond the impact to mental health and well-being, loneliness is linked to detrimental health outcomes. During the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing and isolation requirements likely exacerbated the prevalence of loneliness, which was reported by 1 in 5 American adults before the pandemic. Whether it be through in-person or virtual visits, primary care clinicians have tools and expertise to screen patients for loneliness, provide them supportive consultations, and refer persons with loneliness to helpful resources. As the societal changes from the pandemic continue to evolve, we recommend that primary care providers include loneliness screens as part of their standard workflow and consult with patients about effective interventions to reduce loneliness.","Lonergan-Cullum, Hooker, Levy, Ricco","https://doi.org/10.3122/jabfm.2022.03.210461","20220602","COVID-19; Family Medicine; Loneliness; Mental Health; Outcome Assessment; Pandemics; Physicians; Primary Health Care; Social Isolation; Adult; COVID-19; Emotions; Humans; Loneliness; Pandemics; Social Isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32455,""
"Mental health outcomes in patients with a long-term condition: analysis of an Improving Access to Psychological Therapies service","Having a long-term condition (LTC) significantly affects mental health. UK policy requires effective mental health provisions for patients with an LTC, generally provided by Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services. National IAPT data suggest that patients with an LTC typically demonstrate poorer outcomes compared with patients without an LTC. However, exploration of confounding factors and different outcome variables is limited. To establish the association of LTC status with demographic and clinical factors, and clinical mental health outcomes. Anonymised patient-level data from a London IAPT service during January 2019 to October 2020 were used in this cohort study, to compare differences between LTC and non-LTC groups on sociodemographic and clinical variables. Binary logistic and multiple linear regression models were constructed for binary outcome variables (recovery and reliable improvement) and continuous outcomes (distress and functioning), respectively. Patients with an LTC were more likely to be female; older; from a Black, mixed or other ethnic background; and have greater social deprivation. Across the four clinical outcomes (recovery, reliable improvement, final psychological distress and final functioning), having an LTC significantly predicted poorer outcomes even after controlling for sociodemographic and clinical baseline variables. For three outcome variables, greater social deprivation and being discharged during the COVID-19 pandemic also predicted poorer clinical outcomes. LTC status has a negative effect on mental health outcomes in IAPT services, independent of associated variables such as severity of baseline mental health symptoms, ethnicity and social deprivation. Effective psychological treatment for patients with an LTC remains an unresolved priority.","Seaton, Moss-Morris, Norton, Hulme, Hudson","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.59","20220531","anxiety disorders; comorbidity; depressive disorders; primary care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32456,""
"Stress and the Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Frontline Obstetrics and Gynecology Providers","Ã¢â‚¬Æ’The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic rapidly overwhelmed global health care systems in 2020, with New York City (NYC) marking the first epicenter in the United States. High levels of stress amongst health care workers have been reported in pandemics, but less is known about stress amongst Obstetrics and Gynecology (OB/GYN) providers. We sought to describe levels of stress, anxiety, depression, and other aspects of mental health among OB/GYN health care workers during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ã¢â‚¬Æ’We conducted an anonymous cross-sectional electronic survey of a wide range of OB/GYN clinicians in a large NYC hospital system in the spring of 2020. We used both original survey questions and validated screening tools to assess stress, anxiety, depression, and burnout. We calculated median scores for these tools and compared median score between provider types. We also adapted questions on pandemic-related stressors from the MERS and SARS pandemics to fit the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and OB/GYN providers. Ã¢â‚¬Æ’A total of 464 providers met study inclusion criteria, and 163 providers completed the survey (response rateÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°35.1%). Approximately 35% of providers screened positive for anxiety and 21% for depression. Scores for depression, burnout, and fulfillment varied by provider type, with nurses scoring higher than physicians (<i>p</i> &lt;0.05).

The purpose of this descriptive study is to describe stress in parents of a child with chronic illness during the COVID-19 pandemic. Parents of CSHCN (n = 34) were asked to fill out the Pediatric Inventory for Parents (PIP) and answer two questions related to caring for their child during the COVID-19 pandemic. The means of the PIP-F (M = 146.6, SD = 20.5) and PIP-D (M = 141.9, SD = 23.9) were significantly higher than in previous studies. There is statistically significant positive correlation between parent stress and variables of age of the child and the length of time since diagnosis. In response to the questions about the impact of COVID, nearly all parents reported COVID increased their stress and reported their stress was related to isolation, lack of resources, and concern for the mental health of other children in the household. COVID-19 likely exacerbated feelings of stress for parents of children with chronic health conditions. Although unprecedented, COVID-19 shed light on the existing fragility and high stress of parents of CSHCN. Pediatric nurses not only care for children, but must be advocates for the mental health of their patient's parents.","Gallegos, Aldridge, Connor, Zuba","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedn.2022.05.009","20220603","CMC; CSHCN; Chronic illness; Parents; Pediatric inventory for parents; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32458,""
"Feasibility, satisfaction, acceptability and safety of telehealth for First Nations and culturally and linguistically diverse people: a scoping review","The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of access to telehealth as an alternative model of service during social restrictions and for urban and remote communities alike. This study aimed to elucidate whether First Nations and culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) patients also benefited from the resource before or during the pandemic. This study was a scoping review. A scoping review of MEDLINE, CINAHL and PsycINFO databases from 2000 to 2021 was performed. Paired authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts. A narrative synthesis was undertaken after data extraction using a standard template by a team including First Nations and CALD researchers. Seventeen studies (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 4,960 participants) mostly qualitative, covering First Nations and CALD patient recipients of telehealth in the United States, Canada, Australia, and the Pacific Islands, met the inclusion criteria. Telehealth was perceived feasible, satisfactory, and acceptable for the delivery of health screening, education, and care in mental health, diabetes, cancer, and other chronic conditions for remote and linguistically isolated populations. The advantages of convenience, lower cost, and less travel promoted uptake and adherence to the service, but evidence was lacking on the wider availability of technology and engagement of target communities in informing priorities to address inequalities. Further studies with larger samples and higher level evidence methods involving First Nations and CALD people as co-designers will assist in filling the gap of safety and cultural competency.","Fien, Dowsett, Hunter, Myooran, Sahay, Menzel, Cardona","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2022.04.007","20220531","CALD; Feasibility; First Nations; Telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32459,""
"""Effect of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic outbreak on the emergency department admission for an acute psychiatric condition""","Preliminary evidence seems to suggest a reduction in absolute terms of Emergency Department (ED) admissions for an acute psychiatric condition during the first months of the pandemic. The study aimed to test through a long-term time analysis the effect of COVID-19 on changes in ED visits for an acute psychiatric condition. A quasi-experimental interrupted time series analysis of admissions for acute psychiatric conditions to the Emergency Department of the Merano Hospital (Italy) was performed from January 2017 to August 2021. The main outcome was the monthly rate of ED accesses for an acute psychiatric condition reported per 1000 general admissions. The pandemic outbreak was used as an intervention point. 4398 ED admissions for an acute psychiatric condition were registered. The rate of monthly admissions over total admissions increased from a mean of March 17, 1000 (SD 2.9) admissions per month in the pre-COVID-19 era to September 22, 1000 (SD 4.5) in the pandemic months, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001. In March 2020, the pandemic outbreak led to a significant increase in ED visits for an acute psychiatric condition (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.013) and suicide attempts (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.029), and to an increased need for pharmacological sedation in ED (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.001). During the pandemic, although admissions and hospitalizations showed a non-significant decreasing trend, suicide attempts increased steadily and significantly. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic caused a major increase in rates of admission to the ED for an acute psychiatric condition.","Turcato, Zaboli, Luchetti, Sighele, Sibilio, Donato, Pfeifer, Brigo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.05.035","20220606","Acute psychiatric condition; COVID-19; Psychiatric; SARS-CoV-2; Suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32460,""
"Is Methadone Safe for Patients With Opioid Use Disorder and Coronavirus Disease 2019 Infection?","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to not only increase in substance misuse, substance use disorder, and risk of overdose but also lack of access to treatment services. Due to lack of knowledge of the course and impact of COVID-19 and outcomes of it's interactions with existing treatments, the Substance Misuse Service Team initiated a safety improvement project to review the safety of opioid substitution treatment, particularly the safety of methadone. This preliminary retrospective cross-sectional audit of safety improvement intiative underscores the importance of providing treatment services to those with opioid use disorders and that methadone is safe among this population with a high burden of comorbidity, most of which leads to negative outcomes from COVID-19. The outcomes show that patients who have COVID-19 should continue with opioid substitution treatment with methadone. Although treatment with methadone is safe, symptomatic patients should be monitored. In addition, patients who take methadone at home should be educated on the risk of overdose due to, and adverse outcomes from, COVID-19 infection. Patients should monitor themselves using pulse oximeter for any signs of hypoxia.","Owiti, Benson, Maplanka, Oluseye, Carvalho","https://doi.org/10.1097/JAN.0000000000000457","20220602","COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Drug Overdose; Humans; Methadone; Opioid-Related Disorders; Retrospective Studies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32461,""
"Effects of The Mitochondrial Genome on Germ Cell Fertility: A Review of The Literature","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters cells through angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which expression of its gene increases during pregnancy that is resulted in an enhanced level of the ACE2 enzyme. It might enhance the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its complications in the pregnant women. Although, pregnancy hypertensive disorders and severe infection with SARS-CoV-2 are correlated with high comorbidity, these two entities should be discriminated from each other. Also, there is a concern about the risk of preeclampsia and consequently severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) development in the pregnant women. So, to answer these questions, in the present review the literature was surveyed. It seems there is higher severity of COVID-19 among pregnant women than non-pregnant women and more adverse pregnancy outcomes among pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2. In addition, an association between COVID-19 with preeclampsia and the role of preeclampsia and gestational hypertension as risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and its complications is suggested. However, infection of the placenta and the SARS-CoV-2 vertical transmission is rare. Various mechanisms could explain the role of COVID-19 in the risk of preeclampsia and association between preeclampsia and COVID-19. Suggested mechanisms are included decreased ACE2 activity and imbalance between Ang II and Ang-(1-7) in preeclampsia, association of both of severe forms of COVID-19 and pregnancy hypertensive disorders with comorbidity, and interaction between immune system, inflammatory cytokines and the renin angiotensin aldosterone system and its contribution to the hypertension pathogenesis. It is concluded that preeclampsia and gestational hypertension might be risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and its complications.Infertility is one of the major problems faced in medicine. There are numerous factors that play a role in infertility. For example, numerous studies mention the impact of the quantity and quality of mitochondria in sexual gametes. This is a narrative review of the effects of the mitochondrial genome on fertility. We searched the PubMed, Science Direct, SID, Google Scholar, and Scopus databases for articles related to ""Fertility, Infertility, Miscarriage, Mitochondria, Sperm, mtDNA, Oocytes"" and other synonymous keywords from 2000 to 2020. The mitochondrial genome affects infertility in both male and female gametes; in sperm, it mainly releases free radicals. In the oocyte, a mutation in this genome can affect the amount of energy required after fertilisation, leading to gestation failure. In both cases, infertile cells have substantially less mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copies. The effects of mtDNA on gamete fertility occur via changes in oxidative phosphorylation and cellular energy production. Also, a reduction in the number of mtDNA copies is directly associated with sex cell infertility. Therefore, evaluation of the mitochondrial genome can be an excellent diagnostic option for couples who have children with neonatal disorders, infertile couples who seek assisted reproductive treatment, and those in whom assisted reproductive techniques have failed.","Rahimi Darehbagh, Khalafi, Allahveisi, Habiby","https://doi.org/10.22074/IJFS.2021.527076.1098","20220531","Infertility; Mitochondria; Mitochondrial Genome; Oocyte; Sperm","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32462,""
"Academic stress, COVID-19 anxiety, and quality of life among nursing students: The mediating role of resilience","This study investigated the mediating role of resilience in the relationship between academic stress, COVID-19 anxiety, and quality of life (QoL) among Filipino nursing students during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the QoL of nursing students who are experiencing mental health issues. The mediating role of resilience in mitigating the effects of academic stress and COVID-19 anxiety on nursing students' QoL remains understudied. This study employed a correlational cross-sectional design, with a convenience sample of 611 Filipino nursing students. Data were collected using the scales Connor and Davidson Resilience, Brunnsviken Brief Quality of Life, COVID-19 Anxiety, and Perception of Academic Stress and analyzed using Pearson's r, bivariate analysis, and multistage regression analyses. Academic stress and COVID-19 anxiety negatively correlated with QoL and resilience. Resilience was positively associated with QoL and reduced the effect of academic stress on QoL, indicating that resilience is a crucial mediating variable between academic stress and QoL. Finally, resilience had a significant mediating influence on QoL, as evidenced by a reduction in the effect of COVID-19 anxiety on QoL among nursing students. Filipino nursing students' QoL was affected by academic stress and COVID-19-related anxiety. However, resilience mediated this impact, preserving QoL. Nursing colleges and affiliated hospitals must collaborate to monitor academic stress and pandemic-related anxiety. Nursing students should be provided with programs such as seminars and team-building activities to enhance their resilience.","Berdida, Grande","https://doi.org/10.1111/inr.12774","20220531","COVID-19; anxiety; nursing student; quality of life; resilience; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32463,""
"Cancer pain during an epidemic and a pandemic","As our global population ages, cancer has become more prevalent. Thankfully, oncologic treatments are highly effective, leading to significantly improved rates of long-term survival. However, many of these therapies are associated with persistent pain syndromes. Clinicians caring for people with cancer must understand how the influence of the current epidemic of opioid misuse and the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have complicated cancer pain management. Creative solutions can emerge from this knowledge. Persistent pain due to cancer and its treatment can be managed through multimodal care, although efforts to mitigate the opioid misuse epidemic have created challenges in access to appropriate treatment. Isolation measures associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have limited access to nonpharmacologic therapies, such as physical therapy, and have exacerbated mental health disorders, including anxiety and depression. Cancer pain treatment requires more nuanced assessment and treatment decisions as patients live longer. Societal factors multiply existing challenges to cancer pain relief. Research is needed to support safe and effective therapies.","Paice","https://doi.org/10.1097/SPC.0000000000000594","20220602","Analgesics, Opioid; COVID-19; Cancer Pain; Chronic Pain; Humans; Neoplasms; Opioid-Related Disorders; Pandemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32464,""
"Social Sharing of Emotion During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The long-term uncertainty and persistence of isolation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic created prolonged emotional distress individually and collectively. As the pandemic progressed, the dynamic ride of emotional experience was expressed live and shared online, particularly on social media. In this study, we collected posted messages on Twitter for a longitudinal investigation to determine how emotional experiences changed over time during the pandemic. In total, we analyzed 41,868,013 COVID-19-related tweets in English posted from January 21 to July 31, 2020. Using a stage model, the results demonstrated that there were three stages during the pandemic characterized by distinct emotional changes. The first stage features high anxiety and negative emotions compared with the other stages, possibly due to the lack of information about the disease. The second stage shows the dynamic ride of all emotions and an increase in negative emotions (particularly anger) as the COVID-19 pandemic proceeds. In the third stage, most emotions are stabilized, except for depression, despite the protracted pandemic.","Kim, Park, Kim, Han, Song","https://doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2021.0270","20220531","COVID19; Twitter; emotion; social sharing; stage model","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32465,""
"Systemic lupus erythematosus in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic: infection, vaccination, and impact on disease management","Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) form a vulnerable group in terms of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on disease management. We conducted this overview by searches through Medline/PubMed, Scopus, and the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ). The prevalence and severity of COVID-19, efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination, impact on the management of SLE, and the attitudes of SLE patients to COVID-19 and vaccination were explored. After screening and due exclusions, 198 studies were included for the final review. Patients with SLE have a greater risk of acquiring COVID-19 (0.6-22%) and related hospitalization (30%), severe disease (13.5%), and death (6.5%) than the general population. Older age, male gender, comorbidities, moderate or high disease activity, and glucocorticoid, rituximab, and cyclophosphamide use are associated with unfavorable outcomes, whereas methotrexate and belimumab use showed no association with outcomes. COVID-19 vaccines are safe in SLE with minimal risk of severe flares (&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°2%). Vaccine efficacy is negatively associated with glucocorticoids. The overall attitude of patients towards vaccination is positive (54-90%).

"Effects of Spike Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern on Human or Animal ACE2-Mediated Virus Entry and Neutralization","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a zoonotic agent capable of infecting humans and a wide range of animal species. Over the duration of the pandemic, mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein have arisen, culminating in the spread of several variants of concern (VOCs) with various degrees of altered virulence, transmissibility, and neutralizing antibody escape. In this study, we used pseudoviruses that express specific SARS-CoV-2 S protein substitutions and cell lines that express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) from nine different animal species to gain insights into the effects of VOC mutations on viral entry and antibody neutralization capability. All animal ACE2 receptors tested, except mink, support viral cell entry for pseudoviruses expressing the ancestral prototype S at levels comparable to human ACE2. Most single S substitutions did not significantly change virus entry, although 614G and 484K resulted in a decreased efficiency. Conversely, combinatorial VOC substitutions in the S protein were associated with increased entry of pseudoviruses. Neutralizing titers in sera from various animal species were significantly reduced against pseudoviruses expressing the S proteins of Beta, Delta, or Omicron VOCs compared to the parental S protein. Especially, substitutions in the S protein of the Omicron variant significantly reduced the neutralizing titers of the sera. This study reveals important insights into the host range of SARS-CoV-2 and the effect of recently emergent S protein substitutions on viral entry, virus replication, and antibody-mediated viral neutralization. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to have devastating impacts on global health and socioeconomics. The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, which contain mutations that can affect the virulence, transmission, and effectiveness of licensed vaccines and therapeutic antibodies, are currently becoming the common strains circulating in humans worldwide. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to infect a wide variety of animal species, which could result in additional mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In this study, we investigate the effect of mutations present in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and determine the effects of these mutations on cell entry, virulence, and antibody neutralization activity in humans and a variety of animals that might be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This information is essential to understand the effects of important SARS-CoV-2 mutations and to inform public policy to create better strategies to control the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kim, Gaudreault, Meekins, Perera, Bold, Trujillo, Morozov, McDowell, Chang, Richt","https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.01789-21","20220607","SARS-CoV-2; neutralization; spike mutations; variants of concern; virus entry; virus replication","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32468,""
"From zero to thrive: A model of cross-system and cross-sector relational health to promote early childhood development across the child-serving ecosystem","Early relational health between caregivers and children is foundational for child health and well-being. Children and caregivers are also embedded within multiple systems and sectors, or a ""child-serving ecosystem"", that shapes child development. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has made this embeddedness abundantly clear, systems remain siloed and lack coordination. Fostering relational health amongst layers of this ecosystem may be a way to systematically support young children and families who are facing adversity. We integrate theory, examples, and empirical findings to develop a conceptual model informed by infant mental health and public health frameworks that illustrates how relational health across the child-serving ecosystem may promote child health and well-being at a population level. Our model articulates what relational health looks like across levels of this ecosystem from primary caregiver-child relationships, to secondary relationships between caregivers and child-serving systems, to tertiary relationships among systems that shape child outcomes directly and indirectly. We posit that positive relational health across levels is critical for promoting child health and well-being broadly. We provide examples of evidence-based approaches that address primary, secondary, and tertiary relational health, and suggest ways to promote relational health through cross-sector training and psychoeducation in the science of early development. This model conceptualizes relational health across the child-serving ecosystem and can serve as a template for promoting child health and well-being in the context of adversity.","Miller, Stein, Sokol, Varisco, Trout, Julian, Ribaudo, Kay, Pilkauskas, Gardner-Neblett, Herrenkohl, Zivin, Muzik, Rosenblum","https://doi.org/10.1002/imhj.21996","20220531","care coordination; child; relational health; science of early development","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32469,""
"""It's the worst thing I've ever been put through in my life"": the trauma experienced by essential family caregivers of loved ones in long-term care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada","Essential family caregivers (EFCs) of relatives living in long-term care homes (LTCHs) experienced restricted access to their relatives due to COVID-19 visitation policies.

Objective: This study aims to explore the EFCs' trauma of being locked out of LTCHs and unable to visit their loved ones in-person during COVID-19. Seven online focus groups with a total of 30 EFCs from Ontario and British Columbia, Canada were conducted as part of a larger mixed-method study. We used an inductive approach to thematic analysis to understand the lived experiences of trauma. Four trauma-related themes emerged: 1) trauma from prolonged separation from loved ones; 2) trauma from uncompassionate interactions with the LTCH's staff and administrators; 3) trauma from the inability to provide care to loved ones, and 4) trauma from experiencing prolonged powerlessness and helplessness. The EFCs experienced a collective trauma that deeply impacted their relationships with their relatives as well as their perception of the LTC system. Experiences endured by EFCs highlighted policy and practice changes, including the need for trauma-centred approaches to repair relational damage and post-pandemic decision-making that collaborates with EFCs.","Chu, Yee, Stamatopoulos","https://doi.org/10.1080/17482631.2022.2075532","20220602","COVID-19; essential family caregivers; focus groups; long-term care home; nursing homes; trauma; COVID-19; Caregivers; Humans; Long-Term Care; Ontario; Pandemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32470,""
"Social determinants of self-reported psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study","Total lockdown caused deleterious mental health to many, resulting from a sudden change in daily routine, working and self-isolation at home, and job and income losses. Therefore, the current study aims to assess the social determinants of self-reported psychological distress in Malaysian adults during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Respondents were required to self-report gender, age, ethnicity, educational attainment, marital status, number of dependents, and the presence of clinically diagnosed psychological disorders. Psychological distress during the pandemic was assessed using 21-item of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21).

"Sleep quality and mental health during COVID-19: the role of distress tolerance","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has negatively impacted psychological health for many. This study aimed to investigate if distress tolerance, an individual's perceived or actual 'capacity to withstand negative psychological states', helps to explain the relationship between sleep and mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. College students (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 187) completed questionnaires using an online survey platform between 6 April 2020, and 6 June 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used to examine the indirect effect of distress tolerance on the relationship between sleep quality and mental health. Distress tolerance partially accounted for the relationship between sleep quality and perceived stress but did not help to explain the association between sleep quality and depression or anxiety. Two components of distress tolerance, absorption and appraisal, helped to explain the relationship between sleep quality and all mental health outcomes. These findings help explain how distress tolerance relates to mental health when sleep is negatively impacted.

In the current study, the relationships of PA and sedentary activity (SA) with mental status amid confinement caused by COVID-19 were examined. The study is self-reporting, survey-based, and cross-sectional in design. The study was conducted in Jordan and included 1744 participants (Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years old). The participants' mental status was obtained using the Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale (DASS). The results showed involvement in both PA and SA during COVID-19-induced confinement. The involvement includes walking (77.2%), running (70.3%), cycling (84.9%), swimming (83.1%), sports (82.9%), weightlifting (86.4%), watching TV (79.4%), using electronics (86.3%), and logging to social media (85.1%). Lower DASS scores were associated (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05) with lower walking, running, and weightlifting but not (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â &gt;Ã‚Â 0.05) with cycling and swimming PA. Additionally, DASS scores (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05) were associated with changes in television viewing but not (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â &gt;Ã‚Â 0.05) with electronics and social media use during confinement. In conclusion, individuals who experienced higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression were more likely to turn to more PA and less SA. These findings are important and suggest that individuals during confinement find PA a useful strategy to mitigate the negative mental effects of the pandemic.","Alomari, Alzoubi, Khabour, Zraigat","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imu.2022.100976","20220608","COVID-19; DASS; Emotions; Mental status; Physical activity; Sedentary activity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32473,""
"Disinfection behavior for COVID-19 in individuals with Down syndrome and caregivers' distress in Japan: a cross-sectional retrospective study","The COVID-19 outbreak affected the daily lives of individuals with Down syndrome, who were considered to have a higher risk of severe infection. While several studies have reported mental health issues in children and/or parents in the general population, no study has focused on people with Down syndrome and their caregivers. This study investigated the disinfection behaviors of individuals with Down syndrome and their caregivers' stress. A cross-sectional retrospective survey was conducted in October 2020. Caregivers of children and adults with Down syndrome were administered questionnaires including measures for practiced disinfection behavior in children, caregiver's child-related stress, and psychological distress. About half of the respondents' children practiced hand hygiene and mask-wearing behaviors, while physical distancing was performed less frequently. Habitual practices in physical distancing are affected by intellectual function. Logistic regression showed that caregivers' stress was associated with the irritability of individuals with the disorder (adjusted odds ratio [OR]Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°8.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.69-42.09) and the burden of infection-prevention behaviors for people with Down syndrome (adjusted ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.26, 95% CI 1.88-9.65).

"Depression and anxiety among Pakistani healthcare workers amid COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative study","The sudden COVID-19 crisis required a determined effort on the part of the healthcare workers (HCWs) and excessive workload increased the risk of depressive and anxious symptoms in frontliners. The aim of the study was to assess anxiety and depression levels among HCWs during times of pandemic and its potential aggravating factors. A web-based survey was conducted to assess the mental health outcomes of healthcare workers and related factors during the COVID-19 pandemic. For assessing depression and anxiety, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) comprised of 14 items with seven items for depression and seven for anxiety were used. Of all 436 participants, 158 (36.2%) showed noticeable symptoms of depression and 220 (50.4%) showed substantial anxiety symptoms. The majority of them were females. It has been observed in the study that female gender, young, and unmarried marital status are associated with higher scores. HCWs working in urban regions show more depressive symptoms. Mild depression and anxiety ratio are very common among participants (21.3%). Factors found to be associated with higher anxiety and depression are the increased number of deceased patients with lower family support. Altogether, the present study findings present concerns about the psychological well-being of all HCWs during the acute COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, steps should be taken to protect them from mental exhaustion, so they may fight with more zeal against the infectious pandemic that has caused significant impacts worldwide.","Ullah, Khan, Ali, Ullah, Mukhtar, de Filippis, Malik, Shalbafan, Hassan, Asghar","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2022.103863","20220531","Anxiety; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Depression; Health care workers (HCWs)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32475,""
"Hospital-treated intentional self-poisoning events and in-hospital mortality in Tehran before and during the COVID-19 pandemic","Hospital-treated intentional self-poisoning is common. The possibility of changed (increased) suicidal behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic has been raised. To compare frequencies in self-poisoning events (SPEs) and the proportions with in-hospital mortality, in the year prior to and following the official onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, in a population of hospital-treated self-poisoning patients in Iran. All self-poisoned patients admitted to Loghman-Hakim Hospital, a clinical toxicology specialty hospital in Tehran, were included. The frequency of SPEs was compared between the one-year periods immediately before and after the onset of COVID-19 pandemic using Poisson regression. Differences in proportions of in-hospital mortality were also compared using logistic regression. A total of 14,478 patients with 15,391 SPEs (8,863 [61.2%] females) were evaluated in the study. There was no difference in the overall frequency of SPEs (relative risk [RR] of 0.99 [CI95% 0.96-1.03]), but a small increase in males (RR 1.07; 1.02-1.13) and a minor decrease in females (RR 0.95; 0.91-0.99).

"Psychological Coping and Behavioral Adjustment Among Older Adults in Times of COVID-19: Exploring the Protective Role of Working Memory and Habit Propensity","The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, well-being, and behavior is likely influenced by individual characteristics that determine one's capacity for resilience. In this exploratory study, we examined whether individual differences in working memory (WM) capacity and habit propensity (HP), measured <i>before</i> the outbreak, could predict variation in subsequent psychological coping efficacy (as operationalized by measures of depression, mental well-being, perceived stress, and loneliness) and behavioral adjustment (by evaluating compliance and self-reported automaticity of four COVID-19 guidelines) among Dutch older adults (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°36) <i>during</i> the pandemic (measured April 25 to May 6, 2020). While we found elevated levels of depression and emotional loneliness, overall mental well-being, and perceived stress were not affected by the pandemic. Contrary to our expectations, we found no robust evidence for a protective role of WM in predicting these outcomes, although our findings hint at a positive relationship with perceived change in mental well-being. Interestingly, WM and HP were found to affect the self-reported automaticity levels of adherence to behavioral COVID-19 guidelines (i.e., washing hands, physical distancing), where a strong HP appeared beneficial when deliberate resources were less available (e.g., low WM capacity). These novel and preliminary findings offer new potential avenues for investigating individual differences in resilience in times of major life events or challenges.

"Online education and the mental health of faculty during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan","While the negative impact of the pandemic on students' mental health has been studied around the world, very little is known about the mental health of faculty and staff. This research aims to examine mental health among Japanese faculty members who taught online courses during the COVID-19 pandemic. We recruited 537 university faculty members and assessed their mental health using the World Health Organization-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5), both retrospectively (during the academic year before the onset of the pandemic) and during the pandemic. We also evaluated workload (number of online lectures taught and preparation time per class), difficulty in using information technology (IT) for online classes, and satisfaction with the university support service for online education. As a result, the WHO-5 score during the COVID-19 pandemic was significantly lower than before, and 33.5% of the faculty members were recognized as being at risk for mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic. A binomial logistic regression analysis revealed two significant risk factors for mental illness-faculty members were more at risk for mental illness when they experienced difficulty in using IT for online classes, and were unsatisfied with the administrative support for online education. The deterioration of mental health during the COVID-19 was not predicted by workload, such as the number of online lectures and preparation time. These results suggest the importance of improving workplace support services, especially IT support, to prevent mental health deterioration among faculty teaching online.","Kita, Yasuda, Gherghel","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-12841-x","20220602","COVID-19; Education, Distance; Faculty; Humans; Japan; Mental Health; Pandemics; Retrospective Studies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32479,""

Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the level of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and its associated factors in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A community-based concurrent mixed-method study. In a community setting. Adult residents (n=422) of Akaki Kality subcity who were recruited by a two stage sampling technique and 24 adults who were selected purposively were included for the quantitative and qualitative part of the study respectively. Data were collected by face-to-face interview using a semistructured questionnaire. Factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy were identified by multivariable binary logistic regression model. One out five (19.1%, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 15.3% to 24.6%) participants were not willing to get vaccinated. In the multivariable analysis, vaccine hesitancy was significantly associated with being female (aOR=1.97; 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.10 to 3.89), having negative attitude towards COVID-19 and its preventive measures (aOR=1.75; 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.08 to 3.02), and primary information source being social media (internet) (aOR=3.59; 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.75 to 7.37). Study participants have predominantly stated that they did not have enough information about the vaccine, feared it would not be effective or have too many side effects, and reflected their uncertainty towards the quality of the vaccine. A considerable proportion of the people in Addis Ababa have concerns on COVID-19 vaccines and unwilling to accept them. This was due to the misconceptions, negative attitudes and use of social media as their primary source of information. Providing the community with health education and consistent efforts to enhance the prevention measures are important, particularly using different medias including social media.","Dereje, Tesfaye, Tamene, Alemeshet, Abe, Tesfa, Gedion, Biruk, Lakew","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-052432","20220602","COVID-19; Hesitancy; Vaccine; attitude; knowledge; Adult; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Cross-Sectional Studies; Ethiopia; Female; Humans; Male; Vaccination Hesitancy; Vaccines","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32481,""
"The daily use of a training using a mobile app as a coping tool against COVID-19 distress: A crossover randomized controlled trial","The COVID-19 pandemic has been suggested to constitute a broad base stressor with severe mental health consequences. mHealth applications are accessible self-help tools that can be used to reduce psychological distress during the pandemic. This randomized controlled trial evaluated the effects of mobile-based cognitive training exercises on COVID-19 related distress and maladaptive cognitions. Following initial screening (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯924), participants scoring 1 standard deviations above the mean of the COVID-19 Distress Scale were randomized into two groups. Participants in the immediate-app group (iApp; nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯25) started using the application at baseline (T0) for 12Ã¢â‚¬Â¯days (from T0 to T1). Participants in the delayed-app group (dApp; nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯22) started using the mobile application at T1 (crossover) and used it for the following 12Ã¢â‚¬Â¯days (T1 to T2). Intention to treat analyses indicated that the iApp group exhibited lower COVID-19 distress, lower depression, fewer intolerance of uncertainty and obsessive beliefs than the dApp group at T1. In addition, using the app for 12 consecutive days was associated with large effect-size reductions (Cohen's d ranging from 0.81 to 2.35) in COVID-19 distress and related maladaptive cognitions in the iApp group (from T0 to T1) and the dApp group (from T1 to T2). Moreover, these reductions were maintained at the follow-up. This study was a crossover trial with a relatively limited sample size and mainly female participants.

Unchanged DEB symptoms suggest that the COVID-19 restrictions did not significantly affect participants' eating behaviors and that a general adaptation to the challenges of lockdown and other pandemic containment measures occurred in both T1D and control participants.","Troncone, Chianese, Cascella, Zanfardino, Piscopo, Rollato, Iafusco","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10880-022-09884-7","20220531","Adolescents; COVID-19 pandemic; Children; Disordered eating behaviors; Type 1 diabetes","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32488,""
"A Longitudinal Cohort Study of Youth Mental Health and Substance use Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Ontario, Canada: An Exploratory Analysis","Youth mental health appears to have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact on substance use is less clear, as is the impact on subgroups of youth, including those with pre-existing mental health or substance use challenges. This hypothesis-generating study examines the longitudinal evolution of youth mental health and substance use from before the COVID-19 pandemic to over one year into the pandemic among youth with pre-existing mental health or substance use challenges. A total of 168 youth aged 14-24 participated. Participants provided sociodemographic data, as well as internalizing disorder, externalizing disorder, and substance use data prior to the pandemic's onset, then every two months between April 2020-2021. Linear mixed models and Generalized Estimating Equations were used to analyze the effect of time on mental health and substance use. Exploratory analyses were conducted to examine interactions with sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. There was no change in internalizing or externalizing disorder scores from prior to the pandemic to any point throughout the first year of the pandemic. Substance use scores during the pandemic declined compared to pre-pandemic scores. Exploratory analyses suggest that students appear to have experienced more mental health repercussions than non-students; other sociodemographic and clinical characteristics did not appear to be associated with mental health or substance use trajectories. While mental health remained stable and substance use declined from before the COVID-19 pandemic to during the pandemic among youth with pre-existing mental health challenges, some youth experienced greater challenges than others. Longitudinal monitoring among various population subgroups is crucial to identifying higher risk populations. This information is needed to provide empirical evidence to inform future research directions.","Sheikhan, Hawke, Ma, Courtney, Szatmari, Cleverley, Voineskos, Cheung, Henderson","https://doi.org/10.1177/07067437221097906","20220531","COVID-19; adolescence; longitudinal study; mental disorders; mental health; students; substance use disorders; young adults; youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32489,""

Using technology, in particular video technology, has increased, especially in primary care. This article considers the implications of technology for assessments under the Mental Health Act 1983. NHS Covid-19 guidance anticipated its use in assessments, but this was held to be unlawful. Is this the right decision or is it too restrictive an interpretation of the 1983 Act? The article argues that consideration should be given to the potential role, if any, of video technology in assessments and identifies some issues that need to be addressed.

"Burnout and psychological symptoms in healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: Comparisons of different medical professions in a regional hospital in Turkey","Early studies have revealed the psychological effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on healthcare workers (HCWs). Burnout and psychological outcomes of different medical professions during the pandemic have not yet been addressed. The study aimed to investigate the burnout, depression, anxiety, and psychological distress levels of HCWs, and to determine the predictive factors of burnout in different professions of frontline HCWs during the pandemic. This cross-sectional study included 253 HCWs (79 physicians, 95 nurses, and 79 other-HCWs). The Maslach Burnout Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Impact of Event Scale-Revised, and Sociodemographic Form were used. Emotional exhaustion was significantly higher in physicians and nurses than in other frontline HCWs. While depersonalization was significantly higher in physicians than nurses / other HCWs, levels of avoidance, hyperarousal and intrusion were found to be higher in other HCWs / nurses than physicians. Depression was the most effective predicting variable for burnout, following age, quarantine, supervisor's/team leader's attitude, hyperarousal and avoidance. It has been observed that depending on the uncertainty and life risk of the pandemic in HCWs involved in the treatment of COVID-19, physicians who are the decision-making authorities in the treatment process used more depersonalization than nurses and other HCWs. Nurses and other-HCWs had significantly higher distress symptoms than physicians. Both future research and psychosocial services should address those with high depressive symptoms as a potentially fragile subgroup for burnout among HCWs, and investigate and develop evidence-based interventions that can provide mental well-being, and prevent burnout.","Sagaltici, Saydam, Cetinkaya, Ã…Å¾ahin, KÃƒÂ¼ÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ¼k, MÃƒÂ¼slÃƒÂ¼manoÃ„Å¸lu","https://doi.org/10.3233/WOR-210517","20220531","COVID-19; anxiety; depersonalization; depression; distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32492,""
"Moral injury, depression, and anxiety symptoms among health and social care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: The moderating role of belongingness","The COVID-19 pandemic can affect health and social care workers' (HSCWs') mental health in their role as frontline workers in this crisis. The pandemic poses unique challenges to HSCWs as they face morally daunting decisions while working with limited knowledge and resources. This study primary objective was to examine the moderating role of thwarted belongingness in the relationships between HSCWs' exposure to potentially morally injurious events (PMIEs) and moral injury symptoms, depression, and anxiety. A sample of 296 Israeli HSCWs completed validated self-report questionnaires that include measures of depression, anxiety, PMIE exposure, moral injury symptoms, and a sense of thwarted belongingness. About one-third (33.6%) of the sample met the criteria for major depression and 21.5% for generalized anxiety. Beyond demographic and work-related characteristics, PMIEs contributed to depression and anxiety levels. The indirect effect of PMIE exposure on anxiety/depression symptoms through MI symptoms was significant only at high levels of thwarted belongingness among HSCWs. Thus, greater PMIE exposure contributes to more MI symptoms, which, in turn, is linked to higher levels of anxiety/depression symptoms among HSCWs with high levels of thwarted belongingness. Cross-sectional design, self-report questionnaires, sample limited to Israeli HSCWs. The study's findings highlight the mental burden of HSCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic and the critical contribution of PMIE exposure and thwarted belongingness to this burden. Clinicians treating HSCWs coping with depression and anxiety following the COVID-19 should also attend to moral injury symptoms as well to the belongingness experience.","Benatov, Zerach, Levi-Belz","https://doi.org/10.1177/00207640221099421","20220531","COVID-19; anxiety; belongingness; depression; health and social care workers; moral injury","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32493,""
"Monitoring the Emotional Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic Using Sentiment Analysis: A Case Study in Mexico","The world is facing the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to an unprecedented change in the lifestyle routines of millions. Beyond the general physical health, financial, and social repercussions of the pandemic, the adopted mitigation measures also present significant challenges in the population's mental health and health programs. It is complex for public organizations to measure the population's mental health in order to incorporate it into their own decision-making process. Traditional survey methods are time-consuming, expensive, and fail to provide the continuous information needed to respond to the rapidly evolving effects of governmental policies on the population's mental health. A significant portion of the population has turned to social media to express the details of their daily life, rendering this public data a rich field for understanding emotional and mental well-being. This study aims to track and measure the sentiment changes of the Mexican population in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. To this end, we analyzed 760,064,879 public domain tweets collected from a public access repository to examine the collective shifts in the general mood about the pandemic evolution, news cycles, and governmental policies using open sentiment analysis tools. Sentiment analysis polarity scores, which oscillate around -0.15, show a weekly seasonality according to Twitter's usage and a consistently negative outlook from the population. It also remarks on the increased controversy after the governmental decision to terminate the lockdown and the celebrated holidays, which encouraged the people to incur social gatherings. These findings expose the adverse emotional effects of the ongoing pandemic while showing an increase in social media usage rates of 2.38 times, which users employ as a coping mechanism to mitigate the feelings of isolation related to long-term social distancing. The findings have important implications in the mental health infrastructure for ongoing mitigation efforts and feedback on the perception of policies and other measures. The overall trend of the sentiment polarity is 0.0001110643.","LeÃƒÂ³n-Sandoval, Zareei, Barbosa-SantillÃƒÂ¡n, FalcÃƒÂ³n Morales, Pareja Lora, Ochoa Ruiz","https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/4914665","20220602","Attitude; COVID-19; Communicable Disease Control; Emotions; Humans; Mexico; Pandemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32494,""
"Inpatient violence in a psychiatric hospital in the middle of the pandemic: clinical and community health aspects","Healthcare workers are at a high risk of violence all over the world. The hostility toward nurses, physicians, and hospital staff has reached the point that it can be considered a public health problem. In this paper, we focus on the harassment, aggression, and violence that many healthcare workers have encountered while treating unstable psychiatric patients in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. We present a case with a history of violence toward mental health workers, review psychopathological and clinical aspects, and discuss how both the COVID-19 pandemic and current challenges in psychiatric hospital settings increase the frequency and severity of these attacks and how this affects the team on inpatient psychiatric units. We used the CARE guidelines to provide the most accurate and transparent information about the patient and relevant psychosocial aspects. We also pooled more than 20 unique sources to cover all aspects of violent behaviors in all psychiatric settings for all age groups. We concluded that a lack of nursing staff, the mental burden imposed by difficult patients, and poor communication between team members are some of the factors contributing to patient violence. An incomplete understanding of the problem creates barriers to change on both personal and systematic levels. Constant violence and abuse against healthcare workers cause stress, decreased productivity, and work dissatisfaction. To improve the safety of healthcare professionals, especially in inpatient psychiatric settings, several system-based changes should be implemented.","Bellman, Thai, Chinthalapally, Russell, Saleem","https://doi.org/10.3934/publichealth.2022024","20220601","aggression; involuntary hospitalization; pandemic; psychosis; treatment; violence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32495,""

"A Feasibility Study of a Remotely-Delivered Mindfulness-Based Training for Adolescents During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Social distancing, home confinement, economic challenges, and COVID-19-related illness and deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic can significantly affect mental health in youth. One promising approach to reduce anxiety and depression in adolescents is the neuroscience-based mindfulness intervention Training for Awareness, Resilience, and Action (TARA). The objective of this individually randomized waitlist-controlled trial (RCT) was (1) to test the feasibility of TARA, delivered partially over Zoom, and (2) to assess changes in the emotional wellbeing in healthy adolescents between the ages of 14-18 years old during the COVID-19 pandemic. Twenty-one healthy adolescents were randomized to the TARA intervention or to the waitlist control group in February 2020, just before the start of the pandemic. The TARA group intervention was delivered in person for the first five sessions and remotely over Zoom for the remaining seven sessions due to the pandemic. The participants' acceptability of TARA was assessed weekly using the Child Session Rating Scale (CSRS). The primary outcome was the emotional wellbeing measured using emotional symptoms subscale of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) pre/post-TARA. We also explored weekly changes in TARA participants' wellbeing using the Child Outcome Rating Scale (CORS). The overall session rating in TARA participants improved after the switch to Zoom (Cohen's d = 1.2, <i>p</i> = 0.008). The results of the two-way ANOVA showed no statistically significant difference in the change of the SDQ emotional symptoms during the 12 weeks between the TARA group and waitlist-control group (timepoint Ãƒâ€” group interaction: <i>F</i> = 0.77, <i>p</i> = 0.38). The exploratory analysis using the CORS in the TARA participants showed a significant improvement in their functioning over the weeks of training. Our results support the feasibility of TARA delivered over Zoom. While our primary outcome did not provide support for the improvement of the emotional wellbeing with TARA compared to a passive control group, our exploratory analysis in the intervention group indicated an improved functioning over the weeks of TARA training. The important general positive impact of this study lies in the possibility of offering a neuroscience-based mindfulness intervention remotely to youth living in remote areas and for all youth during pandemic times.","Tymofiyeva, Hu, Sipes, Jakary, Glidden, Jariwala, Bhandari, Parks, Nguyen, Henje, Yang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.838694","20220601","adolescent; mental health; mindfulness; remote; tele-behavioral health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32498,""

A cross-sectional study with a mixed-methods sequential explanatory design was conducted in two phases. First, an online survey was conducted among higher education students in Portugal and Switzerland, in Portuguese and French respectively. A convenience sampling method was used. Second, some participants from the first phase were invited to participate in four online focus group discussions (two in each country) using a maximum variation sampling method. The survey was answered by 1,880 students. Portuguese students revealed higher levels of stress and anxiety, but lower depression symptoms and less resilient coping compared to Swiss respondents. Hope was identified as an explanatory variable for mental health symptoms in students from both countries.

"Suicidal Behavior in Emergency Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Service Users Before and During the 16 Months of the COVID-19 Pandemic","Slovenia is among the countries with the highest suicide rates in the world. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the mental health of children and adolescents. Our hypothesis is that the school closure during the pandemic with a gradual transfer to virtual schooling had an important impact on children's and adolescents' suicidal behavior. Therefore, we aimed to determine possible changes in the frequency of assessments as well as frequency and severity of suicidal behavior in the population of Slovene children and adolescents seeking emergency psychiatric help in correlation with the progression of the pandemic and online schooling. We performed a retrospective observational analysis of medical records of all children and adolescents referred to the only 24-h emergency in- and outpatient child and adolescent psychiatry service in Slovenia from March 2019 through the end of July 2021. We extracted number of assessments, number of patients with suicidal ideation and with attempted suicide. A comparison between the same periods prior to the pandemic and during the pandemic was made. The months of school closure due to the COVID-19 restriction measures and the months without closures were also compared. During this period, 1966 children and adolescents were assessed. There was no statistically significant difference in the observed frequency of emergency visits when we compared all the months with to all the months without school closures, or when individual corresponding months with and without school closures were compared. However, there were statistically significantly more patients with suicidal ideation [<i>t</i>(16) = -2.739, <i>p</i> = 0.015; W = 25.0, <i>p</i> = 0.016] and patients who had attempted suicide [<i>t</i>(16)= -3.412, <i>p</i>= 0.004; W = 14.5, <i>p</i> =0.006] during the pandemic as individually compared to the corresponding pre-pandemic months. Our results show that the number of Slovene children and adolescents who required emergency psychiatric help with suicidality and attempted suicide increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase was shown only after the first year of the pandemic. The observed increase did not appear to directly correspond to the school closures, but was more likely related to the duration of the pandemic.","KiriÃ„Â, Leben Novak, LuÃ…Â¡icky, DrobniÃ„Â Radobuljac","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.893040","20220601","COVID-19; attempted suicide; child and adolescent; emergency psychiatric service; pandemic (COVID-19); suicidal thoughts and behavior (STB)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32501,""
"Mental Health, Burnout, and Job Stressors Among Healthcare Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Iran: A Cross-Sectional Survey","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused increasing levels of mental health problems such as anxiety and depression among doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers in hospitals or health centers. The main objective of this study was to assess the mental health, job stressors, and burnout among healthcare workers in Iran. A cross-sectional study was performed in the primary healthcare centers and hospitals affiliated with six of the medical universities in Iran. The selection of participants was done using multi-center convenient sampling. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and Copenhagen Burnout Inventory were used for gathering data through an online platform. Data related to job stressors were obtained using a validated checklist. Data analysis was performed using Chi-square and multiple regression tests and the phi coefficient. The results of our study showed that 53% of the healthcare workers of the hospitals and primary healthcare centers enrolled in our study either had generalized anxiety disorder or major depressive disorder or both disorders. Moderate and high levels of burnout were seen among 48.9% of the study participants. The prevalence of mental disorders and burnout were significantly higher among the female healthcare workers compared to the male (<i>p</i> = 0.0001) and a higher rate of mental disorder and burnout was also seen among healthcare workers of hospitals compared to those working in primary healthcare centers (<i>p</i> = 0.024). ""Worry about children and old members of family,"" ""family worries for my health condition"" and ""lack of specific effective treatment for COVID-19"" were found to be predictive of mental disorder and burnout.

"Depression and Suicidality in a COVID-19 Patient: A Case Report from Calabar, Nigeria","The coronavirus pandemic is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. While physical recovery has been made a priority, the psychological wellbeing of recovered patients is not receiving the attention it deserves. We present the case of a 27-year-old male who developed severe depression associated with anxiety and suicidal ideations two weeks after full recovery from COVID- 19 infection. Significant somatization was also present at the onset which he misattributed to a recurrence of the infection. He was admitted for in-patient psychiatric care and fully recovered after six weeks of medication and psychotherapy. Infection with the virus is a psychologically distressing experience that can trigger mental disorders in vulnerable individuals. Our report highlights the mental health needs of all COVID-19 patients and the need for psychological evaluation in the post-recovery period.

"The Factors Associated With Nonuse of Social Media or Video Communications to Connect With Friends and Family During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Older Adults: Web-Based Survey Study","Digital technologies have enabled social connection during prolonged periods of physical distancing and travel restrictions throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. These solutions may exclude older adults, who are at higher risk for social isolation, loneliness, and severe outcomes if infected with SARS-CoV-2. This study investigated factors associated with nonuse of social media or video communications to connect with friends and family among older adults during the pandemic's first wave. A web-based, cross-sectional survey was administered to members of a national retired educators' organization based in Ontario, Canada, between May 6 and 19, 2020. Respondents (N=4879) were asked about their use of social networking websites or apps to communicate with friends and family, their internet connection and smartphone access, loneliness, and sociodemographic characteristics. Factors associated with nonuse were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression. A thematic analysis was performed on open-ended survey responses that described experiences with technology and virtual connection. Overall, 15.4% (751/4868) of respondents did not use social networking websites or apps. After adjustment, male gender (odds ratio [OR] 1.60, 95% CI 1.33-1.92), advanced age (OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.38-2.55), living alone (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.39-2.02), poorer health (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.04-1.71), and lower social support (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.20-1.71) increased the odds of nonuse. The reliability of internet connection and access to a smartphone also predicted nonuse. Many respondents viewed these technologies as beneficial, especially for maintaining pre-COVID-19 social contacts and routines, despite preferences for in-person connection. Several factors including advanced age, living alone, and low social support increased the odds of nonuse of social media in older adults to communicate with friends and family during COVID-19's first wave. Our findings identified socially vulnerable subgroups who may benefit from intervention (eg, improved access, digital literacy, and telephone outreach) to improve social connection.","Savage, Di Nicolo, Wu, Li, Lawson, Grieve, Goel, Rochon","https://doi.org/10.2196/34793","20220607","COVID-19; age; communication; connect; connection; digital technology; elderly; factor; family; friend; loneliness; lonely; mental health; older adults; social media; support; usage; video","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32507,""
"Private equity and Covid-19","We survey more than 200 private equity (PE) managers from firms with $1.9 trillion of assets under management (AUM) about their portfolio performance, decision-making and activities during the Covid-19 pandemic. Given that PE managers have significant incentives to maximize value, their actions during the pandemic should indicate what they perceive as being important for both the preservation and creation of value. PE managers believe that 40% of their portfolio companies are moderately negatively affected and 10% are very negatively affected by the pandemic. The private equity managersâ€”both investment and operating partnersâ€”are actively engaged in the operations, governance, and financing in all of their current portfolio companies. These activities are more intensively pursued in those companies that have been more severely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result of the pandemic, they expect the performance of their existing funds to decline. They are more pessimistic about that decline than the venture capitalists (VCs) surveyed in Gompers etÂ al. (2021). Despite the pandemic, private equity managers are seeking new investments. Rather than focusing on cost cutting, PE investors place a much greater weight on revenue growth for value creation. Relative to the 2012 survey results reported in Gompers, Kaplan, and Mukharlyamov (2016), they appear to give a larger equity stake to management teams and target somewhat lower returns.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfi.2022.100968","20220701","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32508,""

"Psychiatric emergencies and 15â€“25 years old during the first year of the health crisis: A descriptive epidemiological study in the largest French psychiatric emergency center","Depuis le 16Â mars 2020, date de lâ€™annonce du premier confinement en France dans le contexte de pandÃ©mie liÃ©e Ã  la COVID-19Â et de crise sanitaire, les FranÃ§ais ont connu un bouleversement brutal et durable de leurs rythmes et habitudes. La crise sanitaire a eu un impact fort sur la population gÃ©nÃ©rale et sur les patients souffrant de troubles psychiatriques. La demande de prise en charge en santÃ© mentale est particuliÃ¨rement accrue chez les jeunes, qui semblent les plus impactÃ©s par cette crise. Dans la premiÃ¨re partie de cet article, nous dÃ©crirons lâ€™impact de la crise sanitaire sur la santÃ© mentale des jeunes et sur la frÃ©quentation des urgences psychiatriques, avec une revue exhaustive de la littÃ©rature franÃ§aise et internationale. La littÃ©rature traitant de la santÃ© mentale des enfants et des jeunes durant la crise sanitaire est vaste et rÃ©guliÃ¨rement actualisÃ©e.

En conclusion, nous Ã©voquerons les mesures et adaptations du systÃ¨me de soins franÃ§ais mises en place pour prendre en charge les besoins accrus en santÃ© mentale de cette population spÃ©cifique des 15â€“25Â ans, particuliÃ¨rement malmenÃ©e par la crise sanitaire, vÃ©ritable enjeu national de santÃ© publique. Introduction Since March 16, 2020, the date of the announcement of the first confinement in France in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and health crisis, French residents have experienced a brutal and lasting disruption in their rhythms and habits. The health crisis has had a strong impact on the general population and especially on patients suffering from psychiatric disorders. The demand for mental health care has particularly heightened among young people, who seem to be the most affected by this crisis. In the first part of this article, we will describe the impact of the health crisis on the mental health of young people and on the attendance of psychiatric emergencies, with a review of French and international literature. In the second part, we will present a descriptive epidemiological study carried out in the largest French psychiatric emergency center. Methods and objective Our sample included 9,771 young patients from 15 to 25 years old. The main objective of our study is to highlight the changes in the flow of consultations of patients aged 15 to 25 years during the first year of the health crisis, compared to the three previous years. We calculated and compared the proportion of the target population consulting between the period of the first year of the health crisis (COVID period) and the period encompassing the previous three years (pre-COVID period). We also compared different variables,Â between the 2,179 young people consulting during the first year of COVID-19 health crisis and the 7,592 young people during the three last years: age, sex, marital status, symptoms, environmental context and CIM-10 diagnoses. Results We observed a significant increase in the proportion of patients aged 15 to 25 during the COVID period (n =29.4% vs. 27.6%; P <0,001). The patients during the COVID period were predominantly female. We have seen a significant increase in patients coming for consultations for anxiety (+4.3%; P <0.001), sleep disorders (+2.8%; P <0.001) and suicidal thoughts (+2.7%; P =0.006) during the COVID period. During the first year of the health crisis, the target population consulted less for claustration, withdrawal or odd behavior. Family conflicts, traumatic events and other life events were more frequent. Schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders were less frequently diagnosed. Conclusion The health crisis has had a considerable impact on the mental health of the youth population. The mental health of young people is a current subject of concern and a major public health issue. Data from the literature warns of the impact of the health crisis on the mental health of this population and the need for early treatment, even as the supply of psychiatric care is decreasing.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2022.04.011","20220101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32514,""

"Reporting and representation of racial and ethnic diversity in randomized controlled trials of internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (iCBT) for depression","There is a growing interest in developing scalable interventions, including internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (iCBT), to meet the increasing demand for mental health services. Given the growth in diversity worldwide, it is essential that the clinical trials of iCBT for depression include diverse samples or, at the very least report information of the racial-ethnic composition of their samples. The field currently lacks data on how racial and ethnic diversity are represented in the iCBT literature. We conducted a systematic review to examine the overall reporting of racial and ethnic minorities in published clinical trials of iCBT for depression. We also reviewed the representation of specific racial and ethnic minority groups. We used a database of randomized controlled trials, focusing on iCBT studies. A total of 59 iCBT RCTs 16,411 participants are summarized in this study. Only 29% of the trial reported race, and only 19% reported ethnicity. Of those that reported race, 88% were conducted in the United States, while reporting outside of the United States was very poor. Within and without the United States, the most reported race was White (75%), followed by Black (8%), and Asian (6%). Furthermore, when translating this to individual participants, 12,863 (76.84%) participants had no reported race and 15,960 (97%) had no reported ethnicity. These findings suggest that reporting on race-ethnicity is very poor outside the United States. While studies in the U.S. report on racial-ethnic representation, the representation itself is quite poor.","Robinson De JesÃºs-Romero et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E016E-580-E43","20220608","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Psychotherapy; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Meta-science; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Mental Disorders; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; race; depression; randomized controlled trials; internet-based cbt; diversity","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32517,""
"Does contracting COVID-19 lead to subsequent poorer mental health and greater loneliness? Findings from the UK COVID-19 Mental Health & Wellbeing study","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with psychological distress. In addition to physical effects including fatigue and cognitive impairment, contracting COVID-19 itself may also be related to subsequent negative mental health outcomes. The present study reports data from a longitudinal, national survey of the UK adult population, investigating whether contracting suspected or confirmed COVID-19 at the early stages of the pandemic (March-May 2020) was associated with poorer mental health outcomes at 1 month (wave 4), 5-month (wave 6) and 13-month (wave 8) follow up. Method A quota survey design and a sampling frame that permitted recruitment of a national sample (n=3077) were utilised. Experience of contracting COVID-19 during the first UK lockdown was assessed along with levels of depression, anxiety, mental wellbeing and loneliness. Results Around 9% of participants reported contracting COVID-19 at waves 1-3, with just under 13% of the overall sample reporting COVID-19 at any one of the first three time points. The results showed that reporting COVID-19 was associated with subsequent poorer mental health outcomes with these effects lasting up to 13 months (wave 8). Conclusions The present study demonstrates that contracting COVID-19 at an early stage of the pandemic can have long-lasting, negative impacts on mental health.","Sarah Wilding et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0039-F48-EBD","20220607","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32518,""
"Temporal disorientation and the Covid-19 crisis: present episodic confusion, past-oriented sustained disbelief, and future-oriented anxiety are the three main ways in which people were temporally disoriented during the pandemic","People facing spatial and social restrictions during the Covid-19 period could report various surprising temporal disruptions, such as time passing slower and faster at once. We investigate the temporal experience of the pandemic through a corpus-based thematic analysis and multiple correspondence analysis of 149 subjective reports in March 2021, during a period of long lasting and ongoing restrictions in France and the UK. We argue that three forms of temporal disorientation constitute a fitting umbrella over a heterogeneous phenomenology. The loss of temporal landmarks made it harder to orient oneself and induced episodic forms of temporal disorientation. Distinctively, sustained temporal disbelief, an existential form of temporal disorientation, could happen when peopleâ€™s past perspective was severely distorted. Finally, a future-oriented form of temporal disorientation whose hallmarks were feelings of anxiety and hopelessness could occur alongside inabilities to project oneself into the future. Our findings suggest that public authorities should provide future landmarks to those most exposed to temporal disorientation during crises.","Bastien Perroy et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0119-D39-9C6","20220601","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Consciousness; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Perception; mental time travel; temporality; disorientation; time perception; metacognition; phenomenology; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-08","",32519,""
