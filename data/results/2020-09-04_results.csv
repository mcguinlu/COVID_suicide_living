"Ultra-low-dose chest CT imaging of COVID-19 patients using a deep residual neural network","The current study aimed to design an ultra-low-dose CT examination protocol using a deep learning approach suitable for clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. In this study, 800, 170, and 171 pairs of ultra-low-dose and full-dose CT images were used as input/output as training, test, and external validation set, respectively, to implement the full-dose prediction technique. A residual convolutional neural network was applied to generate full-dose from ultra-low-dose CT images. The quality of predicted CT images was assessed using root mean square error (RMSE), structural similarity index (SSIM), and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Scores ranging from 1 to 5 were assigned reflecting subjective assessment of image quality and related COVID-19 features, including ground glass opacities (GGO), crazy paving (CP), consolidation (CS), nodular infiltrates (NI), bronchovascular thickening (BVT), and pleural effusion (PE). The radiation dose in terms of CT dose index (CTDI<sub>vol</sub>) was reduced by up to 89%. The RMSE decreased from 0.16 Ã‚Â± 0.05 to 0.09 Ã‚Â± 0.02 and from 0.16 Ã‚Â± 0.06 to 0.08 Ã‚Â± 0.02 for the predicted compared with ultra-low-dose CT images in the test and external validation set, respectively. The overall scoring assigned by radiologists showed an acceptance rate of 4.72 Ã‚Â± 0.57 out of 5 for reference full-dose CT images, while ultra-low-dose CT images rated 2.78 Ã‚Â± 0.9. The predicted CT images using the deep learning algorithm achieved a score of 4.42 Ã‚Â± 0.8. The results demonstrated that the deep learning algorithm is capable of predicting standard full-dose CT images with acceptable quality for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 positive patients with substantial radiation dose reduction. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Ultra-low-dose CT imaging of COVID-19 patients would result in the loss of critical information about lesion types, which could potentially affect clinical diagnosis. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Deep learning-based prediction of full-dose from ultra-low-dose CT images for the diagnosis of COVID-19 could reduce the radiation dose by up to 89%. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Deep learning algorithms failed to recover the correct lesion structure/density for a number of patients considered outliers, and as such, further research and development is warranted to address these limitations.","Shiri, Akhavanallaf, Sanaat, Salimi, Askari, Mansouri, Shayesteh, Hasanian, Rezaei-Kalantari, Salahshour, Sandoughdaran, Abdollahi, Arabi, Zaidi","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-020-07225-6","20200903","Artificial intelligence; COVID-19; Deep learning; Tomography X-ray computed","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-04","",4387,""
"The COVID-19 pandemic: how to maintain a healthy immune system during the lockdown - a multidisciplinary approach with special focus on athletes","On January 31, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus responsible for an infection termed COVID-19 as a global public health emergency. To slow the spread of the coronavirus, countries around the world have been implementing various measures, including school and institutional closures, lockdown and targeted quarantine for suspected infected individuals. More than a third of the world's population have been home confined less than 4 months after the start of the outbreak. The present article aims to advise healthy individuals and athletes who are in lockdown regarding their lifestyle in order to keep healthy, safe and fit. The advice contained in the present article could apply to anyone aiming at remaining in good physical and mental health while forced to undergo lockdown, quarantine, or limited movement (movement control order). Boosting the immune system is crucial during such periods for confined people and especially for confined athletes. Specific recommendations must be followed concerning boosting the immune system through physiological and psychological management. This article analyses the available scientific evidence in order to recommend a practical approach, focusing on nutrition, intermittent fasting or caloric restriction, vitamin D insufficiency, sleep pattern, exercise, and psychodynamic aspects as factors impacting the immune system and human health in general.","Yousfi, Bragazzi, Briki, Zmijewski, Chamari","https://doi.org/10.5114/biolsport.2020.95125","20200903","SARS-CoV-2; adequate sleep; mental disorders; physical distance; self-isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-04","",4388,""
"Mental health status of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 in Changsha","The epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) brought psychological stress to the public, especially to patients. This study aims to investigate the mental health of patients with COVID-19 in Changsha. We took cross-section investigation for the mental health of 112 patients with COVID-19 via questionnaires. Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test, Chi-square test, and Fisher's exact test were performed to compare general and clinical data between the slight-ordinary patients and severe patients. Single sample <i>t</i>-tests were used to compare the difference between the factor scores of the Symptom Check-List 90 (SCL-90) in COVID-19 patients with the norm of 2015 and factor scores of SCL-90 in patients with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The obsessive-compulsive, depression, sleep and eating disorders had the highest frequency among the positive symptoms of SCL-90 in patients with COVID-19 in Changsha. The factor scores of somatization, depression, anxiety, phobia anxiety, sleep and eating disorders in patients with COVID-19 were higher than those of the norm (<i>P</i>Ã¢â€°Â¤0.001 or <i>P</i>&lt;0.05). Slight-ordinary patients with COVID-19 in Changsha showed lower factor scores of somatization, depression, anxiety, and hostility compared with the patients with SARS (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001 or <i>P</i>&lt;0.05). There was no difference in factor scores of SCL-90 between the patients with severe COVID-19 and those with SARS(<i>P</i>&gt;0.05).

"Mental health status of medical staff in the epidemic period of coronavirus disease 2019","To explore the psychological status of medical staff in the epidemic period of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and to analyze its influential factors. A total of 373 medical staff from Xiangya Hospital and the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University were enrolled for this study. The General Sociological Data Questionnaire, Symptom Check-List 90 (SCL-90), and self-designed public opinion response questionnaire were used to assess general sociological data, mental health scores, and ability to respond to COVID-19 related public opinion information of medical staff. The mental health scores of medical staff with different general sociological data and public opinion information coping abilities were compared. Influential factors of mental health were analyzed. The average score of 10 factors in SCL-90 of 373 medical staff was less than 2 points. 14.21% medical staff had one or more factor scores more than two points, including 11.26% with terror symptoms, 7.77% with compulsive symptoms, and 5.63% with anxiety. The main sources of COVID-19 information for medical staff included WeChat, microblog, Jinri toutiao, TV and radio. 66.22% medical staff regularly verified information about COVID-19 through official websites or formal channels. A great deal of COVID-19 information in WeChat could make medical staff nervous (34.05%), anxious (30.29%), and insecure (29.22%). 68.63% medical staff sometimes were worried about getting infected because they knew information about COVID-19. Different departments of medical staff, getting cough or having a fever recently, and the degree of fear of infection had an impact on the SCL-90 score of medical staff, the differences were all statistically significant (all <i>P</i>&lt;0.05). Stepwise regression analysis showed that the impact of COVID-19 information on their life in WeChat, getting cough or having a fever recently, insomnia-early caused by COVID-19 information in WeChat, different departments, and the degree of fear of infection COVID-19 were the influential factors for the mental health of medical staff (all <i>P</i>&lt;0.05). During the epidemic of COVID-19, medical staff suffered from psychological problems to various degrees. It is necessary to establish a psychological assistance platform and guide the direction of public opinion correctly to promote the mental health of medical staff. <b>Ã§â€ºÂ®Ã§Å¡â€ž</b>: Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¤Â¼Â°Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¥Å“Â¨2019Ã¥â€ Â Ã§Å Â¶Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦Â¯â€™Ã§â€”â€¦(coronavirus disease 2019Ã¯Â¼Å’COVID-19)Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã§Å Â¶Ã¥â€ ÂµÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ¥â€¦Â¶Ã¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â³â€¢</b>: Ã©â‚¬â€°Ã¥Ââ€“Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¥Ââ€”Ã¥Â¤Â§Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã¦Â¹ËœÃ©â€ºâ€¦Ã¥Å’Â»Ã©â„¢Â¢Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¦Â¹ËœÃ©â€ºâ€¦Ã¤ÂºÅ’Ã¥Å’Â»Ã©â„¢Â¢373Ã¥ÂÂÃ¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¤Â½Å“Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¨Â±Â¡Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã¥Ë†Â«Ã©â€¡â€¡Ã§â€Â¨Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¨Ë†Â¬Ã§Â¤Â¾Ã¤Â¼Å¡Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã¨Âµâ€žÃ¦â€“â„¢Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¡Â¨Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã¨â€¡ÂªÃ¨Â¯â€žÃ©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¡Â¨(Symptom Check-List 90Ã¯Â¼Å’SCL-90)Ã¥ÂÅ Ã¨â€¡ÂªÃ¥Ë†Â¶Ã¨Ë†â€ Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã©â€”Â®Ã¥ÂÂ·Ã¦â€Â¶Ã©â€ºâ€ Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¨Ë†Â¬Ã§Â¤Â¾Ã¤Â¼Å¡Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã¨Âµâ€žÃ¦â€“â„¢Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã¥Â¾â€”Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¥â€ ÂµÃ¥â€™Å’Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¥Â¯Â¹COVID-19Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¨Ë†â€ Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¤Â¿Â¡Ã¦ÂÂ¯Ã¨Æ’Â½Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¦Æ’â€¦Ã¥â€ ÂµÃ¯Â¼â€ºÃ¥Â¹Â¶Ã¨Â¿â€ºÃ¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¦Â­Â¥Ã¦Â¯â€Ã¨Â¾Æ’Ã¤Â¸ÂÃ¥ÂÅ’Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¨Ë†Â¬Ã§Â¤Â¾Ã¤Â¼Å¡Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã§â€°Â¹Ã¥Â¾ÂÃ¥ÂÅ Ã¨Ë†â€ Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¤Â¿Â¡Ã¦ÂÂ¯Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¨Æ’Â½Ã¥Å â€ºÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã¥Â¾â€”Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã§Å Â¶Ã¥â€ ÂµÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“</b>: 373Ã¥ÂÂÃ¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœSCL-90Ã¤Â¸Â­10Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ¥â€ºÂ Ã¥Â­ÂÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¹Â³Ã¥Ââ€¡Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¥Ââ€¡&lt;2Ã¯Â¼Å’14.21%Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¥Â­ËœÃ¥Å“Â¨1Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ¥ÂÅ Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã¤Â¸Å Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥â€ºÂ Ã¥Â­ÂÃ¥Â¾â€”Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¢â€°Â¥2Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¦ÂÂÃ¦â‚¬â€“(11.26%)Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¥Â¼ÂºÃ¨Â¿Â«Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶(7.77%)Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜(5.63%)Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¨Å½Â·Ã¥Ââ€“COVID-19Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¤Â¿Â¡Ã¦ÂÂ¯Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸Â»Ã¨Â¦ÂÃ¦ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂºÂÃ¥Å’â€¦Ã¦â€¹Â¬Ã¥Â¾Â®Ã¤Â¿Â¡Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¥Â¾Â®Ã¥ÂÅ¡Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¤Â»Å Ã¦â€”Â¥Ã¥Â¤Â´Ã¦ÂÂ¡Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ§â€ÂµÃ¨Â§â€ Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥Â¹Â¿Ã¦â€™Â­Ã¯Â¼â€º66.22%Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¤Â¼Å¡Ã§Â»ÂÃ¥Â¸Â¸Ã©â‚¬Å¡Ã¨Â¿â€¡Ã¥Â®ËœÃ¦â€“Â¹Ã§Â½â€˜Ã§Â«â„¢Ã¦Ë†â€“Ã¦Â­Â£Ã¨Â§â€žÃ¦Â¸Â Ã©Ââ€œÃ¦ÂÂ¥Ã¨Â¯ÂÃ¥Â®Å¾Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¥â€¦Â³COVID-19Ã¤Â¿Â¡Ã¦ÂÂ¯Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Å“Å¸Ã¥Â®Å¾Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¯Â¼â€ºÃ¥Â¾Â®Ã¤Â¿Â¡Ã©â€¡Å’Ã¥Â¤Â§Ã©â€¡ÂCOVID-19Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¤Â¿Â¡Ã¦ÂÂ¯Ã¤Â¼Å¡Ã¨Â®Â©Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¦â€žÅ¸Ã¥Ë†Â°Ã§Â´Â§Ã¥Â¼Â (34.05%)Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜(30.29%)Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¦Â²Â¡Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¥Â®â€°Ã¥â€¦Â¨Ã¦â€žÅ¸(29.22%)Ã¯Â¼â€º68.63%Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¦Å“â€°Ã¦â€”Â¶Ã¤Â¼Å¡Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ§Å“â€¹Ã¥Ë†Â°COVID-19Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¤Â¿Â¡Ã¦ÂÂ¯Ã¨â‚¬Å’Ã¦â€¹â€¦Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã¨â€¡ÂªÃ¥Â·Â±Ã¨Â¢Â«Ã¦â€žÅ¸Ã¦Å¸â€œÃ£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¥Â·Â¥Ã¤Â½Å“Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Â§â€˜Ã¥Â®Â¤Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¨Â¿â€˜Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã¦ËœÂ¯Ã¥ÂÂ¦Ã¥â€¡ÂºÃ§Å½Â°Ã¥â€™Â³Ã¥â€”Â½Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¥Ââ€˜Ã§Æ’Â­Ã§Â­â€°Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¦â€¹â€¦Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã¨Â¢Â«Ã¦â€žÅ¸Ã¦Å¸â€œÃ§Å¡â€žÃ§Â¨â€¹Ã¥ÂºÂ¦Ã§Â­â€°Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ§Å¡â€žSCL-90Ã¥Â¾â€”Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â·Â®Ã¥Â¼â€šÃ¥â€¦Â·Ã¦Å“â€°Ã§Â»Å¸Ã¨Â®Â¡Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã¦â€žÂÃ¤Â¹â€°(Ã¥Ââ€¡<i>P</i>&lt;0.05)Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ©â‚¬ÂÃ¦Â­Â¥Ã¥â€ºÅ¾Ã¥Â½â€™Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ¥Ââ€˜Ã§Å½Â°Ã¥Â¾Â®Ã¤Â¿Â¡Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¨Â½Â¬Ã¥Ââ€˜Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¤Â§Ã©â€¡ÂCOVID-19Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¤Â¿Â¡Ã¦ÂÂ¯Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã§â€Å¸Ã¦Â´Â»Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ§Â¨â€¹Ã¥ÂºÂ¦Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¨Â¿â€˜Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¦â€”Â Ã¥â€™Â³Ã¥â€”Â½Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¥Ââ€˜Ã§Æ’Â­Ã§Â­â€°Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â¾Â®Ã¤Â¿Â¡Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¨Â½Â¬Ã¥Ââ€˜Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¤Â§Ã©â€¡ÂCOVID-19Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¤Â¿Â¡Ã¦ÂÂ¯Ã¦ËœÂ¯Ã¥ÂÂ¦Ã¨Â®Â©Ã¨â€¡ÂªÃ¥Â·Â±Ã©Å¡Â¾Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã¥â€¦Â¥Ã§ÂÂ¡Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â·Â¥Ã¤Â½Å“Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Â§â€˜Ã¥Â®Â¤Ã¥ÂÅ Ã¦â€¹â€¦Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã¨Â¢Â«Ã¦â€žÅ¸Ã¦Å¸â€œÃ§Å¡â€žÃ§Â¨â€¹Ã¥ÂºÂ¦Ã¦ËœÂ¯Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â (Ã¥Ââ€¡<i>P</i>&lt;0.05)Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¨Â®Âº</b>: COVID-19Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¤Â¼Å¡Ã¥â€¡ÂºÃ§Å½Â°Ã¤Â¸ÂÃ¥ÂÅ’Ã§Â¨â€¹Ã¥ÂºÂ¦Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã©â€”Â®Ã©Â¢ËœÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â»ÂºÃ¨Â®Â®Ã¥Â»ÂºÃ§Â«â€¹Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¦ÂÂ´Ã¥Å Â©Ã¥Â¹Â³Ã¥ÂÂ°Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã¦Â­Â£Ã§Â¡Â®Ã¥Â¼â€¢Ã¥Â¯Â¼Ã¨Ë†â€ Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¥Ââ€˜Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã¤Â¿Æ’Ã¨Â¿â€ºÃ¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã£â‚¬â€š.","Shen, Wang, Zhou, Chen, Deng","https://doi.org/10.11817/j.issn.1672-7347.2020.200070","20200903","coronavirus disease 2019; medical staff; mental health status; pneumonia; public opinion","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-04","",4390,""
"Mental health of front-line staff in prevention of coronavirus disease 2019","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global public health crisis, which elicits psychological problems in different population<b>.</b> This study is to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on mental health in the front-line staff. Patient Health Questionnare-9 (PHQ-9), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Fatigue Self-assessment Scale (FSAS) were used to assess the depression, anxiety, and fatigue in front-line staff. The detection rates of depression, anxiety, and fatigue were 49.1%, 21.8%, and 76.0% among the front-line staff. The rates of depression, anxiety, and fatigue in community workers were higher than those in medical workers and other occupational staff (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01). The PHQ-9 of front-line staffs was negatively correlated with age, family income, family members' support, satisfaction of service objects, and sleep quality (all <i>P</i>&lt;0.01), while positively correlated with education level, fatigue, fear of pneumonia, and the duration of daily attention to the COVID-19 (all <i>P</i>&lt;0.01). SAS was negatively correlated with age, family income, family support, satisfaction of objects service, and sleep quality (all <i>P</i>&lt;0.01), while positively correlated with gender, fatigue, fear of pneumonia, and duration of daily attention to the COVID-19 (all <i>P</i>&lt;0.01). The front-line workers should manage work and rest time reasonably to adjust their negative mood and fatigue. The government and the society should pay more attention to the psychological state of the front-line staff, particularly for the staff working in the community or villages and towns in preventing the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, front-line staff can be obtained mental intervention or be taken a rest from the high-intensive work. <b>Ã§â€ºÂ®Ã§Å¡â€ž</b>: 2019Ã¥â€ Â Ã§Å Â¶Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦Â¯â€™Ã§â€”â€¦(coronavirus disease 2019Ã¯Â¼Å’COVID-19)Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ¥â€¦Â¨Ã§ÂÆ’Ã¥â€¦Â¬Ã¥â€¦Â±Ã¥ÂÂ«Ã§â€Å¸Ã¥ÂÂ±Ã¦Å“ÂºÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â¼â€¢Ã¥Ââ€˜Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¤Â¸ÂÃ¥ÂÅ’Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ§Â¾Â¤Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Ââ€žÃ§Â§ÂÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã©â€”Â®Ã©Â¢ËœÃ£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Å“Â¬Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¦â€”Â¨Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¨Â§Â£COVID-19Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã©ËœÂ²Ã¦Å½Â§Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã§ÂºÂ¿Ã¥Â·Â¥Ã¤Â½Å“Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã§Å Â¶Ã¥â€ ÂµÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â³â€¢</b>: Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã©â€”Â®Ã¥ÂÂ·Ã¦ËœÅ¸Ã¥Â¹Â³Ã¥ÂÂ°Ã©â€¡â€¡Ã§â€Â¨Ã§â€ÂµÃ¥Â­ÂÃ©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¡Â¨Ã¨Â¿â€ºÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã¦Â»Å¡Ã©â€ºÂªÃ§ÂÆ’Ã¦Å Â½Ã¦Â Â·Ã¨Â°Æ’Ã¦Å¸Â¥Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â½Â¿Ã§â€Â¨Ã¦Å â€˜Ã©Æ’ÂÃ§â€”â€¡Ã§Â­â€ºÃ¦Å¸Â¥Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¡Â¨(Patient Health Questionnare-9Ã¯Â¼Å’PHQ-9)Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¨â€¡ÂªÃ¨Â¯â€žÃ©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¡Â¨(Self-Rating Anxiety ScaleÃ¯Â¼Å’SAS)Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ§â€“Â²Ã¥Å Â³Ã¨â€¡ÂªÃ¨Â¯â€žÃ©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¡Â¨(Fatigue Self-assessment ScaleÃ¯Â¼Å’FSAS)Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¤Â¼Â°Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã§ÂºÂ¿Ã¥Â·Â¥Ã¤Â½Å“Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¦Å â€˜Ã©Æ’ÂÃ£â‚¬ÂÃ§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ§â€“Â²Ã¥Å Â³Ã¥ÂºÂ¦Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“</b>: Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã§ÂºÂ¿Ã¥Â·Â¥Ã¤Â½Å“Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¦Å â€˜Ã©Æ’ÂÃ¦Â£â‚¬Ã¥â€¡ÂºÃ§Å½â€¡49.1%Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¦Â£â‚¬Ã¥â€¡ÂºÃ§Å½â€¡21.8%Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã§â€“Â²Ã¥Å Â³Ã¦Â£â‚¬Ã¥â€¡ÂºÃ§Å½â€¡76.0%Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã§Â¤Â¾Ã¥Å’ÂºÃ£â‚¬ÂÃ¤Â¹Â¡Ã©â€¢â€¡Ã¥Â·Â¥Ã¤Â½Å“Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¦Å â€˜Ã©Æ’ÂÃ£â‚¬ÂÃ§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ§â€“Â²Ã¥Å Â³Ã¦Â£â‚¬Ã¥â€¡ÂºÃ§Å½â€¡Ã¨Â¾Æ’Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ£â‚¬ÂÃ¥â€¦Â¶Ã¤Â»â€“Ã¨ÂÅ’Ã¤Â¸Å¡Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã©Â«Ëœ(<i>P</i>&lt;0.01)Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¤Â¸â‚¬Ã§ÂºÂ¿Ã¥Â·Â¥Ã¤Â½Å“Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ§Å¡â€žPHQ-9Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã¥Â¹Â´Ã©Â¾â€žÃ£â‚¬ÂÃ¥Â®Â¶Ã¥ÂºÂ­Ã¦â€Â¶Ã¥â€¦Â¥Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¥Â®Â¶Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¦â€Â¯Ã¦Å’ÂÃ£â‚¬ÂÃ¦Å“ÂÃ¥Å Â¡Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¨Â±Â¡Ã¦ËœÂ¯Ã¥ÂÂ¦Ã¦Â»Â¡Ã¦â€žÂÃ£â‚¬ÂÃ§ÂÂ¡Ã§Å“Â Ã¨Â´Â¨Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¥â€˜Ë†Ã¨Â´Å¸Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³(Ã¥Ââ€¡<i>P</i>&lt;0.01)Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã¦â€“â€¡Ã¥Å’â€“Ã§Â¨â€¹Ã¥ÂºÂ¦Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¦â€¹â€¦Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã¦â€žÅ¸Ã¦Å¸â€œÃ¨â€šÂºÃ§â€šÅ½Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¦Â¯ÂÃ¥Â¤Â©Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¦Â³Â¨Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦â€”Â¶Ã©â€”Â´Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã¥ÂÅ Ã§â€“Â²Ã¥Å Â³Ã¥â€˜Ë†Ã¦Â­Â£Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³(Ã¥Ââ€¡<i>P</i>&lt;0.01)Ã£â‚¬â€šSASÃ¤Â¸Å½Ã¥Â¹Â´Ã©Â¾â€žÃ£â‚¬ÂÃ¥Â®Â¶Ã¥ÂºÂ­Ã¦â€Â¶Ã¥â€¦Â¥Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¥Â®Â¶Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¦â€Â¯Ã¦Å’ÂÃ£â‚¬ÂÃ¦Å“ÂÃ¥Å Â¡Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¨Â±Â¡Ã¦ËœÂ¯Ã¥ÂÂ¦Ã¦Â»Â¡Ã¦â€žÂÃ£â‚¬ÂÃ§ÂÂ¡Ã§Å“Â Ã¨Â´Â¨Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¥â€˜Ë†Ã¨Â´Å¸Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³(Ã¥Ââ€¡<i>P</i>&lt;0.01)Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¥Ë†Â«Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¦â€¹â€¦Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã¦â€žÅ¸Ã¦Å¸â€œÃ¨â€šÂºÃ§â€šÅ½Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¦Â¯ÂÃ¥Â¤Â©Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¦Â³Â¨Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦â€”Â¶Ã©â€¢Â¿Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã¥ÂÅ Ã§â€“Â²Ã¥Å Â³Ã¥â€˜Ë†Ã¦Â­Â£Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³(Ã¥Ââ€¡<i>P</i>&lt;0.01)Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¨Â®Âº</b>: Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã§ÂºÂ¿Ã©ËœÂ²Ã¦Å½Â§Ã¥Â·Â¥Ã¤Â½Å“Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¨â€¡ÂªÃ¨ÂºÂ«Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¥ÂË†Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥Â®â€°Ã¦Å½â€™Ã¥Â·Â¥Ã¤Â½Å“Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¤Â¼â€˜Ã¦ÂÂ¯Ã¦â€”Â¶Ã©â€”Â´Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥ÂÅ Ã¦â€”Â¶Ã¨Â°Æ’Ã¨Å â€šÃ¤Â¸ÂÃ¨â€°Â¯Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã§Â»ÂªÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã§Â¼â€œÃ¨Â§Â£Ã§â€“Â²Ã¥Å Â³Ã¯Â¼â€ºÃ¦â€Â¿Ã¥ÂºÅ“Ã©Æ’Â¨Ã©â€”Â¨Ã¥â€™Å’Ã§Â¤Â¾Ã¤Â¼Å¡Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¦Â³Â¨COVID-19Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦â€”Â¶Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â¹Å¸Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¥Â¤Å¡Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã§ÂºÂ¿Ã©ËœÂ²Ã¦Å½Â§Ã¥Â·Â¥Ã¤Â½Å“Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â°Â¤Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¦ËœÂ¯Ã§Â¤Â¾Ã¥Å’ÂºÃ£â‚¬ÂÃ¤Â¹Â¡Ã©â€¢â€¡Ã¥Â·Â¥Ã¤Â½Å“Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã§Å Â¶Ã¦â‚¬ÂÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¥ÂÅ Ã¦â€”Â¶Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¤Â»â€“Ã¤Â»Â¬Ã©â€¡â€¡Ã¥Ââ€“Ã¨Â°Æ’Ã¤Â¼â€˜Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥Â¹Â²Ã©Â¢â€žÃ§Â­â€°Ã¦Å½ÂªÃ¦â€“Â½Ã£â‚¬â€š.","Teng, Huang, Qiu, Tan, Zhong, Tang, Wu, Wu, Chen","https://doi.org/10.11817/j.issn.1672-7347.2020.200241","20200903","anxiety; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; fatigue; front-line staff; pneumonia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-04","",4391,""
"Effect of transfusion convalescent recovery plasma in patients with coronavirus disease 2019","To evaluate curative effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients by the transfusion of other convalescent plasma. Retrospective analysis of the clinical data of 18 patients with severe and critical COVID-19, who were hospitalized in the ICU of Xianghu Branch of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University from February 1 to March 15, 2020. Patients were subdivided into an experimental group (<i>n</i>=6, who had transfused the plasma) and an observation group (<i>n</i>=12, who had no plasma transfusion). Basic clinical data and prognosis indexes of these two groups were compared. Moreover, for the experimental group, the dynamic changes of blood oxygen saturation before and after the transfusion, the changes of lymphocyte absolute value 48 hours after the transfusion, and the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid were analyzed. There were no significant differences in age, gender, blood type and other basic clinical data between the two groups (all <i>P</i>&gt;0.05).There were no significant differences in ventilator machine weaning time, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) weaning time, body temperature recovery to normal time, and hospitalization days between these two groups (all <i>P</i>&gt;0.05). For the experimental group, before, during and after the convalescent plasma transfusion, the blood oxygen saturation of all 6 patients at all time (1, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h) was more than 90%, and there was no significant fluctuation. There were 3 patients whose absolute value of lymphocyte was increased 48 hours after the transfusion, and the remaining was decreased. There were 5 patients whose SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection turned negative 48 hours after the transfusion, accounting for 83.3%. Transfusion of convalescent plasma will not affect outcomesof COVID-19 patients, which can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in patients and reduce the loading capacity of SARS-CoV-2. <b>Ã§â€ºÂ®Ã§Å¡â€ž</b>: Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¤Â»Â·2019Ã¥â€ Â Ã§Å Â¶Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦Â¯â€™Ã§â€”â€¦(coronavirus disease 2019Ã¯Â¼Å’COVID-19)Ã¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¨Â¾â€œÃ¦Â³Â¨Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã¥Â¤ÂÃ¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¦ÂÂ¢Ã¥Â¤ÂÃ¦Å“Å¸Ã¨Â¡â‚¬Ã¦Âµâ€ Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§â€“â€”Ã¦â€¢Ë†Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â³â€¢</b>: Ã¥â€ºÅ¾Ã©Â¡Â¾Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¦Å¾Â2020Ã¥Â¹Â´2Ã¦Å“Ë†1Ã¦â€”Â¥Ã¨â€¡Â³3Ã¦Å“Ë†15Ã¦â€”Â¥Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¥Ââ€”Ã¦ËœÅ’Ã¥Â¤Â§Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã§Â¬Â¬Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã©â„¢â€žÃ¥Â±Å¾Ã¥Å’Â»Ã©â„¢Â¢Ã¨Â±Â¡Ã¦Â¹â€“Ã©â„¢Â¢Ã¥Å’ÂºÃ©â€¡ÂÃ§â€”â€¡Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã§Â§â€˜Ã¤Â½ÂÃ©â„¢Â¢Ã¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã§Å¡â€ž18Ã¥ÂÂÃ©â€¡ÂÃ¥Å¾â€¹Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¥ÂÂ±Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¥Å¾â€¹COVID-19Ã¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸Â´Ã¥ÂºÅ Ã¨Âµâ€žÃ¦â€“â„¢Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã¦Â Â¹Ã¦ÂÂ®Ã¦ËœÂ¯Ã¥ÂÂ¦Ã¨Â¾â€œÃ¦Â³Â¨Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã¥Â¤ÂÃ¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¦ÂÂ¢Ã¥Â¤ÂÃ¦Å“Å¸Ã¨Â¡â‚¬Ã¦Âµâ€ Ã¥Â°â€ Ã¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ¥Â®Å¾Ã©ÂªÅ’Ã§Â»â€ž(Ã¨Â¾â€œÃ¦Â³Â¨Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã¥Â¤ÂÃ¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¦ÂÂ¢Ã¥Â¤ÂÃ¦Å“Å¸Ã¨Â¡â‚¬Ã¦Âµâ€ Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¯Â¼Å’<i>n</i>=6)Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¨Â§â€šÃ¥Â¯Å¸Ã§Â»â€ž(Ã¦Å“ÂªÃ¨Â¾â€œÃ¦Â³Â¨Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã¥Â¤ÂÃ¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¦ÂÂ¢Ã¥Â¤ÂÃ¦Å“Å¸Ã¨Â¡â‚¬Ã¦Âµâ€ Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¯Â¼Å’<i>n</i>=12)Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Â¯â€Ã¨Â¾Æ’Ã¤Â¸Â¤Ã§Â»â€žÃ¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¤Â¸Â´Ã¥ÂºÅ Ã¥Å¸ÂºÃ¦Å“Â¬Ã¨Âµâ€žÃ¦â€“â„¢Ã¥ÂÅ Ã©Â¢â€žÃ¥ÂÅ½Ã¦Å’â€¡Ã¦Â â€¡Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã¨Â¿â€ºÃ¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¦Â­Â¥Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ¥Â®Å¾Ã©ÂªÅ’Ã§Â»â€žÃ¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¨Â¾â€œÃ¦Â³Â¨Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã¥Â¤ÂÃ¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¦ÂÂ¢Ã¥Â¤ÂÃ¦Å“Å¸Ã¨Â¡â‚¬Ã¦Âµâ€ Ã¥â€°ÂÃ£â‚¬ÂÃ¥ÂÅ½Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¨Â¡â‚¬Ã¦Â°Â§Ã©Â¥Â±Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥ÂºÂ¦Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Å Â¨Ã¦â‚¬ÂÃ¥ÂËœÃ¥Å’â€“Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¨Â¾â€œÃ¦Â³Â¨Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã¥Â¤ÂÃ¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¦ÂÂ¢Ã¥Â¤ÂÃ¦Å“Å¸Ã¨Â¡â‚¬Ã¦Âµâ€ Ã¥ÂÅ½48 hÃ¦Â·â€¹Ã¥Â·Â´Ã§Â»â€ Ã¨Æ’Å¾Ã§Â»ÂÃ¥Â¯Â¹Ã¥â‚¬Â¼Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥ÂËœÃ¥Å’â€“Ã¥ÂÅ Ã¤Â¸Â¥Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¦â‚¬Â¥Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¥â€˜Â¼Ã¥ÂÂ¸Ã§Â»Â¼Ã¥ÂË†Ã¥Â¾ÂÃ¥â€ Â Ã§Å Â¶Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦Â¯â€™2(severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2Ã¯Â¼Å’SARS-CoV-2)Ã¦Â Â¸Ã©â€¦Â¸Ã¦Â£â‚¬Ã¦Âµâ€¹Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã¦ËœÂ¯Ã¥ÂÂ¦Ã¨Â½Â¬Ã©ËœÂ´Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“</b>: Ã¤Â¸Â¤Ã§Â»â€žÃ¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¥Â¹Â´Ã©Â¾â€žÃ£â‚¬ÂÃ¦â‚¬Â§Ã¥Ë†Â«Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¨Â¡â‚¬Ã¥Å¾â€¹Ã§Â­â€°Ã¤Â¸Â´Ã¥ÂºÅ Ã¥Å¸ÂºÃ¦Å“Â¬Ã¨Âµâ€žÃ¦â€“â„¢Ã¥Â·Â®Ã¥Â¼â€šÃ¥Ââ€¡Ã¦â€”Â Ã§Â»Å¸Ã¨Â®Â¡Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã¦â€žÂÃ¤Â¹â€°(Ã¥Ââ€¡<i>P</i>&gt;0.05)Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¤Â¸Â¤Ã§Â»â€žÃ¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¥â€˜Â¼Ã¥ÂÂ¸Ã¦Å“ÂºÃ¦â€™Â¤Ã¦Å“ÂºÃ¦â€”Â¶Ã©â€”Â´Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¤Â½â€œÃ¥Â¤â€“Ã¨â€ Å“Ã¦Â°Â§Ã¥ÂË†(extracorporeal membrane oxygenationÃ¯Â¼Å’ECMO)Ã¦â€™Â¤Ã¦Å“ÂºÃ¦â€”Â¶Ã©â€”Â´Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¤Â½â€œÃ¦Â¸Â©Ã¦ÂÂ¢Ã¥Â¤ÂÃ¨â€¡Â³Ã¦Â­Â£Ã¥Â¸Â¸Ã¦â€”Â¶Ã©â€”Â´Ã¥ÂÅ Ã¤Â½ÂÃ©â„¢Â¢Ã¥Â¤Â©Ã¦â€¢Â°Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã©ÂÂ¢Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â·Â®Ã¥Â¼â€šÃ¥Ââ€¡Ã¦â€”Â Ã§Â»Å¸Ã¨Â®Â¡Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã¦â€žÂÃ¤Â¹â€°(Ã¥Ââ€¡<i>P</i>&gt;0.05)Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Â®Å¾Ã©ÂªÅ’Ã§Â»â€ž6Ã¥ÂÂÃ¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¨Â¾â€œÃ¦Â³Â¨Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã¥Â¤ÂÃ¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¦ÂÂ¢Ã¥Â¤ÂÃ¦Å“Å¸Ã¨Â¡â‚¬Ã¦Âµâ€ Ã¥â€°ÂÃ£â‚¬ÂÃ¨Â¾â€œÃ¦Â³Â¨Ã¨Â¿â€¡Ã§Â¨â€¹Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¨Â¾â€œÃ¦Â³Â¨Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¥Ââ€žÃ¦â€”Â¶Ã©â€”Â´Ã§â€šÂ¹(1Ã¯Â¼Å’6Ã¯Â¼Å’8Ã¯Â¼Å’12Ã¯Â¼Å’24Ã¯Â¼Å’36Ã¯Â¼Å’48 h)Ã¨Â¡â‚¬Ã¦Â°Â§Ã©Â¥Â±Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥ÂºÂ¦Ã¥Ââ€¡Ã¥Å“Â¨90%Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã¤Â¸Å Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤ÂºÂ¦Ã¦Å“ÂªÃ¨Â§ÂÃ¦ËœÅ½Ã¦ËœÂ¾Ã¦Â³Â¢Ã¥Å Â¨Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Â®Å¾Ã©ÂªÅ’Ã§Â»â€ž3Ã¤Â½ÂÃ¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¨Â¾â€œÃ¦Â³Â¨Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã¥Â¤ÂÃ¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¦ÂÂ¢Ã¥Â¤ÂÃ¦Å“Å¸Ã¨Â¡â‚¬Ã¦Âµâ€ Ã¥ÂÅ½48 hÃ¦Â·â€¹Ã¥Â·Â´Ã§Â»â€ Ã¨Æ’Å¾Ã§Â»ÂÃ¥Â¯Â¹Ã¥â‚¬Â¼Ã¨Â¾Æ’Ã¨Â¾â€œÃ¦Â³Â¨Ã¥â€°ÂÃ¥Ââ€¡Ã©Â«ËœÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¥ÂÂ¦3Ã¤Â½ÂÃ¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¦Â·â€¹Ã¥Â·Â´Ã§Â»â€ Ã¨Æ’Å¾Ã§Â»ÂÃ¥Â¯Â¹Ã¥â‚¬Â¼Ã¨Â¾Æ’Ã¨Â¾â€œÃ¦Â³Â¨Ã¥â€°ÂÃ¥â€¡ÂÃ¥Â°â€˜Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Â®Å¾Ã©ÂªÅ’Ã§Â»â€žÃ¦Å“â€°5Ã¥ÂÂÃ¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¨Â¾â€œÃ¦Â³Â¨Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã¥Â¤ÂÃ¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¦ÂÂ¢Ã¥Â¤ÂÃ¦Å“Å¸Ã¨Â¡â‚¬Ã¦Âµâ€ Ã¥ÂÅ½48 h SARS-CoV-2Ã¦Â Â¸Ã©â€¦Â¸Ã¦Â£â‚¬Ã¦Âµâ€¹Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã¨Â½Â¬Ã©ËœÂ´Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¨Â½Â¬Ã©ËœÂ´Ã§Å½â€¡Ã¤Â¸Âº83.3%Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¨Â®Âº</b>: Ã¨Â¾â€œÃ¦Â³Â¨Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã¥Â¤ÂÃ¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¦ÂÂ¢Ã¥Â¤ÂÃ¦Å“Å¸Ã¨Â¡â‚¬Ã¦Âµâ€ Ã¦Å“ÂªÃ¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂCOVID-19Ã¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã©Â¢â€žÃ¥ÂÅ½Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¨Æ’Â½Ã¨Â¿â€¦Ã©â‚¬Å¸Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¥â€™Å’COVID-19Ã¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¤Â½â€œÃ¥â€ â€¦Ã§Å¡â€žSARS-CoV-2Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã©â„¢ÂÃ¤Â½Å½SARS-CoV-2Ã¨Â½Â½Ã©â€¡ÂÃ£â‚¬â€š.","Xiao, Lin, Fan, Wen, Huang, Wang, Ren, Wu, Liu, Zhang, Li, LE","https://doi.org/10.11817/j.issn.1672-7347.2020.200318","20200903","convalescent recovery plasma; coronavirus disease 2019; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-04","",4392,""
"Mental and behavioural disorders and COVID-19-associated death in older people","Health factors such as diabetes, severe obesity and chronic kidney disease are all associated with a more severe outcome following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. However, there has been little exploration into the impact of mental and behavioural disorders on outcomes associated with COVID-19. We investigated outcomes for older people who used mental health services. Those who had a COVID-19-associated death had previously rated worse across a range of health and social problems, including mental health related problems. Our findings evidence the need to urgently explore whether mental and behavioural disorders should also be considered a health risk factor for a more severe outcome from COVID-19 infection in older people.","Boland, Gale","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2020.87","20200903","COVID-19; Comorbidity; dementia; mortality; rating scales","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-04","",4393,""

"COVID-19 Concerns Among Persons With Mental Illness","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has been recognized as causing a wide variety of behavioral health problems. Society must mitigate this impact by recognizing that COVID-19 can trigger people's fears of exacerbating an existing mental illness. A survey about COVID-19 for people with mental illness was developed. Two hundred fourteen people responded to the survey, of whom 193 self-identified as living with a mental illness. Almost all participants living with a mental illness (98%) said they had at least one major concern regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, and 62% said they had at least three major concerns. People living with a mental illness are very concerned about disruption of services, running out of medication, and social isolation during this pandemic. Providers and mental health services could address these fears by connecting with people living with mental illness through text messaging and social media.","Costa, Pavlo, Reis, Ponte, Davidson","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202000245","20200903","pandemic; patient needs; patient perceptions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-04","",4396,""
"Experiences, impacts and mental health functioning during a COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown: Data from a diverse New York City sample of college students","In March 2020, New York City (NYC) experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which resulted in a 78-day mass confinement of all residents other than essential workers. The aims of the current study were to (1) document the breadth of COVID-19 experiences and their impacts on college students of a minority-serving academic institution in NYC; (2) explore associations between patterns of COVID-19 experiences and psychosocial functioning during the prolonged lockdown, and (3) explore sex and racial/ethnic differences in COVID-19-related experiences and mental health correlates. A total of 911 ethnically and racially diverse students completed an online survey in May 2020. Findings highlight significant impediments to multiple areas of studentsâ€™ daily life during this period (i.e., home life, work life, social environment, and emotional and physical health) and a vast majority reported heightened symptoms of depression and generalized anxiety. Each of these life disruptions were significantly related to poorer mental health. Moreover, those who reported the loss of a close friend or loved one from COVID-19 (17%) experienced significantly more psychological distress than counterparts with other types of infection-related histories. Nonetheless, the majority (96%) reported at least one positive experience since the pandemic began. Our findings add to a growing understanding of COVID-19 impacts on psychological health and contribute the important perspective of the North American epicenter of the pandemic during the time frame of this investigation. We discuss how the results may inform best practices to support studentsâ€™ well-being and serve as a benchmark for future studies of student populations facing COVID-19 and its aftermath.","Teresa Lopez-Castro et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4609E-F5E-885","20200904","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; anxiety; mass confinement; college students; depression; gender differences; ptsd; covid-19; racial/ethnic differences; mental health","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-04","",4397,""
"Supporting Families to Protect Child Health: Parenting Quality and Household Needs During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: Supportive parenting is critical for promoting healthy child development in the face of stressors, such as those occurring during COVID-19. Here, we address a knowledge gap regarding specific household risk factors associated with parenting quality during the pandemic and incorporate first-person accounts of family challenges and needs. Methods: Mixed methods were applied to data collected between April 14th - 28th, 2020 from the â€œParenting During the Pandemicâ€ survey. Participants included 656 primary caregivers (e.g., mothers, fathers, foster parents) of least one child age 1.5-8 years of which 555 (84.6%) responded to at least one parenting questionnaire. Parenting quality was assessed across stressful, negative, and positive parenting dimensions. Household risk was examined across pandemic-linked (e.g., caregiver depression, unmet childcare needs) and stable factors (i.e., annual income, mental illness history). Significant correlates were examined with regressions in Mplus. Thematic analysis identified caregiver challenges and unmet needs from open-ended questions. Findings: Caregiver depression, higher child parity, unmet childcare needs, and relationship distress predicted lower-quality parenting. Caregiver depression was the most significant predictor across every parenting dimension, with analyses indicating medium effect sizes, ds = .39 - .73. Qualitative findings highlighted severe strains on parent capacities including managing psychological distress, limited social supports, and too much unstructured time. Interpretations: Lower quality parenting during COVID-19 is associated with multiple household and pandemic risk factors, with caregiver depression consistently linked to parent-child relationship disruptions. Focused efforts are needed to address caregiver mental health to protect child health as part of the pandemic response.","Leslie E Roos et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46130-C20-32A","20200904","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Attachment; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Early Childhood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Social Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Toddlerhood/Preschool Period; parenting; psychology; covid; maternal-child health; family; mental health; child development; depression","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-04","",4398,""
"ABC framework of fear of COVID-19 for psychotherapeutic intervention in Nepal: a review","The COVID-19 pandemic is having an impact on physical and mental health. Most studies report the impact on mental health and mental distress during the pandemic. As a result of various stressors (such as lockdown, quarantines, and misinformation) there is heightened fear of a pandemic. The sufferer may experience a variety of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and even psychosis. In predisposed vulnerable individuals, fear of COVID-19 is perpetuating pain and dysfunction. This study discussed the ABC framework of fear and influencer to better understand the different levels of symptoms and interventions. There is an urgent need to integrate mental health into primary health-care centers. The attending physician should be aware of the stress disorders associated with the pandemic. This article introduces a handy and practical portrayal of the ABC framework that can be taught to individuals in distress during clinical visits to primary care centers providing awareness of the relationship between thinking, emotional and behavioral responses.","Dhirendra Paudel","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461C8-025-8F0","20200904","PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Assessment; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Mental Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Psychotherapy; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Therapy; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cultural Psychology; phobia; abc; coronaphobia; anxiety; depression; psychotherapy","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-04","",4399,""
