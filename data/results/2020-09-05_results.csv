"An integrated approach to deal with mental health issues of children and adolescent during COVID-19 pandemic","The pandemic caused by COVID-19 has left few countries untouched  It is a far-reaching implication on humankind, with children and adolescents being no exception  Although the prevalence and fatality are negligible among children, a possible impact on their psychological and mental health cannot be disregarded  The unprecedented change in the way of living is bound to be having some psychological consequences on children and adolescents  The experiences gathered in childhood and adolescence are known to contribute to shaping the physical, emotional, and social well-being in adult life  Children are highly susceptible to environmental stressors  The present situation has the potential of adversely affecting the physical and mental well-being of children  To save the children from the long term consequences of this pandemic, a holistic approach integrating biological, psychological, social and spiritual methods of enhancing mental health have become essential  A concerted effort of government, non government organisations, parents, teachers, schools, psychologists, counselors and physicians are required to deal with the mental health issues of children and adolescents  This paper discusses the possible role of these agencies in the holistic intervention of this crisis","Sethy, M.; Mishra, R.","https://doi.org/10.7860/JCDR/2020/45418.14002","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research;14(9):SE01-SE03, 2020.; Publication details: Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research;14(9):SE01-SE03, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-05","",4400,""

"Addressing competency requirements of social work students during the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia","COVID-19 resulted in massive disruption and changes in every aspect of our lives. To curb the spread of the virus, many governments limited the movement of people or imposed full â€˜lockdownsâ€™. This created significant challenges for social workers practising with people often reliant on interpersonal support such as those at risk of domestic abuse; with mental health problems or learning disabilities. Measures to reduce viral spread affected the education sector at all levels from pre-school to higher education, disrupted traditional classroom pedagogy and shifted to technologically supported e-learning to minimise disruption to the studentsâ€™ education. In lockdown, online teaching has become the new norm. E-learning has its limitations for professional curricula such as social work. Like most countries, field practice represents a compulsory component of the social work curriculum in Malaysia which measures the capabilities or competency of students to enable them to become qualified social workers. When COVID-19 forced universities and agencies to halt field placements in Malaysia, the immediate challenge was to find alternative ways of assessing students. This paper aims to provide an overview of field education assessment in Malaysia during the pandemic and to pose questions for future assessment as Malaysian social work drives towards increased professional regulation.","Azman, Azlinda; Singh, Paramjit Singh Jamir; Parker, Jonathan; Ashencaen Crabtree, Sara","https://doi.org/10.1080/02615479.2020.1815692","","Database: ELSEVIER; Publication details: Soc.

Regression analyses controlling for demographic factors revealed that more dire pandemic expectations significantly predicted PS and NA directly, and the effects on NA were significantly mediated by PS. Findings provide evidence that expectations about a pandemic influence the extent to which older adults experience stress and NA in the midst of a pandemic event.

This problem is likely to be exacerbated for carers. Informal carers (mainly parents) of children and adults with intellectual disabilities, and a comparison group of parents of children without disabilities, completed an online questionnaire. Almost all the data were collected while strict lockdown conditions were in place. Relative to carers of children without intellectual disability, carers of both children and adults with intellectual disability had significantly greater levels of a wish fulfilment coping style, defeat/entrapment, anxiety, and depression. Differences were 2-3 times greater than reported in earlier pre-pandemic studies. Positive correlations were found between objective stress scores and all mental health outcomes.

"Adapting to disruption of research during the COVID-19 pandemic while testing nonpharmacological approaches to pain management","The COVID-19 pandemic has slowed research progress, with particularly disruptive effects on investigations of addressing urgent public health challenges, such as chronic pain. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Department of Defense (DoD) Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Pain Management Collaboratory (PMC) supports 11 large-scale, multisite, embedded pragmatic clinical trials (PCTs) in military and veteran health systems. The PMC rapidly developed and enacted a plan to address key issues in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The PMC tracked and collaborated in developing plans for addressing COVID-19 impacts across multiple domains and characterized the impact of COVID-19 on PCT operations, including delays in recruitment and revisions of study protocols. A harmonized participant questionnaire will facilitate later meta-analyses and cross-study comparisons of the impact of COVID-19 across all 11 PCTs. The pandemic has affected intervention delivery, outcomes, regulatory and ethics issues, participant recruitment, and study design. The PMC took concrete steps to ensure scientific rigor while encouraging flexibility in the PCTs, while paying close attention to minimizing the burden on research participants, investigators, and clinical care teams. Sudden changes in the delivery of pain management interventions will probably alter treatment effects measured via PMC PCTs. Through the use of harmonized instruments and surveys, we are capturing these changes and plan to monitor the impact on research practices, as well as on health outcomes. Analyses of patient-reported measures over time will inform potential relationships between chronic pain, mental health, and various socioeconomic stressors common among Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Coleman, Kean, Brandt, Peduzzi, Kerns","https://doi.org/10.1093/tbm/ibaa074","20200904","COVID-19; Disruption of research; Interventions; Pain management; Pragmatic clinical trials","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-05","",4417,""

"Editorial: The mental health impact of COVID-19 on pre-registration nursing students in Australia","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented changes across the globe challenging every aspect of what was previously considered 'usual' or 'normal' life. Everyday aspects of previous life as we knew it has changed and impacted our personal lives, employment, education, community connections and social activities. For many people, the impact of these changes in previous pandemics has resulted in psychological distress (Usher et al 2020a), associated with high levels of uncertainty leading to feelings of despair, hopelessness, despair, grief and loss of purpose across individuals, families and communities (Usher et al 2020b). Isolation strategies, imposed to contain the spread of the infection, also led to significant social and economic consequences across the community, resulting in increased deleterious psychosocial outcomes (Usher et al 2020c). Health workers have been consistently shown to experience higher levels of anxiety and depression related to pandemics than the general public (GÃƒÂ³mez-Duran et al 2020; Bettinsoli et al 2020) and a recent study exploring impacts of COVID-19 reported that health workers experienced unpleasant emotions such as fear, hyper-arousal, intrusive memories and insomnia, and emotional exhaustion (Braquehais et al 2020).","Usher, Bhullar, Wynaden, Durkin, Jackson","https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.12791","20200904","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-05","",4419,""

"A cross-sectional study of psychological wellbeing of Indian adults during the Covid-19 lockdown: Different strokes for different folks","The psychological impacts of the lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic are widely documented. In India, a family-centric society with a high population density and extreme social stratification, the impact of the lockdown might vary across diverse social groups. However, the patterning in the psychological impact of the lockdown among LGBT adults and persons known to be at higher risk of the complications of Covid-19 (such as persons with comorbidities or a history of mental illness) is not known in the Indian context. We used mixed methods (online survey, n = 282 and in-depth interviews, n = 14) to investigate whether the psychological influence of the lockdown was different across these groups of Indian adults. We fitted linear and logistic regression models adjusted for sociodemographic covariates. Thematic analysis helped us identify emergent themes in our qualitative narratives. Anxiety was found to be higher among LGBT adults (ÃŽÂ² = 2.44, CI: 0.58, 4.31), the high-risk group (persons with comorbidities) (ÃŽÂ² = 2.20, CI:0.36, 4.05), and those with a history of depression/loneliness (ÃŽÂ² = 3.89, CI:2.34, 5.44). Persons belonging to the LGBT group reported a greater usage of pornography than the heterosexuals (ÃŽÂ² = 2.72, CI: 0.09, 5.36) during the lockdown. Qualitative findings suggested that LGBT adults likely used pornography and masturbation to cope with the lockdown, given the limited physical access to sexual partners in a society that stigmatizes homosexuality. Moreover, both qualitative and quantitative study findings suggested that greater frequency of calling family members during lockdown could strengthen social relationships and increase social empathy. The study thereby urgently calls for the attention of policymakers to take sensitive and inclusive health-related decisions for the marginalized and the vulnerable, both during and after the crisis.","Sharma, Subramanyam","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238761","20200903","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-05","",4422,""

"Feasibility of a Commercially Available Virtual Reality System to Achieve Exercise Guidelines in Youth With Spina Bifida: Mixed Methods Case Study","Access to physical activity among youth with spina bifida (SB) is much lower than it is for children without disability. Enjoyable home-based exercise programs are greatly needed. Our objective is to examine the feasibility of a virtual reality (VR) active video gaming system (ie, bundle of consumer-available equipment) to meet US physical activity guidelines in two youth with SB. Two youth with SB-a 12-year-old female and a 13-year-old male; both full-time wheelchair users-participated in a brief, 4-week exercise program using a popular VR head-mounted display: Oculus Quest (Facebook Technologies). The system included a Polar H10 (Polar Canada) Bluetooth heart rate monitor, a no-cost mobile phone app (VR Health Exercise Tracker [Virtual Reality Institute of Health and Exercise]), and 13 games. The intervention protocol was conducted entirely in the homes of the participants due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The VR system was shipped to participants and they were instructed to do their best to complete 60 minutes of moderate-intensity VR exercise per day. Exercise duration, intensity, and calories expended were objectively monitored and recorded during exercise using the heart rate monitor and a mobile app. Fatigue and depression were measured via self-report questionnaires at pre- and postintervention. Participants underwent a semistructured interview with research staff at postintervention. Across the intervention period, the total average minutes of all exercise performed each week for participants 1 and 2 were 281 (SD 93) and 262 (SD 55) minutes, respectively. The total average minutes of moderate-intensity exercise performed per week for participants 1 and 2 were 184 (SD 103) (184/281, 65.4%) and 215 (SD 90) (215/262, 82.1%) minutes, respectively. One participant had a reduction in their depression score, using the Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders (Neuro-QoL) test, from baseline to postintervention, but no other changes were observed for fatigue and depression scores. Participants reported that the amount of exercise they completed was far higher than what was objectively recorded, due to usability issues with the chest-worn heart rate monitor. Participants noted that they were motivated to exercise due to the enjoyment of the games and VR headset as well as support from a caregiver. This study demonstrated that two youth with SB who used wheelchairs could use a VR system to independently and safely achieve exercise guidelines at home. Study findings identified a promising protocol for promoting exercise in this population and this warrants further examination in future studies with larger samples.","Lai, Davis, Narasaki-Jara, Hopson, Powell, Gowey, Rocque, Rimmer","https://doi.org/10.2196/20667","20200904","Oculus Quest; active video gaming; disability; exergaming; physical activity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-05","",4424,""
"Compassion, Law and COVID-19","Levels of personal anxiety are inevitably escalating in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including individual fear of infection, grief at the loss of loved ones and reactive depression related to loss of employment and livelihood. This article considers the importance of compassion in a range of contemporary and emerging contexts during a time of pandemic. These include: exposure of medical and care professionals to the acute demands of overstretched institutions resulting in adverse mental health outcomes and compassion fatigue; attitudes towards the burgeoning cohort of welfare recipients; and particularly vulnerable groups such as the elderly, and those who are homeless. The article considers how we ought to conceive of compassion in these contexts and makes some suggestions for building future compassion interventions and training.","Stobbs, Bennett, Freckelton","https://www.google.com/search?q=Compassion,+Law+and+COVID-19.","20200904","COVID-19; compassion; empathy-building; law; pandemic; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Burnout, Professional; Coronavirus Infections; Empathy; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-05","",4425,""
