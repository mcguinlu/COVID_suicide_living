"Process evaluation of the development and remote recruitment for Essential Coaching for Every Mother during COVID-19","Background: With the sudden decrease in in-person support and increase in perinatal mental health concerns during the coronavirus pandemic, innovative strategies, such as mHealth, are more important than ever. This study has two objectives: (1) to describe the modification of Essential Coaching for Every Mother during the coronavirus pandemic, and (2) to describe the process evaluation of recruitment and retention of pregnant and postpartum women for a pre-post intervention study. Methods: For objective 1, modified messages were piloted with mothers and postpartum healthcare providers simultaneously. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a subset of 10 participants from the original development study. For objective 2, three methods were used for recruitment: social media, posters in hospital, and media outreach. First time mothers were eligible for enrollment antenatally (37+ weeks) and postnatally (<3 weeks). Eligibility screening occurred remotely via text message with participants initiating contact. Data were collected via TextIt and REDCap. Outcomes were days to recruit 75 participants, eligibility vs. ineligibility rates, dropout and exclusion reasons, survey completion rates, perinatal timing of enrollment, and recruitment sources. Results: For objective 1, three mothers (M age=30.67 years) and seven healthcare providers (M age = 46.0 years) participated in the modification of the messages. Participants felt the messages were appropriate and relevant related to changes in postpartum care during the coronavirus pandemic. Nine messages were modified related to coronavirus and five messages were added to the program. For objective 2, recruitment ran July 15th-September 19th (67 days) with 200 screened and 88 enrolled, 70% antenatally. It took 50 days to enroll 75 participants. Mothers recruited antenatally (n=53) were more likely to receive all intervention message (68% vs. 19%). Mothers recruited postnatally (n=35) missed more messages on average (13.8 vs. 6.4). Participants heard about the study through family/friends (31%), news (20%), Facebook groups (16%), Facebook ads (14%), posters (12%), or other ways (7%). Conclusion: Antenatal recruitment resulted in participants enrolling earlier and receiving more of the study messages. Word of mouth and media outreach were successful, followed by advertisement on Facebook. Remote recruitment was a feasible way to recruit for Essential Coaching for Every Mother.","Justine Dol; Gail Tomblin Murphy; Douglas McMillan; Megan Aston; Marsha Campbell-Yeo","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.09.21253071","20210312","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-12","",11781,""

Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of lifestyles, physical activity and sleep characteristics, as well as changes in eating habits in the Peruvian population during COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A Cross-sectional descriptive study was performed. We analyzed adults from Peru between July to August 2020 based on an online self-administered questionnaire divided into sociodemographic, anthropometrics and COVID 19 diagnostic reported, lifestyle habits and frequency of consumption of foods. Findings: During confinement by COVID-19, 1176 participants were studied, 39% were student, 37.5% were workers and 46% were assert not to work. The population asserted gain weight (1 to 3 Kg) and 35.7% were overweight. The lifestyles habits showed that 54.8% affirmed to doing physical activity and a large proportion (37.2%) asserted sleep less. The Peruvian population presented a main feeding patter of breakfast (95.7%), lunch (97.5%), dinner (89.1%) and brunch (44.9%). Likewise, feeding habits before and during COVID-19 pandemic showed that vegetables (OR:1.56, CI95% 1.21 200), fruit (OR: 1.42, CI95% 1.10 1.81), legumes (OR:1.67, CI95% 1.23 2.28) and eggs (OR: 2.00, CI95% 1.52 2.65) presented significantly consumption increase during social isolation, while bakery products (OR: 0.74, CI95% 0.56 0.97), meat, snack, refreshment and fast-food decrease consumption. Other food no significant differences were presented. Conclusion: This study in a Peruvian population showed an important frequency of overweight and sleep disorders. There was a slight increase in physical activity despite the social isolation measures and an increase in health eating habits, nevertheless a majority reported gaining weight.","Salomon Huancahuire-Vega; Edda E.

"The impact of the UK's first COVID-19 lockdown on rates of violence and aggression on psychiatric inpatient wards","Aims: Inpatient life in UK mental health hospitals was profoundly altered during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. We analysed whether these changes impacted the rate of violent and aggressive incidents across acute adult wards and psychiatric intensive care units in a South London NHS Mental Health Trust during the first UK lockdown. Methods: We used an interrupted time series analysis to assess whether the rate of violent and aggressive incidents changed during the lockdown period from 23rd March 2020 to 15th June 2020. We used a quasi-poisson general additive model to model the weekly rate of violent incidents as a function of a seasonal trend, time trend, and impact of lockdown, using data from 1st January 2017 to 27th September 2020. Results: There was a 35% increase in the rate of incidents of violence and aggression [IR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.15-1.58, p < 0.001] between March 23rd 2020 and June 15th 2020. In addition, there was strong evidence of temporal (p < 0.001) and seasonal trends (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Our results suggest that restrictions to life increased the rate of violent incidents on the mental health wards studied here.","James Payne-Gill; Corin Whitfield; Alison Beck","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.10.21253244","20210312","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-12","",11783,""

"Loss of Sarcomeric Proteins via Upregulation of JAK/STAT Signaling Underlies Interferon-ÃŽÂ³-induced Contractile Deficit in Engineered Human Myocardium","The level of circulating interferon-ÃŽÂ³ (IFNÃŽÂ³) is elevated in various clinical conditions including autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, sepsis, acute coronary syndrome, and viral infections. As these conditions are associated with high risk of myocardial dysfunction, we investigated the effects of IFNÃŽÂ³ on 3D fibrin-based engineered human cardiac tissues (&quot;cardiobundles&quot;). Cardiobundles were fabricated from human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, exposed to 0-20ng/ml of IFNÃŽÂ³ on culture days 7-14, and assessed for changes in tissue structure, viability, contractile force and calcium transient generation, action potential propagation, cytokine secretion, and expression of select genes and proteins. We found that application of IFNÃŽÂ³ induced a dose-dependent reduction in contractile force generation, deterioration of sarcomeric organization, and cardiomyocyte disarray, without significantly altering cell viability, action potential propagation, or calcium transient amplitude. At molecular level, the IFNÃŽÂ³-induced structural and functional deficits could be attributed to altered balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, upregulation of JAK/STAT signaling pathway (JAK1, JAK2, and STAT1), and reduced expression of myosin heavy chain, myosin light chain-2v, and sarcomeric ÃŽÂ±-actinin. Application of clinically used JAK/STAT inhibitors, tofacitinib and baricitinib, fully prevented IFNÃŽÂ³-induced cardiomyopathy, confirming the critical roles of this signaling pathway in inflammatory cardiac disease. Taken together, our in vitro studies in engineered myocardial tissues reveal direct adverse effects of pro-inflammatory cytokine IFNÃŽÂ³ on human cardiomyocytes and establish the foundation for a potential use of cardiobundle platform in modeling of inflammatory myocardial disease and therapy. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, lupus erythematosus, Chagas disease, and others, as well as viral infections including H1N1 influenza and COVID-19 show increased systemic levels of a pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon-ÃŽÂ³ (IFNÃŽÂ³) and are associated with high risk of heart disease. Here we explored for the first time if chronically elevated levels of IFNÃŽÂ³ can negatively affect structure and function of engineered human heart tissues in vitro. Our studies revealed IFNÃŽÂ³-induced deterioration of myofibrillar organization and contractile force production in human cardiomyocytes, attributed to decreased expression of multiple sarcomeric proteins and upregulation of JAK/STAT signaling pathway. FDA-approved JAK inhibitors fully blocked the adverse effects of IFNÃŽÂ³, suggesting a potentially effective strategy against human inflammatory cardiomyopathy.","Zhan, Rao, Chen, Strash, Bursac","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2021.03.007","20210311","COVID-19; fibrin hydrogel; hiPSC; inflammation; secretome","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-12","",11798,""

"Impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on the mental health of university students in Sichuan Province, China: An online cross-sectional study","Coronavirus disease 2019 is an emerging public health problem threatening not only the life but also the normal psychology of people. University students' mental health is the focus in the field of higher education. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has brought into attention the mental health problems of this vulnerable group. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on the mental health of university students in Sichuan Province, China. We conducted a cross-sectional study from April 2020 to May 2020. The participants responded to an online questionnaire that included informed consent, basic information, 20-item Self Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20), and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). We received 521 effective responses. The results included the following: 19.0% of respondents reported distress, and 31.5%, 8.1%, and 5.8% of them reported mild, moderate, and severe anxiety, respectively; respondents agedÃ‚Â Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã‚Â 22Ã‚Â years, medical students, and those who were in general health reported more distress than others; and medical students and those who paid more attention to pandemic information reported more anxiety than others. Findings suggest that the mental health of university students should be monitored during pandemic, especially for younger students, medical students, students in general health status, and those who paid too much attention to the news of the pandemic. Due to the limited sample representativeness, we must be cautious when generalizing these findings to other regions of China or other countries.","Yang, Wang, Liu, Li, Jiang","https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.12828","20210311","COVID-19; China; Coronavirus disease 2019; mental health; university student","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-12","",11800,""
"Silver linings: Observed reductions in aggression and use of restraints and seclusion in psychiatric inpatient care during COVID-19","The global COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed the operation of healthcare such that many services were put on hold as patients were triaged differently, people delayed seeking care, and transition to virtual care was enacted, including in psychiatric facilities. Most of the media dialogue has been negative; however, there have been some silver linings observed. Coinciding with the pandemic has been a reduction in aggressive incidents at our psychiatric hospital, along with the decreased need to use restraints and seclusion to manage behaviour. In this paper we are taking stock of the changes that have occurred in response to the pandemic in an attempt to share our learnings and offer suggestions so that healthcare does not necessarily return to 'normal.'","Martin, Arbour, McGregor, Rice","https://doi.org/10.1111/jpm.12752","20210311","COVID19; aggression; inpatient; mental health; restraints and seclusion","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-12","",11801,""
"Psychological eHealth interventions for people with intellectual disabilities: A scoping review","The use of eHealth, which has accelerated in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, could contribute to the access to tailor-made psychological interventions for people with intellectual disabilities. A scoping review was conducted on peer-reviewed studies between 1996-2019. Thirty-three studies reported on the use of psychological eHealth interventions focused on mental health problems and/or challenging behaviour. The vast majority of these studies reported on interventions that were delivered at the individual level. The context in which these interventions were delivered varied, primarily ranging from the home setting to residential settings, as well as day or activity centres and schools. The studies described various types of interventions: telehealth interventions, computerized cognitive behavioural therapy, and interventions focused on (social) learning principles targeting challenging behaviour. eHealth provides new opportunities for both therapists and lay-therapists to deliver psychological interventions. Future studies should focus on the effectiveness of psychological eHealth interventions.","Oudshoorn, Frielink, Nijs, Embregts","https://doi.org/10.1111/jar.12877","20210311","eHealth; intellectual disabilities; psychological interventions; therapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-12","",11802,""
"The Effect of Supervision Waivers on Practice: A Survey of Massachusetts Nurse Practitioners During the COVID-19 Pandemic","While optimal utilization of the nurse practitioner (NP) workforce is an increasingly popular proposal to alleviate the growing primary care shortage, federal, state, and organizational scope of practice policies inhibit NPs from practicing to the full extent of their license and training. In March of 2020, NP state-specific supervisory requirements were temporarily waived to meet the demands of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Massachusetts. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of temporarily waived state practice restrictions on NP perception of care delivery during the initial surge of the COVID-19 pandemic in Massachusetts. Mixed methods descriptive analysis of a web-based survey of Massachusetts NPs (N=391), conducted in May and June 2020. The vast majority (75%) of NPs believed the temporary removal of practice restriction did not perceptibly improve clinical work. Psychiatric mental health NPs were significantly more likely than other NP specialties to believe the waiver improved clinical work (odds ratio=6.68, P=0.001). NPs that experienced an increase in working hours during the pandemic surge were also more likely to report a positive effect of the waiver (odds ratio=2.56, P=0.000). Temporary removal of state-level practice barriers alone is not sufficient to achieve immediate full scope of practice for NPs. The successful implementation of modernized scope of practice laws may require a collective effort to revise organizational and payer policies accordingly.","O'Reilly-Jacob, Perloff","https://doi.org/10.1097/MLR.0000000000001486","20210311","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-12","",11803,""
"Depression and anxiety symptoms associated with internet gaming disorder before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal study","The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has profoundly impacted aspects of human life globally. Playing videogames has been encouraged by several organizations to help individuals cope with the COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictive measures. This longitudinal study was the first to examine gaming in the context of the pandemic and its association with depressive and anxiety symptoms. The sample comprised 1,778 children and adolescents (50.7% male) who were part of the Project of School Mental Health in Southwest China. Data were collected at two-time intervals: before the COVID-19 pandemic (October to November 2019 - [T1]) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (April to May 2020 - [T2]). Data were collected on perceived COVID-19 impacts, videogame use, Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD), and depressive and anxiety symptoms. Cross-lagged panel models were computed to examine longitudinal relationships. The results indicated that both videogame use and IGD increased significantly for adolescents at T2. The cross-lagged panel model results suggested that depressive and anxiety symptoms at T1 positively predicted IGD and videogame use at T2 (especially for boys), but not inversely. Perceived COVID-19 impacts mediated the relationship between depressive and anxiety symptoms at T1 and IGD at T2. Children and adolescents both increased videogame use at T2, but only adolescents significantly increased IGD severity at T2. The findings supported the compensatory hypothesis, and are consistent with the Interaction of Person-Affect-Cognition-Execution model as individual responses to COVID-19 may function as a mediator between personal predisposing variables and IGD.","Teng, Pontes, Nie, Griffiths, Guo","https://doi.org/10.1556/2006.2021.00016","20210311","Internet gaming disorder; anxiety symptoms; depressive symptoms; perceived COVID-19 impacts; videogame use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-12","",11804,""
"Effect of Reading Rehabilitation for Age-Related Macular Degeneration on Cognitive Functioning: Protocol for a Nonrandomized Pre-Post Intervention Study","Age-related vision impairments and dementia both become more prevalent with increasing age. Research into the mechanisms of these conditions has proposed that some of their causes (eg, macular degeneration/glaucoma and Alzheimer's disease) could be symptoms of an underlying common cause. Research into sensory-cognitive aging has provided data that sensory decline may be linked to the progression of dementia through reduced sensory stimulation. While hearing loss rehabilitation may have a beneficial effect on cognitive functioning, there are no data available on whether low vision rehabilitation, specifically for reading, could have a beneficial effect on cognitive health. The research questions are: (1) Does low vision rehabilitation reduce reading effort? (2) If so, does reduced reading effort increase reading activity, and (3) If so, does increased reading activity improve cognitive functioning? The primary objective is to evaluate cognition before, as well as at 6 months and 12 months after, 3 weeks of low vision reading rehabilitation using magnification in individuals with age-related macular degeneration, with or without coexisting hearing impairments. We hypothesize that improvements postrehab will be observed at 6 months and maintained at 12 months for participants with vision loss and less so for those with dual sensory loss. The secondary objective is to correlate participant characteristics with all cognitive outcomes to identify which may play an important role in reading rehabilitation. We employ a quasiexperimental approach (nonrandomized, pre-post intervention study). A 3x3 design (3 groups x 3 time points) allows us to examine whether cognitive performance will change before and after 6 months and 12 months of a low vision reading intervention, when comparing 75 low vision and 75 dual sensory impaired (vision &amp; hearing) participants to 75 age-matched healthy controls. The study includes outcome measures of vision (eg, reading acuity and speed), cognition (eg, short-term and long-term memory, processing speed), participant descriptors, demographics, and clinical data (eg, speech perception in noise, mental health). The study has received approval, and recruitment began on April 24, 2019. As of March 4, 2021, 38 low vision and 7 control participants have been enrolled. Lockdown forced a pause in recruitment, which will recommence once the COVID-19 crisis has reached a point where face-to-face data collection with older adults becomes feasible again. Evidence of protective effects caused by reading rehabilitation will have a considerable impact on the vision rehabilitation community and their clients as well as all professionals involved in the care of older adults with or without dementia. If we demonstrate that reading rehabilitation has a beneficial effect on cognition, the demand for rehabilitation services will increase, potentially preventing cognitive decline across groups of older adults at risk of developing macular degeneration.

"Predictors of emotional wellbeing in osteopathic medical students in a COVID-19 world","In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak a pandemic. Due to the rapid spread, strong contagion, high incidence of lethality in severe cases, and the lack of a pharmaceutical prevention or cure, COVID-19 has posed a serious threat to human life and health. It has also had a tremendous impact on mental health, including fear and worry, difficulty sleeping or concentrating, and increased use of poor coping mechanisms. Osteopathic medical students have had additional concerns regarding the interruption of their studies, closing of clinical rotations, and postponed licensing exams. To date, few reports have focused on osteopathic medical students and their reactions to the outbreak. To assess resilience, coping, health behaviors, and emotional wellbeing of osteopathic medical students during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this cross-sectional study, we distributed an anonymous online survey to all medical students enrolled at Nova Southeastern University in May 2020 (n=1,310) via an e-mail invitation using the institution's student listservs. Our major study variables were based on published reports and anecdotal evidence; we subsequently developed the Emotional Wellbeing in Healthcare Professions Students Questionnaire (EWB-Q). This EWB-Q contained validated scales to assess the contribution of levels of coping strategies used, personal resilience, and health behaviors on the emotional wellbeing of osteopathic medical students. Multiple linear regression and other statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS v0.26. Of the 1,310 students invited to participate, 335 (25.5%) surveys were returned. Of those, 133 had more than 33% of the necessary data missing and were removed, resulting in 202 (15.4%) completed questionnaires. The mean age of the participants was 26.7 years. About half (n=92; 45.5%) were in the clinical phase (years 3 and 4) of their medical school training (in rotations). A significant regression equation was found (<i>F</i>[4,171]=17.481, p&lt;0.000, <i>R</i><sup> <i>2</i> </sup> =0.290, <i>R</i><sup><i>2</i>adjusted</sup>=0.274), indicating that levels of coping, personal resilience, and health behaviors (i.e.,Ã‚Â not sleeping more than usual, not exercising less than usual) accounted for a significant amount of the variance in emotional wellbeing scores in osteopathic medical students. Higher levels of resilience, greater use of coping strategies, not sleeping more than usual, and not exercising less than usual were predictors of emotional wellbeing. Cultivating positive mental health should be a high priority for medical educators as they develop and implement curriculum-based initiatives to help medical students bolster their personal resilience and to encourage healthy coping behaviors during times of crisis and beyond. A proactive position that assists with building personal resilience and developing stress management habits is paramount in assisting students who are grappling not only with the challenges of rigorous medical training, but also with the uncertainty and stress that exists during any major global health or socioeconomic crisis.","Jacobs, Lanspa, Kane, Caballero","https://doi.org/10.1515/jom-2020-0272","20210311","COVID-19; coping; emotional wellbeing; health behaviors; mental health; osteopathic medical student; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-12","",11806,""

Cross-sectional, self-administered registry enrollment survey conducted from April 10 to July 31, 2020. Participants worked in hospitals (74.4%), outpatient clinics (7.4%), and other settings (18.2%) located throughout the nation. A total of 14,600 healthcare workers. COVID-19 exposure, viral and antibody testing, diagnosis of COVID-19, job burnout, and physical and emotional distress. Mean age was 42.0 years, 76.4% were female, 78.9% were White, 33.2% were nurses, 18.4% were physicians, and 30.3% worked in settings at high risk for COVID-19 exposure (e.g., ICUs, EDs, COVID-19 units). Overall, 43.7% reported a COVID-19 exposure and 91.3% were exposed at work. Just 3.8% in both high- and low-risk settings experienced COVID-19 illness. In regression analyses controlling for demographics, professional role, and work setting, the risk of COVID-19 illness was higher for Black/African-Americans (aOR 2.32, 99% CI 1.45, 3.70, p &lt; 0.01) and Hispanic/Latinos (aOR 2.19, 99% CI 1.55, 3.08, p &lt; 0.01) compared with Whites.

"COVID-19 pandemic response behaviors: a Singapore experience of the &quot;circuit breaker&quot;","Preventive health behaviors such as hand hygiene are crucial amidst pandemics like COVID-19 but reports on nonadherence persist. This could be due to the lack of Consideration of Future Consequences (CFC), a cognitive-motivational construct known to improve health-related behaviors. Therefore, we examined the relationship between CFC and five behaviors-mask-wearing, social distancing, hand hygiene, excessive necessities buying, and COVID-19 information searching using an internet-based Singapore-wide survey conducted from April 20 to May 4, 2020. Behavioral differences 2 weeks before and after the state-wide confinement were examined using paired t-tests. Relationships between CFC and COVID-19 behaviors were examined using regression analyses adjusted for depression and anxiety. Participants were regrouped into three categories-increased behavior performance, maintained high performance, and maintained low performance where mean differences were analysed using MANOVA. Three hundred and thirty-six participants completed the survey (mean age, SD = 32.9 years [SD = 12.6]; 38.7% males).

"DETECT Schools Study Protocol: A Prospective Observational Cohort Surveillance Study Investigating the Impact of COVID-19 in Western Australian Schools","<b>Introduction:</b> Amidst the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, understanding the transmission dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is key to providing peace of mind for the community and informing policy-making decisions. While available data suggest that school-aged children are not significant spreaders of SARS-CoV-2, the possibility of transmission in schools remains an ongoing concern, especially among an aging teaching workforce. Even in low-prevalence settings, communities must balance the potential risk of transmission with the need for students' ongoing education. Through the roll out of high-throughput school-based SARS-CoV-2 testing, enhanced follow-up for individuals exposed to COVID-19 and wellbeing surveys, this study investigates the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the current psychosocial wellbeing impacts of the pandemic in school communities. <b>Methods:</b> The DETECT Schools Study is a prospective observational cohort surveillance study in 79 schools across Western Australia (WA), Australia. To investigate the incidence, transmission and impact of SARS-CoV-2 in schools, the study comprises three &quot;modules&quot;: Module 1) Spot-testing in schools to screen for asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2; Module 2) Enhanced surveillance of close contacts following the identification of any COVID-19 case to determine the secondary attack rate of SARS-CoV-2 in a school setting; and Module 3) Survey monitoring of school staff, students and their parents to assess psycho-social wellbeing following the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in WA. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> Trial registration number: ACTRN12620000922976.","Mullane, Thomas, Epstein, Mandzufas, Mullan, Whelan, Lombardi, Barrow, Ang, Leahy, Cameron, Lester, Cooper, Stevenson, Hartman, McKenzie, Mitrou, Zubrick, Coffin, Cross, Bowen, Gething","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.636921","20210311","COVID-19; child health; mental health; school; screening; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-12","",11810,""
"Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Among Healthcare Workers During the COVID-19 Outbreak and Relationships With Expressive Flexibility and Context Sensitivity","This study aimed at investigating depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms among healthcare workers and examine the role of expressive flexibility and context sensitivity as key components of resilience in understanding reported symptoms. We hypothesized a significant and different contribution of resilience components in explaining depression, anxiety, and stress. A total sample of 218 Italian healthcare workers participated in this study through an online survey during the lockdown, consequently to the COVID-19. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21) was used to measure depression, anxiety, and stress; the Flexible Regulation of Emotional Expression (FREE) scale was used to measure the ability to enhance and suppress emotional expression; the Context Sensitivity Index (CSI) was used to measure the ability to accurately perceive contextual cues and determine cue absence. Demographic and work-related data were also collected. DASS-21 cut-off scores were used to verify the mental status among the respondents. Correlational analyses examined relationships between DASS-21, FREE, and CSI, followed by three regression analyses with depression, anxiety, and stress as dependent variables, controlling for age, gender, and work experience. Enhancement and suppression abilities, cue presence, and cue absence served as independent variables. The results showed a prevalence of moderate to extremely severe symptoms of 8% for depression, 9.8% for anxiety, and 8.9% for stress. Results of correlational analysis highlighted that enhance ability was inversely associated with depression and stress. Suppression ability was inversely associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. The ability to perceive contextual cues was inversely associated with depression and anxiety. The regression analysis showed that the ability to enhance emotional expression was statistically significant to explain depression among healthcare workers. In predicting anxiety, age, and the ability to accurately perceive contextual cues and determine cue absence made substantial contributions as predictors. In the last regression model, age, work experience, and the ability to suppress emotional expression were significant predictors of stress. This study's findings can help understand the specific contributions of enhancement and suppression abilities and sensitivity to stressor context cues in predicting depression, anxiety, and stress among healthcare workers. Psychological interventions to prevent burnout should consider these relationships.","Lenzo, Quattropani, Sardella, Martino, Bonanno","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.623033","20210311","COVID-19; anxiety; clinical psychology; context sensitivity; depression; emotion regulation; flexibility; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-12","",11811,""
"Comparative Effectiveness of Multiple Psychological Interventions for Psychological Crisis in People Affected by Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Bayesian Network Meta-Analysis","<b>Objective:</b> The objective of our current research is to compare the different psychological interventions and distinguish the most effective way to treat psychological crisis according to different clinical manifestations in people affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). No previous systematic review has provided a comprehensive overview by performing a Bayesian network meta-analysis of this current topic. <b>Method:</b> A systematic review and a Bayesian network meta-analysis were conducted on randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-RCTs, case-control studies, self-controlled case series (SCCS), cohort studies, and cross-sectional studies of all the available interventions for psychological crisis in people affected by COVID-19. We searched the electronic databases EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library, as well as the Chinese databases such as Sinomed, Chinese Biomedicine Literature (CBM), Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP), WanFang Database, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), from 2019 to April 30, 2020. The main outcomes were self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), self-rating depression scale (SDS), patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9), and symptom checklist (SCL-90). The study is registered with Inplasy, number 202050076. <b>Result:</b> Sixteen self-controlled case series (SCCS) comprising 1,147 participants compared five different psychological interventions with four different measurement scales were included in this study. For effectiveness, all the psychological therapies were significantly more effective than before intervention. Our results showed that supportive therapy (ST), which is adjusted to the COVID-19-related mental crisis, is the best treatment compared with behavioral therapy (BT), nursing-based psychological therapy (NBPT), traditional Chinese medicine therapy (TCMT), and COVID-19-related standard training (CRST) at reducing the anxiety-related symptoms assessed by SAS. When measured by SDS, BT was better than ST and NBPT treatment for reducing the depression symptoms. And ST was better than BT and ST+BT as assessed by PHQ-9. In the end, the last network meta-analysis indicated that NBPT was more effective than ST by the measurement of SCL-90. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our research suggested the potential effectiveness of psychological interventions for decreasing psychological crisis in people affected by COVID-19 and try to introduce the best effective treatment options for clinical practice according to the clinical manifestations of psychological problems, but further confirmation from high-quality RCTs is needed.","Yang, Sun, Hu, Tang, Zhang, Lin","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.577187","20210311","COVID-19; affected people; network meta-analysis; psychological crisis; psychological intervention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-12","",11812,""
"Sickness and the Social Brain: Love in the Time of COVID","As a highly social species, inclusion in social networks and the presence of strong social bonds are critical to our health and well-being. Indeed, impaired social functioning is a component of numerous neuropsychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety, and substance use disorder. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, our social networks are at risk of fracture and many are vulnerable to the negative consequences of social isolation. Importantly, infection itself leads to changes in social behavior as a component of &quot;sickness behavior.&quot; Furthermore, as in the case of COVID-19, males and females often differ in their immunological response to infection, and, therefore, in their susceptibility to negative outcomes. In this review, we discuss the many ways in which infection changes social behavior-sometimes to the benefit of the host, and in some instances for the sake of the pathogen-in species ranging from eusocial insects to humans. We also explore the neuroimmune mechanisms by which these changes in social behavior occur. Finally, we touch upon the ways in which the social environment (group living, social isolation, etc.) shapes the immune system and its ability to respond to challenge. Throughout we emphasize how males and females differ in their response to immune activation, both behaviorally and physiologically.","Smith, Bilbo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.633664","20210311","immune; infection; sex differences; social behavior; social stress and social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-12","",11813,""
"Insights for Fostering Resilience in Young Adults With Multiple Sclerosis in the Aftermath of the COVID-19 Emergency: An Italian Survey","<b>Objective:</b> Recent evidence has demonstrated that the COVID-19 pandemic is taking a toll on the mental health of the general population. The psychological consequences might be even more severe for patients with special healthcare needs and psychological vulnerabilities due to chronic diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Thus, we aimed to explore the psychological impact of this pandemic and of the subsequent healthcare service changes on young adults with MS living in Italy and to examine their coping strategies and preferences regarding psychological support in the aftermath of the pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> Data were collected using a cross-sectional, web-based survey advertised on social networks. We report both quantitative (descriptive statistics, <i>t</i>-tests, and one-way ANOVA) and qualitative data (inductive content analysis). <b>Results:</b> Two hundred and forty-seven respondents (mean age 32 Ã‚Â± 7 years), mainly with relapsing-remitting MS, from all Italian regions participated. Participants felt more worried, confused, sad, and vulnerable because of the disease &quot;during&quot; the pandemic in comparison to their self-evaluation of the period &quot;before&quot; the COVID-19 outbreak. Similarly, their perception of control over MS decreased &quot;during&quot; the pandemic in comparison to the retrospective evaluation of the period &quot;before&quot; the COVID-19 outbreak (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Canceled/postponed visits/exams were listed as the most frequent MS management changes, with modified/postponed pharmacological treatment representing the most stressful change. Psychological support in dealing with pandemic-related fears and improving MS acceptance and well-being was considered extremely important by almost 40% of the respondents. Different coping strategies were mentioned in the qualitative section of the survey, with social support, hobbies, and keeping busy being the most frequent ones. <b>Conclusions:</b> Considering the enormous impact of the pandemic on young adults with MS, we urge MS clinical centers to implement psychological support programs that address the potentially long-lasting psychological negative impact, thus fostering the therapeutic alliance that is being threatened by the infection prevention measures imposed during the pandemic, and promoting psychological resources for adaptively managing future waves of COVID-19.","Donisi, Gajofatto, Mazzi, Gobbin, Busch, Ghellere, Rimondini","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.588275","20210311","COVID-19; coping strategies; multiple sclerosis; pandemic; psychological adjustment; psychological support; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-12","",11814,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Children with ASD and Their Families: An Online Survey in China","The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown will have short-term and long-term psychosocial and mental health implications for children. Children with autism may have some specific needs for support because of their difficulties in social communication, stereotyped behavior patterns, and other specificities brought about by autism. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ASD children and their families. A total of 406 parents of ASD children completed an online survey investigating basic information; sleep, outdoor activities, and rehabilitation training; ASD children's frequency of abnormal behaviors; and stress and emotional status of parents. 50.3% of the parents thought their children had sleep problems, and 47.3% of the parents thought their children's outdoor activity time was reduced. About 40% of parents think that their children have improved cognitive ability, language expression, and understanding. 36.2% of the families reported that their children's emotional and social performance became worse. 60.8% of parents reported that their children's training intensity decreased. The most common abnormal behaviors observed in children with ASD were being easily distracted, losing temper, and crying. 81.3% of parents did not have anxiety, but 98% of parents reported that family training was under pressure. The main impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children with ASD is that they do not have access to professional rehabilitation training. These families need more medical support, especially in family training, to help parents improve the social and emotional control skills of ASD children.","Huang, Sun, Zhu, Song, Zhang, Huang, Chen, Peng, Zhao, Yu, Jing","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S293426","20210311","ASD; COVID-19; China; behavior; child; rehabilitation training","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-12","",11815,""

We performed a cross-sectional study involving nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°296 married women. We used the Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), Marital Satisfaction Scale (MSS), Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and coronary disease anxiety questionnaire, as determinants of QoL for data collection. Data were analyzed using the Pearson correlation coefficient and path analysis. There was a relationship between the components of QoL with SF, anxiety, depression, MS, general health, and contamination obsessions. The results of path analysis also showed that that SF, MS, anxiety, general health, and corona-related anxiety have a direct effect on women's QoL. General health has a more direct effect on QoL. The results of this study could help in a plan to improve the QoL of women during the coronavirus epidemic.","Daneshfar, Jahanian Sadatmahalleh, Youseflu, Bahri Khomami, Kazemnejad","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12905-020-01114-2","20210311","COVID-19; Married women; Path analysis; Quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-12","",11816,""
"Students' attitude and sleep pattern during school closure following COVID-19 pandemic quarantine: a web-based survey in south of Iran","School closure is one of the main policies of global health care strategies performed worldwide. Despite all benefits, there might be some threats for younger groups spending their time in quarantine. This study aims to determine the impacts of lockdown and school closure on children's major lifestyle aspects, especially their leisure and sleep pattern during the COVID-19 pandemic. For the purpose of this study, an online questionnaire was distributed from 14th to 31st of March 2020 among the schools and students from the first grade to the 12th grade (before university) in Fars province, southern Iran. The questionnaire consisted of five sections which included data regarding the students' general information, activity priorities, adherence to quarantine, attitude toward school closure, and sleep patterns. In our study, 20,697 filled questionnaires were received from the participants with an average age of 13.76 years; 29.7% of them were male, 80.6% were from urban areas, and 83.3% were from public schools. The overall first preference of students during school closure was mobile and computer games (30.1%), followed by studying (26.6%) and watching television (13.8%). Our results demonstrated that the majority of students adhered to social distancing and there was also a significant correlation among education levels and desire for schools to be closed till the end of the semester (P = 0.015). Also, regarding sleep patterns, the majority (53.5%) had above 12 h of sleep throughout the day. It seems that lockdown following COVID-19 pandemic has changed various aspects of the students' lifestyle remarkably, especially by increasing screen time and even sleep duration and pattern. We believe that certain strategies should be implemented by the Health and Educational Ministry to control not only the visible side effects of the quarantine period, but also the collateral consequences on their psychological and mental health.","Ranjbar, Hosseinpour, Shahriarirad, Ghaem, Jafari, Rahimi, Mirahmadizadeh, Hosseinpour","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12199-021-00950-4","20210311","Activities; Attitude; COVID-19; Education; Pandemic; School; Sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-12","",11817,""
"How has COVID-19 affected mental health nurses and the delivery of mental health nursing care in the UK? Results of a mixed-methods study","WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been research considering the impact on medical healthcare professionals and the mental health needs of the general population. However, limited focus has been placed on mental health services or mental health staff providing care in the community and in hospitals. While nurses make up the largest section of the mental health workforce in the UK, the impact that this pandemic has had on their work has been largely ignored. WHAT THE PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: This paper provides a unique insight into the experiences and impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on mental health nurses across a range of community and inpatient settings to understand what has changed in their work and the care they can and do provide during this crisis. This includes exploring how services have changed, the move to remote working, the impact of the protective equipment crisis on nurses and the difficult working conditions facing those in inpatient settings where there is minimal guidance provided. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: By understanding the impact the pandemic has had on mental health nursing care, we can understand the gaps in guidance that exist, the challenges being faced and the impact the crisis has had on care for mental health service users. By doing so, we can plan for the ongoing nature of this pandemic and the aftermath that the crisis may leave for our service users and workforce alike. ABSTRACT: Introduction While evidence has emerged concerning the impact of COVID-19 on the general population and the challenges facing health services, much less is known regarding how the pandemic has directly affected the delivery of mental health nursing care. Aim This paper aimed to explore how COVID-19 has affected the ability of mental health nurses to deliver care in community and inpatient mental health services in the UK. Method We investigated staff reports regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental healthcare and mental health service users in the UK, using a mixed-methods online survey. A total of 897 nurses across a range of inpatient and community settings participated. Discussion Key themes within the data explore the following: new ways of working; remote working; risks of infection/infection control challenges; and the impact on service users. Targeted guidelines are required to support mental health nurses providing care and support during a pandemic to people in severe mental distress, often in unsuitable environments. Implications for Practice Service developments need to occur alongside tailored guidance and support for staff welfare supported by clear leadership. These findings identify areas requiring attention and investment to prepare for future crises and the consequences of the pandemic.","Foye, Dalton-Locke, Harju-SeppÃƒÂ¤nen, Lane, Beames, Vera San Juan, Johnson, Simpson","https://doi.org/10.1111/jpm.12745","20210311","COVID-19; community mental health care; infection control; inpatient mental health care; mental health nursing; psychiatry; remote working","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-12","",11818,""

"State anhedonia in young healthy adults: psychometric properties of the German Dimensional Anhedonia Rating Scale (DARS) and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic","Healthy reward processing is a complex interplay of several components. Recent self-report measures of anhedonia, the decrease or loss of hedonic capacity, take this complexity into account. The Dimensional Anhedonia Rating Scale (DARS) measures interest, motivation, effort and consummatory pleasure across four domains: hobbies, food/drink, social activities and sensory experiences. In the present cross-sectional survey study, we validated the German version of the DARS in a sample of 557 young healthy adults. Factor structure as well as convergent and divergent validity were assessed. As a secondary aim, we examined the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on state anhedonia and depression severity. Our results suggest good convergent and divergent validity and high internal consistency of the German DARS. The original differentiation of four factors mapping onto the four domains was confirmed. We conclude that the DARS is a valid instrument to comprehensively assess state anhedonia in German samples. Future studies should further assess the utility of the German DARS in clinical contexts. In line with many previous reports, there were significantly higher levels of depressive symptoms during the pandemic. We found no indication that the COVID-19 pandemic affected state hedonic capacity.","Sarah Aline Wellan et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46054-601-4B1","20210312","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Assessment; self-report; pleasure; depression; validity; factor analysis; reliability; mental health","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-12","",11821,""
