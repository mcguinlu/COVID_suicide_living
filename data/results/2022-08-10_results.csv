"Understanding the biological basis of behavior: Developing evidence-based interventions for clinical, counseling and school psychologists","This book is an introduction to the biological basis of behavior, broadly defined, with practical applications for higher education programs that focus on advances in neuroscience. It has a special focus on training practitioners based on American Psychological Association (APA) health service psychology guidelines. It reviews and digests information for clinical, counseling, and school psychologists serving clients of all ages in a variety of settings, such as schools, hospitals, and clinics. Content for all developmental stages, including birth to geriatric practices are highlighted. This book will help health service psychologists and counselors to meet the needs of an increasingly diverse population by providing cutting-edge, evidence-based, ecologically valid neuropsychological interventions currently lacking within the field. Cultural considerations are provided within each chapter, which is especially important given societal inequity that continues to persist within our world. Implications for the COVID-19 pandemic are also discussed in light of neuroscientific advances in medicine.

"Are we starting to 'think family'? Evidence from a case file audit of parents and children supported by mental health, addictions and children's services","The Health and Social Care Board in Northern Ireland commissioned an audit of social work case files from across service teams to establish whether Think Family Northern Ireland (Think Family NI) and FFP have become embedded across three different services (Community Mental Health Teams (CMHTs), and addictions and children's services). The audit sought to: identify the extent to which these services co-worked to support families;highlight good practice;and identify areas for improvement. A random sample of files was selected from the three services in four of the five Health and Social Care Trusts, the main statutory provider of services in Northern Ireland. Data were collected from 108 case files. The COVID-19 lockdown ended fieldwork prematurely and electronic data from some files were unavailable (n = 12). Of the 103 families in the final sample, the mother was the primary focus in 85% of cases and, in total, parents had caring responsibilities for 258 children, the majority of whom were aged under 16 years. Joint planning was only evident in 18.5% of cases.

"Experiences with online video conferencing therapy among former military service members with PTSD","Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has become a major mental health concern for veterans transitioning to civilian life. This qualitative phenomenological research study focused on interviewing 20 former military service members diagnosed with PTSD to understand their experiences related to online video conferencing therapy. The theoretical foundation of this study was guided by Beck's cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) model. The open-ended research questions examined veterans diagnosed with PTSD perceptions, attitudes, and opinions related to online video conferencing therapy, prior to and during the Covid-19 pandemic. Semi structured interview questions and a demographic questionnaire was used to collect data from participants who had no current relationship with National Guard, reserve, or active-duty military service. NVivo software was used to develop themes regarding the participant's lived experiences related to PTSD and online video conferencing therapy such as: (a) experiences suffering from PTSD, (b) Covid-19's impact on finding mental health treatment, (c) experiences and benefits using online video conferencing therapy, (d) challenges with online video conferencing therapy, and (e) ways that online video conferencing therapy improved PTSD. The findings revealed that online video conferencing therapy improved accessibility to mental health treatment for veterans diagnosed with PTSD who live in rural areas that lack mental health providers giving them therapeutic options such as behavioral strategies, social support, counseling, and medication management, prior to and during the Covid-19 pandemic. The results may provide information for veterans diagnosed with PTSD that may improve their transition to civilian life.

"Creating Space for Emotion in the Composition Studies Archive","Writing teachers and administrators across the country have attempted to create a community of support for our students and ourselves as we've faced a terrifying global pandemic, a hotly contested presidential election, as well as injustices, violence, and protests related to race, gender, sexuality, and gender expression. The emotional toll the past two years have had on us and our students is evidenced by articles in the Chronicle of Higher Education and Inside Higher Ed such as ""Covid-19 Has Worsened the Student Mental-Health Crisis"" (Brown and Kafka),""Faculty Members are Suffering Burnout"" (Pettit), ""How to Manage through Emotional Exhaustion"" (O'Grady), ""Academe, Hear Me. I Am Crying Uncle"" (Anonymous), and ""Honoring Ourselves and Each Other Through Burnout"" (Godbee). [...]here, we spotlight just a few articles from the Composition Studies archive that make space for us to engage with emotion, and we track lines of conversation within the journal that fortify our convic- tion that attention to emotion must be a critical part of writing, teaching, and administration, especially now.

"Barriers to college completion: Black and Latinx undergraduate students","Black and Latinx four-year college graduation rates remain low, per the research, which corresponds to 45.9 percent for Blacks and 55 percent for Latinx, but when compared to White and Asian four-year college students, these rates are 71.7 percent for Asians, and 67.2 percent for Whites (Shapiro et al., 2017). This descriptive qualitative research study using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA), was created to better describe and understand the psychological needs of this marginalized group to provide relevant solutions to college attainment. Due to the COVID-19 recommended safety precautions, this qualitative study was conducted through the video platform Zoom utilizing a convenience sample of eight participants(four Black;four Latinx) located in Los Angeles County, within the state of California. The data was collected through semi-structured interviews that used open-ended questions. During the interviews, significant themes indicated that barriers to college completion included untreated mental health issues, no clinicians of color on campus, financial hardships, no social support, or college administrative support, and experiencing microaggressions that affected mental health. This dissertation assisted in explaining the significant barriers to college completion for this population. Data from the interviews provided recommendations for doctoral-level psychologists, and all other behavioral health professionals, as well as college and university staff. The data backed implications for professional practice in psychology, and how Black and Latinx college students can be supported emotionally to help reduce their dropout rates. These findings are important in understanding that there are many factors beyond academic readiness that contributes to college dropout.

"An exploration of leadership practices in the implementation of mental health supports during the COVID-19 pandemic","The purpose of this phenomenological qualitative study is to explore the leadership practices of school superintendents in the planning and implementation of mental health supports before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The population for this study included school superintendents in New York State. Participants were identified based on the New York State Education Department Basic Educational Data System (NYSED BEDS) enrollment data. New York City (NYC) schools were excluded due to the difference in their governance structure as compared to the rest of New York State (New York City Schools Guidebook, 2020). Criteria were narrowed to the largest 10% of the school districts in New York State, excluding New York City, based on an enrollment list available on the New York State Education Department (NYSED, 2020) website. The enrollment size for districts meeting this criterion had 5,000 or more students. In addition to size, each school district can be categorized as an urban or suburban school district (NYSED, 2020). As a result, 74 school superintendents across New York State were invited to participate in this study. Ten agreed to be interviewed.Findings revealed that prior to the pandemic, district superintendents utilized their staff in the planning and implementation of mental health services and embedded social-emotional learning programs in their classrooms to promote positive mental health. During the pandemic, district leaders identified student disengagement as an indicator of mental health concerns. They also redeployed their supports to accommodate families to include food and technology needs.

"Editorial: Further evidence that projective techniques continue as popular clinical assessment tools in practice settings","Despite continuing criticism regarding the psychometric credibility of projective techniques, evident in the scholarly literature (e.g., Imuta et al., 2013;Lawrence et al., 2021;Ryan et al., 2019), mounting recent evidence indicates that projective tests are considered an integral part of acceptable methods used or applied in research studies (Eby, 2020;Piotrowski, 2022). Perhaps reflecting the acceptability and relevance of projective assessment, chapter coverage in recent texts on psychological assessment clearly depicts the importance of projective techniques in clinical and child psychology applied to the mental health evaluation process (Saklofske et al., 2013;Sellbom & Suhr, 2020;Verdon & Azoulay, 2020;Weiner & Kleiger, 2021;Wright, 2020;Yalof & Bram, 2021). All this bodes-well for research, but what about the status of projective testing in practice/applied settings, particularly as a foundation for forming a conceptual therapeutic framework in mental health treatment? Hence, the purpose of this commentary is to address this specific issue by examining recent test usage findings, based on empirical data, as reported by practitioners. Of particular interest are the findings of 2 recent dissertations regarding the use of projective tests by practicing psychologists. The first study surveyed a sample of 510 members of APA Division 12 (both clinical child and pediatric psychologists) on the use of drawings (H-T-P, DAP, KFDs) in assessment (Longest, 2006). The most interesting observation is that 25% of the practitioners responded to the survey. Such attention to drawings in clinical practice shows a continued professional interest in projective assessment (see Piotrowski, 2016). More recent data on the use of a variety of projective techniques by psychologists were reported in a dissertation on current assessment practices in the context as an aid in therapy (Hanigan, 2021). This study surveyed licensed psychologists in practice across a myriad of applied settings in the USA. Of the 293 respondents, 29% were engaged in assessment for 20+ hours/per week (this is a slight increase from survey data reported over the past 2 decades). In addition, 55% of these practitioners use at least one projective technique (45% don't use any projective measures). Overall, the continued presence of projective measures in the research literature, the introduction of a host of novel projective techniques in recent years, and contemporary survey data on test usage clearly confirm the fact that projective techniques remain a significant part of the assessment armamentarium of mental health professionals. The current pandemic has had a very detrimental impact on the assessment enterprise (Gicas et al., 2021;Krach et al., 2020), particularly with regard to the use of the Rorschach. This disengagement of personality assessment practice has been corroborated in an analysis of the recent mental health literature related to COVID-19 (Piotrowski & Watt, 2021).Hence, we must await the findings of future studies (post-COVID) before an accurate appraisal on the nature and extent of psychological testing (particularly projective techniques) can be determined (Krishnamurthy et al., 2022). But, for now, projective assessment appears alive and (somewhat well) in the field of mental health evaluation.

"Psychological and developmental concerns in child and adolescent athletes","The worldwide appeal of sports-whether soccer, the NFL, tennis, street basketball, skiing, pickup stickball, curling, etc.-has never been clearer since the interruption of sports during the COVID-19 pandemic. People were willing to make tremendous accommodations and endure heightened risk to play or watch sports. Across local communities, parents encourage their children to get involved in organized sports, and coaches see sports as a great vehicle for youth development or, at times, furthering their own prominence. For a variety of reasons, youth sport has become an arena for pressured performance, leading to or exacerbating mental health problems in child and adolescent ""athletes."" In this chapter, with coaches as our particular audience because of their critical role, we focus primarily on sport-related anxiety, depression, disordered eating, and substance misuse. We review the range of symptoms and experiences that fall under each of these categories and consider how they present in childhood and adolescence. We want coaches (and other caregivers) to confidently identify early signs of dysfunction, sensitively and competently broach the subject with all involved, and refer youth athletes to appropriate mental health services as needed, thereby serving as catalysts for mental health.

"Prevalence of depression and its related factors during the COVID-19 quarantine among the elderly in Iran","Objectives: The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to its rapid transmission has created an emergency situation in global health in less than a few months around the world. This disease not only causes public health concerns but also causes a number of psychological illnesses including depression. The present study aims to investigate the prevalence of depression during the COVID-19 quarantine among the elderly in Iran. Methods & Materials: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted on 432 eligible older adults living in Gonabad city who were selected by cluster random sampling method. Data were collected by a demographic checklist and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) which were completed via phone. Collected data were analyzed in SPSS software using descriptive and inferential statistics, considering a significance level of P &lt; 0.05. Results: The prevalence of depression was 55.8% which had a statistically significant relationship with marital status (P &lt; 0.001), living status (P &lt; 0.001), economic status (P &lt; 0.001), family history of depression (P &lt; 0.001), history of chronic disease (P &lt; 0.003), level of education (P &lt; 0.001), and sleep quality (P &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Depression has a high prevalence among the elderly in Gonabad city during the COVID-19 quarantine. In this regard, related interventions for this group should be considered in the plans of health care providers.

"The COVID-19 inequidemic: Disparities in school-based telehealth services","The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most unique events in world history as it caused economic and social disruption, impacted the physical and mental health of individuals, and created new, and highlighted already existing, disparities. To minimize the spread of the infection, schools closed, which required daily tasks to continue through a virtual format. For potentially the first time and with little prior research, school-based professionals were instructed to provide mental and behavioral health services to students through online telehealth platforms. The researcher aimed to examine the extent to which school-based professionals were providing telehealth services to students along with the barriers that have presented to successful telehealth implementation and receipt. Specifically, the researcher was interested in how geographic location and socioeconomic status impacted effectiveness of telehealth services during school closure due to COVID-19. School psychologists, social workers, and counselors were surveyed on experiences with delivering these services, and parents and guardians were surveyed on their child's experience with receiving telehealth services. Quantitative data on current experiences were collected, and qualitative data on future recommendations for practice were analyzed. The findings suggest the lack of access to and consistently successful utilization of telehealth services for rural and lower socioeconomic communities. The findings further demonstrate the need for a systemic approach in successful virtual mental and behavioral health service delivery, which includes government funding, community-based partnerships, and collaboration among school- based providers and families. The data add to the current research literature regarding the potential limitations and successes of telehealth services in schools and areas of improvement that include professional developments and greater education, assistance, and resources for proper use.

"Virtual storytelling in a time of pandemic: building bridges across social distance","This community psychology project consisted of two virtual storytelling groups gathered to examine the impact of storytelling during a global pandemic. It used the public narrative methodology of Marshall Ganz placed within the context of community mental health. Each storytelling group met weekly for 8 weeks. The Sunday group had seven members drawn from Desert Palm UCC, a mid-sized Protestant Christian congregation located in Tempe, Arizona. The Monday group had four members from Desert Palm UCC and two participants from a housing program called I-Help. I-Help is a transitional housing program run by the Tempe Community Action Agency, a nonprofit social service organization connected to the City of Tempe. Desert Palm UCC has a long history of support and engagement with the I-Help program. The research project was intended to explore the impact of storytelling carried out virtually (on Zoom) during a time of social distancing that was a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Five factors related to personal recovery and included in the I-Help community mental health recovery program were employed to help organize the material thematically. The acronym for the five factors is CHIME, which stands for connectedness, hope, identity, meaning, and empowerment. In the final session participants were invited to reflect on whether the stories they shared had any common themes, and whether they resonated thematically with any of the CHIME components. Participants identified several common themes, including connectedness. Several participants reported feeling more connected to other group members as a result of the storytelling experience.

"The perceptions of academically underachieving, gifted, elite male athletes: A grid and group interpretation","This qualitative case study examines the perceptions of three elite collegiate athletes and compares their parallel journeys through the school system and their sports programs. Douglas' (1982) theoretical framework is used to identify characteristics in each of the four social relations: fatalist, hierarchical, individualist, and egalitarian. Three research questions were developed to better understand the circumstances and motivation that produce students that underperformed in the classroom and excelled on the practice field. These questions are: how do academically underachieving, gifted, elite male athletes identify on the grid group map in terms of their experiences in the classroom and the practice field;how do academically underachieving, gifted, elite male athletes perceive an ideal culture within a classroom and practice field;and what are the perceived differences between what academically underachieving, gifted, elite male athletes are experiencing versus their imagined culture of an ideal situation? This study used Douglas' (1982) grid and group topology as a map to analyze hundreds of pages of narratives and survey data. This four-phase study was completed October 2020 (in the year of Covid-19). Narrative data from three male participants consisted of 60 volgs, a focus group, 60 surveys, and multiple individual interviews. Criteria for acceptance into the study was being male, having a high school grade point average of less than 2.3, having a standardized test score in the top 20%, being actively recruited by an NCAA Division I team, and currently playing a sport in college. Three culturally diverse players, from a Midwest community college baseball team, participated in this study. Findings from the study indicated that over time, all three participants passed in-and-out through all of Douglas' four social relations. In the school setting, lack of control, mistrust of the teacher, and overt teacher prejudices drew the participants into a fatalistic relation with the teacher and the school system. On the practice field, the hopelessness of the fatalist relation was mostly non-existent. The participants thrived in the individualistic and hierarchical relations, taking responsibility for their actions and coming together as a team for a collaborative purpose. Overall, the participants would like the school culture to mirror the athletic culture regarding choice and trust. One of their needs for both the classroom and the practice field was to have an open, fear-free space to learn from the teacher or coach, and also to learn from each other. One implication for a sports related practice includes a tool used to determine a coaches' ability to be humble and to accurately assess the effectiveness of their own coaching skills;determine the degree with which they receive and reflect on criticism;and their ability to trust in the players' agency to cultivate and make other players better. Another implication of the study is a ""modern day"" study table developed by and for student-athletes. Further implications in the classroom are for school leaders and teachers to use a form of Harris' (2005) grid and group protocols and key strategies to understand which social relation their school culture identifies with and to reflect on how the fatalist social relation corrupts the system. Lastly, the need for local school districts to understand that gifted programming is an overall engagement tool, not an add-on but a needed component woven within the current curriculum. Leaders at all levels should promote funding from the local, state, and federal levels.

"A Qualitative-Quantitative Analysis Of The Psychological Impact Of Coronavirus (Covid-19) Pandemic On The Healthcare Professionals","COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as a global health emergency. It poses a serious challenge to healthcare professionals since they provide healthcare facilities to affected population in extremely stressful circumstances, which may affect their psychological wellbeing. Keeping this in mind, this study was conducted to understand the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare professionals. Following PRISMA protocol, all research papers published between January 2020 and May 2020 were searched in databases like, e.g., Pub-Med, Science Direct and Google-Scholar databases. After screening through proper inclusion criteria, only 26 studies were finally selected for detailed analysis. Results revealed that healthcare professionals suffered from a variety of psychological disorders, particularly from depression, anxiety, and sleep problems. There were also different predisposing factors that have increased the risk of such adverse psychological symptoms among healthcare professionals. And to deal with such symptoms, the healthcare professionals had adopted different coping strategies. The review concludes that COVID-19 pandemic has a severe impact on the psychological well-being of healthcare professionals, therefore, a broad range of interventions are required for mitigating adverse psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic among healthcare professionals.","Khan, Anwar, Anwar, Muhammad, Awais, Muhammad, Ullah, Mati, Ahmad, Sajjad, Khan, Muhammad Saqib","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+Qualitative-Quantitative+Analysis+Of+The+Psychological+Impact+Of+Coronavirus+(Covid-19)+Pandemic+On+The+Healthcare+Professionals","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Webology; 19(2):8957-8980, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-10","",35843,""
"Gender differences in depression, anxiety, stress and sleep disturbances among doctors combating COVID-19","COVID-19 has caused havoc in the lives of doctors. The doctors were faced with the Herculean task of managing a variety of patients, dealing with the queries of their loved ones, keeping up with the ever-changing guidelines, while balancing the worries of their own families, and facing the risk of contracting the infection themselves or transmitting it to their loved ones. Bearing this in mind, the present study was undertaken to assess the impact of gender in causing depression, anxiety, stress, and sleep disturbances between male and female doctors during COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional, analytical, web-based study was conducted during September 2020, after obtaining approval of Institutional Ethics Committee. All participants gave informed consent. The participants completed basic socio demographic questionnaire, and two standardized questionnaires-Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21 (DASS21) and Athens Insomnia Scale. Out of 143 doctors included in the study, 83 were females (58.04%), while 60 were males (41.96%). On DASS-21, depression and stress was significantly higher in female doctors as compared to male doctors. On the Athens Insomnia Scale, more female doctors suffered from insomnia as compared to male doctors, but the difference was not statistically significant. Female doctors have significantly higher depression and stress while dealing with COVID-19 compared to male doctors.

"Notes from the Field: Mental Health Trainees and Families Adapt to Virtual Platforms for Sibling Support During COVID-19","Before COVID-19, the Sibling Support Program: A Family-Centered Mental Health Initiative (SSP) provided a training opportunity for mental health trainees to facilitate support groups for siblings of youth with psychiatric needs with the goal of reducing trauma and building resiliency among siblings. As part of the SSP, caregivers also joined psychoeducational groups led by parent mentors with the goal of increasing parental competency and confidence. The SSP groups were offered in-person for these family members at partnering hospitals and clinics in Massachusetts. With the arrival of COVID-19, the SSP director reconfigured the program as an online offering for trainees and family members using Zoom and Google Meet. Specific aspects of training were adapted to meet the trainees' needs, including a new and virtual orientation tool, as well as a ""debrief"" style of supervision that was accessed online. Trainees demonstrated flexibility and creativity in their approach to facilitating sibling support groups on virtual platforms and learned that family communication, privacy issues, program accessibility, and participant geographics all impact the group experience. At a time when it is unsafe to meet in person, virtual support groups provide valuable learning opportunities for mental health trainees and critical assistance for families of youth struggling with mental health issues.","Haines, Catherine C.

"Digital behaviors of older adults: An examination of social media characteristics, social support, and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic","The population of the United States is aging. Depression in older adults has serious consequences. Social support has long been recognized as a beneficial and protective factor in the prevention of depression in older adults. Social media have allowed older adults to connect with their social networks and social support systems. The use of social media was highlighted during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic as social distancing and self-quarantine discouraged face-to-face interactions. While social media behaviors and their influence on mental health is a growing area of research, the digital behaviors of an aging population specific to the relationship between their social media behavior, social network structures, social support, and depression under the context of the Coronavirus pandemic of 2019 (COVID-19) is understudied. This dissertation's overall purpose is to explore the relationship between social media use, social support, and depression in older adults. The First Manuscript is a review of the literature aimed at identifying and synthesizing quantitative studies addressing the relationship between social media use and depression in older adults. The findings of this review showed a dearth of literature and a complicated relationship between social media use and depression in older adults. Furthermore, there is a paucity of studies that use validated measures to measure social media use in the older adult population. Age-related health and social variables could potentially influence the relationship between social media use and depression. Further, studies of current social media use measurements in older adults omit descriptions of social network characteristics to include social network structure and function. The Second Manuscript is a cross-sectional study of 371 older adults. Using multiple mediation models, this study examines the mediating effect of social support in the relationship of social network structures (online and offline) and depression in older adults. This study found that social support does not significantly mediate the relationship between online social network structure and depression. However, social support mediated the relationship between offline social network structure and depression to some extent. The tangible and emotional/informational social support domains did not mediate the known relationship between network structure and depression in older adults. Both structural sizes of online and offline social network size did not show any significant relationship to depression. The size of the offline social network, not the online social network size, predicted higher levels of social support. Higher total social support scores predicted lower depression scores in both online and offline network size models. Online and offline social network size models showed that increased social support predicts lower depression scores on all social support scales except the emotional/informational subscale. Certain domains of social support did not mediate the known relationship between offline social network structure and depression in older adults in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Third Manuscript examined the mediating effect of social support in the relationship between social media use and depression in older adults, using the Social Media Use Integration Scale. This study showed that social support did not significantly mediate the relationship between social media use and depression in older adults in models that controlled for demographic and health covariates. Greater social media use significantly predicted higher depression scores in older adults when including only basic demographic covariates (beta = .070, se = .333, p = .037).

"Online teachers who practice positive psychology: A hermeneutic phenomenological study of foreign-born online teachers' experiences in lifelong learning","Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and digital transformation have significantly changed how people learn (Calvo & Peters, 2014;Riva et al., 2016). The COVID-19 pandemic precipitated a sudden transition in the teaching and learning community, necessitating a shift from face-to-face or blended learning environments to online or distance education. The drastic change challenged people's mental health, well-being, and coping mechanisms. Given the possibilities that technology can offer in this context, studying human flourishing in education has become imperative. Among the over eight million teachers in the U.S, approximately 287,600 of educators in postsecondary institutions were born outside of the U.S. (Furuya et al., 2019). Yet this marginalized population remains under-researched. This study attempts to incorporate constructs from ontological and epistemological concepts in psychology to understand the experiences of foreign-born educators who practice positive psychology while teaching online courses. This dissertation utilizes hermeneutic phenomenology to examine the lived experiences of eight foreign-born instructors, guided by the research question: what is it like to experience transcendence and transformation for foreign-born online teachers who practice positive psychology? Four themes emerged from the findings on lived experience: (1) understanding optimism and resilience as strength, (2) meeting challenges and opportunities when in collaboration with others, (3) being flexible and adaptable to technological changes, and (4) seeking sustained opportunity for self-improvement. The findings provided insights into the challenges and triumphs of online education and may energize future strength-based and growth-oriented positive technology research.

"Death and resistance: Professionals on the front line against COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has intensely affected the quality of life and labor conditions of healthcare workers (HCWs). This study sought to understand the experiences of 16 professionals in medicine, nursing and physical therapy who work on the ""frontline"" of the new Coronavirus. A phenomenological design was used. Results were organized into four axes: (a) the impact of the arrival of the pandemic;(b) participants' progressive exhaustion;(c) fear and coping;and (d) rethinking life and death. Experiences of anguish, anxiety, depression, and physical and psychological health problems stand out. It was possible to observe that the lack of national coordination, in addition to unscientific political positions, were felt as an aggravating factor for work demands, and that impotence in the face of the disease implicated in rethinking the meaning of life and death. According to the JD-R model, the need to expand resources and emotional support so HCWs can properly manage psychosocial risk factors at work is evident.

"Consumo de drogas drogas legales e ilegales y sÃ­ntomas de depresiÃ³n en adultos mayores usuarios de Facebook durante la pandemia por SARS-Cov2 en MÃ©xico Consumption of legal and illegal drugs and depressive symptoms in older adults during the SARS-Cov2 pandemic in Mexico","Antecedentes: Los riesgos para la salud que enfrentan los adultos mayores son diversos;sin embargo, poco se ha explorado acerca del uso y abuso de sustancias psicoactivas en esta poblaciÃ³n. La reclusiÃ³n impuesta por la situaciÃ³n que prevalece debido al SARS-Cov2 ha incrementado los sentimientos de soledad, aislamiento y tristeza asociados a esta edad, que los convierte en un factor de riesgo para el consumo de drogas. Objetivo: Analizar el consumo de drogas legales e ilegales en el personas mayores de 60 aÃ±os usuarios de Facebook y su relaciÃ³n con sÃ­ntomas de depresiÃ³n durante la pandemia por SARS-Cov2. Material y mÃ©todos: Estudio realizado a 380 personas mayores, usuarios de Facebook, que respondieron un cuestionario publicado en lÃ­nea, que indagÃ³ sobre: datos sociodemogrÃ¡ficos, frecuencia y cantidad de consumo de drogas legales e ilegales y sintomatologÃ­a depresiva. Resultados: 50.26% fueron mujeres;la edad promedio fue de 66.79 aÃ±os (DS=5.81);31.05% consumieron alcohol en los Ãºltimos 30 dÃ­as, 22.63% tabaco, tranquilizantes sin prescripciÃ³n mÃ©dica 16.05% y mariguana 7.89%. El consumo de otras drogas ilegales no superaron al 2.6% de la poblaciÃ³n.

However, little is known about the psychological sequelae of patients hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Objective: This study aims to assess the prevalence of anxietyâ€“depressive symptoms, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and post-traumatic growth among patients hospitalized for COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic 6 months after discharge, and to identify sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with psychological outcomes. Method: This cross-sectional cohort study enrolled recovered COVID-19 patients during a multidisciplinary follow-up screening. At 6 months post-discharge, participants underwent a remote assessment with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview Plus and completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, and Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory. Descriptive and regression analyses were conducted. Results: The sample was composed of 100 patients, mainly males (72%), with a mean Â± SD age of 58.7 Â± 11.8 years. Regarding psychological symptoms, 34% and 24% of patients, respectively, reported anxiety and depression over the clinical threshold, and 20% met the criteria for a possible PTSD diagnosis. Psychological symptoms were associated with the presence of a mood disorder in the patientâ€™s clinical history and having received a psychological consultation after discharge. Post-traumatic growth was associated with younger age and having received a psychological consultation after discharge. Conclusions: A high prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms, potentially indicative for a mood or anxiety disorder, and PTSD was confirmed among COVID-19 survivors after 6 months. Anxiety and depressive symptoms and PTSD were associated with a previous diagnosis of a mood disorder and having received psychological consultation. Post-traumatic growth was associated with younger age and having received psychological consultation. Tailored psychological interventions could help to elaborate the psychological suffering and foster post-traumatic growth after a traumatic experience such as COVID-19 hospitalization. HIGHLIGHTS A high prevalence of psychological symptoms has been observed among COVID-19 survivors 6 months after hospitalization. Tailored psychological interventions could help to contain the psychological sequelae and facilitate post-traumatic growth.","Bonazza, Federica, Luridiana Battistini, Chiara, Fior, Giulia, Bergamelli, Emilio, Wiedenmann, Federico, Dâ€™Agostino, Armando, Sferrazza Papa, Giuseppe Francesco, Borghi, Lidia, Piscopo, Kyrie, Vegni, Elena, Lamiani, Giulia","https://www.google.com/search?q=Recovering+from+COVID-19:+psychological+sequelae+and+post-traumatic+growth+six+months+after+discharge+SÃ­ndrome+post-COVID:+secuelas+psicolÃ³gicas+y+crecimiento+postraumÃ¡tico+a+los+6+meses+del+alta+COVID+<U+540E><U+7EFC><U+5408><U+5F81>:<U+51FA><U+9662><U+540E>6<U+4E2A><U+6708><U+7684><U+5FC3><U+7406><U+540E><U+9057><U+75C7><U+548C><U+521B><U+4F24><U+540E><U+6210><U+957F>","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of psychotraumatology; 13(1), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-10","",35853,""

"Stressors, manifestations and course of COVID-19 related distress among public sector nurses and midwives during the COVID-19 pandemic first year in Tasmania, Australia","Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of healthcare workers has been established, linking workplace factors with high levels of stress, anxiety, depression, insomnia and burnout. Less established is how COVID-19 affects both work, home and social life of nurses and midwives concurrently. This study describes the prevalence and severity of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and insomnia and examines their associations with stressors within the work, home and social environment, among nurses and midwives. A longitudinal, mixed-methods, online survey explored the psychological health of public sector nurses and midwives during the COVID-19 pandemic first year. Surveys were conducted in April (initial) and June 2020 (3-month), and April 2021 (12-month) and consisted of psychological tests including the Patient Health Questionnaire, General Anxiety Disorder, Insomnia Severity Index, and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised; workplace and lifestyle questions, together with free-text comments. The relative strengths of the associations between predictor and outcome variables were estimated using repeated measures ordered logistic regression, and free text responses were themed. Data show diagnostic levels of anxiety (23%, 18%, 21%) at surveys one, two and three respectively, depression (26%, 23% and 28%), PTSD (16%, 12% and 10%) and insomnia (19%, 19% and 21%). The strongest predictors of psychological distress were current home and family stress and poor clinical team support. Factors which will help preserve the mental health of nurses and midwives include strong workplace culture, reducing occupational risk, clear communication processes, and supporting stable and functional relationships at home. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the visibility of mental distress on nurses and midwives and established they are pivotal to healthcare. The health service has a duty-of-care for the welfare of nurses and midwives who have entered this psychologically taxing profession to future proof service delivery and safeguard its service-response capacity.","Marsden, Robertson, Porter","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0271824","20220809","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-10","",35859,""

"Executive summary of the Merck Animal Health Veterinarian Wellbeing Study III and Veterinary Support Staff Study","Merck Animal Health Veterinarian Wellbeing Study III was conducted to continue to monitor mental health and well being within the veterinary profession in the US and to identify factors associated with high levels of wellbeing and lack of serious psychological distress. A questionnaire consisting of several instruments and questions for measurement of mental health and wellbeing was completed by 2,495 veterinarians and 448 veterinary support staff. Results for veterinarians were weighted to the US AVMA membership. This study revealed that wellbeing and mental health of some veterinarians declined over the past 2 years, driven in part by the COVID-19 pandemic and extreme labor shortages. Burnout remained at a high level, but there was no increase in suicide ideation. A new companion survey of veterinary support staff demonstrated that staff scored lower in wellbeing and mental health, and higher in burnout than veterinarians. Importantly, these studies identified techniques that both individuals and employers may find useful in fostering wellbeing and good mental health. A healthy method for coping with stress and good work-life balance was important, as was engaging a financial adviser for those with student debt or other financial stresses. Employers should create safe environments where employees feel comfortable seeking help, reducing the stigma associated with mental health issues. In addition, employers can provide Employee Assistance Programs and health insurance that covers mental health treatment. Fostering a healthy work culture was also important, one with good communication, teamwork, trust, and adequate time allotted to provide quality patient care.","Volk, Schimmack, Strand, Reinhard, Vasconcelos, Hahn, Stiefelmeyer, Probyn-Smith","https://doi.org/10.2460/javma.22.03.0134","20220809","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-10","",35861,""
"Increased Online Aggression During COVID-19 Lockdowns: Two-Stage Study of Deep Text Mining and Difference-in-Differences Analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic caused a critical public health crisis worldwide, and policymakers are using lockdowns to control the virus. However, there has been a noticeable increase in aggressive social behaviors that threaten social stability. Lockdown measures might negatively affect mental health and lead to an increase in aggressive emotions. Discovering the relationship between lockdown and increased aggression is crucial for formulating appropriate policies that address these adverse societal effects. We applied natural language processing (NLP) technology to internet data, so as to investigate the social and emotional impacts of lockdowns. This research aimed to understand the relationship between lockdown and increased aggression using NLP technology to analyze the following 3 kinds of aggressive emotions: anger, offensive language, and hate speech, in spatiotemporal ranges of tweets in the United States. We conducted a longitudinal internet study of 11,455 Twitter users by analyzing aggressive emotions in 1,281,362 tweets they posted from 2019 to 2020. We selected 3 common aggressive emotions (anger, offensive language, and hate speech) on the internet as the subject of analysis. To detect the emotions in the tweets, we trained a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model to analyze the percentage of aggressive tweets in every state and every week. Then, we used the difference-in-differences estimation to measure the impact of lockdown status on increasing aggressive tweets. Since most other independent factors that might affect the results, such as seasonal and regional factors, have been ruled out by time and state fixed effects, a significant result in this difference-in-differences analysis can not only indicate a concrete positive correlation but also point to a causal relationship. In the first 6 months of lockdown in 2020, aggression levels in all users increased compared to the same period in 2019. Notably, users under lockdown demonstrated greater levels of aggression than those not under lockdown. Our difference-in-differences estimation discovered a statistically significant positive correlation between lockdown and increased aggression (anger: P=.002, offensive language: P&lt;.001, hate speech: P=.005). It can be inferred from such results that there exist causal relations. Understanding the relationship between lockdown and aggression can help policymakers address the personal and societal impacts of lockdown. Applying NLP technology and using big data on social media can provide crucial and timely information for this effort.","Hsu, Tsai","https://doi.org/10.2196/38776","20220809","COVID-19; Twitter; causal relationship; computer; content analysis; emotions; infodemiology; infoveillance; internet; lockdown; natural language processing; neural networks; online aggression; pandemic; sentiment analysis; social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-10","",35862,""
"Habilitative Teletherapy for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Survey of Parents","The purpose of this study was to investigate whether service losses during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic were associated with worsened parent mental health or child behavioral health among families of children with autism spectrum disorder and to identify factors associated with favorable parent appraisals of habilitative teletherapy (applied behavior analysis; speech, occupational, physical therapy) for their child. This web-based survey study was conducted from May to July 2021 with parents whose children were receiving habilitative therapy for autism from an integrated health system. A total of 322 parents responded to the survey (20% response rate). The outcome variables were pandemic-related parent mental health, pandemic-related child behavioral health, and appraisal of habilitative teletherapy. Predictors were COVID-19-related services changes in health care or child care, COVID-19 history (COVID-19 stress, testing positive for COVID-19), and child autism factors (autistic behaviors, caregiving strain). Loss of regular child care was associated with higher odds of worsened parent mental health (odds ratio [OR] = 2.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.5-4.8); higher levels of caregiving strain were associated with worsened child behavioral health (OR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.4-3.8). Higher levels of COVID-19 stress were associated with more favorable appraisals of telehealth (ÃŽÂ² = 0.4, p &lt; 0.01), whereas higher caregiving strain scores were associated with less favorable appraisals of telehealth (ÃŽÂ² = -0.2, p &lt; 0.01). During COVID-19, caregiving factors were associated with worsened parent mental health and worsened child behavioral health, and telehealth is not preferred by all families.

"Implementing telepsychiatry in an early psychosis service during COVID-19: Experiences of young people and clinicians and changes in service utilization","In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our early psychosis program rapidly transitioned to telepsychiatry. This study examined the change in health service utilization and experiences of young people and clinicians in response to the implementation of telepsychiatry. Mixed methodology and triangulation of evidence drawn from health service databases and survey data. Using a retrospective observational design, health service data from pre- (Time 1) and post-(Time 2) telepsychiatry periods were compared. Surveys were also conducted with representation from clinicians and young people. The number of appointments increased between Time 1 and 2, although this was accompanied by a near-doubling in missed appointments (8% to 13%). Young people had mixed views about telepsychiatry. While convenience was a frequently cited benefit, clients reported technological issues, isolation and lack of human connection. A preference for face-to-face appointments was linked to younger age and anxiety when using telepsychiatry. Clinicians reported improved workplace satisfaction and efficiency but noted some limitations in the use of telepsychiatry including difficulty interviewing and managing unwell clients remotely and called for greater skill development. The introduction of telepsychiatry in response to COVID-19 was associated with an increase in service activity; however, there was an increase missed appointments by young people. Although clinicians and clients reported positive experiences, telepsychiatry was not completely endorsed as a replacement for face-to-face interactions.","Randall, Raisin, Waters, Williams, Shymko, Davis","https://doi.org/10.1111/eip.13342","20220809","early psychosis; engagement; mental health; telepsychiatry; youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-10","",35864,""
"Understanding de novo onset of anxiety during COVID-19: Pre-pandemic socio-emotional functioning in vulnerable children","There is a need to understand and mitigate the psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic for children known to be vulnerable. Data from prior to the pandemic are required to provide robust assessments of the socio-emotional impacts of COVID-19 and identify those who are more vulnerable. This study capitalises on an ongoing UK study of primary school children (4-8Ã‚Â years) identified prior to the pandemic as ""at risk"" for mental health problems by teachers. We collected mental health and social-emotional functioning data prior to the pandemic (Time 1) and re-assessed this cohort (<i>N</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 143) via researcher-led videocalls during lockdown (Time 2, summer 2020) and post-lockdown, 12Ã‚Â months later (Time 3; summer 2021). Mental health problems, particularly clinically significant anxiety, increased from 34% to 43% during lockdown and to 48% post-lockdown. Parental mental health difficulties (anxiety and depression) were prevalent during lockdown (40%) but had decreased 1Ã‚Â year later (20%). Children who developed clinically significant anxiety during the pandemic had impaired socio-emotional functioning at Time 1 (i.e., impaired emotion recognition, low self-esteem and social problems) and a high proportion (44%) had no contact with any peers during lockdown, which may have contributed to their anxiety, especially their school anxiety. The pandemic appears to have exacerbated anxiety in already vulnerable children. A profile of socio-emotional problems identified a group of children who developed significant anxieties during the pandemic. These socio-emotional processes can be targeted for intervention to mitigate the negative mental health consequences of the pandemic and contribute to resilience in children.","Adegboye, Lennon, Batterbee, Thapar, Collishaw, Shelton, Langley, Hobson, Higgins, van Goozen","https://doi.org/10.1002/jcv2.12076","20220809","anxiety; emotion; peer relationships; resilience; selfÃ¢â‚¬Âesteem","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-10","",35865,""
"Dispositional causes of burnout, satisfaction, and performance through the fear of COVID-19 during times of pandemic","Rooted in research into personality, we propose that the Big Five traits would be related to fear of COVID-19 (FOC), which in turn would lead to heightened job burnout, reduced job satisfaction, and decreased performance. Utilizing a three-wave time-lagged design, we collected our data from employees working in the United States and Canada (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°300Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ãƒâ€”Ã¢â‚¬â€°3). We found good support for our hypotheses. Extraversion, neuroticism, and conscientiousness had significant direct effects on FOC. Fear of COVID-19 was positively related to job burnout and negatively related to job satisfaction and performance. Extraversion, neuroticism, and conscientiousness had significant indirect effects on burnout, job satisfaction, and job performance via FOC. Hence, this study identifies a key mechanism, an individual's worry about losing their valuable resources (e.g. their health, and that of their family members and friends, etc.), through which selected dimensions of personality might affect employees' work outcomes.

The purpose of this study is to explore questions related to how clients perceive VCP versus IP in terms of credibility and expectancy. Results from this investigation demonstrate that clients who participate in VCP, without first meeting their counselor in person, may initially question the credibility and effectiveness of VCP.

"The impact of COVID-19 lockdown on children's and adolescents' mental health in Greece","The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on children's and adolescents' mental health in Greece during the lockdown of spring 2020. A cross-sectional survey of 1232 Greek parents was conducted in spring 2020. 35.1% of parents reported that their children's psychological health was significantly affected. Parental unemployment, limited opportunity for tele-work and deteriorating psychological health, increased family conflicts and children's pre-existing physical health conditions were all significantly associated with mental health impact. Children and adolescents may experience adverse mental health effects due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Magklara, Lazaratou, Barbouni, Poulas, Farsalinos","https://doi.org/10.1111/chso.12605","20220809","COVIDÃ¢â‚¬Â19; adolescence; children; lockdown; mental health; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-10","",35869,""
"Online learning performance and engagement during the COVID-19 pandemic: Application of the dual-continua model of mental health","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an abrupt transition from face-to-face learning to online learning, which has also affected the mental health of college students. In this study, we examined the relationship between students' adjustment to online learning and their mental health by using the Dual-Continua Model. The model assumes that mental disorder and mental well-being are related yet distinct factors of mental health. For this purpose, 2,933 college students completed an online survey around the beginning of the Fall semester of 2020 (<i>N</i> = 1,724) and the Spring semester of 2021 (<i>N</i> = 1,209). We assessed participants' mental well-being, mental disorders, and academic distress by means of the online survey. In addition, we incorporated grades and log data accumulated in the Learning Management System (LMS) as objective learning indicators of academic achievement and engagement in online learning. Results revealed that two dimensions of mental health (i.e., mental well-being and mental disorder) were independently associated with all objective and subjective online learning indicators. Specifically, languishing (i.e., low levels of mental well-being) was negatively associated with student engagement derived from LMS log data and academic achievement and was positively associated with self-reported academic distress even after we controlled for the effects of mental disorder. In addition, mental disorder was negatively related to student engagement and academic achievement and was positively related to academic distress even after we controlled for the effects of mental well-being. These results remained notable even when we controlled for the effects of sociodemographic variables. Our findings imply that applying the Dual-Continua Model contributes to a better understanding of the relationship between college students' mental health and their adaptation to online learning. We suggest that it is imperative to implement university-wide interventions that promote mental well-being and alleviate psychological symptoms for students' successful adjustment to online learning.","Kim, Moon, Lee, Jeong, Lee, Ko","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.932777","20220809","academic achievement; academic distress; dual-continua model; learning management system; mental disorder; mental well-being; online learning; student engagement","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-10","",35870,""
"Workplace infection prevention control measures and work engagement during the COVID-19 pandemic among Japanese workers: A prospective cohort study","Our objective was to assess the effect of appropriate workplace IPC measures on employees' work engagement. It could be important to note how workplace infection prevention control (IPC) measures for COVID-19 contribute to positive mental health among workers. We hypothesized that if workplace IPC measures are adequately implemented, they would have a positive effect on employees' work engagement. We conducted an internet-based prospective cohort study from December 2020 (baseline) to December 2021 (follow-up after 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°year) using self-administered questionnaires. At baseline, 27036 workers completed the questionnaires, while 18Ã¢â‚¬â€°560 (68.7%) participated in the one-year follow-up. After excluding the 6578 participants who changed jobs or retired during the survey period, or telecommuted more than 4Ã¢â‚¬â€°days per week, 11Ã¢â‚¬â€°982 participants were analyzed. We asked participants about the implementation of workplace IPC measures at baseline and conducted a follow-up using a nine-item version of the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES-9). Four groups were created according to the number of workplace IPC measures implemented. The mean (SD) UWES-9 score of the ""0-2"" group was the lowest at 18.3 (13.2), while that of the ""8"" group was the highest at 22.6 (12.6). The scores of the ""3-5,"" ""6-7,"" and ""8"" groups were significantly higher than that of the ""0-2"" group (all, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). The p trend of the four groups was also significant (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). Promoting workplace IPC measures improves workers' work engagement, and a dose-response relationship exists between workplace IPC measures and work engagement.","Ikegami, Ando, Fujino, Eguchi, Muramatsu, Nagata, Tateishi, Tsuji, Ogami","https://doi.org/10.1002/1348-9585.12350","20220809","COVID-19; infection control measures; infection prevention; work engagement; workplace","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-10","",35871,""
"Validation of a COVID-19 mental health and wellness survey questionnaire","COVID-19 affected mental health and wellbeing. Research is needed to assess its impact using validated tools. The study assessed the content validity, reliability and dimensionality of a multidimensional tool for assessing the mental health and wellbeing of adults. An online questionnaire collected data in the second half of 2020 from adults in different countries. The questionnaire included nine sections assessing: COVID-19 experience and sociodemographic profile; health and memory; pandemic stress (pandemic stress index, PSI); financial and lifestyle impact; social support; post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); coping strategies; self-care and HIV profile over 57 questions. Content validity was assessed (content validity index, CVI) and participants evaluated the test-retest reliability (Kappa statistic and intra-class correlation coefficient, ICC). Internal consistency of scales was assessed (Cronbach ÃŽÂ±). The dimensionality of the PSI sections and self-care strategies was assessed by multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) using all responses and SPSS. For qualitative validation, we used a semi-structured interview and NVivo was used for coding and thematic analysis. The overall CVIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.83 with lower values for the memory items. Cronbach ÃŽÂ± for the memory itemsÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.94 and ICCÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.71. Cronbach ÃŽÂ± for PTSD items was 0.93 and ICCÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.89. Test-retest scores varied by section. The 2-dimensions solution of MCA for the PSI behavior section explained 33.6% (precautionary measures dimension), 11.4% (response to impact dimension) and overall varianceÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°45%. The 2-dimensions of the PSI psychosocial impact explained 23.5% (psychosocial impact of the pandemic dimension), 8.3% (psychosocial impact of the precautionary measures of the pandemic dimension) and overall varianceÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°31.8%. The 2-dimensions of self-care explained 32.9% (dimension of self-care strategies by people who prefer to stay at home and avoid others), 9% (dimension of self-care strategies by outward-going people) and overall varianceÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°41.9%. Qualitative analysis showed that participants agreed that the multidimensional assessment assessed the effect of the pandemic and that it was better suited to the well-educated. The questionnaire has good content validity and can be used to assess the impact of the pandemic in cross-sectional studies especially as individual items. The PSI and self-care strategies need revision to ensure the inclusion of items with strong discrimination.","El Tantawi, Folayan, Nguyen, Aly, Ezechi, Uzochukwu, Alaba, Brown","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-13825-2","20220808","COVID-19; Multiple correspondence analysis; Questionnaire; Reliability; Stress; Validity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-10","",35872,""
"Efficacy and impact of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination on cancer treatment for breast cancer patients: a multi-center prospective observational study","Vaccination is an essential strategy to prevent infection in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. However, there are concerns about vaccine efficacy and the impact of vaccination on cancer treatment. Additionally, the emergence of novel variants may affect vaccination efficacy. This multi-center, prospective, observational study investigated the efficacy and impact of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 variants on treatment among breast cancer patients in Japan. Patients with breast cancer scheduled to be vaccinated with the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine from May to November 2021 were prospectively enrolled (UMIN000045527). They were stratified into five groups according to their cancer treatment: no treatment, hormone therapy, anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)2 therapy, chemotherapy, and cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor. Serum samples for assessing serological responses were collected before the first vaccination and after the second vaccination. Eighty-five breast cancer patients were included. The overall seroconversion rate after second vaccination was 95.3% and the lowest seroconversion rate was 81.8% in the patients under chemotherapy. The overall positivity rate of neutralizing antibodies against the wild-type, ÃŽÂ±, ÃŽâ€, ÃŽÂº, and omicron variants were 90.2%, 81.7%, 96.3%, 84.1%, and 8.5%, respectively. Among the patients under chemotherapy or CDK4/6 inhibitors, various degrees of decreased neutralizing antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 variants were observed. Withdrawal or reduction of systemic therapy because of vaccination was observed in only one patient. Our data support SARS-CoV-2 vaccination for breast cancer patients. However, a reduction in neutralizing antibody titers was suggested during chemotherapy and CDK4/6 inhibitors, raising concerns about the impact on long-term infection prevention.","Terada, Kondo, Wanifuchi-Endo, Fujita, Asano, Hisada, Uemoto, Akiko Kato, Yamanaka, Sugiura, Mita, Wada, Takahashi, Saito, Yoshioka, Toyama","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10549-022-06693-2","20220808","Breast cancer; CDK4/6; COVID-19; SARA-CoV-2; Seroconversion; Vaccine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-10","",35873,""
"Quality of Life Outcomes and Associated Symptoms Reported by Lung Transplant Recipients Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic: Applying a Novel Assessment Tool","There are 2 main aims of lung transplantation for people with end-stage lung disease: (1) to extend life and (2) to improve its quality. Much consideration is given to how to support the longevity and functioning of the allograft, though less robust studies have been done on the quality of the recipients' lives. With an interest in providing compassionate and holistic patient-centered care, it is vital that the treatment providers accurately understand their patients' lived experience. This study aimed to describe the health-related quality of life experiences of lung transplant recipients. An interest was held for where patients may struggle, thus informing where support might be needed to achieve the best possible outcomes. This single-center study used a validated Lung Transplant Quality of Life questionnaire, which was sent in autumn of 2020 to all of the lung transplant recipients (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 581) under the care of Columbia University Irving Medical Center (New York, NY). ""Anxiety/Depression"" had the highest concentration of struggle responses, followed closely by ""Pulmonary Symptoms"" and ""Neuromuscular Symptoms."" ""Neuromuscular Problems"" and ""Sexual Problems"" had the highest percentage of struggle responses. As the struggles increased, the overall quality of life rating dropped proportionately. There was no correlation between the overall quality of life and graft dysfunction, age, or time out from transplant date. All of the domains held an average rating of ""Satisfactory,"" except ""Treatment Burden,"" which was rated as ""Favorable."" Those ratings dropped for the cohort of patients who died during the study period. With the goal of providing comprehensive care at the forefront of transplant priorities, we found the newly developed questionnaire invaluable in targeting areas for quality improvements, mostly notably respecting recipient mental health.","Storaasli, Nakagawa, Singer, Fedoronko, Zhang, Tsapepas, Rincon, Scheffert, Benvenuto, Arcasoy","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transproceed.2022.07.001","20220808","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-10","",35874,""
"Rate and correlates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following the Beirut blast and the economic crisis among Lebanese University students: a cross-sectional study","Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental illness that develops in some people after they have experienced a stunning, scary, or dangerous incident. Due to major disasters like as the Economic Crisis and the Beirut Blast, Lebanese people are struggling with a variety of mental health issues. The study objectives were to find the rate of PTSD and its association with stress, anxiety, depression, financial well-being and coping strategies among university students in Lebanon. This is a cross-sectional study, conducted between May and August 2021, which enrolled 419 university students from all districts of Lebanon. The PTSD Checklist-Specific Version (PCL-S) was used to evaluate manifestation of PSTD. The results showed that 132 (31.5%), 109 (26.0%) and 169 (40.3%) had PTSD from COVID, Beirut blast and economic crisis respectively. More avoidant coping (BetaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.52) and more anxiety (BetaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.62) were significantly associated with more PTSD from the Beirut Blast. More avoidant coping (BetaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.56), depression (BetaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.40) and anxiety (BetaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.49) were significantly associated with more PTSD from the economic crisis, whereas more financial wellbeing (BetaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.31) was significantly associated with less PTSD from the economic crisis. Significant rates of PTSD were found in our sample of Lebanese university students, whether from the Beirut blast, or from the current economic crisis. Significant correlations of these PTSD rates were found with factors such as avoidant coping, depression, anxiety and financial wellbeing. Such findings must raise the attention to serious mental and psychosocial alteration endured by Lebanese youth that are still under fatal cumulative traumatic events, that were and even may be, intergenerationally and unintentionally transmissible, therefore, affecting not only the present, but also the future of a whole nation.","El Zouki, Chahine, Mhanna, Obeid, Hallit","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-04180-y","20220809","Correlates; Lebanon; Post-traumatic stress disorder; University students; Adolescent; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Economic Recession; Humans; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Students; Universities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-10","",35875,""
