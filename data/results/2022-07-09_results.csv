"Rapid increase in depression within the first month of the Shanghai Covid lockdown in 2022 (preprint)","In the global efforts to combat Covid-19, researchers have increasingly recognized the profound impacts of society lockdown on population mental health. However, the fine temporal evolution of negative psychological consequences induced by lockdowns remains poorly understood. Here we report a rapid and systematic increase in depression due to the Shanghai Covid lockdown in March 2022. Measured by Beck Depression Inventory-2, 10% of the participants experienced at least mild depression before the official citywide lockdown started, and two and four weeks later this number increased to 21% and 36 %, respectively. Regression analyses show that lockdown duration and physical restriction jointly contribute to worsening depression. Furthermore, the time of sleep and social communication during the lockdown are associated with the severity of depression symptoms. These results highlight the fast development of depression during lockdowns and call for special attention to early psychological interventions once a lockdown is initiated.","","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/mwge8","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-09","",33882,""
"The Effect of Covid-19 on Adolescentsâ€™ Mental Health, Social Lives, and Academic Achievement (preprint)","The aim of this study was to discover effects of Covid-19 on the mental health, academic life, social life of students and discover their interrelationships at a boarding school in New Jersey, USA. 193 participants completed a 26 question survey relating to the preceding topics. A majority reported that Covid-19 had a negative effect on their mental health and social lives, felt well informed about Covid-19 cases on campus, and were unconcerned about getting Covid-19 at school. Significant correlations implied that Covid-19 has impacted all areas of school life. Age correlated with impacted mental health, social lives and academic performance. Females were more strongly impacted with regards to social bonds and mental health than males. Support and strategies to mitigate effects of Covid-19 are needed for affected students, with regards to mental health, as well as academic and social lives.","","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/h3r2u","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-09","",33883,""
"Executive function difficulties among school-aged children during the COVID-19 pandemic: associations with home literacy environment, reading and screen media timesÂ  (preprint)","Several studies indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic and the containment measures it required (including social distancing, quarantine and school closure) had a significant impact on childrenâ€™s mental health. The present study aimed to examine executive function difficulties at behavioural level in school children during the COVID-19 lockdown, and to analyze potential associations with home literacy environment, current reading and screen times. Data were collected from mothers of 210 children (9â€“12 years old) through an online survey. Significant increases in children screen times were observed, while most of them did not read for pleasure on a daily basis. Parentsâ€™ literacy beliefs and childrenâ€™s current leisure reading times were negative predictors of executive function difficulties, which increased with videogame and internet exposure. Nevertheless, perceived changes on screen or reading times with respect to pre-pandemic levels were not associated with executive function scores. The results might indicate: 1) opposite effects of literacy and screen times over childrenâ€™s executive functioning;2) a preference for reading or screen recreational use according to their executive function profiles;or 3) a combination of both. Our findings highlight the relation of reading and screen times with childrenâ€™s cognitive development, and the importance of following their trajectory during post-pandemic times.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1784639/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-09","",33884,""
"Barriers and facilitators to training delivery and subsequent implementation of a localised child and adolescent mental health initiative: A qualitative content analysis (preprint)","Background:  Ensuring that children and young people (CYP) can obtain mental health support from a broad variety of sources is of upmost importance. This is especially true given the increasing prevalence of mental health difficulties in this population, and the associated challenges with receiving support from specialised healthcare services. Equipping professionals, from a wide range of sectors, with the skills needed to provide this support is a vital starting point. This study explored the experiences of professionals who had participated in CYP mental health training modules relating to a socially funded initiative in Greater Manchester, UK, to establish the barriers and facilitators behind its implementation. Methods:  Directed qualitative content analysis of semi-structured interview data from nine CYP-facing professionals was conducted. Both interview schedule and initial deductive coding strategy were devised using the findings of a relevant systematic literature review by the authors. This methodology was used with the aim of establishing the presence of these findings within the localised intervention, before generating tailored recommendations for their training programme. Results:  When the interview data were coded and analysed, a strong level of thematic similarity with the authorsâ€™ review was found. However, we deduced that the emergence of additional inductive themes might reflect the contextual uniqueness of the intervention, in addition to that of the COVID-19 pandemic. Six recommendations were made for further improvement of CYP mental health training, including the facilitation of unstructured peer interaction during training, and ensuring that jargon and key words are fully clarified. Conclusions:  Methodological limitations, guidance for usage, and potential applications of the studyâ€™s findings are explored. Whilst largely, the findings were akin to those of the review, subtle yet important differences were found. These are likely to reflect the nuances of the training programme discussed, but despite this, we tentatively suggest that our findings are transferable to similar training interventions. This study provides a valuable example of how qualitative evidence syntheses can be used to aid study design and analysis: an underused approach.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1764285/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-09","",33885,""
"Mail-based harm reduction services are key solutions to reduce the impact of COVID-19-like crises on people who use drugs: evidence from two independent structures in France and in the USA (preprint)","Background:  Harm Reduction (HR) policies for People Who Use Drugs (PWUD) have a significant positive impact on their health. Such approaches limit the spread of infections and reduce opioid overdose mortality. These policies have led to the opening of specialized centers located mainly in big cities and urbanized zones. The COVID-19 pandemic reduced access to HR centers in locations undergoing lockdown. Before the pandemic, HR services in France and in the USA were complemented by the development of remote HR programs: HaRePo (Harm Reduction by Post) for France, implemented in 2011, and NEXT Distro for the USA founded in 2017. These programs are free and specifically designed for people who have difficulties accessing HR tools and counseling in-person. PWUD can access HaRePo program by phone and/or email. NEXT Distro users can access the program through its dedicated website. The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated lockdowns have drastically impacted the HR services in both countries and many HR centers were forced to adapt their activities. Methods: : Here, we analyzed how lockdowns impacted the number of new users entering the programs, the numbers of parcels sent and naloxone distributed using the records of both structures. With the ability to reach PWUD remotely, HaRePo and NEXT Distro were particularly effective at maintaining service continuity and scaling up services to meet the needs of PWUD during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: : By comparing previous yearâ€™s data average with a 95% confidence interval, we showed that the activity of both programs were significantly impacted by the pandemic. Both show an increase in new users joining the programs as well as the number of parcels sent per month. It shows that remote HR was able to partially compensate for the reduced HR activities due to COVID-19. We also observed that the distribution of naloxone per parcel tends to increase for both structures. Conclusion:  By studying two independent structures in France and in the USA sharing similar objectives (remote HR), we showed that this approach can be a key solution to crises that impact classical HR structures despite various differences in operating procedures between countries.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1758408/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-09","",33886,""
"An Analysis of the Perspective of Last Year Medical Students in Training Allocated to Manage COVID-19 Hospital Patients in Mexico (preprint)","Background:  In order to address the COVID-19 pandemic, health systems have used all their resources, including health care workers in training. Knowing the insights of these workers is of the utmost importance to generate adequate educative/political /administrative strategies. Methods:  An anonymous cross-sectional online survey was made by the General Directorate of Quality and Health Education in Mexico, in a convenience sample of 6,020 participants who belong to personnel in training for the health area, which included practitioners and professional technologists, undergraduate doctors, nursing, and residents in several specialties. Results:  Different positive and negative feelings were identified by the health workers who participated in facing this health emergency;emphasizing elements such as the need for Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) that, when deficient or lacking, generate concerns that raise questions about the medical/epidemiological attention to the pandemic. Based on an analysis of feelings, 8 main feelings were identified, which by frequency of appearing were: distrust(24.83%), fear(21.97%), sadness(12.45%), anticipation(11.65%), anger(10.71%), disgust(9.69%), joy(4.97%) and surprise(3.72%) which influence health workers in training and their wrok performance day to day.Concerning their positive and negative evaluation of their experience facing this health emergency, 13.83% of participants had a positive perception about participating in this kind of health emergency to support the country, 49.94% showed a negative evaluation, and 36.23% kept a neutral evaluation about their participation. Conclusions:  The health workers in training in Mexico gave a negative evaluation of the management of the health emergency. Distrust as a response to the absence of timely information from the education/health institutions, as well as concern about lack of personal protection equipment/inputs, are the main conflicts reported. We must establish a credible globally relevant continuity plan for the education of health care personnel in training, facing emergencies and disasters, so that next time we are properly prepared.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-522952/v2","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-09","",33887,""
"Mental health, sleep quality and quality of life in individuals with and without multiple health conditions during home quarantine in India due to the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study (preprint)","Background: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic and the global spread had created several challenges for the general public and the healthcare workers across the world, the primary aim of this study was to assess the psychological stress, sleep quality, and health-related quality of life (QoL) of individuals with multiple health issues during home quarantine caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: : The study was conducted between 28 th March to 30 th April 2020. We recruited 50 individuals who have a history of chronic health issues, and 50 individuals with no health issues for this cross-sectional study. Three questionnaires were used to evaluate the mental health [depression anxiety stress scale (DASS-21)], sleep quality [Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI)], and QoL [short form of health-related questionnaire (SF-36)] of the participants. Statistical analysis was carried out with Studentâ€™s t-test, using SPSS software v16. Results: : Baseline demographic characteristics were homogenous for both groups of participants. Intergroup analysis revealed statistically significant differences in mental health (p&lt;0.001), sleep quality (p&lt;0.001), and QoL (p&lt;0.001) between the two groups. Â The results showed high levels of depression, anxiety and stress;poor sleep quality and low health-related QoL in Group A as compared to Group B. Conclusion:  Our findings indicate that individuals with chronic health issues exhibit higher mental health problems, lower quality of sleep and have a lower health-related QoL.

"Resident Depression and Burnout During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Resident physicians face a higher rate of burnout and depression than the general population. Few studies have examined burnout and depression in Canadian laboratory medicine residents, and none during the COVID-19 pandemic. To identify the prevalence of burnout and depression, contributing factors, and the impact of COVID-19 in this population. An electronic survey was distributed to Canadian laboratory medicine residents. Burnout was assessed using the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory. Depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9. Seventy-nine responses were collected. The prevalence of burnout was 67% (50 of 79). The prevalence of depression was 47% (37 of 79). Modifiable factors significantly associated with burnout included career dissatisfaction, below average academic performance, lack of time off for illness, stress related to finances, lack of a peer or staff physician mentor, and a high level of fatigue. Modifiable factors significantly associated with depression further included a lack of access to wellness resources, lack of time off for leisure, and fewer hours of sleep. Fifty-five percent (41 of 74) of participants reported direct impacts to their personal circumstances by the COVID-19 pandemic. Burnout and depression are significant issues affecting Canadian laboratory medicine residents. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, we recommend the institution of flexible work arrangements, protected time for illness and leisure, ongoing evaluation of career satisfaction, formal and informal wellness programming with trainee input, formal mentorship programming, and a financial literacy curriculum as measures to improve trainee wellness.","Han, Hahn, Done, Pun, Shivji, Lu","https://doi.org/10.5858/arpa.2021-0501-EP","20220708","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-09","",33891,""
"Establishing a Sustainable Healthcare Delivery Workforce in the Wake of COVID-19","Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. healthcare sector was facing challenges that threatened the sustainability of its workforce. These challenges included changing demographics, competition from other employers, and burnout. Now in the wake of the pandemic, the labor market is seeing more disruption with the exacerbation of these issues. Healthcare organizations have a responsibility to prevent further labor shortages so that they can continue to deliver high quality care and achieve positive health outcomes. Given the changes in people's values and behaviors, healthcare leaders can consider four innovative strategies to meet the needs of their current and future employees: flexible work arrangements, alternative benefits packages, career pathways, and mental health services. Organizations need to take into account their employee populations and the ability to invest in these changes when considering how to move forward.","Weidman","https://doi.org/10.1097/JHM-D-22-00100","20220708","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-09","",33892,""
"Latent class analysis of health, social, and behavioral profiles associated with psychological distress among pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States","There is a growing body of literature documenting negative mental health impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to identify risk and protective factors associated with mental health and well-being among pregnant and postpartum women during the pandemic. This was a cross-sectional, anonymous online survey study distributed to pregnant and postpartum (within 6Ã‚Â months) women identified through electronic health records from two large healthcare systems in the Northeastern and Midwestern United States. Survey questions explored perinatal and postpartum experiences related to the pandemic, including social support, coping, and health care needs and access. Latent class analysis was performed to identify classes among 13 distinct health, social, and behavioral variables. Outcomes of depression, anxiety, and stress were examined using propensity-weighted regression modeling. Fit indices demonstrated a three-class solution as the best fitting model. Respondents (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 616) from both regions comprised three classes, which significantly differed on sleep- and exercise-related health, social behaviors, and mental health: Higher Psychological Distress (31.8%), Moderate Psychological Distress (49.8%), and Lower Psychological Distress (18.4%). The largest discriminatory issue was support from one's social network. Significant differences in depression, anxiety, and stress severity scores were observed across these three classes. Reported need for mental health services was greater than reported access. Mental health outcomes were largely predicted by the lack or presence of social support, which can inform public health decisions and measures to buffer the psychological impact of ongoing waves of the COVID-19 pandemic on pregnant and postpartum women. Targeted early intervention among those in higher distress categories may help improve maternal and child health.","Goldstein, Brown, Lennon, Zgierska","https://doi.org/10.1111/birt.12664","20220708","COVID-19; maternal mental health; postpartum; pregnancy; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-09","",33893,""

Our objectives were to verify how the phenomenon of domestic violence has evolved and changed along 2020, and to clarify if these changes were correlated to the evolution of the pandemic. Though the analysis of the number of daily calls from women to the national anti-violence number and the parameters related to COVID-19 pandemic (daily cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and admissions in ICU), a positive correlation was found between daily deaths due to COVID-19 and the number of calls to the anti-violence number, while daily hospitalizations and admissions in ICU negatively correlated with calls of women reporting at the national anti-violence number. The number of daily calls from women reporting at the national anti-violence number positively correlated with the number of quarantined people shifted of 30Ã‚Â days from the beginning of isolation at home, as well. We also analyzed temporal trends of daily calls from women to the national anti-violence number from 25th of February 2020 to 31st of December 2020.

"Effectiveness of Online Psychotherapy to Treat and Prevent Burnout","Introduction: Burnout or mental health exhaustion is a hidden productivity killer in organizations today. Finding a solution to efficaciously measure, identify causes, and company exposure, and to proactively prevent and to rehabilitate employees with Burnout is a major challenge. To accomplish this digitally is even more challenging, especially as demand and the effects of COVID-19 outgrow the support services. To meet this unabated demand, companies and caregivers need to focus on proactive measures to prevent ""Burnout as an Occupational Phenomenon"" from further escalation. Objective: This study aims to address the effectiveness, reliability, and validity of the Empowerment for Participation (EFP) batch of assessments to measure Burnout risk in relation to the efficacy of online interventions using Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and floating, to achieve improved mental health and wellbeing. The study will also briefly introduce three risk assessments: Risk for Burnout, Risk of Anxiety and Risk for Depression. Method: An interventional, empirical, and parallel design using raw EFP psychometric data to measure the effectiveness of online therapy to reduce the risk for Burnout between a control group and an online therapy group. The aim is to test whether there is a statistically significant difference in the effectiveness on online therapy to reduce the Risk for Burnout compared to that of a Control Group. Fifty participants were randomly selected. The rehabilitation and control Group consisted of twenty-five normally distributed employees (N25) each. The rehabilitation group received therapy, and the control had not yet received any form of therapy. SPSS was used to analyze the data collected, a Repeated Measure ANOVA, an ANCOVA, a Discriminant analysis, and a Construct Validity analysis were used to test for Reliability and Validity. The group was selected from a list of employees within the My-E-Health ecosystem that showed a moderate or high risk for Burnout. A normally distributed group (N50) met all assumptions and consisted of a Control Group (N25) and a Therapy Group (N25). The post assessment value was used as the dependent variable. The Burnout measure (30 questions) is obtained from the Empowerment for Participation (EFP) batch of assessments (110 questions). All assessments and CBT were done digitally online, and floating was done at a designated location. The full EFP assessment is integrated into a digital ecosystem designed for this purpose and therapy. The online digital system is an integrity-based platform offering both the employee and caregiver a secure and encrypted ecosystem. It is a secure tunnel or channel between the therapists and patients. Results: There is a statistically significant difference between the pre-assessment and the post-assessment scores for Burnout between the groups. Online therapy is effective in reducing Burnout. Reliability of the Burnout Measure was good (ÃŽÂ± = .858, M = 1.826, SD = 3.008, d = .607, P &lt; .001) with a high validity = .9420. A Paired Samples Test shows a good t score of 4.292, P &lt; .001 with a good effect size d = .607. Online therapy reduced the risk for Burnout compared to the control group. Tests of Between-Subjects Effects shows F = 16.964 significantly significant difference between the Control Group and the Online Therapy Group: P &lt; .001 with movement between the group variables of .261 or 26.1% for the dependent variable. Conclusion: This original study suggests good reliability and validity in using online Interventional mixed-method CBT to reduce the risk of Burnout. The Empowerment for Participation (EFP Batch) of online assessments could reliably identify morbidity risk levels and successfully measure clinical interventions and rehabilitation with consistently reliable results to serve as both a diagnosis and therapeutic tool worthy of major research in the future.","Michelsen, Kjellgren","https://doi.org/10.2196/39129","20220708","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-09","",33895,""
"Chronic Pain Management During a Pandemic: Evidence-Based Review","Chronic pain is the leading cause of morbidity in the world and is strongly associated with physical and psychological disabilities. In this pandemic, most of the pain care centers are forced to shut their doors leaving patients in dismay and adding to their misery. A systematic review was performed following the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. All research articles from March 2020 to September 15, 2020, available on PubMed, Google scholar, and EmBase were included in this study. The keywords used for data search were ""chronic pain,"" ""coronavirus,"" ""pain management,"" ""COVID-19,"" ""drugs usage in covid-19,"" ""recommendation,"" and ""guidelines"". This review summarizes findings from the current literature available worldwide from different databases regarding guidelines to practice during chronic pain in coronavirus disease (COVID) crisis. This article acts as a specimen on how to handle future pandemics. We concluded that chronic pain management is a fundamental right and telemedicine is the silver lining that can be used for primary, follow-up consultation and to address mental health issues in chronic pain patients. Outpatient department visits should be scheduled using ""forward triage."" Pain Interventions should be carried out if urgent or semi-urgent with necessary precautions. Reopening of elective procedures with COVID testing can be planned, considering pain interventions to be usually percutaneous, of short duration, and involving office procedures with minimal aerosol generation. Drugs contrib- uting to immune suppression, for example, strong opioids and steroids, should be avoided. Regenerative therapy can be used instead during pain interventions. Physicians are expected to follow the recommended government guidelines before prescribing any drugs.","Arora, Kumar, Kumar, Sharma","https://doi.org/10.5152/TJAR.2022.1328","20220708","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-09","",33896,""
"Differences in Mental Health Status Among Asian Americans During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Findings from the Health, Ethnicity, and Pandemic Study","This study aims to explore the differences in mental health status among Asian Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from the 2020 Health, Ethnicity, and Pandemic (HEAP) Study were used to explore the psychological distress of 2672 adults, using the Standard Kessler Psychological Distress Scale.

"Food Insecurity, Financial Hardship, and Mental Health Among Multiple Asian American Ethnic Groups: Findings from the 2020 COVID-19 Household Impact Survey","The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted the financial and mental well-being of U.S. adults, however, Asian American (AA)-specific data are lacking, particularly disaggregated by AA ethnicity. Our objective was to evaluate food insecurity (FI), financial hardship, and mental health among disaggregated AA ethnic groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. We used data from the COVID-19 Household Impact Survey, a sample of 10,760 U.S. adults weighted to reflect the U.S. population (<i>weighted n: 418,209,893)</i>. AA ethnic categories were based on self-report (<i>n</i>=312, 5.1%; <i>weighted n: 21,143,079</i>) and provided as follows: Chinese American, South Asian, Filipino+Vietnamese, and Japanese+Korean. We estimated the prevalence of FI and financial hardship across AA ethnic categories. We estimated the demographic determinants of FI, including financial hardship, among AA adults using multivariable Poisson regression. We calculated the prevalence of mental health symptoms among food-insecure AA adults, as well as among AA adults experiencing both FI and financial hardship. Overall, the prevalence of FI and financial hardship among AA adults was highest among Filipino+Vietnamese adults (52.9-24.5%) and lowest among Japanese+Korean adults (13.9-8.6%). Determinants of FI among AA adults included Filipino+Vietnamese ethnicity (adjusted prevalence ratios [aPR]: 2.81, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.49-5.29), being widowed/divorced/separated (aPR: 3.14, 95% CI: 1.37-7.23), high school graduate only (aPR: 3.46, 95% CI: 1.96-6.11), having low income &lt;$30,000 (aPR: 2.54, 95% CI: 1.27-5.06), and living in rural areas (aPR: 7.65, 95% CI: 1.17-50.14). Eighty-one percent and 63% of AA adults with anxiety and hopelessness at least 3-7 days/week, respectively, were food insecure and experiencing financial hardship. Disparities exist in FI and financial hardship among AA adults, particularly Filipino+Vietnamese adults, and are associated with increased self-reporting of feelings of anxiety and hopelessness.","Islam, Awan, Kapadia","https://doi.org/10.1089/heq.2021.0179","20220708","Asian Americans; COVID-19 pandemic; anxiety; disaggregated data; disparities; financial hardship; food insecurity; hopelessness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-09","",33898,""
"Mental Health and Substance Abuse Among the Bosnia and Herzegovina Student Population During the COVID-19 Outbreak","Mental health, substance abuse and suicidal ideation present an emerging healthcare problem during COVID-19 pandemic as a result of socio-epidemiological measures, isolations, work modifications, constant media overload with COVID-19 related news and no effective cure for the disease. The aim of this study was to analyse substance abuse, suicidal ideation and mental health status among university students during the COVID-19 outbreak in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This cross-sectional study, was conducted via an online anonymous questionnaire based on a Patient Health Questionnaire-4 and Impact of Event Scale-6 which was distributed to the student population of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In total 827 subjects, the majority of whom were female (636), had a high school degree (431), were unemployed (587), lived in an urban environment (747) and had a median age of 23.0 (21.0,32.0), completed the questionnaire.

"Prevalence of mental health disorders among health-care providers of COVID-19 positive and suspected cases","Health-care providers (HCP) engaged in demanding work like being involved in the care of COVID-19 positive and suspected cases are likely to have a lot of stress, anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. It will be noteworthy to have an idea about the magnitude of the mental health problems in them to formulate effective intervention strategies for their well-being. The aim of this study is to determine whether frontline HCP engaged in the treatment and care of COVID-19 positive and suspect cases experienced increased mental health problems. Two hundred and fifty-one frontline HCPs engaged in COVID-19 duty and 97 nonfrontline (controls) HCP were assessed and compared using tools like General Health Questionnaire 12, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Appropriate statistical tools such as analysis of variance and Chi-square were used. Frontline HCP who were directly involved in COVID-19 duty had a higher proportion (28.3%) of psychological morbidities as compared to 19.6% among controls; HCP-frontline had significantly 2.17 times chances of having psychological distress compared to HCP controls. Among, HCP-frontline 13.1% had clinical depression, whereas in the HCP control, this was 6.2%. Further, 20.3% of HCP frontline and 10.3% of HCP control had clinical anxiety, and the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (<i>P</i> = 0.0011). Frontline HCPs working in demanding work such as COVID-19 patient care are susceptible to psychological distress, anxiety, and depression which warrant urgent attention.","Das, Harish, Tyagi, Rohilla, Domun, Garg, Pandargiri, Singh","https://doi.org/10.4103/ipj.ipj_229_20","20220708","Anxiety; COVID-19; depression; health-care providers; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-09","",33900,""
"Older adult life in COVID-19 pandemic: Focus on social isolation, loneliness, and minimization of risks","At the moment of worldwide lockdown with the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), older adult life bangs up with lots of changes such as stagnation in life, abuses, or violence (e.g., physical, emotional, sexual, and neglect). Older adults are feeling and experiencing more deprivation of social connectedness in a self-isolating environment. When there is a need for solidarity worldwide, COVID-19 is escalating stigmatization and discrimination against older adult populations. For this reason, we are particularly interested/accentuated more on the isolation life and loneliness lifestyles of older adults residing inside the four walls of their houses. In addition, emphasis is also given on different approaches of 4 R's such as reinoculate, remove, restore, and resilience for minimization of impact of COVID-19 among older adults. However, the cultural differences and societal values also played a major role in minimization of mental health challenges and illnesses during lockdown in Western and Eastern societies. The ""We-ness"" of collectivistic culture of Eastern societies brings more ""Wellness"" for older adult mental health. On the other hand, the ""I-ness"" of individualistic culture of Western societies brings only ""Illness"" for the older adult population. Still, many countries are facing a second or third wave of COVID-19, which are worsening the situation more for the older adult population. With aging and social isolation in pandemic, older adults' well-being can be restored by developing healthy habits, involvement in religious activities, adopting natural healing techniques, and positive thinking toward the life.","Maral, Punetha","https://doi.org/10.4103/ipj.ipj_219_20","20220708","Coronavirus disease 2019; culture; discrimination; loneliness; mental health; natural healing; older adults; physical illness; social isolation; social values; violence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-09","",33901,""
"Feasibility of Online High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) on Psychological Symptoms in Students in Lockdown During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Randomized Controlled Trial","We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of an online High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) program on clinical psychological symptoms in higher education students in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. During the lockdown, 30 students aged 18-25 years, who had been screened previously with a cut-off score Ã¢â€°Â¥5 in the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaire, were randomly assigned to either the 4-week HIIT program with three sessions per week conducted through online videos, or a no-intervention control group. The primary outcome was the feasibility assessment. The secondary outcome was a psychological self-report with the 21-items Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Assessment and intervention were performed in compliance with social distancing rules. Two participants in the HIIT were lost to follow-up, leaving 13 participants vs. 15 in the control group. We observed high adherence (87%) and complete safety for mental and physical status with the HIIT intervention delivered by online videos. The Mann-Whitney test demonstrated a significant (group Ãƒâ€” time, <i>P</i>-Value = 0.046) reduction of clinical stress symptoms and a trend (group Ãƒâ€” time, <i>P</i>-Value = 0.08) toward reduction of clinical depression symptoms, both favoring the HIIT group. No significant (group Ãƒâ€” time, <i>P</i>-Value = 0.118) interaction was found for anxiety symptoms. The online HIIT program was found to be feasible and safe in a clinical sample of young adults, who were experiencing social and physical restrictions due to COVID-19. HIIT reduced stress and depressive symptoms and thus these preliminary results show promise for broader application among higher education students during the present lockdown necessitated by the global COVID-19 health crisis.","Philippot, Moulin, Charon, Balestra, Dubois, de Timary, De Volder, Bleyenheuft, Lambrechts","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.904283","20220708","COVID-19; High-Intensity Interval Training; anxiety; depression; exercise; lockdown; stress; students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-09","",33902,""

"Young children's voices in an unlocked Sweden during the COVID-19 pandemic","During the COVID-19 pandemic, Sweden was one of the few countries that rejected lockdowns in favour of recommendations for restrictions, including careful hand hygiene and social distancing. Preschools and primary schools remained open. Several studies have shown negative impacts of the pandemic on children, particularly high levels of anxiety. The study aim was to explore how Swedish school-aged children aged 6-14 years, experienced the COVID-19 pandemic and their perceived anxiety. In total, 774 children aged 6-14 years and their guardians answered an online questionnaire containing 24 questions, along with two instruments measuring anxiety: the Children's Anxiety Questionnaire and the Numerical Rating Scale. A convergent parallel mixed-methods design was used for analysing the quantitative and qualitative data. Each data source was first analysed separately, followed by a merged interpretative analysis. The results showed generally low levels of anxiety, with no significant sex differences. Children who refrained from normal social activities or group activities (<i>n</i>=377) had significantly higher levels of anxiety. Most of the children were able to appreciate the bright side of life, despite the social distancing and refraining from activities, which prevented them from meeting and hugging their loved ones. <b>These Swedish children generally experienced low levels of anxiety, except those who refrained from social activities. Life was nonetheless mostly experienced as normal, largely because schools remained open.

"The effect of COVID-19 lockdowns on women's perinatal mental health: a systematic review","Risk factors for poor maternal perinatal mental health include a previous mental health diagnosis, reduced access to perinatal services, economic concerns and decreased levels of social support. Adverse maternal perinatal mental health can negatively influence the psychological wellbeing of infants. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic presented an additional stressor. While literature on the impact of COVID-19 on perinatal mental health exists, no systematic review has focused specifically on maternal perinatal mental health during periods of COVID-19 lockdown. This systematic review explores how periods of COVID-19 lockdown impacted women's perinatal mental health. Searches of CINAHL, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were conducted for literature from 1st January 2020-25th May 2021. Quantitative, peer-reviewed, cross-sectional studies published in English with perinatal women as participants, and data collected during a period of lockdown, were included. Data was assessed for quality and narratively synthesized. Sixteen articles from nine countries met the inclusion criteria. COVID-19 lockdowns negatively impacted perinatal mental health. Risk factors for negative perinatal mental health noted in previous literature were confirmed. In addition, resilience, educational attainment, trimester, and ethnicity were identified as other variables which may influence mental health during perinatal periods experienced during lockdown. Understanding nuance in experience and harnessing intra and interpersonal support could advance options for intervention. Developing resources for perinatal women that integrate informal sources of support may aid them when normal routine is challenged, and may mediate potential long-term impacts of poor perinatal maternal health on infants.","Wall, Dempsey","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wombi.2022.06.005","20220707","COVID-19; Lockdown; Mental health; Perinatal; Systematic review; Women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-09","",33906,""
"Prevalence of and risk factors for depression, anxiety, and stress in non-hospitalized asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 patients in East Java province, Indonesia","Despite abundant data on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, 3 important knowledge gaps continue to exist, i.e., 1) studies from low-/middle income countries (LMICs); 2) studies in the later period of the COVID-19 pandemic; and 3) studies on non-hospitalized asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 patients. To address the knowledge gaps, we assessed the prevalence of and the risk factors for mental health symptoms among non-hospitalized asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 patients in one LMIC (Indonesia) during the later period of the pandemic. This cross-sectional study was conducted in September 2020 in East Java province, Indonesia. Study population consisted of non-hospitalized asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 patients who were diagnosed based on reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction results from nasopharyngeal swab. Mental health symptoms were evaluated using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21. From 778 non-hospitalized asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 patients, 608 patients were included in the analysis. Patients' median age was 35 years old and 61.2% were male. Of these, 22 (3.6%) reported symptoms of depression, 87 (14.3%) reported symptoms of anxiety, and 48 (7.9%) reported symptoms of stress. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that females were more likely to report symptoms of stress (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.98, p-value = 0.028); healthcare workers were more likely to report symptoms of depression and anxiety (aOR = 5.57, p-value = 0.002 and aOR = 2.92, p-value = 0.014, respectively); and those with a recent history of self-quarantine were more likely to report symptoms of depression and stress (aOR 5.18, p = 0.004 and aOR = 1.86, p = 0.047, respectively).

"Analyzing the influence of COVID-19 epidemic on the employment intention of resident physicians in China","To investigate the effects and influencing factors of the COVID-19 epidemic on the employment intention of resident physicians in China. 409 questionnaires were statistically analyzed after removing the missing values. We used the Chi-Square test for single-factor analysis and logistic regression analysis for multivariate analysis. The questions include the residents' employment intention and their willingness to engage in epidemic-related subspecialties and participate in epidemic-related work. Residents of severe and high-risk epidemic regions had much lower employment intentions than those of stable epidemic regions (OR = 1.917, 95% CI: 1.024, 3.591, p = 0.042).

"Proper death certification in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic: Forensic perspective","It is well known that the quality of death certificates determines the accuracy of public health mortality data. In the light of a pandemic, forensic pathologists must understand the true definition of a COVID-19 death and the requirements for filling out the death certificate, as these are critical for maintaining accurate and trustworthy mortality data. To determine the scope and evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic, accurate death certification is critical. We believe that COVID-19 should be enlisted under part II or section ""note"" (if it exists in DC form in a particular country) of the DC in all suicide instances and putrefied bodies with positive autopsy swabs for SARS-CoV-2. In addition to our suggestions for the completion of the DC in some COVID-19 instances, we feel that forensic pathologists should follow the WHO criteria for proper DC completion in COVID-19 cases. Better physician education at this stage of the pandemic would increase adherence to existing (WHO and CDC) standards. As a result, forensic pathologists with competence in death certification could help by teaching treating physicians in this area.","BogdanoviÃ„â€¡, AtanasijeviÃ„â€¡, PopoviÃ„â€¡, MihailoviÃ„â€¡, RadniÃ„â€¡, PetroviÃ„â€¡, BaraÃ„â€¡","https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.16556","20220708","COVID-19; Death certificate; autopsy; forensic; putrefaction; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-09","",33909,""
"[Clinical and immunological correlates in endogenous psychoses developed after COVID-19]","The clinical and immunological study of the potential impact of coronavirus infection on the course of endogenous psychosis. Thirty-three female patients, aged 16 to 48 years, with depressive-delusional conditions (ICD-10 F20.01, F21, F31) developed after coronavirus infection, of whom 15 people (group 1) had depressive-delusional states 1-2 months after COVID-19 and 18 people (group 2), who developed similar psychoses in later periods (2-6 months). The severity of the psychopathologic symptoms was evaluated with PANSS and HDRS-21 scales. The activity of inflammatory markers - leukocyte elastase (LE) and ÃŽÂ±1-proteinase inhibitor (ÃŽÂ±1-PI) in the blood was determined. The absolute neutrophil count, the absolute lymphocyte count and the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio were calculated. As a control, we used standard values of indicators of age - and sex-matched healthy donors. The endogenous psychosis that developed later after a coronavirus infection (group 2) is associated with a ""typical"" inflammatory reaction with an increase in the activity of acute phase proteins (according to ÃŽÂ±1-PI) and degranulation activity of neutrophils (according to LE), which is associated with the development of depressive-delusional states in patients with the dominance of manifestations of positive affectivity (anxiety, melancholy) and the extended nature of delusional disorders, which were predominantly incongruent to affect. On the contrary, the development of endogenous psychosis during the first two months after COVID-19 (group 1) is characterized by a spectrum of inflammatory biomarkers with a decrease in the number of neutrophils and low activity of LE. This immunological profile is associated with the predominance of manifestations of negative affectivity (apathy, asthenia, adynamia) in the structure of depressive-delusional states and the relatively undeveloped nature of delusional disorders, which were predominantly congruent to affect. The clinical and biological correlates presumably indicate the modulating effect of the coronavirus infection (COVID-19) on neuroinflammation and the structure of endogenous psychosis.

"Smartphone Ownership, Smartphone Utilization, and Interest in Using Mental Health Apps to Address Substance Use Disorders: Literature Review and Cross-sectional Survey Study Across Two Sites","In recent years, there has been increasing interest in implementing digital technologies to diagnose, monitor, and intervene in substance use disorders. Smartphones are now a vehicle for facilitating telepsychiatry visits, measuring health metrics, and communicating with health care professionals. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the movement toward web-based and hybrid clinic visits and meetings, it has become especially salient to assess phone ownership among individuals with substance use disorders and their comfort in navigating phone functionality and using phones for mental health purposes. The aims of this study were to summarize the current literature around smartphone ownership, smartphone utilization, and the acceptability of using smartphones for mental health purposes and assess these variables across two disparate substance use treatment sites. We performed a focused literature review via a search of two academic databases (PubMed and Google Scholar) for publications since 2007 on the topics of smartphone ownership, smartphone utilization, and the acceptability of using mobile apps for mental health purposes among the substance use population. Additionally, we conducted a cross-sectional survey study that included 51 participants across two sites in New England-an inpatient detoxification unit that predominantly treats patients with alcohol use disorder and an outpatient methadone maintenance treatment clinic. Prior studies indicated that mobile phone ownership among the substance use population between 2013 and 2019 ranged from 83% to 94%, while smartphone ownership ranged from 57% to 94%. The results from our study across the two sites indicated 96% (49/51) mobile phone ownership and 92% (47/51) smartphone ownership among the substance use population. Although most (43/49, 88%) patients across both sites reported currently using apps on their phone, a minority (19/48, 40%) reported previously using any apps for mental health purposes. More than half of the participants reported feeling at least neutrally comfortable with a mental health app gathering information regarding appointment reminders (32/48, 67%), medication reminders (33/48, 69%), and symptom surveys (26/45, 58%). Most patients were concerned about privacy (34/51, 67%) and felt uncomfortable with an app gathering location (29/47, 62%) and social (27/47, 57%) information for health care purposes. The majority of respondents reported owning a mobile phone (49/51, 96%) and smartphone (47/51, 92%), consistent with prior studies. Many respondents felt comfortable with mental health apps gathering most forms of personal information and with communicating with their clinician about their mental health. The differential results from the two sites, namely greater concerns about the cost of mental health apps among the methadone maintenance treatment cohort and less experience with downloading apps among the older inpatient detoxification cohort, may indicate that clinicians should tailor technological interventions based on local demographics and practice sites and that there is likely not a one-size-fits-all digital psychiatry solution.","Hsu, Martin, Ahmed, Torous, Suzuki","https://doi.org/10.2196/38684","20220708","addiction; digital mental health; digital phenotyping; digital psychiatry; health equity; mHealth; mental health; mindfulness; mobile phone; phone applications; phone ownership; phone utilization; smartphone; substance abuse; substance use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-09","",33911,""
"Psychological Effects of Aromatherapy on Smokers With Depressive Tendencies During Smoking Cessation Treatment: Protocol for a Pre-Post Single-Arm Clinical Trial","Cessation of smoking can markedly reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease, improve health economics, and benefit society. Aromatherapy has the potential to be a novel option as an adjuvant therapy for smoking cessation that may alleviate depressive symptoms. However, research on the efficacy of aromatherapy as an adjuvant therapy for smoking cessation is scarce. The aim of this study was to examine the potential effects of aromatherapy on psychological states in smokers with depressive tendencies and to determine if it is reasonable to proceed to the next step (ie, a phase III trial). This is a pre-post single-arm clinical trial. Smokers with depression will be subjected to aromatherapy during smoking cessation treatment for 12 weeks. We will evaluate changes in scores on the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale and the Profile of Mood States from pretreatment screening to 4 weeks and 12 weeks after the start of aromatherapy. Moreover, we will compare the group treated with aromatherapy with the group that received standard treatment in our previous randomized controlled trial (ie, the control group in that study). Furthermore, we will compare successful smoking cessation rates after 12 weeks. In addition, we will conduct an exploratory analysis of the efficacy of aromatherapy. The target sample size is 100, which is the number of subjects expected to be enrolled in this study during the 2-year study period. This study was approved by the Kyoto Medical Center Institutional Review Board (IRB approval No. 19-016). Enrollment started on July 1, 2019. As of May 2022, 76 patients have been recruited. In the original plan, recruitment should have been finished on June 30, 2021. However, the number of subjects decreased due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the study inclusion period was extended by 1 year (ie, until the end of June 2022) with the approval of the IRB on May 17, 2021. Analyses of the results will be completed subsequently. This study has some limitations. This is not a rigorous validation study because it compares the same subjects who received standard treatment in a previous study. Moreover, the sample size and methods of statistical analysis were not fully set with prior consideration of statistical rigor. To address these limitations, we plan to conduct a phase III trial that will reflect the exploratory findings of this study. This is the first study to evaluate the psychological effects of aromatherapy during a smoking cessation program, and it may help improve the quality of treatment for smoking cessation in the future.

"Students' increased time spent on social media, and their level of coronavirus anxiety during the pandemic predict increased social media addiction","During the COVID-19 pandemic period, the level of anxiety and the duration of social media use increased in university students. This study aimed to examine the relationship between coronavirus anxiety and social media addiction in university students. The sample consisted of 346 university students in Turkey. The data were collected online using the Sociodemographic Data Form, the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale Short Form and the Social Network Addiction Scale. The data were analysed using one-way analysis of variance, Mann-Whitney U test, Pearson correlation analysis, chi-square analysis and multiple linear regression analysis. The results showed that the mean coronavirus anxiety score was higher in men than in women. Social media addiction increased as the daily time spent by the students on social media increased. A positive correlation was found between the daily time spent on social media before the pandemic and social media usage during the pandemic. It was concluded that students use social media more during the pandemic than before it and that social media addiction increases as the students' coronavirus anxiety increases. It is important to plan initiatives to reduce coronavirus anxiety to prevent social media addiction in young people. The research population consisted of 1st and 2nd year students who are studying in the Medical Services and Techniques Department of Vocational School of Health Services at a university located in the west of Turkey, during the Fall Term of academic year 2020-2021. Students in this department are studying in anaesthesia, dialysis, first and emergency aid, medical laboratory techniques, medical imaging technique, and medical documentation and secretarial programmes.","Parlak Sert, BaÃ…Å¸kale","https://doi.org/10.1111/hir.12448","20220707","mental health; questionnaires; social media; statistical methods; students; surveys","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-09","",33913,""

"Multimorbidity, COVID-19 and Mental Health: Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) Longitudinal Analyses","This paper examines the longitudinal effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on older adults (65+) with multimorbidity on levels of depression, anxiety, and perceived global impact on their lives. Baseline (2011-2015) and Follow-up 1 (2015-2018) data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA), and the Baseline and Exit waves of the CLSA COVID-19 study (April-December, 2020) (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 18,099). Multimorbidity was measured using: a) an additive scale of chronic conditions; and b) six chronic disease clusters. Linear Mixed Models were employed to test hypotheses. Number of chronic conditions pre-pandemic was associated with pandemic levels of depression (estimateÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.40, 95% CI: [0.37,0.44]); anxiety (estimateÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.20, 95% CI: [0.18, 0.23]); and perceived negative impact of the pandemic (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.04, 95% CI: [1.02, 1.06]). The associations between multimorbidity and anxiety decreased during the period of the COVID-19 surveys (estimateÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.02, 95% CI: [-0.05, -0.01]); whereas the multimorbidity association with perceived impact increased (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.03, 95% CI: [1.01, 1.05]). This study demonstrates that pre-pandemic multimorbidity conditions are associated with worsening mental health. Clinicians treating mental health of older adults need to consider the joint effects of multimorbidity conditions and pandemic experiences to tailor counseling and other treatment protocols.","Wister, Li, Best, Cosco, Kim","https://doi.org/10.1080/07317115.2022.2094742","20220707","CLSA; COVID-19; Multimorbidity; mental health; older adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-09","",33916,""
"Psychological outcomes of COVID-19 survivors at sixth months after diagnose: the role of kynurenine pathway metabolites in depression, anxiety, and stress","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in long-term psychiatric symptoms because of the immunologic response to the virus itself as well as fundamental life changes related to the pandemic. This immune response leads to altered tryptophan (TRP)-kynurenine (KYN) pathway (TKP) metabolism, which plays an essential role in the pathophysiology of mental illnesses. We aimed to define TKP changes as a potential underlying mechanism of psychiatric disorders in post-COVID-19 patients. We measured plasma levels of several TKP markers, including KYN, TRP, kynurenic acid (KYNA), 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK), and quinolinic acid (QUIN), as well as the TRP/KYN, KYNA/3-HK, and KYNA/QUIN ratios, in 90 post-COVID-19 patients (on the first day of hospitalization) and 59 healthy controls (on the first admission to the Check-Up Center). An online questionnaire that included the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) was used 6 months after the initial assessment in both groups. A total of 32.2% of participants with COVID-19 showed depressive symptoms, 21.1% exhibited anxiety, and 33.3% had signs of stress at follow-up, while 6.6% of healthy controls exhibited depressive and anxiety symptoms and 18.6% had signs of stress. TRP and 3-HK were negative predictors of anxiety and stress, but KYN positively predicted anxiety and stress. Moreover,Ã‚Â TRP negatively predicted depression, while KYNA/3-HK was a negative predictor of anxiety. The correlation between depression, anxiety, and stress and TKP activation in COVID-19 could provide prospective biomarkers, especially the reduction in TRP and 3HK levels and the increase in KYN. Our results suggest that the alteration of TKP is not only a potential biomarker of viral infection-related long-term psychiatric disorders but also that the therapy targets future viral infections related to depression and anxiety.","Kucukkarapinar, Yay-Pence, Yildiz, Buyukkoruk, Yaz-Aydin, Deveci-Bulut, Gulbahar, Senol, Candansayar","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00702-022-02525-1","20220707","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Inflammation; Kynurenic acid; Kynurenine; Tryptophan","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-09","",33917,""
"Coping strategies and mental health: A web-based survey among the Italian population dealing with COVID-19","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continues to be a highly stressful event with a major impact on psychological mental health worldwide. The use of different coping strategies may change the perception of psychological well-being during the pandemic. The present study aims to explore psychological mental health in relation to sociodemographic variables and to analyze the coping strategies of the Italian population in dealing with COVID-19. Implications for clinical interventions are reported. A total of 537 individuals (&gt;18) participated in the survey completing measures of sociodemographic data, general psychological well-being, and coping strategies. Results found that females, students, and unmarried people reported the lowest levels of well-being. Specifically, the coping strategy called positive attitude was positively correlated with psychological well-being, whereas avoidance and social support strategies negatively influenced well-being. Understanding beneficial coping strategies is central to optimally manage the long-lasting of the current COVID-19 situation and may be useful for mental health professionals in treating patients suffering psychologically from the pandemic.","Rossi, De Salve, Agliati, Oasi","https://doi.org/10.4081/ripppo.2022.609","20220707","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-09","",33918,""
"Social determinants of mental health during a year of the COVID-19 pandemic","Belonging is a basic human need, with social isolation signaling a threat to biological fitness. Sensitivity to ostracism varies across individuals and the lifespan, peaking in adolescence. Government-imposed restrictions upon social interactions during COVID-19 may therefore be particularly detrimental to young people and those most sensitive to ostracism. Participants (<i>N</i> = 2367; 89.95% female, 11-100 years) from three countries with differing levels of government restrictions (Australia, UK, and USA) were surveyed thrice at three-month intervals (May 2020 - April 2021). Young people, and those living under the tightest government restrictions, reported the worst mental health, with these inequalities in mental health remaining constant throughout the study period. Further dissection of these results revealed that young people high on social rejection sensitivity reported the most mental health problems at the final assessment. These findings help account for the greater impact of enforced social isolation on young people's mental health, and open novel avenues for intervention.","Minihan, Orben, Songco, Fox, Ladouceur, Mewton, Moulds, Pfeifer, Van Harmelen, Schweizer","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0954579422000396","20220707","COVID-19; mental health; physical distancing; social connectedness; social rejection sensitivity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-09","",33919,""
"Assessment of Resilience Training for Hospital Employees in the Era of COVID-19","Health care workers face serious mental health challenges as a result of ongoing work stress. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated that stress, resulting in high rates of anxiety, depression, and burnout. To date, few evidence-based programs targeting mental health outcomes in health care workers have been described. To assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes of a skills-based coaching program designed to reduce stress and build resilience. A pilot cohort study was conducted between September 2020 and April 2021 using preprogram and postprogram assessments and a mixed-methods analysis. Duration of follow-up was 7 weeks. The coaching program was delivered via video conferencing. Participants were health care workers and staff from a large urban health system. The Promoting Resilience in Stress Management (PRISM) program, a manualized, skills-based coaching program originally developed for adolescents and young adults with serious/chronic illness, was adapted to support health care workers and staff (""PRISM at Work""). It included 6 weekly 1-hour group sessions. Feasibility was defined a priori as 70% completion rates. Acceptability was defined quantitatively (satisfaction scores) and qualitatively (open-ended questions regarding experience with program). Preliminary outcomes were assessed with preprogram and post program assessments of self-reported resilience, stress, anxiety, and burnout using validated instruments. Descriptive statistics summarized demographic variables and feasibility and acceptability. Linear mixed effects regression models examined preliminary outcomes, controlling for relevant covariates. A total of 153 participants (median [SD] age, 40.6 [10.1] years; 142 [92%] were female; 128 [84%] identified as having White race; 81 [53%] were in patient-facing roles) enrolled. Of the 132 health care workers who provided follow-up surveys, 120 (91%) had completed the program, and 116 (88%) reported being satisfied. Answers to open-ended questions suggested that participants wanted more PRISM either with longer or additional sessions.

"Social Support and Depressive Symptoms Among Adolescents During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Mediating Roles of Loneliness and Meaning in Life","Identifying which factors influence depressive symptom during the COVID-19 pandemic is highly significant for psychological crisis interventions among adolescents. Social support is likely to be one of the main factors. However, the underlying mechanism is still not well understood in the context of COVID-19. The current study examines whether loneliness and meaning in life mediate the association between social support and depressive symptoms in adolescents. A sample of 1,317 high school students in China were surveyed using the Perceived Social Support Scale, the Chinese Child Loneliness Scale, the Meaning in Life Questionnaire, and the Beck Depression Inventory-II. The results showed that social support predicted depressive symptoms directly and indirectly by enhancing loneliness and diminishing the sense of meaning in life. These findings help in providing new entry points in the design of effective depression prevention and intervention for adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Liu, Hu, Liu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.916898","20220708","adolescents; depressive symptoms; loneliness; meaning in life; social support; Adolescent; COVID-19; Child; Depression; Humans; Loneliness; Pandemics; Social Support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-09","",33921,""
"Associations of High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein and Interleukin-6 with Depression in a Sample of Italian Adolescents During COVID-19 Pandemic","Many studies highlighted the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of depression, although not for every patient nor for every symptom. It is widely shared that stressors can increase inflammation and lead to depressive symptoms. Little is known about the symptom-specificity of the inflammation-depression link in adolescence, which we aimed to explore. The single symptom analysis is a core feature of the recent network approach to depression, supposing that psychiatric disorders consist of co-occurring symptoms and their tendency to cause each other. We recruited 52 adolescents diagnosed with a Depressive Disorder during the COVID-19 stressful period. We used regression analysis to measure associations between high sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and depressive symptoms assessed by the Children's Depression Inventory 2 (CDI 2). For the study of symptom specificity, we selected 13 items from the CDI 2 Self Report corresponding with the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for Major Depressive Disorder and we coded them as dichotomous variables to perform a regression analysis. We found that a higher CDI 2-Parent Version total score was significantly predicted by higher hs-CRP (coefficient 3.393; <i>p</i> 0.0128) and IL-6 (coefficient 3.128; <i>p</i> 0.0398). The endorsement of the symptom self-hatred, measuring the DSM-5 symptom ""feelings of worthlessness"", was significantly predicted by hs-CRP (OR 10.97; 95% CI 1.29-93.08; <i>p</i> 0.0282). A novel symptom-specificity emerged, with hs-CRP significantly predicting the endorsement of the symptom self-hatred, recognized as a core feature of adolescent depression, following the network theory. We considered it a possible phenotypic expression of one depression endophenotype previously causally linked to inflammation. Due to the limited sample size, these preliminary findings require confirmation with future research focusing on the relationship between inflammation and self-hatred and other central nodes of the depression network, representing an opportunity for targeting interventions on crucial symptoms.","Serra, Presicci, Quaranta, Achille, Caputo, Medicamento, Margari, Croce, Margari","https://doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S362536","20220707","endophenotype; inflammation; network; self-hatred; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-09","",33922,""
"The Association Between Perceived Risk of COVID-19, Psychological Distress, and Internet Addiction in College Students: An Application of Stress Process Model","The closed-off management of the university during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may be associated with an elevated odds of psychological and behavioral issues among college students.

"Postintensive Care Syndrome-Family Associated With COVID-19 Infection","To assess the prevalence of and risk factors for postintensive care syndrome in family (PICS-F) in the COVID-19 era. A single-center retrospective study using questionnaires and telephone calls. An ICU at St. Luke's International Hospital. Patients who were treated for COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome between March 23, 2020, and September 30, 2021, and their family members participated. None. PICS-F refers to the psychologic distress such as anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) experienced by the patient's family. The primary outcome was PICS-F occurrence. Furthermore, factors related to PICS-F development were identified using statistical analysis. Of 85 patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to the ICU, 57 family members consented to the study and completed the survey, and 54 family members' data were analyzed. The median age of family members was 53.5 years, 68.5% were female, and 46.3% were spouses. The median age of patients was 55.5 years, and 83.3% were male. During their ICU stay, 68.5% received invasive mechanical ventilation, 11.1% received venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and 11.1% underwent tracheostomy. The median ICU and hospital stays were 7 and 22 days, respectively. Overall PICS-F occurred in 33%. Anxiety, depression, and PTSD occurred in 24%, 26%, and 4% of family members, respectively. The prevalence of all three components of PICS-F was 4%. Multivariable analysis showed that Family Satisfaction with the ICU Survey (FS-ICU) scores were independently associated with PICS-F development (odds ratio, 0.941; 95% CI, 0.891-0.983; <i>p</i> = 0.005). One-third of family members of COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU had symptoms of PICS-F. These results suggest that measurement of FS-ICU may be helpful as a predictor of PICS-F development. In addition, increasing the level of ICU care satisfaction of the family members may prevent PICS-F.","Shirasaki, Hifumi, Isokawa, Hashiuchi, Tanaka, Yanagisawa, Takahashi, Otani","https://doi.org/10.1097/CCE.0000000000000725","20220707","COVID-19; critical care; family; intensive care unit; postintensive care syndrome; questionnaire","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-09","",33924,""

"Children and Adolescents' Mental Health Following COVID-19: The Possible Role of Difficulty in Emotional Regulation","The COVID-19 pandemic has shattered routines throughout the world, creating closures and social isolation. Preliminary studies conducted during the pandemic have shown that children and adolescents are mainly affected by social distancing and the lack of a supportive framework. The purpose of the present study was to compare mental health symptoms of 430 children and adolescents who sought mental health services in the community before vs. during the pandemic. The study examined children's perceived burden of the pandemic, reports of emotional and behavioral problems (SDQ) anxiety (SCARED), depressed moods (SMFQ-C), and difficulty in emotional regulation (DERS), as well as intervening variables such as age and gender. Furthermore, the effect of difficulty in emotional regulation on children's mental health symptoms was explored. Findings indicate an increase in all mental health symptoms excluding anxiety, during the pandemic. Boys reported more difficulty in emotional regulation during the pandemic than before, and girls reported more emotional and behavioral problems. Children reported an increase in emotional and behavioral problems and adolescents in peer relationship problems. Difficulty in emotional regulation predicted all mental health symptoms in both samples, more so in girls and adolescents. These initial findings support the need for further studies to examine the long-term mental health effects of COVID-19 pandemic on children and adolescents.","Hen, Shenaar-Golan, Yatzker","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.865435","20220707","COVID-19; children; difficulties in emotion regulation; gender; mental symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-09","",33926,""
"The Severity of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress: Recommendations From Joint Work of Research Center and Psychology Clinics in COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the psychological stability of general population of Pakistan. However, research on the severity of COVID-19 induced depression, anxiety, and stress (DAS) in Pakistan is scarce. This paper thereby investigates the severity of COVID-19 induced DAS based on demographic, socioeconomic, and personal feeling variables by modeling DAS. Snowball sampling strategy was adopted to conduct online survey from July 03, 2021 to July 09, 2021. Out of 2,442, 2,069 responses from Karachi were included. Descriptive and inferential statistics (binary and multinomial logistic regression analysis) were performed using SPSS V21 (IBM, 2013) to identify significant determinants and their association with DAS severity. The result of this study indicates 27.8, 21.7, and 18.3% respondents suffer from severe and extremely severe states of depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. Binary logistic regression revealed that age is a significant determinant with odds of having 4.72 (95% CI = 1.86-11.97) and 5.86 (95% CI = 2.26-15.2) times greater depression, and stress for respondents aged 19-26 years. Moreover, gender-based difference is also observed with females 1.34 (95% CI = 1.08-1.68) and 1.75 (95% CI = 1.40-2.20) times more likely to exhibit anxiety and stress than males. Furthermore, marital status is a significant determinant of depression with odds of having depression is 0.67 (95% CI = 0.48-0.93) times greater for married population. Multinomial logistic regression revealed that those who believe COVID-19 pandemic has affected them mentally, fear new COVID-19 cases and deaths, depressed due to imposition of lockdown, believe they will not survive COVID-19 infection, and spend more time on social media gathering COVID-19 updates suffer from extremely severe state of depression (OR mental-effect-of-pandemic = 3.70, OR new-COVID-19-cases-and-deaths = 2.20, OR imposition-of-lockdown = 17.77, OR survival-probability = 8.17, OR time-on-social-media = 9.01), anxiety (OR mental-effect-of-pandemic = 4.78, OR new-COVID-19-cases-and-deaths = 3.52, OR imposition-of-lockdown = 5.06, OR survival-probability = 8.86, OR time-on-social-media = 5.12) and stress (OR mental-effect-of-pandemic = 6.07, OR imposition-of-lockdown = 11.38, OR survival-probability = 15.66, OR time-on-social-media = 4.39).

"Effects of Occupational Stress, Self-Efficacy and Mental Health During the Pandemic on Hospital Sanitation Workers in Malaysia","COVID-19 rapidly spread across the world, constituting a public health disaster unlike any other experienced in decades. The impact exerted on workplaces and their employees was dramatic, and an immense burden fell on healthcare provision globally. Along with ""front-line"" healthcare staff, sanitation workers at hospitals also had to cope with additional workloads, making them vulnerable to psychological trauma and affecting their quality of life at establishments. This study investigated how the factors of occupational stress, self-efficacy (belief in the capacity to carry out a task well) and mental health altered the WRQoL (Work-Related Quality of Life) of employees carrying out sanitation duties at hospitals in Malaysia. To this end, a survey translated into the Malay language was conducted among 449 such workers during a so-called ""recovery movement control order"", i.e. quarantine and control measures pertaining to an outbreak of Coronavirus disease. Research involved co-variance-based structural equation modeling, performed in IBM-AMOS-26 software, in order to discern the causal relationship of the aforementioned factors on WRQoL. Results revealed a high level of occupational stress, diminished self-efficacy and poor mental health among the employees surveyed. Such stress directly impacted the WRQoL of the second factor alongside an indirect effect on that of the third, i.e. anxiety stemming from potentially catching the virus and the experience of having to disinfect facilities for treating patients, undertake cleaning duties, and move corpses.","Nawal, Shoaib, ZÃƒÂ¡meÃ„ÂnÃƒÂ­k, Rehman","https://doi.org/10.1177/01632787221112079","20220707","hospital sanitation workers; mental health; occupational stress; pandemic; self-efficacy; work-related quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-09","",33928,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on the Post-operative Bariatric Surgery Patient Experience","To characterize patient and provider perceptions of the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on weight loss following bariatric surgery. COVID-19 has disrupted routines and healthcare throughout the United States, but its impact on bariatric surgery patients' postoperative experience is unknown. Semistructured interviews with bariatric surgery patients, primary care providers, and health psychologists were conducted from April to November 2020. As part of a secondary analysis, patients and providers described how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the postoperative experience within 3 domains: dietary habits, physical activity, and follow-up care. Interview guides were created from 2 conceptual models: Torain's Surgical Disparities Model and Andersen's Behavioral Model of Health Services Use. Study team members derived codes, which were grouped into themes using conventional content analysis. Thirty-four participants were interviewed: 24 patients (12 Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and 12 sleeve gastrectomy), 6 primary care providers, and 4 health psychologists. Patients were predominately female (83%) and White (79%). Providers were predominately female (90%) and White (100%). COVID-19 affected the postoperative bariatric surgery patient experience via 3 mechanisms: (1) it disrupted dietary and physical activity routines due to facility closures and fear of COVID-19 exposure; (2) it required patients to transition their follow-up care to telemedicine delivery; and (3) it increased stress due to financial and psychosocial challenges. COVID-19 has exacerbated patient vulnerability. The pandemic is not over, thus bariatric surgery patients need ongoing support to access mental health professionals, develop new physical activity routines, and counteract increased food insecurity.","Murtha, Alagoz, Breuer, Eierman, Jawara, Farrar-Edwards, Voils, Funk","https://doi.org/10.1097/SLA.0000000000005446","20220707","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-09","",33929,""
"Mathematical modeling of the impact of Omicron variant on the COVID-19 situation in South Korea","The rise of newer coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) variants has brought a challenge to ending the spread of COVID-19. The variants have a different fatality, morbidity, and transmission rates and affect vaccine efficacy differently. Therefore, the impact of each new variant on the spread of COVID-19 is of interest to governments and scientists. Here, we proposed mathematical SEIQRDVP and SEIQRDV3P models to predict the impact of the Omicron variant on the spread of the COVID-19 situation in South Korea. SEIQEDVP considers one vaccine level at a time while SEIQRDV3P considers three vaccination levels (only one dose received, full doses received, and full doses + booster shots received) simultaneously. The omicron variant's effect was contemplated as a weighted sum of the delta and omicron variants' transmission rate and tuned using a hyperparameter k. Our models' performances were compared with common models like SEIR, SEIQR, and SEIQRDVUP using the root mean square error (RMSE). SEIQRDV3P performed better than the SEIQRDVP model. Without consideration of the variant effect, we don't see a rapid rise in COVID-19 cases and high RMSE values. But, with consideration of the omicron variant, we predicted a continuous rapid rise in COVID-19 cases until maybe herd immunity is developed in the population. Also, the RMSE value for the SEIQRDV3P model decreased by 27.4%. Therefore, modeling the impact of any new risen variant is crucial in determining the trajectory of the spread of COVID-19 and determining policies to be implemented.","Oh, Apio, Park","https://doi.org/10.5808/gi.22025","20220706","COVID-19; Omicron; SARS-COV-2; mathematical models; variant","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-09","",33930,""
"Predicting panel attrition in longitudinal HRQoL surveys during the COVID-19 pandemic in the US","Online longitudinal surveys may be subject to potential biases due to sample attrition. This study was designed to identify potential predictors of attrition using a longitudinal panel survey collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Three waves of data were collected using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), an online crowd-sourced platform. For each wave, the study sample was collected by referencing a US national representative sample distribution of age, gender, and race, based on US census data. Variables included respondents' demographics, medical history, socioeconomic status, COVID-19 experience, changes of health behavior, productivity, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Results were compared to pre-pandemic US norms. Measures that predicted attrition at different times of the pandemic were identified via logistic regression with stepwise selection. 1467 of 2734 wave 1 respondents participated in wave 2 and, 964 of 2454 wave 2 respondents participated in wave 3. Younger age group, Hispanic origin (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and higher self-rated survey difficulty (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.002) consistently predicted attrition in the following wave. COVID-19 experience, employment, productivity, and limited physical activities were commonly observed variables correlated with attrition with specific measures varying by time periods. From wave 1, mental health conditions, average daily hours worked (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.004), and COVID-19 impact on work productivity (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) were associated with a higher attrition rate at wave 2, additional to the aforementioned factors. From wave 2, support of social distancing (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.032), being Republican (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), and having just enough money to make ends meet (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.003) were associated with predicted attrition at wave 3. Attrition in this longitudinal panel survey was not random. Besides commonly identified demographic factors that contribute to panel attrition, COVID-19 presented novel opportunities to address sample biases by correlating attrition with additional behavioral and HRQoL factors in a constantly evolving environment. While age, ethnicity, and survey difficulty consistently predicted attrition, other factors, such as COVID-19 experience, changes of employment, productivity, physical health, mental health, and financial situation impacted panel attrition during the pandemic at various degrees.","Yu, Chen, Gu, Hay, Gong","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12955-022-02015-8","20220708","COVID-19; Panel attrition; Quality of life; COVID-19; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Pandemics; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-09","",33931,""
"Demographic Predictors of Telehealth Use for Integrated Psychological Services in Primary Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, growing mental health needs were well documented, particularly those of diverse patient populations. The current study aims to better understand racial and psychosocial factors associated with patient utilization of integrated psychological services via telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic within a diverse primary care clinic. Retrospective chart reviews were completed for patients seen by an integrated psychology team within a general internal medicine clinic at a large urban health system during the year 2020. Demographics were extracted from the medical record. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine demographic predictors for (1) telehealth video visits vs. audio only telehealth visits and (2) in-person vs. telehealth visits (both video and audio). Older patients, Black patients, and those with Medicare and Medicaid were more likely to complete audio only telehealth visits vs. video visits. There were no significant demographic predictors when comparing in-person vs. telehealth (both video and audio). Some underserved and vulnerable patient populations are more likely to utilize audio-onlyÃ‚Â integrated psychological visits to video visits. The utilization of audio visits over video for certain demographics speaks to the need to better understand how this type of care may benefit psychological services in the future and continued advocacy to extend audio mental health visits beyond the public health emergency to address patient populations with significant mental health needs.","Tobin, Hadwiger, DiChiara, Entz, Miller-Matero","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-022-01334-2","20220706","Integrated care; Psychology; Telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-09","",33932,""
"A synergistic mindsets intervention protects adolescents from stress","Social-evaluative stressors-experiences in which people feel they could be judged negatively-pose a major threat to adolescent mental health<sup>1-3</sup> and can cause young people to disengage from stressful pursuits, resulting in missed opportunities to acquire valuable skills. Here we show that replicable benefits for the stress responses of adolescents can be achieved with a short (around 30-min), scalable 'synergistic mindsets' intervention. This intervention, which is a self-administered online training module, synergistically targets both growth mindsets<sup>4</sup> (the idea that intelligence can be developed) and stress-can-be-enhancing mindsets<sup>5</sup> (the idea that one's physiological stress response can fuel optimal performance). In six double-blind, randomized, controlled experiments that were conducted with secondary and post-secondary students in the UnitedÃ‚Â States, the synergistic mindsets intervention improved stress-related cognitions (study 1, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2,717; study 2, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°755), cardiovascular reactivity (study 3, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°160; study 4, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°200), daily cortisol levels (study 5, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°118 students, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1,213 observations), psychological well-being (studies 4 and 5), academic success (study 5) and anxiety symptoms during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdowns (study 6, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°341). Heterogeneity analyses (studies 3, 5 and 6) and a four-cell experiment (study 4) showed that the benefits of the intervention depended on addressing both mindsets-growth and stress-synergistically.

"Evaluation of pain, disease activity, anxiety, depression, and neuropathic pain levels after COVID-19 infection in fibromyalgia patients","Psychological stressors may cause mental disorders such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorders and fibromyalgia (FM) patients could be affected by these stressors. To evaluate pain, disease activity, anxiety, depression, and neuropathic pain levels after COVID-19 infection in patients with FM. According to the 2016 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, fifty-seven patients with FM alone and 77 patients with FM and recovering from COVID-19 infection were recruited to the study (group 1: patients with FM alone and group 2: patients with FM and recovering from COVID-19). Demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded. The pain level was determined by the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), the pain regions by the Widespread Pain Index (WPI) of the 2016 ACR criteria, the severity of the symptoms by the Symptom Severity Scale (SSS) of the 2016 ACR criteria, the disease activity by the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), the anxiety and depression levels by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the neuropathic pain level by Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs Pain Scale (LANSS). Age, height, weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), and the duration of FM diagnosis were similar in both groups (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). NRS, FIQ, HADS depression scale, and SSS and LANSS scores were similar between group 1 and group 2 (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). HADS anxiety score and WPI were significantly increased in group 2 (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.026 and pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.024 respectively).

"Changes in Internalizing Symptoms During the COVID-19 Pandemic in a Transdiagnostic Sample of Youth: Exploring Mediators and Predictors","The COVID-19 pandemic is a chronically stressful event, particularly for youth. Here, we examine (i) changes in mood and anxiety symtpoms, (ii) pandemic-related stress as a mediator of change in symptoms, and (ii) threat processing biases as a predictor of increased anxiety during the pandemic. A clinically well-characterized sample of 81 youth ages 8-18Ã‚Â years (MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°13.8Ã‚Â years, SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.65; 40.7% female) including youth with affective and/or behavioral psychiatric diagnoses and youthÃ‚Â without psychopathology completed pre- and during pandemic assessments of anxiety and depression and COVID-related stress. Forty-six youth also completed a threat processing fMRI task pre-pandemic. Anxiety and depression significantly increased during the pandemic (all psÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Significant symptom change was partially mediated by pandemic stress and worries. Increased prefrontal activity in response to neutral faces pre-pandemic was associated with more intense parent-reported anxiety during the pandemic (all Fs(1.95,81.86)Ã¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°14.44, psÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001).

"An intersectional approach to identifying factors associated with anxiety and depression following the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting mental health, with some populations bearing a greater burden. In this cross-sectional online study, we examined the personal and intersectional factors associated with increased symptoms of anxiety and depression following the COVID-19 pandemic. We assessed pre- and post-pandemic levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 (GAD-2) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scales, respectively. The study included 1847 participants, with an age range of 18 to 79Ã‚Â years and representing 43 countries. Variables with significance (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05) in predicting post-pandemic GAD-2 and PHQ-9 scores were pre-pandemic scores on the same scales, an interaction between increasing age and non-man gender, and an interaction between non-man gender and having children.

"Changes in lifestyles and depressive symptom among patients with chronic diseases during COVID-19 lockdown","This study aims to investigate the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on lifestyle behaviors and depressive symptom among patients with NCDs (noncommunicable diseases). We incorporated a COVID-19 survey to the WELL China cohort, a prospective cohort study with the baseline survey conducted 8-16Ã‚Â months before the COVID-19 outbreak in Hangzhou, China. The COVID-19 survey was carried out to collect information on lifestyle and depressive symptom during lockdown. A total of 3327 participants were included in the COVID-19 survey, including 2098 (63.1%) reported having NCDs at baseline and 1457 (44%) without NCDs. The prevalence of current drinkers decreased from 42.9% before COVID-19 lockdown to 23.7% during lockdown, current smokers from 15.9 to 13.5%, and poor sleepers from 23.9 to 15.3%, while low physical activity increased from 13.4 to 25.2%, among participants with NCDs (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05 for all comparisons using McNemar's test). Participants with NCDs were more likely than those without to have depressive symptom (OR, 1.30; 95% CI 1.05-1.61), especially among those who need to refill their medication during the COVID-19 lockdown (OR, 1.52; 95% CI 1.15-2.02).

"Systematic review of mental health symptom changes by sex or gender in early-COVID-19 compared to pre-pandemic","Women and gender-diverse individuals have faced disproportionate socioeconomic burden during COVID-19. There have been reports of greater negative mental health changes compared to men based on cross-sectional research that has not accounted for pre-COVID-19 differences.

"Psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in community pharmacists: A longitudinal study","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has negatively affected the mental health of frontline health care workers, including pharmacists. The aim of this longitudinal study was to assess the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in French owner community pharmacists. We conducted a postal-based survey to assess the psychological difficulties of the COVID-19 outbreak in French owner community pharmacists based on 3 psychologically validated self-report questionnaires: Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Impact of Event Scale-revised (IES-R), and Maslach Burnout Inventory. The baseline assessment was during the first sanitary lockdown period and the second one 5 months later. The sample consists of 135 owner community pharmacists. At follow-up, 67 answered the questionnaires (response rate: 49.6%). The mean scores of the PSS and IES-R significantly decreased (PÃ‚Â = 0.002). Fifteen pharmacists reported significant posttraumatic stress symptoms (23.1%) at baseline and 11 at follow-up (16.4%, PÃ‚Â = 0.02). Age and sex were not significantly associated with persistent posttraumatic stress or burnout symptoms. This is the first longitudinal study that showed the psychological impact of owner community pharmacists as health care workers dealing with their community's COVID-19 outbreak. Based on validated self-report questionnaires, stress, posttraumatic stress, and burnout symptoms decreased during follow-up. It is necessary to continue monitoring psychological difficulties for health care workers, especially during consecutive waves of the COVID-19 outbreak.","Lange, Licaj, Boulouard, Garon, Richard, Le Bas, Salmon, Stroiazzo, Le Bas, Humbert","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.japh.2021.12.004","20220708","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-09","",33939,""
"Toward an accurate assessment of tourism economic impact: A systematic literature review","Tourism is acknowledged as a contributor to destination economies in many countries. However, COVID-19 has devastated the tourism industry in numerous national economies. Although the economic impact of tourism on destinations has been examined in a large body of tourism literature, most studies have utilized the tourism-led economic growth hypothesis and traditional methods and data rather than cutting-edge economic methods. This study conducts a systematic literature review on tourism economic impact between 1975 and 2020, analyzing the general bibliometrics and examining the key themes and methods of assessing tourism economic impact. It contributes to an accurate assessment of tourism economic impact, works to identify gaps in the literature, highlights emerging trends in the field, and proposes directions for future research.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annale.2022.100054","20221101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-09","",33940,""
"Experiences of suffering among nursing professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic: A descriptive qualitative study","Background and aim Healthcare professionals have played a fundamental role in managing and controlling the COVID-19 health crisis. They are exposed to high levels of suffering, trauma, uncertainty, and powerlessness in the workplace. The objective of this study was to explore and understand experiences of suffering among primary care and hospital care nurses during the COVID-19 health crisis. Design This is a descriptive qualitative study. Between March and April 2021, 19 in-depth interviews were carried out with nurses at health and social care facilities and hospitals in southern Spain. ATLAS.ti 9.0 software was used for discourse analysis. Results Nurses reported that they had experienced suffering during their work in the pandemic. The main causes suggested were direct contact with patients' suffering and organisational difficulties. The repercussions are in emotional dimension and physical deterioration and social isolation. Conclusion and implications Given the circumstances, programmes to promote healthy, compassion-based behaviours and changes to the way in which professionals' suffering is handled must be implemented by healthcare facility managers. Nursing leaders should consider the management of suffering as a matter of the first order, both from the ethical point of view and the business profitability and make compassionate leadership.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnr.2022.151603","20220801","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-09","",33941,""

This study uses a non-experimental descriptive survey design to answer descriptive questions on how participants rated their experience with telehealth as a standalone service delivery method in private practice settings. When patients experience quality care, they are more likely to return for future services and refer others. Quality experiences do correlate with positive financial performance, and this study describes how patients are rating their experience. The survey in this study contained Likert Scale questions, and the researcher used cross-tabulation and pivot tables to describe how participants responded to the survey. Results from this study are intended to provide insight into telehealth acceptance and effectiveness. This study also provides a foundation for further research to discover participant perceptions and examine participant responses as it relates to telehealth as a standalone mode of treatment in a private practice setting.","Tyronne Anthony West","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E00E5-F37-E58","20220708","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-09","",33963,""
"Prospective, directional associations between Social Media Intensity, Loneliness, and Anxiety among Peruvian Adolescents during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The impact of social media on adolescent mental health is an area of intense interest and controversy, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic has increased youthâ€™s reliance on online communications. Current evidence, mostly from cross-sectional studies in the Global North, is mixed. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between social media and mental health in adolescents in PerÃº across 15 months of COVID-19 lockdowns. In this observational study, we first examined associations between social media intensity (SMI), feelings of loneliness, and anxiety at the beginning of the pandemic (May 2020) in 1603 early adolescents (10 â€“ 14 years). Hypotheses of a positive association between all outcomes, particularly for girls, were derived from exploring one half of the sample (n =807), preregistered, and then confirmed in the second half of the sample (n = 806). In May 2020, SMI was associated with more frequent loneliness for girls, and SMI was associated with more frequent anxiety for both sexes. In a longitudinal follow up (n = 455) we then investigated prospective and directional associations across three waves (May 2020, November 2020, and July 2021). Longitudinal analyses revealed a more complex pattern. Across 15 months of COVID-19 in PerÃº, feelings of loneliness in girls were associated with an increase in SMI. In contrast, higher SMI among girls was associated with an increase in feelings of anxiety. We did not find the reverse relationships. Our findings with early adolescents in low-and middle-income urban settings in Latin America, an underrepresented population, underscore the importance of longitudinal research and contribute to understanding these important issues globally.","Elizabeth Sherwin et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E00DF-48B-5C0","20220707","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; loneliness; longitudinal; latin america; latent change score; peru; anxiety; social media; adolescence","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-09","",33964,""
"Promoting Daily Well-being in Adolescents using mHealth","Adolescents are at increased risk for developing mental health problems. The Grow It! app is an mHealth intervention aimed at preventing mental health problems through improving coping by cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-inspired challenges as well as self-monitoring of emotions through Experience Sampling Methods (ESM). Yet, little is known about daily changes in well-being and coping during a stressful period, like the COVID-19 pandemic. The current study aimed to elucidate daily changes in positive and negative affect, and adaptive coping, and to better understand the within-personâ€™s mechanisms of the Grow It! app. The sample consisted of 12-25-year old Dutch adolescents in two independent cohorts (cohort 1: N = 476, Mage=16.24, 76.1% female, 88.7% Dutch; cohort 2: N = 814, Mage=18.45, 82.8% female, 97.2% Dutch). ESM were used to measure daily positive and negative affect and coping (cohort 1: 42 days, 210 assessments per person; cohort 2: 21 days, 105 assessments). The results showed that, on average, adolescents decreased in daily positive affect and adaptive coping, and increased in their experienced negative affect. A positive relation between adaptive coping and positive affect was found, although independent of the CBT-based challenges. Latent class analysis identified two heterogeneous trajectories for both positive and negative affect, indicating that the majority of participants with low to moderate-risk on developing mental health problems were likely to benefit from the Grow It! app.","Michelle M.J.
