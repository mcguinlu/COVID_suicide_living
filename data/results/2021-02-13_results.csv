"Effects of non-drug interventions on depression, anxiety and sleep in COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) suffer from anxiety, depression and sleep disorders due to isolation treatment, among other reasons. Whether non-drug interventions can be alternative therapies for COVID-19 patients with anxiety, depression and sleep disorders is controversial. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis and systematic review to evaluate the effects of non-drug interventions on anxiety, depression and sleep in patients with COVID-19 to provide guidance for clinical application. We searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from December 2019 to July 2020: China Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chongqing VIP Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP), Wanfang, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PubMed, MEDLINE and Embase. Two investigators independently screened the literature according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, extracted data and evaluated the risk of bias in the included studies. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan5.3 software. A total of 5 articles with 768 subjects were included. Meta-analysis results indicated that non-drug interventions can reduce anxiety [SMD=-1.40, 95% CI (-1.62, -1.17), p&lt;0.00001] and depression [SMD=-1.22, 95% CI (-2.01, -0.43), p=0.002] scores in patients with COVID-19. Descriptive analysis indicated that non-drug interventions can improve the sleep status of COVID-19 patients. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the meta-analysis results were stable. Egger's test and Begg's test showed no publication bias. This meta-analysis found that non-drug interventions can reduce the anxiety and depression scores of patients with COVID-19. Due to the limitations of this study, more high-quality studies are needed to verify the findings, especially the effect of non-drug interventions on improving the sleep status of COVID-19 patients.","Ding, He, Lu, Hao, Fan","https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202101_24679","20210212","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-13","",10702,""
"Mindfulness in Pediatrics: Practices to Improve Clinician and Patient Mental Health and Enhance Well-Being","Children and adolescents with symptoms of mental health disorders often present to primary care settings. In the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, mental health symptoms in children, adolescents, families, and health care clinicians are rising. Mindfulness is an approach to improve both mental and physical health that can be practiced freely in any circumstance. Although not a panacea, research does support the use of mindfulness-based practices not only to improve overall well-being but also to address a variety of symptoms and diagnoses in numerous populations. This review defines mindfulness, describes the current state of the literature, outlines ways to support youth and families in cultivating and applying mindfulness in their daily lives, and provides guidance for health care clinicians on how to begin a personal practice to support their own health and well-being.

"Trends in US Pediatric Hospital Admissions in 2020 Compared With the Decade Before the COVID-19 Pandemic","In early 2020, the United States declared a public health emergency in response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and implemented a variety of social distancing measures. The association between the COVID-19 pandemic and the number of pediatric admissions is unclear. To determine the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with the prior decade. This cross-sectional study included 49 US hospitals contributing to the Pediatric Health Information Systems database. Inpatient admissions were transformed into time-series data, and ensemble forecasting models were generated to analyze admissions across a range of diagnoses in 2020 compared with previous years. The setting was inpatient admissions. All patients discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020, from an inpatient hospital encounter were included. Number of hospital admissions by primary diagnosis for each encounter. Of 5Ã¢â‚¬Â¯424Ã¢â‚¬Â¯688 inpatient encounters among 3Ã¢â‚¬Â¯372Ã¢â‚¬Â¯839 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 5.1 [0.7-13.3] years; 2Ã¢â‚¬Â¯823Ã¢â‚¬Â¯748 [52.1%] boys; 3Ã¢â‚¬Â¯171Ã¢â‚¬Â¯224 [58.5%] White individuals) at 49 hospitals, 213Ã¢â‚¬Â¯571 (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019. At the nadir, admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years (23Ã¢â‚¬Â¯798 in April 2020 compared with a median [interquartile range] of 43Ã¢â‚¬Â¯550 [42Ã¢â‚¬Â¯110-43Ã¢â‚¬Â¯946] in April 2010-2019). Inflation-adjusted hospital charges decreased 27.7% in the second quarter of 2020 compared with prior years ($4Ã¢â‚¬Â¯327Ã¢â‚¬Â¯580Ã¢â‚¬Â¯511 in 2020 compared with a median [interquartile range] of $5Ã¢â‚¬Â¯983Ã¢â‚¬Â¯142Ã¢â‚¬Â¯102 [$5Ã¢â‚¬Â¯762Ã¢â‚¬Â¯690Ã¢â‚¬Â¯022-$6Ã¢â‚¬Â¯324Ã¢â‚¬Â¯978Ã¢â‚¬Â¯456] in 2010-2019). Seasonal patterns were evident between 2010 and 2019 for a variety of common pediatric conditions, including asthma, atrial septal defects, bronchiolitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health admissions, and trauma. Ensemble models were able to discern seasonal patterns in admission diagnoses and accurately predicted admission rates from July 2019 until December 2019 but not from January 2020 to June 2020. All diagnoses except for birth decreased below the model 95% CIs between January 2020 and June 2020. In this cross-sectional study, pediatric admissions to US hospitals decreased in 2020 across an array of pediatric conditions. Although some conditions may have decreased in incidence, others may represent unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Pelletier, Rakkar, Au, Fuhrman, Clark, Horvat","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.37227","20210212","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-13","",10704,""
"Effects of anxiety sensitivity, disgust, and intolerance of uncertainty on the COVID stress syndrome: a longitudinal assessment of transdiagnostic constructs and the behavioural immune system","Excessive fear and worry in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., COVID stress syndrome) is prevalent and associated with various adverse outcomes. Research from the current and past pandemics supports the association between transdiagnostic constructs-anxiety sensitivity (AS), disgust, and intolerance of uncertainty (IU)-and pandemic-related distress. Recent research suggests a moderating effect of disgust on the relationship of AS-physical concerns and COVID-19-related distress, suggesting that transdiagnostic constructs underlie individual differences in activation of the behavioral immune system (BIS). No previous study has examined the independent and conjoint effects of pre-COVID-19 AS-physical concerns, disgust propensity (DP), disgust sensitivity (DS), and IU in this context; thus, we did so using longitudinal survey data (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 3,062 Canadian and American adults) with simple and moderated moderations controlling for gender, mental health diagnosis, and COVID-19 diagnosis. Greater AS-physical concerns, DP, and DS predicted more severe COVID stress syndrome assessed one month later. Either DP or DS further amplified the effect of AS-physical concerns on COVID stress syndrome, except danger and contamination fears. IU did not interact with AS-physical concerns and DS or DP. Theoretical and clinical implications pertaining to delivery of cognitive behavioural therapy for pandemic-related distress are discussed.","Paluszek, Asmundson, Landry, McKay, Taylor, Asmundson","https://doi.org/10.1080/16506073.2021.1877339","20210212","COVID-19; anxiety; anxiety sensitivity; behavioral immune system; covid stress syndrome; disgust; intolerance of uncertainty; pandemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-13","",10705,""
"Depression and Health-Related Quality of Life Among Elderly Patients during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Israel: A Cross-sectional Study","This study aims to assess how optimism, social support, and perceived susceptibility are associated with depressive symptoms and health-related quality of life among elderly patients during the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel. In a cross-sectional study, 256 participants age 60 through 95 completed the following self-administered questionnaires: Perceived Susceptibility, Life Orientation Test (LOT-R), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), Symptoms of Depression (CES-D) and health-related quality of life (SF-12v2 Health Survey). Data were collected from June to July 2020, 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°months after the COVID-19 state of emergency was declared in Israel. Participants were interviewed by family medicine residents via telephone. Statistical analyses included Pearson correlations, <i>t</i>-tests between groups, regression analyses, and Hayes' PROCESS to analyze a moderated mediation model. Of the elderly participants, 37.5% were classified as having depression. Optimism, social support and health-related quality of life were positively associated. Higher optimism and social support were related to lower perceived susceptibility and lower depression. Results of a multivariate regression explained 29% of the variance in depression and 19% of the variance in health-related quality of life. The relationships assessed by 4 Process models were significant, such that higher optimism and social support were related to lower perceived susceptibility, which in turn was related to higher depression and lower health-related quality of life. Optimism and social support may be effective in coping with challenges and buffering depression. Perceived susceptibility may mediate the association of optimism and social support with higher depression and lower health-related quality of life. The conclusions of this study underscore the need to treat depression among older adults during this period. Hence, healthcare providers should also support elderly patients living at home. In giving this type of help, healthcare providers should strive to increase social support and optimism among older adults.","Levkovich, Shinan-Altman, Essar Schvartz, Alperin","https://doi.org/10.1177/2150132721995448","20210212","COVID-19; depression; health-related quality of life; older adults; optimism perceived susceptibility; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-13","",10706,""
"Mental Health Staff Perceptions of Improvement Opportunities around COVID-19: A Mixed-Methods Analysis","While COVID-19 has had widespread impact on the way behavioral health services are delivered, very little research exists characterizing how providers have perceived these changes. This study used mixed-methods to understand the complex and varied experiences of staff of a psychiatric service line at a large tertiary medical center with high community spread of COVID-19. A brief convenience survey was sent to all staff of the service line and thematic analysis generated brief themes and their frequency. Qualitative focus groups were then held to elucidate greater detail on survey responses. In total, 99 individuals responded to the survey and 17 individuals attended two focus groups in which theoretical saturation was achieved. While brief survey responses generated three broad themes, including operations, telehealth and technology, and communication, focus group data provided nuanced information about these themes, including reasons underlying heightened stress and fatigue felt by staff, inadequacy of technology while finding innovative approaches for its use, and appreciation for the benefits of telehealth while expressing concern for patients not served well by it. These mixed-methods findings highlight the complexities of implementing widespread changes during COVID-19 and demonstrate how survey and focus group data can be used to evaluate rapid care transformations driven by COVID-19.","Bommersbach, Dube, Li","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-021-09890-2","20210212","Clinical practice; Health services delivery; Multidisciplinary care; Quality improvement; Staff perceptions; Stress and coping","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-13","",10707,""
"[The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the care provision for people with mental health problems]","There are increasingly comprehensive data on recognition of the psychological impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVIDÃ‚Â 19) pandemic on global populations. In most regions of the world, the economic and psychological burden on the general population and persons with mental disorders has risen sharply over the course of the pandemic. Beyond anxieties regarding severe acute respiratory syndromes due to coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, in many countries the measures for containing the pandemic also led to psychological burdens. It was shown that social distancing and contact restrictions were risk factors for the development or deterioration of mental health problems on aÃ‚Â global scale. Simultaneously, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted or reduced mental health services in many countries. Thus, there is a substantial need for low threshold offers of assistance and for coping strategies. Current studies could show that certain coping strategies, such as virtual social contacts and physical activity, appear to be useful in counteracting the negative psychological sequelae of the pandemic; however, in order to improve care provision for people with psychological burden and mental illness in the medium term, it is necessary to offer targeted treatment, such as online psychotherapy in particular. Collaborative research tackles poverty, social isolation and loneliness. Mit zunehmend umfangreicheren Daten zu den psychischen Folgen der Coronavirus-disease-2019(COVID-19)-Pandemie wird deutlich, dass die psychische Belastung der BevÃƒÂ¶lkerung durch die Pandemie in vielen Regionen der Welt stark zugenommen hat. Neben der Angst vor einer Infektion mit dem Ã¢â‚¬Å¾severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirusÃ‚Â 2Ã¢â‚¬Å“ (SARS-CoV-2) fÃƒÂ¼hren vielerorts auch die MaÃƒÅ¸nahmen zur EindÃƒÂ¤mmung der Pandemie zu psychischen Belastungen. So wurde gezeigt, dass soziale Distanzierung und KontaktbeschrÃƒÂ¤nkungen Risikofaktoren fÃƒÂ¼r die Entstehung oder Verschlechterung psychischer StÃƒÂ¶rungen sind. Gleichzeitig hat sich die Versorgung von Menschen mit psychischen StÃƒÂ¶rungen wÃƒÂ¤hrend der Pandemie oft verschlechtert, sodass ein erheblicher Bedarf an niedrigschwelligen Hilfsangeboten und BewÃƒÂ¤ltigungsstrategien besteht. Aktuelle Studien konnten zeigen, dass bestimmte Coping-Strategien wie virtuelle soziale Kontakte und kÃƒÂ¶rperliche AktivitÃƒÂ¤t den negativen psychischen Folgen der Pandemie entgegenwirken kÃƒÂ¶nnen. Um jedoch mittelfristig die Unterversorgung psychisch belasteter und erkrankter Personen zu reduzieren, bedarf es einer gezielten Ausweitung des Behandlungsangebots, insbesondere der Onlinepsychotherapie, sowie der FÃƒÂ¶rderung von MaÃƒÅ¸nahmen, die Armut oder soziale Isolation verhindern.","Liu, Heinz, Haucke, Heinzel","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00115-021-01068-2","20210212","Coping strategies; Mental health; Prevention policy; Social isolation; Virtual social networking and physical activity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-13","",10708,""
"Deaths in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention: FY2018-2020","Many civil liberties organizations have raised concerns that substandard medical care in United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facilities have led to preventable deaths. The 2018 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Bill required ICE to make public all reports regarding in-custody deaths within 90 days beginning in Fiscal Year (FY) 2018. Accordingly, ICE has released death reports following each in-custody death since April of 2018. This study describes characteristics of deaths among individuals in ICE detention following the FY2018 mandate. Data was extracted from death reports published by ICE following the FY2018 mandate. Causes of death were categorized as suicide or medical, and medical deaths as COVID-19-related or not. Characteristics were compared between medical and suicide deaths, and among medical deaths between COVID-19-related and non-COVID-19-related deaths. Additionally, death rates per person-year and per 100,000 admissions were calculated for FY2018, 2019, and 2020 using methods from prior work evaluating deaths among detained immigrants in the United States. Since April 2018, 35 individuals have died in ICE detention. The death rate per 100,000 admissions in ICE detention was 2.303 in FY2018, 1.499 in FY2019, and 10.833 in FY2020. Suicide by hanging was identified as the cause of death in 9 (25.7%), and medical causes in the remaining 26 (74.3%). Among 26 deaths attributable to medical causes, 8 (30.8%) were attributed to COVID-19, representing 72.7% of 11 deaths occurring since April 2020. The death rate among individuals in ICE detention is increasing amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Potentially preventable causes of death including COVID-19 and suicide contribute to at least half of recent deaths. Findings suggest that individuals detained by ICE may benefit from improved psychiatric care and prevention measures to combat suicide, as well as increased infection control efforts to reduce mortality associated with COVID-19.","Terp, Ahmed, Burner, Ross, Grassini, Fischer, Parmar","https://doi.org/10.3934/publichealth.2021006","20210212","COVID-19; custodial health; immigration health; infectious diseases; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-13","",10709,""

The objective of this study was to review the psychosocial implication of quarantine and lockdown among Indian community who are facing a double burden of mental and economic crisis. Databases for relevant studies were searched in PubMed and Google Scholar with key term &quot;quarantine,&quot; &quot;mental health,&quot; &quot;lockdown,&quot; and &quot;psychosocial.&quot; Few newspaper reports related to quarantine and psychosocial implication have also incorporated. Home and facility quarantine were imposed on people in order to control and check the spread of this infectious disease. This strict imposition not just led to various other counter effects that were negative in nature, but it is predicted to have long-lasting social, economic, and psychological effects too. As social diversities lead to varied mental health adversities, a broader umbrella needs to be created in order to protect every community dealing with mental health issues due to the pandemic. In order to address the mental issues of the vulnerable classes, the issue still remains untouched, and this leaves us with a question of are we doing enough for each individual.

Interval chest radiography is recommended following community-acquired pneumonia; however, its utility in monitoring recovery from COVID-19 pneumonia remains unclear. This was a prospective single-centre observational cohort study. Patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19 pneumonia (admission duration Ã¢â€°Â¥48Ã¢â‚¬â€¦h and oxygen requirement Ã¢â€°Â¥40% or critical care admission) underwent face-to-face assessment at 4-6Ã¢â‚¬â€¦weeks post-discharge. The primary outcome was radiological resolution of COVID-19 pneumonitis (Radiographic Assessment of Lung Oedema score &lt;5). Secondary outcomes included clinical outcomes, symptom questionnaires, mental health screening (Trauma Screening Questionnaire, seven-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder assessment and nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire) and physiological testing (4-m gait speed (4MGS) and 1-min Sit-to-Stand (STS) tests). 119 patients were assessed between June 3, 2020 and July 2, 2020 at median (interquartile range (IQR)) 61 (51-67)Ã¢â‚¬â€¦days post-discharge: meanÃ‚Â±sd age 58.7Ã‚Â±14.4Ã¢â‚¬â€¦years, median (IQR) body mass index 30.0 (25.9-35.2)Ã¢â‚¬â€¦kgÃ‚Â·m<sup>-2</sup>, 62% male and 70% ethnic minority.

"COVID-19 and Emotional Variables in a Sample of Chileans","During the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, a set of daily stressors are being experienced, all this affects people's mental health, leading them to have a set of emotional disturbances. Little is known about how people's age can influence their emotional well-being in the face of prolonged stress generate by the pandemic. To clarify the presence of emotional aspects such as emotional expressiveness and the frequency of positive and negative affections in people with different age in times of crisis. The final sample included 297 Chileans between 22 and 68 years old (<i>M</i> = 38.51, <i>SD</i> = 13.85), recruited through an online survey with the appropriate written informed consent. The study was carried out when the pandemic was spreading in Chile. The findings revealed age differences in emotional expressivity and the type of affections experienced. The expression of emotions was more affected by negative affections, the age and the gender of the people. While the avoidance of this emotional expression, by age and affections both positive and negative. Age was a significant predictor of emotional expressiveness. Findings suggests that the associations between both variables, varied according to the age group of the people. Furthermore, this finding proposes that although older people are facing the persistent and serious threat of COVID-19, they show better emotional functioning. Which would help to better understand the interaction of both positive and negative life experiences in times of crisis.","GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-Tovar, HernÃƒÂ¡ndez-RodrÃƒÂ­guez","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.615268","20210212","COVID-19; affections and emotions; age; emotional disturbances; emotional variables","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-13","",10717,""
"A Study on the Psychological Wound of COVID-19 in University Students","An increasing number of studies have addressed the psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the general population. Nevertheless, far less is known about the impact on specific populations such as university students, whose psychological vulnerability has been shown in previous research. This study sought to examine different indicators of mental health in university students during the Spanish lockdown; we also analyzed the main sources of stress perceived by students in relation to the COVID-19 crisis, and the coping strategies adopted when faced with the situation. Data was collected from 932 students (704 women) through a web-based platform. Measures of anxiety (i.e., GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), irritability, and self-perceived change in mental health were administered, as well as ad hoc measures of stressors and coping strategies. Results indicated that students experienced considerable psychological problems during the confinement, with higher rates of emotional difficulties in women and undergraduate students than in men and postgraduates, respectively. Psychological distress was mainly related to several specific domains of stressors, as perceived by the participants: academic future, task overload, worsening of interpersonal conflicts, and restrictions in pleasant social contact; and far less related to the spread of the disease and its consequences for physical health. As regards coping strategies, both reframing skills and daily routines were shown to be the most effective. A path-analysis model integrating stressors, coping, and mental health revealed that coping strategies partially mediated the effect of stressors on psychological health. In general, results suggest that students' psychological health was substantially affected by the COVID-19 situation and that the academic and relational changes were the most notable sources of stress. This study reinforces the need to monitor and promote mental health in university students to boost resilience in times of crisis. Our results on effective coping strategies may inform preventive programs aimed at helping students to deal with challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic.","PadrÃƒÂ³n, Fraga, Vieitez, Montes, Romero","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.589927","20210212","COVID-19; COnVIDa-20; coping; psychological impact; stressors; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-13","",10718,""
"Negative shocks predict change in cognitive function and preferences: assessing the negative affect and stress hypothesis","In the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, households throughout the world have to cope with negative shocks. Previous research has shown that negative shocks impair cognitive function and change risk, time and social preferences. In this study, we analyze the results of a longitudinal multi-country survey conducted in Italy (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1652), Spain (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1660) and the United Kingdom (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1578). We measure cognitive function using the Cognitive Reflection Test and preferences traits (risk, time and social preferences) using an experimentally validated set of questions to assess the differences between people exposed to a shock compared to the rest of the sample. We measure four possible types of shocks: labor market shock, health shock, occurrence of stressful events, and mental health shock. Additionally, we randomly assign participants to groups with either a recall of negative events (more specifically, a mild reinforcement of stress or of fear/anxiety), or to a control group (to recall neutral or joyful memories), in order to assess whether or not stress and negative emotions drive a change in preferences. Results show that people affected by shocks performed worse in terms of cognitive functioning, are more risk loving, and are more prone to punish others (negative reciprocity). Data do not support the hypotheses that the result is driven by stress or by negative emotions.","Bogliacino, Codagnone, Montealegre, Folkvord, GÃƒÂ³mez, Charris, Liva, LupiÃƒÂ¡ÃƒÂ±ez-Villanueva, Veltri","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-83089-0","20210212","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-13","",10719,""
"Burn-out syndrome in Spanish internists during the COVID-19 outbreak and associated factors: a cross-sectional survey","The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on mental health and burn-out syndrome in Spanish internists and the factors that could be related to its appearance. We performed an observational, cross-sectional, descriptive study for which we designed a survey that was distributed in May 2020. We included internists who worked in Spain during the COVID-19 outbreak. A total of 1015 internists responded to the survey. Of those 62.9% were women. Of 1015 people, 58.3% presented with high emotional exhaustion, 61.5% had a high level of depersonalisation and 67.6% reported low personal fulfilment. 40.1% presented with the 3 criteria described, and therefore burn-out syndrome.Burn-out syndrome was independently related to the management of patients with SARS-CoV-2 (HR: 2.26; 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.15 to 4.45), the lack of availability of personal protective equipment (HR: 1.41; 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.05 to 1.91), increased responsibility (HR: 2.13; 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.51 to 3.01), not having received financial compensation for overtime work (HR: 0.43; 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 0.31 to 0.62), not having rested after 24-hour shifts (HR: 1.61; 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.09 to 2.38), not having had holidays in the previous 6 months (HR: 1.36; 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.01 to 1.84), consumption of sleeping pills (HR: 1.83; 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.28 to 2.63) and higher alcohol intake (HR: 1.95; 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.39 to 2.73). During the COVID-19 outbreak, 40.1% of Internal Medicine physicians in Spain presented with burn-out syndrome, which was independently related to the assistance of patients with SARS-CoV-2, overworking without any compensation and the fear of being contagious to their relatives. Therefore, it is imperative to initiate programmes to prevent and treat burn-out in front-line physicians during the COVID-19 outbreak.","MacÃƒÂ­a-RodrÃƒÂ­guez, Alejandre de OÃƒÂ±a, MartÃƒÂ­n-Iglesias, Barrera-LÃƒÂ³pez, PÃƒÂ©rez-Sanz, Moreno-Diaz, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-Munera","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-042966","20210212","COVID-19; anxiety disorders; internal medicine; occupational &amp; industrial medicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-13","",10720,""
"Psychological impact of the state of emergency over COVID-19 for non-permanent workers: a Nationwide follow-up study in Japan","The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused mental health problems and increased unemployment due to the economic recession. This survey aimed to assess the psychological impact of the state of emergency. We estimated changes in mental health, quality of life, and unemployment experience for general workers during the first COVID-19 outbreak in Japan. We conducted a nationwide follow-up study. During the periods of March 26 to April 6, 2020 and June 26 to July 2, 2020, we used the internet to survey general workers aged 15 to 59Ã¢â‚¬â€°years in Japan. The questionnaire items covered employment status and socioeconomic factors, and we used the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and EQ-5D-5L to assess depression and health-related quality of life (HR-QOL), respectively. The differences in outcomes of permanent and non-permanent workers were analyzed using propensity score analysis. A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to examine the relationship between unemployment and CES-D scores. We included 2351 subjects in the analysis. Changes in both CES-D scores and utility were not significantly different between the two groups. However, a significant difference was found regarding the rate of unemployment, which was associated with higher CES-D scores. The present study demonstrated that the mental health of non-permanent workers was not negatively affected following the state of emergency due to COVID-19 in Japan. Unemployment is an important factor that influences the mental health of general workers.","Saito, Tran, Qi, Suzuki, Takiguchi, Ishigami, Noto, Ohde, Takahashi","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10401-y","20210212","COVID-19; Employment security; General workers; Mental health; Propensity score analysis; Quality of life; Unemployment; Web survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-13","",10721,""
"The effect of online multimedia psychoeducational interventions on the resilience and perceived stress of hospitalized patients with COVID-19: a pilot cluster randomized parallel-controlled trial","There is evidence suggesting that quarantine might have undesirable psychological impacts on the patients. Therefore, it is important to seek for ways to increase the resilience and alleviate the psychological pressure of the patients who are quarantined due to infection with COVID-19. The present study was conducted to assess an online multimedia psychoeducational intervention regarding the feasibility, adherence, patient satisfaction and effectiveness on resilience and perceived stress of patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19. This was a pilot cluster randomized parallel-controlled trial with hospital wards as the units of randomization. Participants in this fully online trial were 50 consecutive patients who were hospitalized in 2 hospitals in Shiraz, after being diagnosed with COVID-19. Before the beginning of the intervention, four inpatient wards inside two of the hospitals were randomly assigned to either intervention or control conditions. All eligible participants in the wards allocated to the intervention condition received online multimedia psychoeducational interventions during the 2Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks, whilst the patients in the wards allocated to the control condition were offered the opportunity to receive telephone-based psychological counseling if needed. Psychoeducational interventions mainly included cognitive-behavioural techniques, stress management techniques, mindfulness-based stress reduction and positive psychotherapy. The patients were assessed regarding resilience and perceived stress at baseline and after two weeks. Of 27 patients starting multimedia psychoeducational interventions, 26 (96.29%) completed post-assessments. A high level of adherence (80.76%) and satisfaction (MeanÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°29.42; SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.18) with the online multimedia psychoeducational interventions was found. Compared with the control group, the patients who used online multimedia psychoeducational interventions reported greater resilience (Mean<sub>intervention</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°81.74; Mean<sub>control</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°72.86; adjusted t (46)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.10; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.04; CI: 0.39 to 17.38; dppc2Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.83) and fewer perceived stress (Mean<sub>intervention</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°22.15; Mean<sub>control</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°29.45; adjusted t (46)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.66; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01; CI: -Ã¢â‚¬â€°12.81 to -Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.78; dppc2Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.77) after 2Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks. The findings of the present study provided a successful first attempt at implementing feasible online multimedia psychoeducational interventions to promote resilience and mitigate stress among the patients who were hospitalized due to infection with COVID-19. The present results could help mental health professionals to determine which psychological techniques should be emphasized to promote patients' resilience in the context of COVID-19 disease.

"Perceived uncertainty stress and its predictors among residents in China during the COVID-19 pandemic","The prevalence of and risk factors for uncertainty stress among residents during the COVID-19 pandemic remain unclear. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted to explore and identify the risk factors for high perceived uncertainty stress among the general public in China during the COVID-19 outbreak. Information about the respondents' socioeconomic characteristics, knowledge of and attitudes towards COVID-19, perceived uncertainty stress, social capital, anxiety, and depressive symptoms was collected and analysed. Among the 1205 respondents, 45.3% (546) reported a high level of uncertainty stress. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that anxiety (ÃŽÂ²=3.871,<i>P</i>&lt;0.001) and depression symptoms (ÃŽÂ²=2.458,Ã‚Â <i>P</i>&lt;0.001), family residence (in towns or rural areas) (ÃŽÂ²=0.947,<i>Ã‚Â P</i>&lt;0.001), lack of support for local epidemic control strategies (ÃŽÂ²=1.253,<i>Ã‚Â P</i>&lt;0.001), worry about the pandemic (ÃŽÂ²=1.191,<i>Ã‚Â P</i>&lt;0.001), and symptoms of weakness among family members (ÃŽÂ²=1.525,<i>Ã‚Â P</i>=0.002) were positively associated with perceived uncertainty stress. Cognitive social capital (ÃŽÂ²=-0.883,<i>Ã‚Â P</i>&lt;0.001) and social networks (ÃŽÂ²=-0.726,<i>Ã‚Â P</i>&lt;0.001) were negatively, but social participation (ÃŽÂ²=0.714,<i>Ã‚Â P</i>&lt;0.001) was positively associated with perceived uncertainty stress.

"The Effects of Sleep Quality and Resilience on Perceived Stress, Dietary Behaviors, and Alcohol Misuse: A Mediation-Moderation Analysis of Higher Education Students from Asia, Europe, and North America during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has increased the already high levels of stress that higher education students experience. Stress influences health behaviors, including those related to dietary behaviors, alcohol, and sleep; yet the effects of stress can be mitigated by resilience. To date, past research studying the connections between dietary behaviors, alcohol misuse, sleep, and resilience commonly investigated singular relationships between two of the constructs. The aim of the current study was to explore the relationships between these constructs in a more holistic manner using mediation and moderation analyses. Higher education students from China, Ireland, Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, the Netherlands, and the United States were enrolled in a cross-sectional study from April to May 2020, which was during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic for most participants. An online survey, using validated tools, was distributed to assess perceived stress, dietary behaviors, alcohol misuse, sleep quality and duration, and resilience. 2254 students completed the study. Results indicated that sleep quality mediated the relationship between perceived stress and dietary behaviors as well as the relationship between perceived stress and alcohol misuse. Further, increased resilience reduced the strength of the relationship between perceived stress and dietary behaviors but not alcohol misuse. Based on these results, higher education students are likely to benefit from sleep education and resilience training, especially during stressful events.","Du, Zan, Cho, Fenton, Hsiao, Hsiao, Keaver, Lai, Lee, Ludy, Shen, Swee, Thrivikraman, Tseng, Tseng, Doak, Folk, Tucker","https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13020442","20210212","COVID-19; college; food intake; health behaviors; mental health; nutrition; pandemic; substance use; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-13","",10724,""
"The Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Outbreak on the Polish Dental Community's Standards of Care-A Six-Month Retrospective Survey-Based Study","Currently, SARS-CoV-2 is the primary pathogen worldwide, disrupting most of our everyday activities. The study aim was to evaluate its impact on the Polish dental community, standards of care, health, and welfare. A Google Forms survey was conducted among 303 dental practitioners. Of respondents, 54.93% curbed the number of patients in the last six months, 34.21% declared no changes, and 10.86% reported an increase; whereas 70.7% of the respondents reported a treatment price increase within the same period (27.96% and 1.32% reported no changes and a decrease, respectively). Of the respondents, 15.5% did not close their businesses during the first wave of the pandemic. Most declared 1 or 2 month break, 30.7% and 34.7%, respectively. Some reported 3, 4, or 5 month breaks (15.84%, 1.32%, and 0.99%, respectively), and only two respondents (0.66%) did not admit patients at all. Headache episodes were more frequent among female dentists before the pandemic; after the pandemic, headache frequency increased among both sexes. Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) were more frequent among women (<i>p</i> = 0.017). Most Polish dentists followed SARS-CoV-2 recommendations and restricted their practices to admitting only patients with pain or incomplete treatment. Decreased sleep parameters, head, back, and neck pain, were observed. This situation may affect dental health conditions in Polish society over time.","Dalewski, Palka, Kiczmer, Sobolewska","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18031281","20210212","COVID-19; Poland; SARS-CoV-2; community dentistry; delivery of health care; dental care; dentistÃ¢â‚¬â€œpatient; epidemiology; infection transmission","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-13","",10725,""
