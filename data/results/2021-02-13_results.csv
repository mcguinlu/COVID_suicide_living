"Efficiency and Quality of Data Collection Among Public Mental Health Surveys Conducted During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Systematic Review","BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization has recognized the importance of assessing population-level mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. During a global crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic, a timely surveillance method is urgently needed to track the impact on public mental health. OBJECTIVE: This brief systematic review focused on the efficiency and quality of data collection of studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We searched the PubMed database using the following search strings: ((COVID-19) OR (SARS-CoV-2)) AND ((Mental health) OR (psychological) OR (psychiatry)). We screened the titles, abstracts, and texts of the published papers to exclude irrelevant studies. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to evaluate the quality of each research paper. RESULTS: Our search yielded 37 relevant mental health surveys of the general public that were conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, as of July 10, 2020. All these public mental health surveys were cross-sectional in design, and the journals efficiently made these articles available online in an average of 18.7 (range 1-64) days from the date they were received. The average duration of recruitment periods was 9.2 (range 2-35) days, and the average sample size was 5137 (range 100-56,679). However, 73% (27/37) of the selected studies had Newcastle-Ottawa Scale scores of <3 points, which suggests that these studies are of very low quality for inclusion in a meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The studies examined in this systematic review used an efficient data collection method, but there was a high risk of bias, in general, among the existing public mental health surveys. Therefore, following recommendations to avoid selection bias, or employing novel methodologies considering both a longitudinal design and high temporal resolution, would help provide a strong basis for the formation of national mental health policies.","Lin, Yu-Hsuan; Chen, Chung-Yen; Wu, Shiow-Ing","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/25118","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;23(2): e25118, 2021 Feb 10.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;23(2): e25118, 2021 Feb 10.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-12","",10672,""
"The Efficacy of WeChat-Based Parenting Training on the Psychological Well-being of Mothers With Children With Autism During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Quasi-Experimental Study","BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, special education schools for children in most areas of China were closed between the end of January and the beginning of June in 2020. The sudden interruption in schooling and the pandemic itself caused parents to be anxious and even to panic. Mobile-based parenting skills education has been demonstrated to be an effective method for improving the psychological well-being of mothers with children with autism. However, whether it can improve the psychological states of mothers in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic is a subject that should be urgently investigated. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of WeChat-based parenting training on anxiety, depression, parenting stress, and hope in mothers with children with autism, as well as the feasibility of the program during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This was a quasi-experimental trial. A total of 125 mothers with preschool children with autism were recruited in January 2020. The participants were assigned to the control group (n=60), in which they received routine care, or the intervention group (n=65), in which they received the 12-week WeChat-based parenting training plus routine care, according to their preferences. Anxiety, depression, parenting stress, hope, satisfaction, and adherence to the intervention were measured at three timepoints: baseline (T0), postintervention (T1), and a 20-week follow-up (T2). RESULTS: In total, 109 mothers completed the T1 assessment and 104 mothers completed the T2 assessment. The results of the linear mixed model analysis showed statistically significant group Ã— time interaction effects for the intervention on anxiety (F=14.219, P<.001), depression (F=26.563, P<.001), parenting stress (F=68.572, P<.001), and hope (F=197.608, P<.001). Of all mothers in the intervention group, 90.4% (48.8/54) reported that they were extremely satisfied with the WeChat-based parenting training. In total, 40.0% (26/65) logged their progress in home training each week and 61.5% (40/65) logged their progress more than 80% of the time for all 20 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The WeChat-based parenting training is acceptable and appears to be an effective approach for reducing anxiety, depression, and parenting stress, as well as increasing hope in mothers with children with autism during the global COVID-19 pandemic. Future studies with rigorous designs and longer follow-up periods are needed to further detect the effectiveness of the WeChat-based parenting training.

"Yoga an effective strategy for self-management of stress-related problems and wellbeing during COVID19 lockdown: A cross-sectional study","This cross-sectional research aims to study the effect of yoga practice on the illness perception, and wellbeing of healthy adults during 4-10 weeks of lockdown due to COVID19 outbreak. A total of 668 adults (64.7% males, M = 28.12 years, SD = 9.09 years) participated in the online survey. The participants were grouped as; yoga practitioners, other spiritual practitioners, and non-practitioners based on their responses to daily practices that they follow. Yoga practitioners were further examined based on the duration of practice as; long-term, mid-term and beginners. Multivariate analysis indicates that yoga practitioners had significantly lower depression, anxiety, & stress (DASS), and higher general wellbeing (SWGB) as well as higher peace of mind (POMS) than the other two groups. The results further revealed that the yoga practitioners significantly differed in the perception of personal control, illness concern and emotional impact of COVID19. However, there was no significant difference found for the measure of resilience (BRS) in this study. Yoga practitioners also significantly differed in the cognitive reappraisal strategy for regulating their emotions than the other two groups. Interestingly, it was found that beginners -those who had started practicing yoga only during the lockdown period reported no significant difference for general wellbeing and peace of mind when compared to the mid- term practitioner. Evidence supports that yoga was found as an effective self- management strategy to cope with stress, anxiety and depression, and maintain wellbeing during COVID19 lockdown.","Sahni, Pooja Swami; Singh, Kamlesh; Sharma, Nitesh; Garg, Rahul","https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245214","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: PLoS One;16(2): e0245214, 2021.; Publication details: PLoS One;16(2): e0245214, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-12","",10674,""

"Examination of Air Pollution's Relationship with COVID-19, Physical and Mental Health","Air pollution is a result of natural phenomena or human activities that can cause the release of harmful substances in the environment, leading to adverse health outcomes among living beings  Pollution is associated with adverse health impacts on multiple organ systems among humans  While the respiratory and cardiovascular systems are mainly affected, there are other health issues related to the eyes, skin, brain, blood, immunity, behavioral/mental well-being, and reproduction among exposed individuals  Air pollutants can especially have higher health impacts on people at the extremes of their ages (children and elderly) and on those suffering from underlying respiratory and heart issues  Pollutants such as ozone, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, and nitrogen dioxide have respiratory effects among children and adults and are associated with increased respiratory diseases, asthma exacerbations, and related hospitalizations  Carbon monoxide interferes with transporting oxygen by forming carboxyhemoglobin leading to cardiovascular, neurological, and respiratory problems  Particulate matter is a heterogeneous mixture of tiny particles of varying compositions found in the atmosphere and has a wide variety of severe health effects  Particulate matter emits from combustion, diesel engines, power generation, and wood-burning, and certain industrial activities  Lead is considered neurotoxic and has more severe consequences among children  Here we summarize characteristics of six criteria air pollutants and associated air quality risk assessment parameters known as the Pollutant Standard Index (PSI)  The present manuscript also examines the impact of air pollution on human behavior, mental well-being, and neurological health consequences, as air pollution has been associated with cognitive decline, hyperactivity, dementia, anxiety, depression, aggression, and Alzheimer's disease-related changes  Lastly, we also attempt to look into any relationship between air pollutants and Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and examine its possible association with a higher COVID-19 incidence, complications, and mortality","Islam, H.; Shakoori, I.

"The Challenges and Opportunities of Establishing a New Paediatric Psychodermatology Service during COVID 19","As highlighted in Mind and Skin All Parliamentary Group report there is little provision for children/young people (CYP) experiencing significant psychological distress associated with their skin disease  These CYP rarely meet the threshold for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) and their needs are rarely understood/met  There is even less provision for children presenting with skin conditions due to psychological/psychiatric/neurodevelopmental comorbidities   In February 2020 a new monthly multi-disciplinary (MDT) paediatric psychodermatology service was established with 60 min new and follow-up appointments  Children/parents are jointly assessed by a consultant dermatologist and clinical psychologist  The child and parents then have individual consultations with the psychologist and dermatologist respectively  The appointment is consolidated jointly discussing a psychological and clinical action plan  Due to COVID-19 and the associated stressors of lockdown, video psychodermatology clinics were offered from April-June reverting to face-to face from July  To date, 9 CYP (age range 9-17) have been seen within 3 face-to-face and 3 virtual clinics  Conditions treated were dermatitis artefacta, trichotillomania, skin picking, acne and depression with 2 patients being discharged from dermatology  Challenges included building rapport, having effective consultations, with new families and delivering the MDT approach virtually  Unexpected benefits were that families were more relaxed online at home and there were no DNAs  Further patient outcome data will be presented  Currently this is the only dedicated paediatric psychodermatology service so the success of this virtual model could facilitate access to multi-disciplinary support to many more children and families  Reference: 1  Mental Health and Skin Disease;A report of the All Parliamentary Group on Skin published on 23rd September 2020","Sears, A.; Ali, R.; Baron, S.","https://doi.org/10.1111/pde.14428","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Pediatric Dermatology;37(SUPPL 1):15-16, 2020.; Publication details: Pediatric Dermatology;37(SUPPL 1):15-16, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-12","",10690,""
"Transcranial magnetic stimulation in us military veterans-a naturalistic study in the veterans health administration","Background: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS, hereafter TMS) has emerged as evidence-based treatment for pharmacoresistant major depressive disorder (MDD) and has been cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration for over a decade  In that time, data has emerged supporting the use of TMS utilizing different devices, settings, and patient populations  One particular patient population of interest in the US are military Veterans;this patient group is thought to have generally higher levels of medical and psychiatric comorbidity, as well as elevated risk for suicide  A recent negative study of TMS indicated that active stimulation did not separate from sham, and poor response was particularly prevalent in Veterans who had comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder  Yet, other studies have consistently indicated efficacy of TMS for Veterans including with PTSD in other studies  To this end, the VA instituted a nationwide rollout of TMS, with the purpose to evaluate clinical outcomes in naturalistic settings and thus inform real-world practice  This abstract reports clinical outcomes of the first cohort of patients to receive TMS at the VA as part of this program, where we hypothesized that TMS would be safe, well tolerated, and provide clinically meaningful reductions in depressive symptoms as well as comorbid PTSD symptoms  Methods: VA Palo Alto Healthcare System Mental Illness Research Education and Clinical Center served as the central coordinating site for this naturalistic study;the VA Palo Alto/ Stanford Institutional Review Board approved procedures related to this report  Individual sites received training through the coordinating site and data gathered through a centralized VA REDCap database  Veterans were eligible for TMS if they met standard inclusion/clearance criteria for TMS (e g , failure of at least one antidepressant in the current major depressive episode, etc );in general other treatments were unchanged for approximately six weeks before stimulation, and remained unchanged during stimulation, although this could be modified depending on a Veteran's clinical situation  TMS parameters were at local clinical discretion, and generally were high frequency stimulation (10Hz or intermittent theta burst) delivered to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex at 120% of motor threshold over 6-8 weeks  Depression and PTSD symptoms were measured using the 9-item patient health questionnaire (PHQ9) and PTSD symptom checklist for DSM5 (PCL-5);outcomes of interest included mean changes in both rating scales, as well as dichotomous outcomes describing response (&gt;50% reduction) and remission (score10 points) and those no longer meeting threshold criteria for PTSD (score &lt;33) on the PCL-5  Safety outcomes were measured through database queries and separate inquiries across the sites  Outcomes were analyzed using paired-sample t-tests and missing data were addressed using multiple imputations  This report includes all Veterans that received TMS up until March 2020 (i e , pre-COVID)  Results: The cohort included N=413 Veterans with major depression  380 (92%) reported some degree of PTSD symptoms, and 275 (66 6%) had threshold-level PTSD symptoms  Average age was 51 years (SD = 14 14, range 22 - 89), and 74 2 % identified as male  The majority of Veterans were treated with high frequency stimulation to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex  There was a significant decrease in self-reported depression symptoms on the PHQ9 (t(412) = 24 15, p &lt; 0 01;pre-TMS: mean = 18 2, standard deviation = 5 06, post-TMS: mean = 10 66, standard deviation = 7 12)  Depression response and remission rates were 46 2% (n=191) and 23 7% (n=98), respectively  There was also a significant decrease on self-reported PTSD symptoms on the PCL-5 (t(379) = 18 85, p &lt; 0 01;pre-TMS : mean = 43 80 SD = 18 36, post-TMS: M = 28 15, SD = 20 42)  Of the Veterans with threshold-level PTSD symptoms at baseline, n=159 (57 5%) demonstrated clinically meaningful reduction and n=130 (47 2%) no longer met PTSD threshold criteria post-treatment  TMS was generally safe as delivered;four Veterans experienced unexpected side effects requiring significant medical intervention  One Veteran reportedly had a seizure (H-coil), and five were hospitalized for worsened psychiatric symptoms  Conclusions: This data represents the first multisite naturalistic study of TMS for Veterans with pharmacoresistant major depression  Consistent with this patient population, the majority reported comorbid MDD & PTSD  TMS resulted in statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in depressive and PTSD symptoms  Stimulation was safe as provided, with side effects consistent with the known profile of TMS  Limitations include those inherent to naturalistic cohort studies  Furthermore, all Veterans were engaged in concurrent clinical care, and we did not differentiate between different stimulation parameters  Future reports, using the associated network of clinical sites, will focus on  key related questions including evaluating the impact of different TMS parameters or approaches, as well as the study of biological outcomes such as functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography to better identify biomarkers of treatment response in this population  Caveats notwithstanding, this is the largest report of TMS in Veterans and provides a clear indication of efficacy and safety in real-world environments","Philip, N.;

"Examining social behavior in a time of social distancing","Study Group Summary: During this time of social distancing, our intuitive understanding of an instinct or 'need' that drives us to be together has become even more apparent  Undeniably, social behaviors are fundamental to the survival of animals, including humans  Guided by social interactions, such as those that are affiliative, aggressive, and cooperative in nature, individuals gain reproductive opportunities and develop the parental behaviors that propagate our species  Moreover, social attachments are critical to healthy psychological development and well-being  Interruptions in the ability to engage in these behaviors, whether mediated by neural circuits, environmental experiences (e g  social isolation), or a combination of both, can lead to impairments in mental health and species typical functioning  Given the ongoing situation, it is expected that emerging research questions will focus on the implications of COVID19 on mental health, as measured in part by the establishment and maintenance of social behaviors in our new world  In the laboratory, a diversity of social behaviors and model organisms are used to understand the neurobiology of neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders  While investigators use different models/tasks with distinct advantages/drawbacks, there are very few opportunities to consult and establish a consensus on the appropriate design, implementation, and translational perspectives for this work  During this session, we will review several sociability metrics and discuss their strengths and weaknesses, in addition to the translation use/purpose of each, and the underlying neural circuits engaged  Some metrics to be covered include social interaction, social preference, social discrimination, social propinquity and vigilance, aggression, play behavior, reproductive behaviors, social communication (including USVs), social odor discrimination, social rejection/aversion and social defeat  The presenters will address the importance of standardizing the general designs within and across laboratories  Major questions to be addressed include: What can social behavior tests teach us regarding the causes and treatments of mental disorders and their underlying neural circuits? Are these sociability measures well validated? Do each of these tests apply across species, age, and sex? We will also explore considerations of the social dynamics between focal animals and their conspecifics in addition to the appropriateness of methodological designs  Our study group discussions will facilitate the development of best practices for standardized social behavior metrics to improve the rigor, reproducibility, and relevance of this work to mental health research and our new socially distanced reality","Young, L.; Kentner, A.; Trainor, B.; Veenema, A.; Bagot, R.; Golden, S.; Sandi, C.; Neunuebel, J.","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41386-020-00889-0","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Neuropsychopharmacology;45:48, 2020.; Publication details: Neuropsychopharmacology;45:48, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-12","",10693,""

"Trends in pharmacotherapy for anxiety and depression during COVID-19: A north york area pilot study","Introduction: During the COVID-19 pandemic, with the implementation of social distancing regulations, there is increased concern around the mental health of the general population, including depression and anxiety  Mental health prescribing trends in Canada during COVID-19, at the time of writing, have not been investigated  Methods: This pilot study collected refill information of 365 patients from an independent community pharmacy in North York, Ontario to compare (1) initiation, (2) dose change, (3) dispensing frequency, and (4) defined daily dose of first-line antidepressants as defined by the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments and other select medications, including Z-drugs and benzodiazepines  Data from January 1 to May 31, 2019 were compared with data from January 1 to May 31, 2020  Results: The number of newly initiated antidepressant and antianxiety medications during the COVID-19 pandemic was not significantly affected compared to the same months in the prior year (Z=-1 149, p=0 251)  Upon investigation of logistic regression, age was significantly correlated to antidepressant initiation in the year prior (p=0 038) whereas it was not during COVID-19, which may represent an increase in antidepressants in the younger population  There was a significant difference in the number of dose changes, which occurred between the two years, showing significantly more increases and switches of therapy (p=0 008) during COVID-19  There was significantly more frequent dispensing of benzodiazepine tablets (Z=2 402, p=0 016) in the first five months of 2020 compared to those of 2019  There were no statistically significant changes in the number of defined daily doses  Discussion: There are shifting trends in mental health prescribing  This result is concerning during a time when accessing appropriate mental health care is significantly impacted  This study emphasizes the need for benzodiazepine deprescribing due to the increase in benzodiazepines dispensed and the risk of misuse, tolerance, and dependence with long-term benzodiazepines  Â© 2021, University of Toronto  All rights reserved","Yu, C.; Boone, C.; Askarian-Monavvari, R.; Brown, T.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Trends+in+pharmacotherapy+for+anxiety+and+depression+during+COVID-19:+A+north+york+area+pilot+study","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: University of Toronto Medical Journal;98(1):41-46, 2021.; Publication details: University of Toronto Medical Journal;98(1):41-46, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-12","",10700,""
