"Emerging and Continuing Trends in Opioid Overdose Decedent Characteristics during COVID-19","Background: Since COVID-19 erupted in the United States, little is known about how state-level opioid overdose trends and decedent characteristics have varied throughout the country. Objective: Investigate changes in annual overdose death rates, substances involved, and decedent demographics in opioid overdose deaths across nine states; assess whether 2019-2020 trends were emerging (i.e., change from 2019-2020 was non-existent from 2018-2019) or continuing (i.e., change from 2019-2020 existed from 2018-2019). Design: Cross-sectional study using vital statistics data to conduct a retrospective analysis comparing 2020 to 2019 and 2019 to 2018 across nine states. Setting: Alaska, Colorado, Connecticut, Indiana, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Utah, and Wyoming. Participants: Opioid-related overdose deaths in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Measurements: Annual overdose death rate, proportion of overdose deaths involving specific substances, and decedent demographics (age, sex, race, and ethnicity). Results: We find emerging increases in annual opioid-related overdose death rates in Alaska (55.3% [P=0.020]), Colorado (80.2% [P<0.001]), Indiana (40.1% [P=0.038]), North Carolina (30.5% [P<0.001]), and Rhode Island (29.6% [P=0.011]). Decreased heroin-involved overdose deaths were emerging in Alaska (-49.5% [P=0.001]) and Indiana (-58.8% [P<0.001]), and continuing in Colorado (-33.3% [P<0.001]), Connecticut (-48.2% [P<0.001]), Massachusetts (39.9% [P<0.001]), and North Carolina (-34.8% [P<0.001]). Increases in synthetic opioid presence were emerging in Alaska (136.5% [P=0.019]) and Indiana (27.6% [P<0.001]), and continuing in Colorado (44.4% [P<0.001]), Connecticut (3.6% [P<0.05]), and North Carolina (14.6% [P<0.001]). We find emerging increases in the proportion of male decedents in Colorado (15.2% [P=0.008]) and Indiana (12.0% [P=0.013]). Limitations: Delays from state-specific death certification processes resulted in varying analysis periods across states. Conclusion: These findings highlight emerging changes in opioid overdose dynamics across different states, which can inform state-specific public health interventions.","Gian-Gabriel P.

"Promoting resilience in healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic with a brief online intervention","Introduction: The psychological wellbeing of healthcare workers has been impacted by the high levels of stress many have experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to examine the feasibility and acceptability of a brief online course focused on introducing skills that could increase resilience and decreases emotional distress in healthcare workers during the pandemic. Materials and Methods: Employees of a large healthcare system completed a survey at baseline, one month, and two months later. The online course, called Resilience Training for Healthcare Workers, consists of three 12-20 minute videos focused on evidence-based skills that support aspects of emotional resilience: mindfulness, mentalization, and self-compassion. Results: A total of 554 participants completed the baseline survey, endorsing moderate to high levels of emotional distress. Of those who completed all three assessments and participated in the course (n = 38), significant improvements in resilience and reductions in emotional distress were found across two months, in comparison to those who did not participate in the course. Discussion: These findings suggest that a brief, online intervention can improve the mental health of healthcare workers during a crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Nicole R DeTore; Louisa Sylvia; Elyse R Park; Anne Burke; Julie H Levison; Alec Shannon; Karmel W Choi; Felipe A Jain; Drew C Coman; John Herman; Roy Perlis; Maurizio Fava; Daphne J Holt","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.28.21261304","20210731","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-01","",16714,""
"Prospective examination of mental health in university students during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: The impact of changing social restrictions on the mental health of students during the COVID-19 pandemic warrants exploration. Aims: To prospectively examine changes to university students mental health during the pandemic. Methods: Students completed repeated online surveys at three time points (October 2020 (baseline), February 2021, March 2021) to explore relationships between demographic and psychological factors (loneliness and positive mood) and mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety, and stress). Results: A total of 893 students participated. Depression and anxiety levels were higher at all timepoints than pre-pandemic normative data (p<.001). Scores on all mental health measures were highest in February, with depression and anxiety remaining significantly higher in March than baseline. Female students and those with previous mental health disorders were at greatest risk of poor mental health outcomes. Lower positive mood and greater loneliness at baseline were associated with greater depression and anxiety at follow-ups. Baseline positive mood predicted improvement of depression and anxiety at follow-ups. Conclusion: Depression and anxiety were significantly higher than pre-pandemic norms, with female students and those with previous mental health difficulties being at greatest risk. Given these elevated rates, universities should ensure adequate support is available to meet potentially increased demand for services.","Ru Jia; Holly Knight; Kieran Ayling; Carol Coupland; Jessia Corner; Chris Denning; Jonathan Ball; Kirsty Bolton; Joanne R Morling; Grazziela Figueredo; David Ed Morris; Patrick Tighe; Armando Villalon; Holly Blake; kavita vedhara","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.29.21261196","20210731","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-01","",16715,""
"Development of a Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) Symptom Lexicon Using Electronic Health Record Clinical Notes","Objective: To develop a comprehensive post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) symptom lexicon from clinical notes to support PASC symptom identification and research. Methods: We identified 26,117 COVID-19 positive patients from the Mass General Brigham's electronic health records (EHR) and extracted 328,879 clinical notes from their post-acute infection period (day 51-110 from first positive COVID-19 test). The PASC symptom lexicon incorporated Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus concepts and synonyms based on selected semantic types. The MTERMS natural language processing (NLP) tool was used to automatically extract symptoms from a development dataset. The lexicon was iteratively revised with manual chart review, keyword search, concept consolidation, and evaluation of NLP output. We assessed the comprehensiveness of the lexicon and the NLP performance using a validation dataset and reported the symptom prevalence across the entire corpus. Results: The PASC symptom lexicon included 355 symptoms consolidated from 1,520 UMLS concepts. NLP achieved an averaged precision of 0.94 and an estimated recall of 0.84. Symptoms with the highest frequency included pain (43.1%), anxiety (25.8%), depression (24.0%), fatigue (23.4%), joint pain (21.0%), shortness of breath (20.8%), headache (20.0%), nausea and/or vomiting (19.9%), myalgia (19.0%), and gastroesophageal reflux (18.6%). Discussion and Conclusion: PASC symptoms are diverse. A comprehensive PASC symptom lexicon can be derived using a data-driven, ontology-driven and NLP-assisted approach. By using unstructured data, this approach may improve identification and analysis of patient symptoms in the EHR, and inform prospective study design, preventative care strategies, and therapeutic interventions for patient care.","Liqin Wang; Dinah Foer; Erin MacPhaul; Ying-Chih Lo; David W.

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on acute inpatient psychiatric units in Spain","Patients with more severe mental health symptoms are treated in acute inpatient psychiatric units (AIPUs), but the functioning of these units throughout Spain has been challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic. We therefore conducted a descriptive, cross-sectional study to assess the situation. An online survey was distributed to all hospitals with AIPUs in Spain and made accessible for 28 days. Two scientific coordinators were appointed to supervise the scientific and methodological aspects of the study. The most relevant findings include reductions in numbers of beds and staff, insufficient material resources, changes in action protocols and in admission processes, and limitations in routine therapies, such as group and occupational therapy, psychotherapy and psychoeducational programmes. The possibility of performing ECT was also seriously curtailed. This is the first study to evaluate the impact of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on AIPUs. These data may help improve the quality of care of patients with mental illness in the future.","Montes, HernÃƒÂ¡ndez-Huerta","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.114136","20210731","Hospitalization; Mental disorders; Psychiatry; Spain","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-01","",16717,""
"Feasibility, acceptability, and potential effectiveness of an online expressive writing intervention for COVID-19 resilience","The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted mental health in the general population. In this trial, our objective was to assess whether a 6-week expressive writing intervention improves resilience in a sample from the general population in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. This 6-week trial was conducted online. Eligible participants (n=63) were a sample of adults who self-identified as having been significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC). Perceived Stress Scale - 10-Item (PSS-10); Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale - Revised (CESD-R); Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI).

"Anxiety and depressive symptoms in US Census Bureau assessments of adults: Trends from 2019 to fall 2020 across demographic groups","Events from spring to fall 2020, including the COVID-19 pandemic, hate crimes, and social unrest, may have impacted mental health, particularly mood and anxiety disorders. This study compares rates of positive screens for anxiety and depressive disorders in separate U.S. national samples from 2019 and April to September 2020. The analysis includes trends within demographic groups, which have received scant attention. Nationally representative probability samples of U.S. adults administered by the U.S. Census Bureau (n = 1.3 million) completed the PHQ-2 screening for depressive disorder and the GAD-2 screening for anxiety disorder. U.S. adults in 2020 were four times more likely to screen positive for depressive and anxiety disorders than in 2019, with the largest increases among males, 18- to 29-year-olds (for depression), Asian Americans, and parents with children in the home. Anxiety and depression rose and fell in tandem with the number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S., as well as increasing during the early June weeks of racial justice protests. Screens for mood and anxiety disorders remained at elevated levels in spring, summer, and fall 2020, especially among certain groups.","Twenge, McAllister, Joiner","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2021.102455","20210731","Anxiety; COVID-19 pandemic; Depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-01","",16719,""
"Short-term impacts of COVID-19 on family caregivers: Emotion regulation, coping, and mental health","The negative mental health impact of coronavirus disease 2019-related stressors may be heightened for those caring for children, who bear responsibity for their welfare during disasters. Based on the Transactional Model of Stress and Coping, we inquired whether caregivers' emotion regulation and coping behavior were associated with posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). Data were collected through a national online survey in April 2020, and again 60 days later. Of the 801 longitudinal cases, 176 (63.6% female; mean ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°33.5) reported caring for minors in their homes during the pandemic. Over 20% of caregivers experienced clinically concerning PTSS, rates higher than their noncaregiving counterparts. Regression analysis indicates caregivers' baseline mental health symptoms and emotion regulation predicted PTSS 60 days later. Implications for needed parenting supports among families experiencing traumatic stress are provided. Anxiety symptoms at baseline were the most significant and consistent contributor to all models and were significantly higher among those with clinically concerning levels of PTSS suggesting a clear intervention target.","Russell, Hutchison, Park, Fendrich, Finkelstein-Fox","https://doi.org/10.1002/jclp.23228","20210731","COVID-19; caregiver stress; coping; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-01","",16720,""
"Investigating tinnitus subgroups based on hearing-related difficulties","Meaningfully grouping individuals with tinnitus who share the common characteristics (i.e., subgrouping, phenotyping) may help tailor interventions to certain tinnitus subgroups and hence reduce outcome variability. The purpose of this study was to test if the presence of tinnitus subgroups are discernible based on hearing-related comorbidities, and to identify predictors of tinnitus severity for each subgroup identified. An exploratory cross-sectional study was used. The study was nested within an online survey distributed worldwide to investigate tinnitus experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. The main outcome measure was the tinnitus Handicap Inventory- Screening Version RESULTS: From the 3400 respondents, 2,980 were eligible adults with tinnitus with an average age of 58 years (SD= 14.7) with 50% (n= 1,457) being female. A three-cluster solution identified distinct subgroups, namely, those with tinnitus but no hearing loss (n = 1,306; 44%), those presenting with tinnitus and hyperacusis and/or misophonia (n = 795; 27%), and those with tinnitus and hearing loss (n = 879; 29%). Those with tinnitus and hyperacusis reported the highest tinnitus severity (M= 20.3; SD= 10.5) and those with tinnitus and no hearing loss had the lowest tinnitus severity (M= 15.7; SD= 10.4). Younger age and the presence of mental health problems predicted greater tinnitus severity for all groups (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â€°Â¤ -.1, pÃ¢â€°Â¤ .016). Further exploration of these potential subtypes are needed in both further research and clinical practice by initially triaging tinnitus patients prior to their clinical appointments based on the presence of hearing-related comorbidities. Unique management pathways and interventions could be tailored for each tinnitus subgroup.","Beukes, Baguley, Manchaiah, Andersson, Allen, Kaldo, Jacquemin, Lourenco, Onozuka, Stockdale, Maidment","https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14684","20210731","heterogeneity; interventions; phenotyping; subgroups; tinnitus; tinnitus managment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-01","",16721,""
"Psychological impact of COVID-19 on speech and language therapists working with adult dysphagia: A national survey","Speech and language therapists (SLTs) working with dysphagia have had to radically alter diagnostic and rehabilitation services during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, hereafter referred to as coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Given the aerosol-generating procedures inherent in swallow assessment and interventions, these SLTs have also been particularly susceptible to virus exposure. To investigate the psychological impact of COVID-19 on SLTs working with adult dysphagia across the Republic of Ireland and to identify the personal and professional factors associated with depression, anxiety, stress and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). To explore SLT perspectives regarding their experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional 34-item online survey was developed and piloted. The survey collected demographic details and professional factors and it incorporated the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). The survey also sought SLT perspectives regarding their experiences during the pandemic. It was distributed to Irish SLT managers, the Irish Association of Speech and Language Therapists (IASLT) and the Irish Dysphagia Special Interest Group (SIG) for dissemination. A total of 94 SLTs working with adults with dysphagia across Ireland responded. In total, 60% of respondents screened positive for depression, anxiety, stress and/or PTSD. Based on the DASS-21, 38% screened positive for depression (mean score = 8.0; SD = 6.3), 36% screened positive for anxiety (mean score = 6.5; SD = 6.0), and 49% screened positive for stress (mean score = 15.4; SD = 6.9). A total of 26% of respondents screened positive for PTSD (mean IES-R total score = 22.6; SD = 16.0). Factors associated with depression, anxiety, stress and PTSD were young age (p = 0.002), limited clinical experience (p = 0.01) and not living with children (p = 0.02). A thematic analysis of SLT perspectives identified four main themes: 'fear of COVID-19 infection and transmission', 'uncertainty regarding policies and procedures', 'changes in SLT roles and responsibilities' and 'increased workload'. This study highlights the psychological impact of COVID-19 on SLTs working with adults with dysphagia in Ireland and identifies SLTs who are at risk of depression, anxiety, stress and PTSD during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings may assist employers to identify staff who require psychological support and long-term follow-up during this pandemic and any future health emergencies. What is already known on the subject Depression, anxiety, stress and PTSD are prevalent among nurses and other healthcare professionals internationally as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated factors have been identified in previous research. Despite this, no research has been conducted to establish the psychological impact of the first surge of COVID-19 on SLTs working with dysphagia in relation to depression, anxiety, stress and PTSD and the associated factors. What this paper adds to existing knowledge A total of 60% of SLTs working with adults with dysphagia in this survey presented with depression, anxiety, stress and/or PTSD. Associated personal and professional factors amongst respondents included young age, limited clinical experience and not living with children. The perspectives of SLTs on their experiences during the first surge of COVID-19 are also explored. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? The findings from this study may assist SLT managers to identify SLTs who are at a higher risk of depression, anxiety, stress and PTSD to ensure appropriate support can be provided.","Rouse, Regan","https://doi.org/10.1111/1460-6984.12654","20210731","COVID-19; dysphagia; psychological impact; speech and language therapists","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-01","",16722,""

"Life under COVID-19 for LGBT+ people in the UK: systematic review of UK research on the impact of COVID-19 on sexual and gender minority populations","To systematically review all published and unpublished evidence on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health and well-being of UK sexual and gender minority (LGBT+; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, non-binary, intersex and queer) people. Any relevant studies with or without comparator were included, with outcomes of: COVID-19 incidence, hospitalisation rates, illness severity, death rates, other health and well-being. Six databases (platforms) were searched-CINAHL Plus (Ovid), Cochrane Central (Cochrane Library), Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), Science Citation Index (Web of Science) and Scopus between 2019 and 2020 in December 2020, using synonyms for sexual and gender minorities and COVID-19 search terms. Data extraction and quality assessment (using the relevant Joanna Briggs checklist) were in duplicate with differences resolved through discussion. Results were tabulated and synthesis was through narrative description. No published research was found on any outcomes. Eleven grey literature reports found to be of low quality were included, mostly conducted by small LGBT+ charities. Only four had heterosexual/cisgender comparators. Mental health and well-being, health behaviours, safety, social connectedness and access to routine healthcare all showed poorer or worse outcomes than comparators. Lack of research gives significant concern, given pre-existing health inequities. Social and structural factors may have contributed to poorer outcomes (mental health, well-being and access to healthcare). Paucity of evidence is driven by lack of routinely collected sexual orientation and gender identity data, possibly resulting from institutional homophobia/transphobia which needs to be addressed. Men are more at risk of serious illness from COVID-19 than women, so using data from trans women and men might have started to answer questions around whether higher rates were due to sex hormone or chromosomal effects. Routine data collection on sexual orientation and gender identity is required to examine the extent to which COVID-19 is widening pre-existing health inequalities.

"Trends in healthcare utilisation during COVID-19: a longitudinal study from the UK","The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic had a major impact on healthcare utilisation. The aim of this retrospective review was to quantify how utilisation of non-COVID care changed during this time so as to gain insight and inform planning of future services during potential second and subsequent waves. A longitudinal design was used to analyse anonymous private UK health insurer datasets covering the period of January 2018 to August 2020. Taken as a measure of healthcare utilisation in the UK, incidence rates of claims broken down by service area and condition were calculated alongside overall monthly totals and costs. Pre-COVID-19 years were compared with the current year. Healthcare utilisation during the first wave of COVID-19 decreased by as much as 70% immediately after lockdown measures were implemented. After 2Ã¢â‚¬â€°months, the trend reversed and claims steadily began to increase, but did not reach rates seen from previous years by the end of August 2020. Assessment by service and diagnostic category showed that most areas, especially those highly reliant on in-person treatment, reflected the same pattern (ie, rapid drop followed by a steady recovery). The provision of mental health services differed from this observed trend, where utilisation increased by 20% during the first wave of COVID-19, in comparison to pre-COVID-19 years. The utilisation of maternity services and the treatment of existing cancers also stayed stable, or increased slightly, during this time. Healthcare utilisation in a UK-based privately insured population decreased dramatically during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, being over 70% lower at its height. However, mental health services remained resilient during this time, possibly due to greater virtualisation of diagnostics and care.","Howarth, Munro, Theodorou, Mills","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-048151","20210731","COVID-19; Health services administration &amp; management; Public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-01","",16725,""
"Ageism and the State of Older People With Mental Conditions During the Pandemic and Beyond: Manifestations, Etiology, Consequences, and Future Directions","The pandemic has put the spotlight on older people and on the topic of ageism.

The aim of this paper is to articulate the International Psychogeriatric Association (IPA) and the World Psychiatric Association Section of Old Age Psychiatry (WPA-SOAP) response to this call. This brief statement on ageism with a special focus on older people with mental health conditions is divided into three sections. We start by outlining the various manifestations of ageism in varied contexts and countries with a primary focus on the pandemic. Possible consequences of ageism with a focus on older people's mental health and well-being are outlined. We conclude by discussing ways to overcome ageism and reduce its occurrence, especially during times of extreme conditions.","Ayalon, Peisah, Lima, Verbeek, Rabheru","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2021.06.017","20210731","Ageism; covid-19; discrimination; human rights; older people","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-01","",16726,""
"Saving Lives: The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Rapid Naloxone Initiative","The United States is in the midst of an opioid epidemic within the COVID-19 pandemic, and veterans are twice as likely to die from accidental overdose compared to non-veterans. This article describes the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Rapid Naloxone Initiative, which aims to prevent opioid overdose deaths among veterans through (1) opioid overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND) to VHA patients at risk for opioid overdose, (2) VA Police naloxone, and (3) select automated external defibrillator (AED) cabinet naloxone. VHA has taken a multifaceted, theory-based approach to ensuring the rapid availability of naloxone to prevent opioid overdose deaths. Strategies targeted at multiple levels (for example, patient, provider, health care system) have enabled synergies to speed diffusion of this lifesaving practice. As of April 2021, 285,279 VHA patients had received naloxone from 31,730 unique prescribers, with 1,880 reported opioid overdose reversals with naloxone; 129 VHA facilities had equipped 3,552 VA Police officers with naloxone, with 136 reported opioid overdose reversals with VA Police naloxone; and 77 VHA facilities had equipped 1,095 AED cabinets with naloxone, with 10 reported opioid overdose reversals with AED cabinet naloxone. Remarkably, the COVID-19 pandemic had minimal impact on naloxone dispensing to VHA patients. The VHA Rapid Naloxone Initiative saves lives. VHA is sharing many of the tools and resources it has developed to support uptake across other health care systems. Health care systems need to work together to combat this horrific epidemic within a pandemic and prevent a leading cause of accidental death (opioid overdose).","Oliva, Richardson, Harvey, Bellino","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcjq.2021.06.004","20210731","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-01","",16727,""
