"Psychological Repercussions On Nursing Staff Due To The COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study","Introduction. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a high demand for health services, especially nursing. This workload can lead to emotional distress affecting their daily lives on a personal and professional basis. Objective. To examine the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress in nurses and to analyze the factors associated with their presence during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods. An observational cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out in a second-level hospital in Mexico between September and October 2020. Within a population of 150 nurses invited to the study, 116 participated by answering a questionnaire regarding emotional aspects during their time caring for COVID-19 patients, as well as using the depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS- 21). Results. Among de 116 participants, 77.6% were females, and 22.4% were males. The 91.4% reported fear of spreading the disease to their families, and 59.5% reported that the death of their patients infected with COVID-19 affected them deeply. The factors associated with moderate to extremely severe levels of depression were the attitude of indifference from the community to their work during the pandemic (OR:2.66) and the increase consumption of addictive substances (OR:9.80). In the stress subscale, the variables that conferred a significant association was working inside the COVID-19 area (OR:17.05), being severely affected by the death of patients infected (OR:4.23), and fear of entering the red zone (OR:19.47). The need for psychological care was associated with moderate to severe depression and anxiety. (OR:7.38, OR:9.50, respectively). For the anxiety subscale, no association with the studied variables was found. Conclusions. The study indicates a high prevalence of emotional distress among nurses, and that there were working, psychological and social factors associated with symptoms of depression and stress. Future research should focus on prevention measures and strategies to reduce psychological impact, as this could affect the quality of care provided to their patients. Resumen IntroducciÃ³n. La pandemia de la enfermedad por coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) ha provocado una alta demanda de servicios de salud, especialmente de enfermerÃ­a. Este aumento en la carga de trabajo pueden conducir a una angustia emocional que afecta su vida diaria tanto a nivel personal como profesional. Objetivo. Examinar la prevalencia de depresiÃ³n, ansiedad y estrÃ©s en enfermeras y analizar los factores asociados a su presencia durante la pandemia por la enfermedad de COVID-19. MÃ©todos. Se realizÃ³ un estudio observacional descriptivo de corte transversal en un hospital de segundo nivel en MÃ©xico, entre septiembre y octubre de 2020. De una poblaciÃ³n de 150 enfermeros(as), 116 participaron respondiendo un cuestionario sobre aspectos emocionales y la escala de depresiÃ³n, ansiedad y estrÃ©s (DASS-21). Resultados. De los 116 participantes el 77.6% eran mujeres y el 22.4% eran hombres. El 91.4% manifestÃ³ temor de contagiar la enfermedad a sus familiares y el 59.5 % se sintiÃ³ profundamente afectado por el fallecimiento de sus pacientes con COVID-19. Los factores asociados a niveles moderados a extremadamente severos de depresiÃ³n fueron la actitud indiferete por parte de la comunidad hacia su trabajo durante la pandemia (OR:2.66) y el aumento del consumo de sustancias adictivas (OR:9.80). En la subescala de estrÃ©s, las variables que confirieron asociaciÃ³n significativa fue trabajar en el Ã¡rea COVID-19 (OR:17,05), verse gravemente afectado por la muerte de pacientes con COVID-19 (OR:4,23), miedo a entrar en zona roja (OR: 19.47). La necesidad de atenciÃ³n psicolÃ³gica se asociÃ³ con depresiÃ³n y ansiedad moderadas a severa (OR:7.38, OR:9.50, respectivamente). Para la subescala de ansiedad no se encontrÃ³ asociaciÃ³n con las variables estudiadas. Conclusiones. El estudio indica una alta prevalencia de angustia emocional entre el personal de enfermerÃ­a, y se identificaron factores laborales, psicolÃ³gicos y sociales asociados a los sÃ­ntomas de depresiÃ³n y estrÃ©s. Las investigaciones futuras deben centrarse en medidas y estrategias de prevenciÃ³n para reducir el impacto psicolÃ³gico, ya que esto podrÃ­a afectar la calidad de la atenciÃ³n brindada a los pacientes.","Ponce, Deenis MartÃ­nez, Traconis, Mario Alberto Amat, Rosabal, LisvÃ¡n Yassel Cala, Xolio, Edgar Chapan, VelÃ¡zquez, Leslie Valenzuela, AmÃ©zquita, Mariana Gabriela Lecourtois","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhqr.2022.08.005","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Healthcare Quality Research;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-09","",37247,""
"PEG placements during the COVID-19 pandemic An audit of the procedures performed by a single consultant operator at a tertiary teaching hospital","PEG feeding provides a valuable nutritional access for patients with a functional gastrointestinal tract. The aim of this project was to audit all the PEG procedures performed by a single consultant operator during the Covid-19 pandemic including the indications, outcomes and complications. All the procedure reports were accessed to identify the patients, indications and immediate outcomes. For every patient, all the letters from all specialties were accessed for the dates following the procedure through the clinical records platforms to identify any later complications. A total of 92 procedures were performed between 15/3/2020 and 31/4/2021 in a total of 84 patients. Lists were operating at less than half capacity compared to pre Covid-19. 65 were planned PEG insertions, 17 were planned removals, and 10 were planned replacements. 5 of the procedures were for PEG-J insertion or replacement. The main indication was Head and Neck Ca in 59/92 procedures followed by CVA 9/92, chronic nausea/vomiting/gastroparesis in 6/92, dysphagia with or without aspiration risk in 4/92, MND in 4/92, CNS tumour post-op (pineal gland) in 2/92, cerebral palsy in 1/92, multiple sclerosis in 1/92, neurodegenerative disorder in 1/92, neuromuscular disorder in 1/92, chronic pancreatitis in 1/92, cystic fibrosis in 1/92, depression with poor oral intake in 1/92 and learning difficulties in 1/92. 83/92 procedures were completed successfully. 2 procedures had a failed intubation, 1 because of a subglottal stricture. The rest of the abandoned procedures were due to patient distress (2/92), high oesophageal stricture (1/92), failed cannulation (1/92), body habitus (1/92), stomach not translluminated and patient desaturation (1/92). One of the planned replacements failed because of a buried bumper. In two patients there was a small leak around the PEG site, 1 identified in the endoscopy room, 1 a few weeks later but both were managed conservatively and the PEG was kept in place. No other complications identified. From October 2020 the consistent use of Corflo PEGs reduced the service demands as these can be easily removed in the community. Lists during the COVID-19 pandemic were significantly impacted, especially UGI procedures, as these are aerosol generating procedures. The vast majority of the procedures are completed successfully and there are no significant complications. Most failed procedures are due to patient related factors such as tolerance and anatomical factors. The use of PEGs that can be removed in the community avoiding further endoscopic procedures is a valuable tool especially in this pandemic and early post-pandemic setting.","Pantzaris, N.

"Supporting the NHS during the Covid-19 pandemic to reduce hospital admissions and reducing the risk of Covid-19 infections between nurses and patients","As a national nursing service providing community nursing support for patients receiving enteral, parenteral nutrition and other intravenous therapies employing over 300 nurses, it was important to support the NHS during the Covid-19 pandemic. An NHS support campaign was launched which began by implementing a guiding principle across our service in relation to sending patients to hospital. The guiding principle was framed around keeping the patient at home safely to avoid admission. The guiding principle was: â€˜why hospital, why todayâ€™. This was communicated out across our nursing service and our standard operating procedures were updated to reflect this. To help raise awareness to this initiative we also launched a logo. This was added to the email footers of the nursing team and shared with our NHS partner hospitals. We increased the nursing service offering to further support admission prevention, to include the following: â€¢ Blood taking visits â€¢ Additional drug administration â€¢ Virtual patient assessments and training â€¢ Support/facilitate virtual clinics â€¢ Condensed patient training to aid reduced number of visits for training â€¢ Rapid discharge for nursed patients We reduced the number of nursing visits our patients were having to reduce the risk through contact: â€¢ Patients were offered training for themselves or a carer â€¢ Where clinically safe and in agreements with the referring centres and our patients, we reduced patientâ€™s visits to once a day from twice per day by administering 24-hour infusions, thus reducing contact and exposure to nurses and patients We offer a 24hour nurse Advise Line to support our patients and nurses in the community. As part of the â€˜Why Hospital Why Today â€˜initiative, the Advice Line worked hard to find ways to keep patients safely at home rather than advising hospital, along with discussions with the manager on call were able to reduce the number of out of hours hospital admissions. We also considered our patients mental health and well-being. Our patient cohort is a vulnerable group and they were being isolated from family and friends as well as reduced nursing visits which could impact on their mental health and well-being. We initiated weekly supportive calls to all our patients which were well received. During 2020 at the height of the pandemic, 27 hospital admissions were avoided, 6 patients completed the condensed patient training package, 160 patients had amendments to their prescription regime to reduce number of nurse visits, 63 patients initiated 24-hour parenteral nutrition infusions, halving their contact with nurses.","Dickinson, H.; Houston, Y.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2022.02.092","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Clinical Nutrition ESPEN; 48:514-515, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-09","",37249,""
"Assessment of macronutrient intake in subjects with mild to moderate pneumonia due to Covid 19 classified based on their nutritional status","Malnutrition, both severe and acute in covid 19 patients are particularly serious problems, may depress the immune system further indicating a poor outcome in terms of morbidity, quality of life and mortality1. Thus, dietary intake may play a major role in determining nutritional status of patients with pneumonia due to COVID 19. Aim was to screen and evaluate the intake of macro-nutrients in subjects who could tolerate oral intake with mild to moderate pneumonia due to Covid 19 assessed for nutritional status, fat free mass index (FFMI) and basic lung function. A cross sectional study was carried out on 71 patients admitted to an ICU in an urban multispecialty hospital from August 2020 to January 2021. Nutritional status, lung function, body composition was assessed using Patient generated Subjective global assessment (PGSGA), Spirometry and Fat Free Mass Index (FFMI) respectively. Dietary intakes were assessed using Food record charts (FRCs). The results show that higher proportion of subjects were unable to meet the RDI for energy (56%), protein (90%) and fat (66%);carbohydrate intake was above RDI (41%) despite of providing oral nutritional supplements in an attempt to meet the required dietary allowance and nutritional needs in these subjects. 24 (73%) subjects out of 33 under stage B & C reported lack of appetite with early satiety. Mean age of the patients was 62Â± 8.8 yrs. and mean BMI on admission was 21.1Â± 4.2 kg/m2. [Formula presented] In conclusion subjects included in this study with better nutritional status and nutrient intakes had better lung function. Hence, early identification of malnutrition by screening, assessment with timely nutrition intervention in COVID 19 subjects by fueling of deficits in nutrient intake may preserve lean body mass, improve nutritional status, avoid deterioration of lung function due to malnutrition thus leading to a probable positive prognosis of the disease.

"Physical and psychological impairment in survivors with acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Background Survivors of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are at risk of long-term comorbidities. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQoL), physical and psychological impairments in ARDS survivors from 3 months to 5 years follow-up after Intensive Care Unit discharge. Methods Systematic search of PubMed, AMED, BNI, CINAHL databases from January 2000 to date (PROSPERO: CRD42021296506). The primary outcome was HRQoL. Secondary outcomes included physical, pulmonary, and cognitive function, mental health and return to work. A secondary analysis compared classical ARDS with SARS-CoV-2 ARDS. Results Forty-eight papers met inclusion criteria including 11693 patients;of those 85% (n=9992) had classical ARDS and 14% (n=1632) SARS-CoV-2 ARDS. The SF-36 physical component summary score mean (95% CI) was 46 (41, 50) at 3 months, 39 (36, 41) at 6 months, and 40 (38, 43) at 12 months. The SF-36 mental component summary mean score was 53 (48, 57) at 3 months, 45 (40, 50) at 6 months, and 44 (42, 47) at 12 months. SF-36 was below normal population value up to 5 years. The predictive distance walked in 6 minutes was 57% (45, 69), 63% (56,69) and 66% (62, 70) at 3, 6 and 12 months respectively. Classical ARDS and SARS-CoV-2 ARDS had no difference in HR-QoL and physical function;but classical ARDS patients had higher incidence of anxiety and depression (p&lt; 0.001). Conclusion ARDS survivors can experience reduced HRQoL, physical and mental health impairment and symptoms may not recover completely up to 5 years after ICU discharge.","Fazzini, Brigitta, Battaglini, Denise, Carenzo, Luca, Pelosi, Paolo, Cecconi, Maurizio, Puthucheary, Zudin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bja.2022.08.013","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: British Journal of Anaesthesia;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-09","",37251,""
"Secondary traumatic stress and dissociative coping strategies in nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic: The protective role of resilience","During the COVID-19 pandemic, nurses are repeatedly exposed to acute stress at their workplace, and therefore, they are at high risk for developing mental health symptoms. The prolonged exposure of healthcare professionals may lead to Secondary Traumatic Stress (STS). STS is an aspect of â€œcost of careâ€, the natural consequence of providing care to people who suffer physically or psychologically. The purpose of this study was to investigate the levels of STS in nurses during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Greece and to detect aggravating and protective factors. Participants were 222 nurses (87.4Â % women;mean age 42.3Â years) who completed an online survey. The questionnaire comprised of the Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale, the Brief Resilience Scale, and the Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced Inventory. Nurses had high levels of STS. The hierarchical regression analyses showed that STS and its dimensions Avoidance and Arousal were positively predicted mainly by denial and self-distraction coping strategies and inversely by resilience. Resilience exhibited a protective (partial mediation) effect on the strong relationship between the dissociative coping strategies (denial, self-distraction, venting and behavioral disengagement) and STS. Trauma-informed care psychosocial interventions are needed to support the already overburdened nursing staff during the coronavirus pandemic.","Tsouvelas, George, Kalaitzaki, Argyroula, Tamiolaki, Alexandra, Rovithis, Michael, Konstantakopoulos, George","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnu.2022.08.010","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Archives of Psychiatric Nursing;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-09","",37252,""
"Associations between compassion fatigue, burnout and secondary traumatic stress with lifestyle factors in mental health nurses: A multicenter study from Uganda","Purpose This cross-sectional study aimed (a) to explore levels of compassion satisfaction, secondary traumatic stress, and symptoms of burnout among Ugandan mental health nurses working in regional referral hospitals in Uganda during the Covid-19 pandemic, and (b) to investigate associations between compassion satisfaction, secondary traumatic stress, and symptoms of burnout and sedentary levels, physical activity (PA) levels, sleep quality, and harmful drinking. Material and methods In total 108 mental health nurses from 8 regional referral hospitals across Uganda (ageÂ =Â 34.8Â Â±Â 10.0 years;55.6Â % female) completed the Professional Quality of Life Scale-5, (PQoLS-5), the Simple Physical Activity Questionnaire (SIMPAQ), Physical Activity Vital Sign (PAVS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test â€“ Concise (AUDIT-C). Spearman Rho correlations and Mann-Whitney U tests were applied. Results ProQOL-5 compassion satisfaction correlated significantly with SIMPAQ walking, PSQI and AUDIT-C, ProQOL-5 burnout with SIMPAQ exercise and PSQI and ProQOL-5 traumatic with SIMPAQ walking and PSQI. Mental health nurses meeting PA guidelines reported higher ProQOL-5 compassion satisfaction and lower ProQOL-5 burnout and traumatic stress than those who did not. Those who reported a poor sleep quality reported significantly less ProQOL-5 compassion satisfaction and higher ProQOL-5 burnout than those who did not. Those who reported harmful drinking patterns reported a significantly lower compassion satisfaction versus those who did not. Discussion In mental health nurses, a lower professional quality of life is associated with an unhealthy lifestyle. The effectiveness and efficacy of resilience and self-care programs for mental health nurses focusing on unhealthy lifestyle patterns should be explored.","Vancampfort, Davy, Mugisha, James","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnu.2022.08.009","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Archives of Psychiatric Nursing;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-09","",37253,""
"Telepharmacy at Mental Health Services: A new approach to medication therapy management during COVID-19","Service or Program: The number of COVID-19 infections have increased dramatically since March 2020 in Qatar. Measures have been taken to minimize the risk of exposure to COVID-19 including medication home delivery by postal service and by using telemedicine at The Mental Health Service (MHS), a tertiary care hospital in Qatar. In order to continue patients' access to care during the pandemic, the Medication Therapy Management (MTM) clinic at MHS would like to utilize clinical pharmacists to offer patient counseling, medication reviews, and develop medication action plans with the patients via telepharmacy. Justification/Documentation: Patients for whom counseling is essential to ensure positive outcomes of therapy were identified;patients on lithium or clozapine (phase 1), patient on newly prescribed psychotropics or on antipsychotic polypharmacy (phase 2), females on valproate in childbearing age (phase 3). The aim of this quality improvement (QI) project was to improve the number of patients currently receiving MTM service from baseline (90) by 20% by September 2020, 50% by December 2020 and 80% by March 2021. Outcome measure included percentage increase in patients from baseline who are receiving telepharmacy service, process measures included the percentage compliance of filling the Moresky Medication Adherence Scale-4 by the pharmacist, the percentage of referrals to other MHS services, balance measures were patient/caregivers and staff satisfaction. The improvement in outcome measure was successfully achieved in each phase;phase 1 - 28%, phase 2 - 82%, phase 3 - 127%. QI tools were used as appropriate. Adaptability: This service was intended to be provided by clinical pharmacists to adult patients registered under MHS. Similar service can easily be adapted to another setting by clinical pharmacists using comparable strategies and measures. Significance: The lessons learnt from this QI project will help in increasing patients' access to care, promote better utilization of resources, and allow better communication and management of patients.","Riaz, S.; Eltorki, Y.; Mahran, I.; Elbakary, N.; Abdallah, O.; Moursi, A.; Al-Khuzaei, N.","https://doi.org/10.1002/jac5.1661","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: JACCP Journal of the American College of Clinical Pharmacy; 5(7):779, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-09","",37254,""
"COVID-RELATED DISTRESS AND DISRUPTIONS IN OVARIAN CANCER SURVIVORS","Background: The objective of this study was to determine how levels of distress and disruption during the COVID-19 pandemic compared between ovarian cancer survivors and a community sample;how clinical and demographic characteristics of survivors were related to COVID-related distress and disruption;and if perceived stress, depression, and emotional well-being at cancer diagnosis predicted COVID-related distress during the first year of the pandemic. Methods: Ovarian cancer patients (N=90) who were part of 3 ongoing studies completed COVID surveys through mail and on REDCAP between 6/20 and 12/20. Responses were compared to those of community females (N=1110) who participated in a COVID survey mailed to an Iowa Statewide Voter Registration-based sample between 8/20 and 12/20. Pre-COVID data on perceived stress, depression, and emotional well-being (EWB) from ovarian cancer patients at the time of diagnosis was available for 30 long-term (=4 yrs) and 60 shorter-term (&lt;4 yrs) survivors. Hierarchical regressions examined whether psychosocial features at diagnosis, controlling for age, stage, total COVID disruption (healthcare, financial, and daily-life), and time since diagnosis, predicted COVID-related distress. Results: Compared to the community sample, ovarian cancer survivors reported lower levels of healthcare disruption (p=.016), financial hardship (p&lt;.001), and distress (p=.009), but no difference in disruption of daily activities (p=.089). Among survivors, there were no differences in distress or total COVID-related disruptions based on stage or time since diagnosis (all p values =0.10). Younger survivors (&lt;63 yr median) showed significantly greater distress (p=.009) and disruption (p=.001) than older survivors. Adjusting for covariates, perceived stress (ÃŸ=.237, p=.006) and EWB (ÃŸ= -.338, p&lt;.001) at diagnosis were significant predictors of total COVID-related distress, whereas depression was not. Conclusions: Surprisingly, cancer survivors reported fewer COVID-related disruptions and distress compared to a community sample. Older patients reported less distress and disruptions during COVID, but stage and time since diagnosis were not associated with these factors. The relationship between distress and well-being at diagnosis and COVID-related distress suggests the possibility of identifying patients particularly at-risk during environmental challenges.","Zia, S.; Telles, R.; Charlton, M.; Greteman, B.; Armer, J.; Noble, A.; Goodheart, M.

"Chicago Pediatric Firearm Deaths During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: Pediatric firearm injuries are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, residents of Chicago were placed under a â€œstay at homeâ€ order during the Spring of 2020. The full impact of these â€œstay at homeâ€ orders is unknown, but previous social and economic stressors have been associated with increased rates of violence. Additionally, studies demonstrate increased firearm purchases during this time period, a known risk factor for homicide and suicide. We sought to describe pediatric firearm associated deaths in Chicago during the COVID-19 pandemic and â€œstay at homeâ€ order. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of the Cook County Medical Examiner's database from January 2016 through December 2020. We collected information on all firearm associated deaths for persons less than 18 years old and compared deaths from 2020 during the COVID-19 Pandemic and Chicago's â€œstay at homeâ€ order to deaths from the previous 4 years to determine if there were differences that occurred during these time periods. Results: During the 5 year period, there were a total of 221 pediatric firearm deaths, 285 firearm homicides and 29 firearm suicides. 2020 had a similar number of pediatric firearm homicides, 67, compared to prior years, range 47-82. The majority of these firearm homicides occurred in Black (76%) children aged 15-17 (74%). There were more firearm homicides in persons aged 1-14 (14) in 2020 compared to prior years (range 3-10). June and July 2020 saw the highest number of firearm homicides per month, 9 and 11. The months during Chicago's â€œstay at homeâ€ order did not see an increase in firearm homicides compared to prior years, 11 compared to range 0-19. 2020 had a greater number of pediatric firearm suicides, 11, compared to prior years, range 2-7. There were more firearm suicides in Black children in 2020, 5, compared to prior years, range 1-2. The majority of firearm suicides occurred in children aged 15-17 (73%). Additionally, 2020 saw more firearm suicides in children aged 10-14, 3, compared to prior years, range 0-2. The months during Chicago's â€œstay at homeâ€ order did not see an increase in firearm suicides compared to prior years, 0 compared to range 0-3. Conclusion: Firearm injuries are a leading cause of death in children.

"BEREAVEMENT IN THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: THE GRIEF EXPERIENCE OF AFRICAN AMERICAN & LATINO COMMUNITIES","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic death rate for African American and Latinx communities is twice as high as White Americans, leaving more loved ones to cope with the difficulties of bereavement. With already existing challenges, the COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the need to understand the disproportionate struggles of people of color. Methods: To study the impact, we conducted the Survey of Bereavement After Covid-Related Death. In the current study, 267 participants answered online surveys, measuring loss characteristics, demographics, depression, grief, and an option for open-ended comments. Results: Grief and depression scores were predicted by kinship relationship, participant age, and time since loss, but were not predicted by gender, race, or ethnicity in regression analyses (grief: F = 6.38, p &lt; .001;depression: F = 5.30, p &lt; .001). However, the sample was not representative of the current population, with fewer African Americans and Hispanic/Latinx individuals than in the community. Conclusion: Pandemic grief severity and depression following bereavement is predicted by factors seen in pre-pandemic grief research. However, the study revealed that there are still significant challenges among recruiting underrepresented populations in academic research, indicating that further research is necessary.","West, M.

"IMPROVING PATIENT ENGAGEMENT AND EXPERIENCE: LESSONS LEARNED FROM LONG COVID","Background: Long COVID is increasingly recognized as a post-viral syndrome;however general knowledge within the medical field is limited and many with the syndrome continue to face challenges accessing healthcare. The present study examined long COVID patients' perceptions and experiences of medical care. Methods: Participants (N=123) with protracted COVID A-136 symptoms (? 3 months) were recruited via social media and completed online measures of premorbid health, COVID-19 positivity, symptoms, recovery, and perceptions of their healthcare experience. Satisfaction with medical care was rated on a scale of 0 ?very dissatisfied? to 4 ?very satisfied.? Results: Participant satisfaction of long COVID related healthcare ranged from ?dissatisfaction? with their emergency room experience (M=1.45, SD=1.37) to ?neither satisfied nor dissatisfied? for cardiology (M=2.43, SD=1.25). Fifty-six participants (46%) received an anxiety disorder diagnosis by at least one physician despite experiencing symptoms that were not consistent with the diagnosis (e.g. protracted fever, anosmia). As a result, they felt dismissed (84%), unheard (64%), angry (54%), and delayed (29%) or discontinued medical care (25%). Common themes in the open-ended responses included perceiving providers to be dismissive of long COVID medical literature (18%), female patients' belief that clinician response and treatment would have been different if they were male (15%), and a desire for clinicians to recognize limits of their knowledge (11%). Ten percent reported positive experiences, specifically when the relationship felt collaborative and/or the clinician recognized a need to learn more about post-COVID syndromes and complications. Another 5% acknowledged and empathized with challenges faced by the medical community during the pandemic. Discussion: These findings suggest that long COVID patients are generally dissatisfied with their healthcare experiences, and that, in line with research in other populations, engaging the patient's experience, working collaboratively, and recognizing limits of knowledge contribute to a more positive experience. When a formal mental health evaluation supports a psychiatric diagnosis, clinicians can improve patient engagement and treatment compliance by acknowledging symptoms that are inconsistent with such diagnosis and referring to other specialists as appropriate.","Walsh-Messinger, J.; Sizemore, J.; Kaouk, S.; Jalloh, M.; Quale, M.; Bishof, K.; Greenspan, N.; Debidda, M.","https://www.google.com/search?q=IMPROVING+PATIENT+ENGAGEMENT+AND+EXPERIENCE:+LESSONS+LEARNED+FROM+LONG+COVID","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychosomatic Medicine; 84(5):A136-A137, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-09","",37259,""

"THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC: ASSOCIATIONS OF OPTIMISM AND POSITIVE AFFECT WITH MENTAL & PHYSICAL HEALTH OUTCOMES","COVID-19 has led to the emergence of an altered society. Cumulative and individual stressors may lead to a time of crisis for students over time. Considering the detrimental impacts that stress may have, proper attention should be given to various mental and physical health issues. During this pandemic, there has been a high prevalence of anxiety and depression and serious impairments in mental and physical health. Previous studies suggest that certain psychosocial factors, such as optimism and positive affect, serve as valuable resources for mental and physical health during times of stress. However, the associations between optimism and positive affect with mental and physical health outcomes during the pandemic are yet to be investigated. This study aims to investigate these associations. We hypothesized that greater levels of optimism and positive affect would be associated with lower levels of depression, anxiety, and physical health symptoms during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. 293 university students were recruited to complete an online questionnaire in the spring of 2020. Longitudinal data was collected from participants every two months after, for a total of five assessments. Students self-reported their optimism, positive affect, anxiety, depression, and physical health levels. Multilevel modeling was used to test associations. Results indicated that greater optimism and positive affect were associated with fewer depressive symptoms, lower anxiety, fewer physical health symptoms, and better self-reported physical health (ps &lt; 0.05). When testing optimism and positive affect together, both were associated with depressive symptoms, but only optimism was associated with anxiety (ps &lt; 0.05). When entered together in the model, optimism and positive affect were not significantly associated with physical symptoms or self-reported physical health (ps &gt; 0.05). Results suggest optimism and positive affect may serve as resources during COVID-19, and there are overlaps in their effects on health. Further investigations could create and implement effective health interventions that promote optimism and positive affect.","Venkatesh, H. V.; Osorno, A.; Boehm, J. K.; Jenkins, B.

"CHILDHOOD TRAUMA EXPOSURE INCREASES LONG COVID RISK","Background: While long-term physical and psychological effects of COVID-19 remain unknown, it is clear that a proportion of COVID-19 survivors develop protracted respiratory, cardiovascular, neurologic, dermatologic, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms and complications following acute illness, herein referred to as long COVID (LC) syndrome.Females appear to be at higher risk for LC, and also have higher rates of childhood trauma, which is associated with a heightened inflammatory response to stress. The present study investigated the impact of childhood trauma on COVID-19 illness course and recovery, including mental health outcomes. Methods: Participants (N=244), recruited via social media, Prolific.au, and from a post-COVID clinical treatment trial, completed online self-report measures of premorbid health, COVID-19 positivity, symptoms, and recovery, along with measures of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and childhood (CTE) and recent (RTE) traumatic experiences. Results: Compared to recovered participants (N=110), the LC group (N=158) was older and predominantly female. Those who reported one or more CTE were nearly 3-fold more likely to develop LC (OR=2.87, CI, 0.95 to 8.60) while those who endorsed two or more CTE were 4.5 times more likely (OR=4.56, CI, 1.61 to 12.33). A binary logistic regression analysis revealed that chest pain (p&lt;.001), fatigue (p=.031), burning sensation (p=.002), and olfactory hallucinations (p&lt;.001) during acute COVID, along with sex (p=.001) and age (p&lt;.001) predicted LC. Compared to pre-COVID diagnoses, rates of PTSD (p&lt;.001), depression (p&lt;.001), and generalized anxiety (<U+03C7>2=12.32, p&lt;.001) increased across the entire sample and current PTSD (p=.001, partial <U+03B7>2=.042), depression (p&lt;.001, partial <U+03B7>2=.048), and anxiety (p=.017, partial <U+03B7>2=.022) severity were higher in the LC group. Discussion: These findings suggest that childhood trauma or early adversity may prove relevant to the development of long COVID via central nervous system changes and dysfunction in the form of central sensitization, somatosensory disruptions, and/or dysautonomia, resulting from a heightened inflammatory response. Psychiatric outcomes should be assessed following acute COVID-19, and future research is needed to determine the unique contributions of COVID-19 and general pandemic stress to post-illness mental health.","Van Den Hurk, A.

"INCREASED DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC REGARDLESS OF COVID-19 POSITIVITY","Background: Recent studies have reported increased rates of mood and anxiety disorders in COVID-19 patients after acute illness, possibly resulting from inflammation, which is linked to depression and childhood trauma. Increased rates of anxiety and depression have also been observed at the population level following past viral outbreaks (e.g. SARS-CoV-1, MERS) and pandemic associated stress could also impact mental health. Thus, the present study compared depression, anxiety, and perceived stress scores in university students who tested positive for COVID-19 to those who never contracted the disease, and to scores prior to the pandemic. Methods: University students completed self-report measures of depression, anxiety, and perceived stress before (N=150) and during (N=334) the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic sample also completed measures of COVID-19 positivity, symptoms, and recovery. One third of the sample tested positive for COVID-19 (N=109). Three x (pre-pandemic, COVID-19 positive, COVID-19 negative) x two (male, female) ANOVAs examined differences in depression, anxiety, and perceived stress. A two (COVID-19 positive, COVID-19 negative) x two (male, female) ANOVA compared PTSD severity. Results: There were significant group effects for depression (F(1,477)=3.06, p=.048, partial <U+03B7>2=.013), anxiety (F(1,477)=3.03, p=.049, partial <U+03B7>2=.013), and perceived stress (F(1,376)=5.62, p=.004, partial <U+03B7>2=.029). Post-hoc analyses indicated that depression and anxiety were higher in the COVID-19 positive (all p's &lt;.034) and negative (all p's &lt;.042) groups compared to the pre-pandemic sample, but did not differ across the pandemic samples (all p's &gt;.584). In contrast, perceived stress was higher in the pre-pandemic group compared to those who were COVID-19 positive (p=.033) and negative (p=.011). PTSD severity did not differ between the COVID-19 positive and negative groups (p=.645). Females were more depressed (p=.036), anxious (p&lt;.001) and stressed (p=.006) than males but did not differ in PTSD severity (p=.305). Discussion: These results suggest that rates of depression and anxiety have increased during the pandemic regardless of COVID-19 positivity. Reduced stress during the pandemic may reflect reduced extracurricular commitments due to university activity restrictions. Future research should examine if these results generalize beyond university students.","Ujvari, C.; Van Den Hurk, A.

"EFFECT OF ACE AND COPING ON COVID SELF-EFFICACY","It is well established that exposure to Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) can have a profound negative impact on physical and mental health and other health-related processes (e.g. decision making;Chang et al. 2019). Research has also indicated that individual differences in coping styles represent one pathway through which exposure to ACEs can confer risk for negative health outcomes (Sheffler et al. 2019). It is less clear however, whether the negative effects of exposure to ACEs extend also to one's self-efficacy for preventing and overcoming COVID-19. The current study aimed to examine the relationship between ACEs, measured as the total number of adverse childhood experiences endorsed on the Adverse Childhood Experiences Scale, and self-efficacy for preventing and overcoming COVID-19, measured using a modified version of the Self-Efficacy for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. In addition, we examined whether the use of avoidant coping strategies (denial, venting, and behavioral disengagement) derived from a principal components analysis of the Brief Coping Questionnaire, statistically mediated the association between ACE scores and COVID-19 self-efficacy. Young adults (N = 86, Mage = 23.6;69% female;34% Asian, 33% white, 23% Latinx, 8% Mixed Race, 2% Black or African American) completed measures as part of a larger study. A series of linear regression analyses indicated that both exposure to a greater number of ACEs (ÃŸ = -.23, p = .033) and greater use of avoidant coping strategies (ÃŸ = -.36, p &lt; .001) were associated with lower COVID-19 self-efficacy. On the other hand, ACE scores did not significantly predict the use of avoidant coping strategies (ÃŸ = .09, p = .41) and when entered into a model simultaneously, both ACEs (ÃŸ = -.20, p = .049) and coping (ÃŸ = -.34, p = .001) remained significant predictors of COVID-19 self-efficacy. These results indicate that ACE scores and the use of avoidant coping strategies independently affect COVID-19 self-efficacy, and confirm that the negative health effects of ACEs extend also to perceptions of ability to prevent and overcome COVID-19.","Tong, A.; Nguyen, S.; Josevska, N.; Miller, K.","https://www.google.com/search?q=EFFECT+OF+ACE+AND+COPING+ON+COVID+SELF-EFFICACY","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychosomatic Medicine; 84(5):A61, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-09","",37264,""

"COVID-19 CONSPIRACY BELIEFS ARE LINKED TO POORER PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING AND COVID-19 PREVENTION BEHAVIOR","Conspiracy theories are beliefs that a group of individuals is attempting to achieve sinister goals in secret. These beliefs usually result from fear and existential threat and are associated with decreased psychological and physical well-being. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted many people in the United States and COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs have grown in popularity. Such beliefs may undermine personal and public health, as past research indicates that greater conspiratorial thinking is associated with lower frequency of psychological well-being and preventative health behaviors. This study examined whether greater belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories would be linked to lower levels of psychological well-being (perceived stress and depression) and lower engagement in COVID-19 prevention behavior and COVID-19 vaccine receptivity in a sample of 1,728 U.S. adults recruited through the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform. Participants completed four online surveys over approximately one-year (April, July, September-October 2020, March-April 2021) to assess COVID-19 experiences and psychosocial and physical well-being. COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs were measured at waves two and four and well-being and COVID-19 prevention behaviors at every wave. Vaccine receptivity was assessed at wave 4. Greater belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories predicted greater levels of perceived stress (wave 2 ÃŸ=.11, p&lt;.001;wave 4 ÃŸ =.12, p&lt;.001) and greater levels of depressive symptomatology (wave 2 ÃŸ=.15, p&lt;.001;wave 4 ÃŸ =.12, p&lt;.001) at both waves, in regression models including age, sex, and race covariates. Greater conspiracy belief also predicted lower frequency of engagement in COVID-19 prevention behaviors (wave 2 ÃŸ=-.36, p&lt;.001;wave 4 ÃŸ =-.42, p&lt;.001), less receptivity to COVID-19 vaccination (ÃŸ =-.76, p&lt;.001), and less willingness to be vaccinated (OR for never getting vaccine = 4.95 (95% CI = 3.90, 6.28) and OR for might get vaccine = 2.15 (95% CI = 1.85, 2.49) compared to those already vaccinated or will vaccinate as soon as possible) . Given observed associations between COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs and decreased psychological well-being, lower engagement in COVID-19 prevention behaviors, and much lower receptivity towards vaccination, these beliefs appear to be important public health targets.","Standridge, N.; Tadros, C.; Gruenewald, T.","https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID-19+CONSPIRACY+BELIEFS+ARE+LINKED+TO+POORER+PSYCHOLOGICAL+WELL-BEING+AND+COVID-19+PREVENTION+BEHAVIOR","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychosomatic Medicine; 84(5):A80, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-09","",37266,""
"MAINTAINING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY DURING COVID-19: THE INFLUENCE OF PSYCHOSOCIAL VARIABLES IN INDIVIDUALS WITH BACK PAIN","Purpose Stressor events, such as COVID-19, may trigger adaptive or maladaptive pain management strategies among individuals with persistent low back pain (LBP). Emerging research shows individuals with lower fear avoidance, depression and anxiety, and greater positive affect and quality of life can better maintain positive pain management strategies during stressor events. For individuals with persistent LBP, physical activity (PA) has been shown to be a beneficial pain management strategy. This study investigated psychosocial variables of individuals with LBP who demonstrated adaptive pain management strategies during COVID-19, indicated by the maintenance of physical activity. Methods Twenty-five individuals with persistent LBP (age 22.4 (3.4) years, 7m, 18f) from an existing longitudinal cohort participated. Participants completed a baseline survey prior to COVID-19. This survey quantified demographics, pain severity, frequency, and duration. Other baseline measures were the Physical Activity Scale, the WHOQOL-Bref physical, psychological, social, and environmental quality of life subscales, Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Trait Affect scale. Participants then completed follow-up surveys for 18 months. During COVID-19 lockdown, the impact of lockdown on PA was assessed. The cohort was dichotomized into individuals reporting the same or more PA (MPA) and those reporting less PA (LPA) and baseline characteristics were compared between groups. Results The LPA group contained 17 individuals and the MPA group contained 8 individuals. There was no significant demographic difference between groups. The MPA group had greater duration of LBP symptoms (p=0.015, d =1.16). The MPA group trended towards higher physical quality of life (p=0.101, d=0.79) and higher environmental quality of life (p=0.057, d=0.96) at baseline. Individuals in the MPA group had lower negative affect (fatigue domain) scores than the LPA group (p=0.038, d=0.86). Depression scores were lower in the MPA group (p=0.006, d=1.12). Conclusions Individuals with persistent LBP who had greater duration of symptoms, better physical and environmental quality of life, lower negative affect, and less depression were more likely to maintain or increase physical activity during COVID-19. These characteristics may facilitate positive adaptation to a stressor event.","Stabbert, H. E.; Smith, J.

"ESCALATIONS IN EARLY COVID-19 DEATH COUNTS PREDICT DISTRESS VARIABILITY","Research has shown a complicated relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and well-being, particularly in its initial months when there was great uncertainty about the virus and its impact on daily life. While some work suggested increases in distress, other research shows fluctuations in levels of anxiety, stress, and depression as the pandemic progressed. The COVID-19 pandemic is not a monolithic experience but rather one with day-to-day variability perhaps accounting for these types of variations. Notably, each day individuals were exposed to updated information about its severity, including the number of deaths due to COVID-19. This paper tests if daily changes in COVID-19 severity as measured by reported deaths in February and March 2020 predicts daily distress and distress variability in emerging adults. Participants in California (n = 56;81.8% female;Mage = 20.53;Hispanic/Latinx 67.9%, White 58.2%, or Asian 16.4%) completed two consecutive weeks of ecological momentary assessment between February and March of 2020. A new cohort was enrolled weekly, providing a naturalistic experiment where participants were exposed to differing levels of daily and accumulated death counts. A brief distress scale was completed four times daily, resulting in 56 possible assessments. Daily averages and standard deviations were calculated for distress. Multilevel models tested cross-level relationships between COVID-19 deaths reported in California (accessed from California Department of Public Health), including daily deaths count and accumulated total death counts. Results indicated an inverse relationship between accumulated death counts and daily distress standard deviation (variability, b = -1.62, p = .03) suggesting a blunting effect as the COVID-19 pandemic escalates. No significant relationships were found for daily death counts nor mean distress. These findings point to a compounding of the severity COVID-19, highlighting its features as a chronic stressor and the need to understanding total versus acute exposure. Also, they support the use of variability metrics when studying individuals in stress environments. A blunted level of responding or numbness, even to negative cues over the course of a day could have serious implications for health, as this pattern prolonged over time indicates a lack of adaptation with sustained, low-grade increase in distress.","Small, A.

"DIGITAL BIOMARKERS FOR PREDICTING PTSD, DEPRESSION, AND BURNOUT IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT CLINICIANS","Background: The importance to protect emergency department (ED) clinicians' mental health has been dramatically reinforced in the COVID-19 pandemic leading to a high prevalence of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and other stress-associated adverse mental health effects in ED clinicians. This study proposes an innovative approach using digital phenotyping to develop Digital Biomarkers as predictors of stress pathologies. Furthermore, we determine how candidate digital biomarkers relate to physiological markers of chronic stress. Methods: We used computer vision and voice analysis to extract facial, voice, speech, and movement characteristics from an unstructured clinical interview. Previously, we tested the approach to identify digital biomarkers in a cohort of trauma survivors to discriminate PTSD. Here, we adapted the approach to test its potential to develop digital biomarkers as predictors of stress pathologies in ED clinicians. Results: Video- and audio-based markers were able to accurately discriminate PTSD (AUC=0.90) and depression status (AUC=0.86) in trauma survivors. Building on these results, we will present pilot findings from an ongoing longitudinal study of COVID-19 frontline workers. Conclusion: Digital biomarkers identified in direct clinical observation during free speech may be used to classify stress pathologies in ED clinicians. Digital biomarkers could improve the scalability and sensitivity of clinical assessments using low burden, passive evaluations of well-being, which is critical among this high-risk population.","Schultebraucks, K.; Chang, B.","https://www.google.com/search?q=DIGITAL+BIOMARKERS+FOR+PREDICTING+PTSD,+DEPRESSION,+AND+BURNOUT+IN+EMERGENCY+DEPARTMENT+CLINICIANS","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychosomatic Medicine; 84(5):A84, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-09","",37270,""
"CONNECTION TO NATURE ATTENUATES THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN GRIEF AND DECREASED MENTAL HEALTH","Grief predicts decreased mental health over time (Ott, 2003). Furthermore, a sense of connection to the natural world is correlated with greater physical and mental health (Dean et al., 2018). We hypothesized, therefore, that feeling connection with nature buffers the association of grief with depression and anxiety. We sampled eighty-six mTurk workers, 18 Facebook users, and 6 Reddit users who self-disclosed the passing of a close individual from COVID-19. Participants completed an online questionnaire which included measures of grief (Shear & Essock, 2006;Guarnaccia & Hayslip, 1998), depression (PHO, 2019), anxiety (Spitzer et al., 2006), and nature connectedness (CNS;Mayer & Frantz, 2004). Connection to nature moderated the effect of grief on depression when controlling for gender, age, and days since the passing of the loved one, b = - 1.61, SE = .77, t(91) = -2.09, p = .04. Similarly, connection to nature marginally moderated the effect of grief on anxiety, b = -.99, SE = .56, t(93) = -1.77, p = .08. Simple slope analyses indicated that grief was associated with anxiety/depression only for people low (1 SD below the mean) in connection to nature, bs = 1.54, SEs = .58, ts = 3.59, ps &lt; .001, but not for people high (1 SD above the mean) in connection to nature, bs = .47, SEs = .42, ts = 1.12, ps = .27. Self-reported time spent in nature did not moderate the relationship between grief and anxiety or depression, bs = .21, SEs = .17, ts = .91, ps = .36. Consequently, connection to nature-not actual time spent in natural settings-impacts mental health outcomes related to grief. Further research is needed to demonstrate that connection to nature buffers the effects of long-term mental health outcomes following bereavement.","Schony, M.; Mischkowski, D.","https://www.google.com/search?q=CONNECTION+TO+NATURE+ATTENUATES+THE+ASSOCIATION+BETWEEN+GRIEF+AND+DECREASED+MENTAL+HEALTH","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychosomatic Medicine; 84(5):A72-A73, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-09","",37271,""
"An Innovative Pilot Program Addressing Food Insecurity in the Pediatric Primary Care Setting","Background: Food insecurity has long been established as a social determinant of health. Food insecurity in children is correlated with adverse health outcomes including poor overall health, obesity, asthma, allergies, anxiety and depression. Traditional interventions for food insecurity in the pediatric primary care setting have included referral to food banks, food vouchers and assistance programs. Limited research has been done examining the impact of meal delivery or of the feasibility of integrating food assistance directly into the pediatric practice. The objective of this pilot study is to determine if a medical home centered meal delivery program is acceptable, feasible and effective in reducing food insecurity and stress in families with children ages 0-5. Methods: The Division of Community Pediatrics (DCP) provides healthcare to vulnerable children in an urban area. DCP partnered with Share Our Strength's No Kid Hungry, and the Power of 10, a restaurant industry non-profit, to design and implement a pilot program to address food insecurity for families with young children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ready to heat and serve healthy meals were delivered to the household twice a week to provide one meal per day per family member for 10 weeks. Surveys were conducted before and after receipt of 10 weeks of meal delivery during the pandemic among an adult caregiver. Survey questions were adapted from existing survey tools that examine meal delivery program implementation effectiveness, program acceptability, food insecurity and caregiver stress. Results: 43 families with at least one child age 0-5 enrolled and received meals. The majority (83%) stayed in the program until the conclusion. 31 families completed both the pre-test and the post-test. The average household size of participants was 5.6 members with an average of 2 children under age 5. Most (84%) participants were already receiving food assistance like WIC and/or SNAP benefits. The number of families who experienced food insecurity decreased with program participation (Table 1). Satisfaction and acceptability with the program was high (Table 2). Most (77.4%) said they and their children ate more fruits and vegetables than normal. Of those worried about food before the intervention, 66.7% were no longer worried at the end of the program (p=0.0001). Of those who ran out of food before the intervention, 71% reported no longer running out of food at the end of the intervention (p=0.0001). Conclusion: This innovative pilot program demonstrated that meal delivery through the primary care setting is feasible and effective in reducing food insecurity. It improved the quality of food consumed. Participants were satisfied with the program and there was a high retention rate. There was less reported worry about food running out by the conclusion of the program.","Sandel, P. M.; Gremont, C.; Odom, J.; Agama, S.; Bryan, N.; Makkapati, D.; Johnson, N.

"THE PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT OF LIVING WITH ASTHMA DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Background Underlying chronic conditions could make individuals particularly vulnerable to environmental stress during the coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Comorbid psychopathology frequent in asthma could increase the vulnerability of this population. As psychological symptoms are intimately linked with asthma control, research is needed to uncover potential mental health considerations for the clinical management of asthma in a pandemic setting. Objective We investigated whether differences exist between asthmatics relative to non-asthmatics in various dimensions of psychological health during a pandemic. We then investigated how perceived COVID-19 vulnerability, asthma and COVID-19 symptom experience, and symptom-related worry may mediate group differences in psychological distress. Methods Survey data on the physical, psychological, and pandemicrelated health of 234 adults was collected from July-November 2020. Controlling for demographic and health-related confounds, multiple regression analyses examined differences in psychological distress between asthmatics (n=111) and nonasthmatic controls (n=123) during a pandemic. Mediation analyses investigated roles of perceived COVID-19 vulnerability, symptom experience, and symptom-related worry in this model. Results Compared to non-asthmatics, scores on anxiety, stress, and symptoms of burnout were significantly higher for individuals with asthma (P&lt;.05). Emotional exhaustion, represented by a subscale of the Maslach Burnout Inventory, remained elevated beyond general anxiety and depression. Experience of symptoms typical in both asthma and COVID-19 (i.e., chest tightness) mediated 42% of this effect (95%CI=[0.72, 2.51]). Conclusion The mental health of individuals with asthma is differentially impacted in a pandemic environment compared to individuals without asthma. Characteristics of burnout, partially mediated by physical symptoms related to asthma and COVID-19, may constitute a new ?symptom burnout? phenomenon related to viral pandemics. This phenomenon emerged over and above comorbid anxiety and depression, which are commonly observed in asthma. Our findings can contribute to an optimization of asthma management, and more research is needed to understand whether ?symptom burnout? exists beyond the limited access to care and heightened environmental stress of a viral pandemic.","Salsman, M.

"UNCERTAINTY AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS DURING COVID-19: A GLOBAL STUDY TO EXAMINE THE ROLE OF RESILIENCE AND PERCEIVED SOCIAL SUPPORT","Objectives. In this study we examined the relationship between perceived uncertainty and depression/ anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic and we tested the moderating roles of resilience and perceived social support in this relationship. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted between March 31st and May 15th, 2020, using an online, multi-language, international survey built within Qualtrics. The study included 3786 respondents from 94 different countries, 47.7% of whom reported residence in the United States of America. We collected data on sociodemographic features, perceived uncertainty, perceived social support, depression and anxiety symptoms, and resilience. A moderation model was tested using model 2 of Hayes' PROCESS macro for SPSS. Results. Results demonstrated that higher perceived uncertainty was associated with more symptoms of depression and anxiety (r = 0.54;p&lt; .001). Higher resilience levels and higher perceived social support were associated with fewer depression and anxiety symptoms (r =-0.49, p&lt; .001 and r =-0.25, p&lt; .001, respectively). The moderation hypotheses were supported (F (5, 3780) = 585.6, p&lt; 0.0001);the relationship between uncertainty and symptoms of depression and anxiety decreased as levels of resilience increased (B =-0.16;p&lt; .0001) and as perceived social support increased (B =-0.10;p&lt; .0001). Conclusion. The study confirms the importance of resilience and social support in buffering the impact of major upheaval, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The results indicate that resilience and social support could be helpful targets to reduce the negative effects of uncertainty on depression and anxiety symptoms.","Salah, A. B.; DeAngelis, B.

"ASTHMA, AIRWAY INFLAMMATION AND PTSD ASSOCIATION: RELEVANT MODELS AND A ROLE OF IL17A","Background: There is a growing interest in airway inflammation and mental health. Recent genetic and epidemiological evidence supports an association between PTSD and asthma however, contributory immune mediators/mechanisms are unclear. Recent work from our group employs mouse aeroallergen, house dust mite (HDM) models to examine the role of severe asthma linked inflammatory T helper cells, Th17 and interleukin 17 (IL-17A) in regulating PTSD-relevant behaviors. Methods: A combination of behavioral, immunological, transgenic and transcriptomic approaches were used. 1) BALBc-C5a receptor treatment that shifts Th2 mild asthma phenotype to Th17/IL17a expansion and robust airway inflammation;2) IL-17a receptor knockout mice and 3) RNAseq transcriptomics of cortical and blood brain barrier compromised area, subfornical organ (SFO) tissue was performed. Fear conditioning and extinction was assessed as a PTSD-relevant behavior. Results: Induction of Th17/IL-17 in the BALBc/anti-C5aR1 treated mice resulted in compromised fear extinction and increased fear reinstatement. Absence of IL-17 signaling in IL17Ra deficient mice attenuated HDM effects on fear extinction. Preliminary evidence suggests a potential of the SFO in translating HDM effects to the medial prefrontal cortex, an area regulating fear extinction. Transcriptomic analyses revealed modulation of immune T cell-targeted signaling pathways within the SFO in mice with Th17A expansion. Conclusion: Overall, our work provides novel insights on mechanisms by which mediators of severe airway inflammation, Th17/IL17A regulate fear memory of relevance to PTSD. Beyond asthma-PTSD, our findings have relevant implications for other pulmonary (e.g. COVID-19) and autoimmune inflammatory conditions and mental health.","Sah, R.","https://www.google.com/search?q=ASTHMA,+AIRWAY+INFLAMMATION+AND+PTSD+ASSOCIATION:+RELEVANT+MODELS+AND+A+ROLE+OF+IL17A","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychosomatic Medicine; 84(5):A141-A142, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-09","",37275,""
"THERAPEUTIC ALLIANCE AND WELL-BEING FROM USE OF A GLOBAL DIGITAL MENTAL HEALTH BENEFIT DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Background: Digital mental health services leverage technology to increase access to care, yet less is known about how quality therapeutic relationships form in a virtual setting. This study examined therapeutic alliance (a mechanism underlying successful treatment) and its association with well-being among registrants of a digital mental health platform. Method: Adults (n=3,087, M age=36Â±9 years, 54% female) engaged in videoconference sessions with a licensed therapist (18%), certified coach (65%), or both (17%) between 9/29/20-10/12/21. Members completed 2 adapted items of the Working Alliance Inventory (goal and bond) after each session and we averaged ratings across visits (?=.72). We used the WHO-5 to measure changes in well-being. We performed Mann-Whitney U tests, Kruskal-Wallis tests, paired samples t-tests, and linear regressions to examine: (1) average alliance ratings;(2) differences in alliance by member demographics and provider type;and (3) if alliance was related to changes in well-being over time. Results: Members completed a median of 3 digital sessions over a median of 28 days. Median therapeutic alliance was 4.8 (range=1-5) and did not differ by age, country, or baseline well-being (ps&gt;.07). Females reported higher alliance than males (4.88 vs. 4.67, p=.01). Members in coaching reported higher alliance than those in therapy or both modalities (4.83 v. 4.75, p=.004), though effect sizes were negligible. Members reported an average WHO-5 increase of 4.14 points (95% CI [3.44, 4.83], p&lt;.001), a 10% improvement in well-being (d=0.22). Therapeutic alliance predicted greater well-being at follow-up (b=2.17, 95% CI [1.07, 3.28]) after controlling for age, sex, and baseline WHO-5 (R2=.22, p&lt;.001). This association did not differ by provider type (p=.78). Conclusion: Members of a global digital mental health benefit formed a high therapeutic alliance with their providers, both coaches and therapists. Higher alliance was associated with greater well-being improvements, providing evidence that it is a key mechanism in virtual care outcomes as it is in face-to-face care. Continued focus on the quality of therapeutic relationships will ensure digital mental health services are patient-tailored as these platforms expand equitable access to evidence-based care.","Sagui-Henson, S.; Prescott, M.; Chamberlain, C.

"Experience of COVID-19 and Postpartum Mental Health","Background: Early reports show pregnant and postpartum women have increased rates of anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. These elevations could be related to fear of contracting COVID or mitigation strategies, such as social distancing and stay-at-home orders. First-time mothers may be uniquely vulnerable to these stressors. We examined whether 1) exposure to potentially stressful COVID-19 events, perceived impact of COVID-19, and COVID-19 distress are related to anxiety and depression symptoms reported by first-time mothers, and 2) whether the relationship between COVID-19 related stressors and anxiety and depression is stronger for mothers reporting less social support. Methods: We interviewed 125 first-time mothers of infants less than 3 months old from four pediatric primary care offices in Pennsylvania and Delaware (June 2020 - February 2021). Mothers completed a self-report interview asking about social support, COVID-19 experiences, and anxiety and depression symptoms (EPDS Total, Anxiety, Depression). The COVID-19 measure yielded three variables: 1) number of potentially stressful COVID-19 pandemic-related events (Event Exposure), 2) perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on family (Family Impact), and 3) overall perceived distress related to the pandemic (Distress). Results: Participants (mean age = 29.18, SD: 5.50) were racially representative of the recruitment clinics (40.8% White;37.6% Black;11.2% Asian/Asian American;6.4% Latina). Hierarchical linear regression found COVID-19 Event Exposure was unrelated to Depression (ÃŸ = 0.03, n.s.) and Anxiety (ÃŸ = 0.04, n.s.). Controlling for Event Exposure, Family Impact was associated with higher EPDS Total (ÃŸ = 0.32, p = 0.001), Depression (ÃŸ = 0.29, p =.003), and Anxiety (ÃŸ = 0.23, p = 0.02). Distress was significantly associated with higher EPDS Total (ÃŸ = 0.21, p = 0.04) and Depression (ÃŸ = 0.26, p = 00.01) but not Anxiety (ÃŸ = 0.08, n.s.). Mothers reporting less social support had higher Depression scores (r = 0.26, p =.003), but social support was unrelated to Anxiety (r = 0.08, p = 0.41). The interaction of Family Impact and social support produced a nonsignificant trend (p = 0.09, Figure). Conclusion: While experience of more COVID-19 related events was unrelated to maternal anxiety and depression symptoms, maternal report of impact of COVID-19 on the family was associated with both anxiety and depression symptoms. Additionally, higher maternal distress reports and less perceived social supports were related to increased maternal depression symptoms. Therefore, future work should explore how to mitigate impact of COVID-19 families and connect mothers to social support to support maternal mental health.","Rohde, J.; Harrison, M.; Hatchimonji, D.; Berman, T.; Flatley, C.

"Efficacy of a Home Visiting Program on Child Outcomes: A Randomized Controlled Trial","Background: High-quality home visiting programs are designed to improve child health and support expecting and new parents. These programs can assist families in developing skills and garnering the resources necessary to raise healthy children. A non-profit organization operating in the Southwestern United States provides a universal home visiting program to families having their first child (first-time for either the mother or father), including child by birth, adoption, or child placement. The program includes participant advocacy, home-based visits, and an enhanced referral program. The present study examines the effects of the program on child development outcomes at 12- month follow-up. Methods: Data were collected as part of a larger randomized controlled trial in which first-time families were randomly assigned to the home visiting program (n = 179) or a business-as-usual control group (n =164). This study follows the family and the child until the child graduates from high school or turns 19. The Ages â€¢Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) was used to assess five domains of child development. Although this outcome was measured at 2, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36-month, the present study focuses on the five domain outcomes at 12 months. Results: Results of independent-sample t-tests showed that, compared to controls, children in the home visiting program reported significantly better communication (t(280)=2.328, p=0.02, d=.277 [small effect]), gross motor skills (t(280)=2.601, p=0.01, d=.306 [small effect]), fine motor skills (t(280)= 3.010, p=.008, d=.357 [small effect]), problem-solving (t(280)=5.218), p&lt;.001, d=.631 [moderate effect]), and personalsocial functioning (t(280)=3.355, p=.002, d=.404 [small effect]) at 12-month follow-up. Conclusion: The 12-month follow-up showed promising evidence of the effectiveness of the home visiting program under investigation. It is important to continue to follow these children to determine longer-term outcomes. As this study is ongoing, we will be able to examine the degree to which these early childhood outcomes are predictive of school readiness, broader dimensions of health functioning, and decreased criminal justice involvement.

"Increase in Psychiatric Care Needs of Rural Children Postcovid-19","Background: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic children were deprived of in-person attendance at school and experienced social isolation. The impact of these social-distancing measures on pediatric mental health is only now being unraveled. We conducted a descriptive review of psychiatric diagnoses at a pediatric outpatient practice in a Southern Illinois rural community. We compared the trends of pediatric psychiatric diagnosis before and following the COVID pandemic. Methods: Pediatric Group LLC has multiple office locations in Rural Southern Illinois catering to about 10,000 pediatric patients staffed by pediatric providers and a clinical psychologist. The pediatric population has remained stable during the period. The care providers and practices have remained unchanged over the past four years. We did a retrospective review of electronic health records from January 2019 through June 2021. Using ICD10 diagnostic codes, we analyzed the top 100 diagnoses made at the pediatric practice. Diagnoses were broadly classified into psychiatric and non-psychiatric categories. Psychiatric illnesses included anxiety, attention deficit hypersensitivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorders, mood disorders, sleep disorders, and other psychiatric illnesses such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Descriptive comparisons were made between pre-COVID (2019) and post-COVID (2021) periods. Results: Compared to a baseline of 5044 encounters in 2019 (pre-COVID), attendance was 9% lower (4680) in 2020. Attendance dropped by 14% (2206) in the first half of 2020, increasing by 11% (2474) to reach preCOVID levels in the second half of 2020. The attendances continued to increase in the first half of 2021, reaching 43% higher (3614) numbers compared to pre-COVID levels. Compared to 2019 and 2020, an increase in all psychiatric diagnoses was seen in our offices in the year 2021. Further analysis of the year 2021 showed significant increases in Anxiety and Depressive disorders, Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), Disruptive Mood Dysregulation disorder (DMDD), and Major Depressive disorders (MDD) that almost doubled the statistics from the pre-COVID period. Sleep disorders and Post Traumatic Distress Disorder (PTSD) visits increased by far more than 150 percent. (Table 1) Conclusion: A steady increase in pediatric psychiatric illness has been noted in the second half of 2020 and first half of 2021 following COVID pandemic. We observed an increase by over two times with almost all the psychiatric disorders in 2021. The overall increase in the incidence of various pediatric psychiatric illnesses is concerning. We believe that the absence of in-school attendance may have played a significant role.","Reddy, P.

"Regional Metrics Pertinent for Children and Familiesin Disaster Cycle","Background: Awareness of day to day situations that can effect children and families in disasters is an important component to mitigation in the disaster cycle through the development of standardized metrics to evaluate all types of events. Children make up 20% of the US population and are impacted physically and emotionally by disasters. Issues related to social and physical determinants of health emphasize the inequities between preparedness for the segments of the US population in different communities, as evidenced by the COVID pandemic. Tools have been created to assist communities to address hazards, such as the Hazard Vulnerability Analysis (HVA) and the Threat Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (THIRA), but unique needs of children are not included or highlighted in these tools. The Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) created two Pediatric Disaster Centers of Excellence (COE) in 2019, Western Regional Alliance for Pediatric Emergency Management (WRAP- EM) and Eastern Great Lakes Pediatric Consortium for Disaster Response (EGLPCDR) and situational awareness around pediatrics and disasters was a important deliverable. Methods: Along with the two pediatric COE, and Emergency Medical Services for Children (EMSC/EIIC) disaster domain experts, a group of pediatric disaster subject matter experts (SME) identified key infrastructures and support mechanisms that exist and could be important to healthcare coalitions or communities when considering children and families within a region. Through a modified delphi process, nine domains were recommended. The domains consisted of healthcare expertise available within a region, mental health considerations, community resiliency, early education and schools, transportation services, public health jurisdiction, shelters and sheltering in place, supply chain and patient tracking, reunification and evacuation. Results: An extensive literature search was completed to review existing resources that could inform quality measures within the domains identified. Alignment of available measures that could inform the domains was completed and a scorecard was created to pilot among healthcare coalitions to better assess community level awareness for children and families that are important to the entire disaster cycle. This scorecard and preliminary evaluation will be used to create the first regional metrics scorecard for situational awareness to help inform the nine domains within communities or healthcare coalitions that can be important to consider when mitigating for disasters effecting children and families. Conclusion: When used at least annually, this regional metrics scorecard can inform where improvement and where further attention is needed to better prepare for future disasters improving the resilience for children and families and the entire community.","Pintea, M.; Dahl Grove, D.

"Digital Literacy against Fake News: Strategies and Gaps among University Students","The global crisis in the flow of information and communications due to COVID-19, infodemia, largely caused by social networks, has left a global concern about the impact of fake news on societies. The increase in the consumption of networks and the presence of the population in these spaces impose the need to know how to adequately address this social problem, which involves the management of digital identity and network consumption habits. In this sense, the study presented here, of an exploratory nature and with the philosophy of exploration-action, has the dual objective of exploring the perceptions, uses and consumption of digital identity, social networks, and fake news in order, secondly, to propose specific actions. The research is approached with a quantitative, descriptive, and correlational methodology in a sample of 248 master's and bachelor's degree students from 17 different autonomous communities. The results indicate a significant lack of knowledge despite the degree of use and consumption, revealing the need for specific actions that require specific digital literacy.

"Perinatal Mood Anxiety Disorders(PMAD) Screening in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit(NICU) and the Pediatric Emergency Department(ED)","Purpose/Objectives: Recognizing the impact of Perinatal Mood and Anxiety Disorders (PMAD) on childrens and their caregivers, providers from the Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) and the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at Children's National (CN) Hospital sought to institute universal screening of parents for PMADs. Early identification of those with depressive symptoms would allow for the provision of resources that promote caregiver mental health. Our goal is to improve the mental health post-partum caregivers through early detection. Design/Methods: In August 2018, the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Screen (EPDS) was selected as a screening tool, and an electronic form was developed and housed in REDCap. Using the IHI model for improvement, several interventions were performed. A part-time family services staff member was hired to screen during normal business hours all caregivers who fit the eligibility criteria. Real-time social work interventions and linkage to resources were provided to all screened caregivers. Those who screened positive received further care and referral. Screening was changed from an opt-in to an opt-out process as staff became comfortable with approaching parents. When the pandemic hit, screening was halted for 1 month. In July 2020, new funding was obtained which allowed an increase in the workforce, extending the coverage to evenings and weekends. A part-time psychologist was then hired to provide telemedicine therapy for parents requiring further treatment. Results: In the NICU, 1105 parents were approached from August 2018 to June 2021. Of those approached 982 (88%) completed screening, 245 (24%) were positive, 38 indicated having suicidal thoughts (3%), and 112 were fathers (11%). In the PED, 1586 parents were approached in the same time period. Of those approached 1338 (89%) completed the screen, 220 (16%) of parents screened positive, 39 indicated having suicidal thoughts (3%), and 118 were fathers (9%). Major challenges were lack of caregiver time or bedside availability (NICU), no translator availability for languages other than English and Spanish, caregiver refusal, no night coverage, COVID concerns, and inadequate staff buy-in at the beginning of the project. Screening in the PED was hampered by rapid patient turnover. Conclusion/Discussion: Our data shows that PMAD rates at CNH are higher than the published literature. A universal postpartum depression and anxiety screening program is a critical first step for hospitals caring for postpartum parents both in the inpatient and outpatient setting. Electronic tools such as electronic screens and telemedicine can aid significantly in expanding screening and follow up. Human resources are key to success. Remote screening, overnight access, care coordination, and translation of screens into other languages will be key next steps.","Perazzo, S. I.; Jarvis, L. R.; Israel, S.; Lee, M. C.; Koozmin, A.

"ELEVATED HAIR CORTISOL CONCENTRATIONS IN YOUTH DURING THE PANDEMIC","The COVID-19 pandemic has elicited increases in stress, anxiety and depression, as evidenced in large samples of adults (Ettman et al., 2020;Jia et al., 2020). In youth, mental health symptoms also appear elevated compared to pre-pandemic norms (Glynn et al., 2021, Hawke et al., 2020). While children's mental health symptoms appear to be increasing during the pandemic, many studies implement cross-sectional, rather than longitudinal designs. Therefore, less is known about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on youth's stress and within-person changes over time. In addition, studying stress biomarkers such as hair cortisol can inform about the impact that the current pandemic and resulting changes to daily life have on youth's stress physiology. To our knowledge, only one previous study examined hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) in children during the pandemic, and found that more negative changes to family life predicted greater HCC in 4-5-year-old children relative to pre-pandemic HCC (Hastings et al., 2021). The present study utilized hair cortisol data collected pre-pandemic (2017-2020) and re-contacted participants to participate in a follow-up study during the pandemic (October 2020 - March 2021). Participants (N = 86, 61.7% female) included youth ages 10-13 (M = 11.41, SD = .95) who had provided hair samples in the original study and agreed to provide a second hair sample during the pandemic. Parents collected hair samples from youth while guided by experimenters via Zoom and mailed the samples to our laboratory. Parents and youth also completed questionnaires regarding the impact of the pandemic on their lives, including the Covid-19 Adolescent Symptom & Psychological Experience Questionnaire. The Child Life Events and Perceived Stress Scales were administered both before and during the pandemic. Initial paired samples t-tests revealed a significant increase in hair cortisol from pre-pandemic to post-pandemic, t(79) = 3.305, p = .001, and increases in youth self-reported perceived stress, t(84) = 7.15, p &lt; .0001. Conference analyses will include comparing post-pandemic HCC in this sample to another age-matched pre-pandemic comparison group to account for any age-related differences. The present study illustrates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children's long-term cortisol output using a within-person design.","Parenteau, A. M.; Yi, S. C.; Fu, B. T.; Alen, N. V.; Deer, L.

"Olfactory disorders: Diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment","The sense of smell, one of the five basic senses that humans have, helps us detect different types of odors. It also plays an important role in the detection of pollutants, toxic gases, or rotten and hazardous foods. Although olfaction is considered less important than the other senses, smell disorders could cause a variety of problems, including reduced taste detection due to the relationship between taste and smell, depression, and overall loss of quality of life. Olfactory dysfunction is one of the first clinical signs of neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The olfactory disorder has many etiologies, some of which are more obvious. Most people with olfactory disorders have experienced a recent illness or trauma. Common causes of olfactory disorders include aging, rhinosinusitis, upper respiratory infections, and cerebral lesion;the rest of the cases are less relevant. Since there are limited evidence-based treatments for olfactory disorders, it is necessary to share information about the risks associated with these disorders. This information includes practical and useful screening measures for olfactory dysfunction, appropriate clinical evaluation, patient counseling to prevent injury, health and quality of life management, and the introduction of treatments with higher recovery rates. This review study focuses on the etiology, prevalence, and short-term and long-term consequences of olfactory disorders. Also, diagnostic strategies and new treatment options have been developed and discussed.","Moradi, S.; Kamrava, S.

"Barriers to Academic Performance in Distance Learning Settings Among College Students","Background: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many colleges during the 2020 spring term transitioned to distance learning. This new learning environment posed numerous obstacles that may have negatively affected the academic performance of students, and these obstacles may be more prevalent amongst minority groups. The objective of this study is to assess the prevalence of barriers to academic performance among US college students in distance learning environments during COVID-19. Methods: An anonymous, voluntary survey was distributed to academic student groups at 166 accredited colleges/universities across 44 states by email in June 2020. Students were asked if their college transitioned to distance learning and other questions related to their educational experience. Students were asked if they faced barriers that affected their academic performance after transitioning to distance learning. If yes, they were able to select from a list of barriers to online learning which they believed affected their academic performance during this transition. Students were able to choose more than one option from the list. Chi-Squared analyses were performed to examine differences in barriers to academic performance for Hispanic and non-Hispanic students. Sample size for other racial or ethnic groups were inadequate for Chi-Squared analyses. Results: A total of 682 college students responded to the survey;307 completed the survey and met inclusion criteria. Data for barriers to academic performance are presented in Table 1. The most commonly reported barriers included trouble concentrating (n=243, 79.2%), responsibilities at home (57.6%), and mental health issues (n=142, 46.3%) (Table 1). Of note, 8.5% (n=26) of students reported having limited access to a computer or device to use for remote learning and 6.8% (n=21) of students reported having difficulty accessing food. Only 14 students (4.6%) reported experiencing no barriers to academic performance in a distance learning environment (Table 1). Hispanic students experienced more responsibilities at home, including taking care of siblings and doing chores, than non-Hispanic students after returning home for remote learning (X 2 = 4.16, p=0.04) (Table 2). Conclusion: The prevalence of students reporting mental health issues, limited access to technology, and food insecurity posed a barrier to distance learning is concerning. Future studies should investigate how sociodemographic disparities in barriers to distance learning may have played a role in the academic performance of students during the pandemic.","Milanaik, R.; Athanasian, C.; Lazarevic, B.; Kriegel, E.; Rapoport, E.

"GRIEF AND LOSS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: EXPLORING PERCEIVED PHYSICAL HEALTH AS A PREDICTOR FOR RUMINATION","Background: Ruminative thought predicts complicated grief and hinders the adjustment to loss by acting as a cognitive avoidance strategy. Not only is the process linked to psychological issues, rumination is also associated with negative health consequences, such as poor sleep quality, impaired immune functioning, and cardiovascular disease. Understanding how bereaved people adjust to the death of a loved one, and the associated physical and psychological health outcomes, can offer meaningful direction for interventions. Self-reported physical health has been shown to be indicative of documented physical health. Very few studies have investigated the potential relationship between self-reported physical health and rumination, especially in the bereaved population. Methods: Arizonans who experienced the death of a partner, child, sibling, parent, grandparent, other family member, non-biological family, or close friend in the past year were recruited for a semi- structured phone interview, during which they reported their grief severity, depressive symptoms, grief-specific rumination, and perceived physical health. Results: In the present study (N = 51), we tested whether perceived physical health acts as a predictor for grief-specific rumination in bereaved individuals who experienced the death of a loved one during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (74.5% White, 80.4% non-Hispanic) had an average age of 51 (SD = 15.9) and were mostly female (76.5%). Linear regression analyses showed that self-reported physical health predicted grief rumination outcomes (F = 4.0, p = 0.005). Notably, self-reported physical health also predicted grief severity (F = 4.0, p &lt; 0.005) and depression (F = 5.2, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: These results are consistent with previous findings that engagement in ruminative thought is associated with poorer health. Using self-report measures to assess physical health may offer accessible insights related to psychological health outcomes-especially in a time of social distancing.","Merritt, L.; Friedman, S.; West, M.; O'Connor, M.

"Echocardiographic Findings in Adolescents Presenting for Sports Clearance Following COVID-19","Background: Multiple studies have investigated cardiovascular effects associated with COVID-19 in collegiate and professional athletes. The incidence of cardiovascular abnormalities in adolescents seeking a return to sports following COVID-19 is not well known. We performed a comprehensive analysis of clinical and subclinical function in a cohort of post-COVID individuals seeking clearance for sports participation. We hypothesized that adolescent athletes after COVID-19 would have subclinical functional abnormalities. Methods: We reviewed outpatient transthoracic echocardiograms obtained between 11/01/2020 and 12/31/2020 for clearance for return to activity/sports of patients aged 12-18 with a history of mild or moderate COVID infection (COVID group). Adolescents from the pre-COVID era with complaints of chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, or syncope served as controls (pre-COVID group). Conventional echocardiographic metrics were ed from clinical reports;two investigators retrospectively used speckle tracking echocardiography to obtain left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LV GLS), LV global circumferential strain (GCS), right ventricular global longitudinal strain (RV GLS), and RV free wall strain (FWS). Upper limit of normal for GLS was -18%. Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to evaluate differences between the groups, and Spearman's rho was used to evaluate correlations. Multivariable linear regression following multiple imputation of minimal missing data was performed to evaluate associations. Results: Thirty-eight COVID and 36 pre-COVID subjects were enrolled. There was no significant difference in the groups' age and gender distributions (Table 1). Median time since COVID diagnosis in that cohort was 33.5 days (IQR 22 - 64). Symptoms were reported in 68.4% of that group with a borderline or abnormal ECG in 23.7%;1 patient had depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and associated abnormal strain, and 8 had abnormal LV GLS despite normal LVEF based on our cut-off of -18%. The COVID group had decreased LV GLS, LV GCS, RV FWS, and RV GLS in comparison to the pre-COVID group (Table 1, Figure 1). Within the COVID cohort, controlling for age and gender, neither abnormal ECG nor presence of symptoms was associated with abnormal LV GLS or GCS. Time since COVID diagnosis was not associated with conventional echocardiographic or strain metrics. The COVID group continued to have worse LV GCS and RV GLS after controlling for age and gender;LV GLS and RV FWS no longer correlated with COVID status in multivariable analysis. Conclusion: In adolescents with prior mild or moderate COVID illness, ventricular function by conventional metrics is not categorically different from those without a COVID history. However, differences in myocardial strain suggest subclinical dysfunction. Future studies should elucidate whether these myocardial strain abnormalities persist and whether they are predictive of adverse outcomes in these patients.","McEachern, W. A.; Coburn, G.

"GROUP-BASED TRAJECTORIES AND PREDICTORS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS DURING COVID-19: A LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF OLDER ADULTS IN QUEBEC","In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments around the world imposed confinement and physical distancing directives for all citizens. Although essential to reduce the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, these measures may have collateral consequences for older adults, such as increased psychological distress. Research suggests, as a population, older adults have been experiencing less psychological distress than younger adults during COVID-19. However, most of these studies examine mean levels of psychological distress and do not capture the heterogeneity of outcomes, like subgroups who may experience increased psychological distress. The goal of this longitudinal study was to use group-based trajectory modelling (GBTM) to identify meaningful subgroups that follow different trajectories of psychological distress among 645 older adults with a mean age of 78.69 (SD = 5.67). Participants were recruited from two research cohorts and newspaper ads. Telephone-based assessments were conducted across four time periods: T1-Spring 2020-first confinement, T2-Summer 2020-first deconfinement, T3-Fall 2020-second confinement, and T4-Winter/Spring 2021-continued confinement. Participants completed the Kessler 6-item Psychological Distress Scale (K6) to assess psychological distress at each time point and provided information on socioeconomic, medical, and psychosocial factors. Results indicated that the average psychological distress level was stable across the first three time points but slightly increased at the fourth assessment (Fig. 1). Using GBTM, three groups emerged to best characterize the different trajectories of psychological distress: resilient (50.5%), fluctuating (34.9%), and elevated (14.6%) distress groups (Fig. 1). Those in the fluctuating and elevated groups were more likely to have chronic mental health problems, mobility issues, insomnia symptoms, loneliness, COVID-19 related acute stress and general health anxiety than those in the resilient group. Those who lived in poverty, who could not use technology, and who took psychotropic medication had uniquely increased odds of being in the elevated group. These findings identify subgroups of older adults at greater risk of psychological distress with potential intervention targets to alleviate distress during and after the pandemic.","Matovic, S.; Jauvin, F.; Gravel, C.; Grenier, S.; Vasiliadis, H.

"Detrimental Intrauterine Stress Exposure and Post-natal Outcomes in Prenatally Diagnosed Congenital Heart Disease","Background: Prenatal diagnosis of congenital heart disease (CHD) is a stressful event that leads to anxiety, depression and traumatic stress in expectant parents. Cortisol is elevated in times of stress, and when present in mothers, crosses the placenta and leads to suppression of the fetus' own production of cortisol. When those neonates go on to require stressful procedures in the first months of life, some are unable to effectively mount a cortisol mediated stress response which can lead to poor outcomes and even death. We sought to investigate the relationship between maternal stress during pregnancy, and neonatal outcomes. Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of pregnancies complicated by a fetal diagnosis of critical CHD (including transposition of the great arteries, tetralogy of Fallot, total anomalous pulmonary venous return, and coarctation) who were born between 5/1/2019 and 5/1/2021. Maternal data included demographics and medical comorbidities. Composite maternal prenatal stress score (PSS) was calculated based upon 1) prenatal mental health diagnoses, 2) housing/food insecurity 3) income insecurity, 4) social support/child care, 5) legal involvement, 6) transportation issues and 7) other stressors. Categories ranged from 0 (no concerns) to 3 (significant concerns). Infant charts were reviewed for postnatal, and post-operative outcomes including infection, inotropic support, and exogenous steroid treatment. Results: 41 maternal-fetal dyads met inclusion criteria. Demographic and catheter based intervention at a median of 8 (2-54) days of life. 13 patients had single ventricle anatomy (8 initial surgical palliation, 5 catheterization). Mothers with higher composite PSS were more likely to have infants that required steroids after CHD surgery compared to mothers with lower scores (p=.01) (figure 1). Surgical patients needing bypass were more likely to require post-operative steroids than those not requiring bypass (18/22 vs 0/4, p&lt;.005). None of the catheter-based interventions (including those with high risk single ventricle anatomy) required steroids (p &lt;.0001). Maternal individual stress sub-categories, severity of prenatal CHD diagnosis, and counseling during the COVID-19 era did not correlate with steroid treatment. Finally, PSS did not correlate with individual outcomes such as birthweight, inotropic support, infection or hypoglycemia. Conclusion: Maternal prenatal stress is multifactorial and higher composite maternal prenatal stress scores are correlated with post-bypass steroid requirements, suggesting that a stressful intrauterine environment can be associated with worse postoperative outcomes for the neonate.","Madriago, E.

"THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND MENTAL HEALTH: EFFECTS OF SOCIAL SUPPORT AND SELF-REGULATION","Social support has been widely associated with various morbidity and mortality. How does social support availability help youths cope with the global pandemic of Covid-19 and maintain their mental well-being? Utilizing data from a UK national birth cohort, namely the Millennium Cohort Study, this research investigated the joint role of social support availability and self-regulation against such major life stressors, inclusding G Ã— E mechanisms. Results from 4095 cohort members (399 males (47.20%) and 2602 females (63.54%), others refused to report) suggested that social support availability at the outburst of Covid-19 pandemic, as well as age 7 emotional self-regulation (rated by cohort members' parents) contributes to youths' better mental health (viz., mental well-being and non-specific psychological distress) shortly after the outburst of Covid-19 (;B;s &gt; 0.072, ps &lt; .018). Most importantly, age 7 cognitive self-regulation and social support availability jointly predicted better their well-being 4 months later after the local outbursts of pandemic (for mental well-being, B = 0.309, p = .017, 95% CI = [0.056, 0.562];and for non-specific psychological distress, B =-0.299, p = .043, 95% CI = [-0.587,-0.011]). Johnson-Neyman plots (false discovery rate limited) suggested that it was those high but not low in cognitive self-regulation that benefited more from the perceived social support availability. Within the ranges of significance (81.19% for mental well-being and 80.94% for non-specific psychological well-being), social support availability positively predicted mental health and such effect increased gradually as the increase of age 7 cognitive self-regulation. Findings filled in the research gap such that social support and self-regulation have been investigated separately as two coping mechanisms, by revealing that self-regulation (i.e., internal resources) determines the utility of social support availability (i.e., external resources). Findings here inspired new research questions for the field, such as whether relevant developmental trajectories of self-regulation and social support might intertwin to cast on health trajectories, and whether these processes are subject to potential G Ã— E interactions such as the exposure to childhood adversity or relevant genetic risks. Models to examine these hypotheses will be discussed.","Li, S.; Chan, M.; Lau, C.","https://www.google.com/search?q=THE+COVID-19+PANDEMIC+AND+MENTAL+HEALTH:+EFFECTS+OF+SOCIAL+SUPPORT+AND+SELF-REGULATION","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychosomatic Medicine; 84(5):A52, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-09","",37291,""
"EFFECTS OF REPEATED SARS-COV-2 SEROLOGY TESTING ON HEALTHCARE WORKER ANXIETY","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a considerable effect on mental health, healthcare workers (HCWs), and the healthcare infrastructure. Few simple interventions have been identified to reduce this impact, but access to SARS-CoV-2 testing has been identified as a potential source of anxiety. Methods: This longitudinal study was conducted April 2020-July 2020 at a quaternary care children's hospital. Participants included pediatric HCWs with direct patient contact or proximity to patient-care areas. Participants received rapid SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing at routine intervals and were asked to rate their ?level of anxiety about the COVID-19 pandemic at this moment? on a visual analog scale of 0 to 100. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the study population, repeated measure ANOVAs were used to examine change in anxiety across time, and Chi squared analyses/logistic regressions were used to examine effects of demographics on change in anxiety. Results: 362 individuals participated in this study. Reported baseline COVID-19 anxiety was negatively associated with years of experience (r =-0.12, p=.030), females reported higher anxiety than males (Z=-3.66 p&lt;.001), and nurses reported higher anxiety compared to physicians, physician assistants, and technicians (F (3,302)=6.04, p =.003). Results indicated a significant positive result by test number interaction (F (5,1020)=3.75, p=.002) in which reported anxiety in those testing positive (n=55) and those testing negative initially decreased, until test 3, after which reported anxiety in those with positive results increased whereas those in the negative group stabilized. Demographic and occupational factors, including gender, age, race, years of experience, job position, and department, did not affect the likelihood of reported anxiety scores decreasing. Conclusion: This study suggests that repeat SARS-CoV-2 antibody serology testing may be associated with decreasing anxiety levels. If validated by further research, routine screening for disease could potentially be used as a simple but powerful tool to reduce the mental health burden of the current, and future, pandemic(s)/epidemic(s).","Li, N.

"Psychosocial Support in the Pandemic: Effects of a Preventive Depression Intervention on Maternal and Infant Outcomes","Background: Perinatal depression is a common and undertreated pregnancy complication. Beginning in January 2020, we implemented â€œReach Out, Stay Strong, Essentials for New Moms,â€ (ROSE) an empirically validated 5-session intervention recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force to prevent perinatal depression (PPD). Methods: Our integrated evaluation framework helped us to understand the virtual program delivery adapted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This included semi-structured provider interviews and surveys, patient questionnaires, and a COVID-19 stressor screen. Two controls matched on maternal age, race, delivery date, zip-code, and infant gender were selected per ROSE participant on a quarterly basis, and maternal and infant outcomes were assessed at nine months post-delivery. Results: To date, 68 highrisk pregnant women have been referred, and 57 enrolled in the ROSE program (84% retention, Figure 1). Eight ROSE infants and 16 controls have reached nine months of age and were eligible for review. ROSE participants and controls had similar rates of attendance at a six-week PPD follow-up visit. Participants and controls also attended on average a similar number of well-child visits, had similar rates of screening for PPD at attended visits, and had similar cumulative incidence of positive screens for PPD. ROSE participants and controls had similar rates of initiating breastfeeding. Of those who initiated breastfeeding, ROSE participants had, on average, a longer duration of breastfeeding. Rate of completion of infant vaccination schedules was similar between ROSES participants and controls, with a trend toward reduced vaccination refusal in the ROSE group. Provider stakeholders surveyed feel that the ROSE program is addressing a gap in care by flexibly providing additional mental health services, improving continuity of care through a dedicated program coordinator, and increasing partner engagement. Participants sought out an additional 103 contacts beyond those required by the five sessions of the program. Conclusion: Analysis of preliminary data shows trends toward increased duration of breastfeeding and decreased vaccine hesitancy in the ROSE study population. The majority of records reviewed to date are from initial enrollment, which began in a clinic for pregnant mothers with substance use disorder. Stakeholders feel that ROSE is addressing key care needs, particularly in this clinic population, and participants continue to seek engagement with the program outside of required sessions. Our data suggests that ROSE supports high-risk mothers in caring for themselves and their infants after birth.

"THE IMPACTS OF LONELINESS AND SOCIAL SUPPORT ON THE PHYSICAL HEALTH AND COPING STYLES OF COLLEGE STUDENTS DURING COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic and preventive measures such as social distancing and campus closures have brought unprecedented social isolation to college students. Past studies have suggested that being socially isolated may not only have harmful effects on one's mental health but also result in a variety of physical health problems, such as a weakened cardiovascular system. On the other hand, higher perceived social support can lead to more positive health outcomes as it is associated with lower mortality risk and greater use of active coping strategies. The purpose of the present study was to investigate how loneliness and perceived social support are associated with the physical symptoms and coping styles of college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study investigated two types of coping strategies: active coping and self-distraction. The variables were measured through an online survey administered across five different time points in 2020 with students (n = 292) enrolled in a university located in Southern California. Linear regression analyses were conducted to predict the students' physical symptoms and coping styles using their levels of loneliness and perceived social support. The analyses used the first wave of data (from May 2020) to predict the second and fifth waves of the survey, which took place in July and December of 2020, in order to examine how baseline levels at the start of the pandemic predicted changes in the beginning of the study compared to at the end of the year. Students who reported higher levels of loneliness in May experienced more physical symptoms in July, b = 2.89, p &lt; .001. However, social support did not significantly predict physical symptoms (p &gt; .05), and neither loneliness nor social support significantly predicted the students' coping styles (ps &gt; .05). When using data from May to predict outcomes in December, there were no significant associations. This study may help improve the physical and psychological well-being of college students during the global health crisis.","Lee, H.

"DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ASSAULT DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: A COMMUNITY STUDY","The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have been far-reaching, disproportionately impacting vulnerable populations. Of particular concern is the impact on individuals experiencing domestic violence (DV), an urgent public health issue. Reports have indicated that certain regions have experienced surges in DV, and it has been speculated that prolonged periods of state-mandated isolation are the source of these surges. The current study utilized publicly available records to examine fluctuations in DV coinciding with COVID-19 lockdown restrictions in a diverse metropolitan county. Data from two major agencies in Orange County, CA (i.e., Anaheim, Santa Ana) specifying police-reported DV assault were extracted from a web-based crime mapping engine. A total of 7,488 assault incidents were extracted from January 1st, 2020 through March 31st, 2021. All incidents were coded for time in weeks to examine the time course of DV among other types of assault, allowing for a longitudinal view of incidents over a 60-week window. Prior to any major lockdown, about 45% and 85% of assaults reported to police were DV-related in Anaheim and Santa Ana, respectively. A changepoint analysis determined whether and when DV assaults changed when mapped with coinciding tightening or loosening of restrictions county-wide. Results indicated that in Anaheim, there was no meaningful change in DV assault rates at any time interval. In Santa Ana, however, rates spiked in the week following the first major lockdown in March 2020, remaining stable at this higher level thereafter. To evaluate this spike in DV assault, a piecewise regression analysis indicated DV assault incidents in Santa Ana increased 7% in the week following the initial lockdown week (b = .07, SE = .03, t = 2.45, p = .01). The slope of the lines before and after the first week of lockdown were not significantly different, confirming that levels of DV assaults remained relatively stable after the initial spike in DV (b =-.0004, SE = .003, t =-1.77, p = .08). Results suggest that reported surges in DV vary between communities, and that systemic issues may set the stage for the surge of an already endemic problem. In under-resourced communities, simultaneous traumas compound risk for both immediate harm and long-term physical and mental health problems.","Kofman, Y. B.; Weiss, C. C.; Yim, I.

"Posttraumatic Stress Among Pediatric Critical Care Physicians in the United States in Association with Corona virus Disease 2019 Patient Care Experiences","Background: Pediatric critical care physicians have played an active role in the care of critically ill patients including adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our objective was to assess the prevalence of posttraumatic stress (PTS) and its association with COVID-19 patient care experiences among pediatric critical care physicians during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods: The study is a cross-sectional study of pediatric critical care physicians working in the US. The study was conducted from August 26, 2020 to October 26, 2020 using a web-based online survey platform (Qualtrics, Provo, Utah). Results: We measured PTS which included posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and subthreshold posttraumatic stress disorder (SubPTSD) using validated PTSD Checklist- 5 survey tool. Association of PTS with COVID-19 patient care experiences was analyzed using regression analysis. Prevalence of PTS was noted in 120 among 294 pediatric critical care physicians (41%;95% CI, 35-47%) with predominance of hyperarousal symptoms and feelings of negative cognition and mood. Among our physicians with PTS, 19% had PTSD and 81% had SubPTSD. Female physicians and those with children had statistically significant increase in posttraumatic stress (p&lt;0.05). Posttraumatic stress was significantly associated with physicians testing positive or taking time off for COVID-19 illness, self-isolation, fear of infecting their loved ones, families scared of being infected, feeling helpless, patients expressing fears of dying, having preexisting depression, anxiety or insomnia, working beyond comfort level of training and having thoughts of quitting (p&lt;0.05). Thoughts of quitting was associated with the highest significant increase in PTS scores (coefficient:11.643;95% CI:8.551,14.735;P&lt;0.01) followed by feeling of helplessness (coefficient:11.055;95% CI: 8.484,13.624;P&lt;0.01) and need for additional medications for depression, anxiety and insomnia (coefficient: 10.980;95% CI: 4.970, 16.990;P&lt;0.01). Conclusion: Posttraumatic stress is high in pediatric critical care physicians especially in female physicians and those with children and is associated with various COVID-19 patient care experiences. Thoughts of quitting was associated with highest increase in posttraumatic stress score and this could have major implications for the workforce in the future. Subthreshold posttraumatic stress disorder should be identified and mental health issues of pediatric critical care physicians addressed.","Kalyanaraman, M.; Sankar, A.; Timpo, E.; McQueen, D.; Morparia, K.; Bergel, M.; Rosenblatt, J.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Posttraumatic+Stress+Among+Pediatric+Critical+Care+Physicians+in+the+United+States+in+Association+with+Corona+virus+Disease+2019+Patient+Care+Experiences","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Pediatrics; 149, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-09","",37296,""
"MENTAL HEALTH BEFORE AND DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND THE ROLE OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY: RESULTS FROM THE 4HAIE STUDY IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC","It has become a research priority to examine mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in different populations and countries. We evaluated weekly/monthly within-individual changes in the prevalence of depression, stress and feelings of happiness before (up to one-year prior) and during 17 months (30/3/2020 to 4/07/2021) after lockdown was first announced. Futhermore we assessed how the changes differ by age, sex, physical activity status and other health behaviors. We analyzed data from 1153 adults (aged 18 to 65 years) from the Czech Republic involved in a prospective-cohort study Healthy Aging in Industrial Environment?Programme 4. Mixed linear models were fitted. Prevalence of depression 3 weeks after the lockdown in March 2020 increased from 5% to 19% (p=0.044) and then declined over the following 6 weeks to 5,5% (p=0.045). Depression levels increased again to 10% (p=0.009) when a new lockdown was introduced in October 2020, but by the end of May 2021 they had returned to near baseline. Young adults 18-34 years reported the highest levels of depression after both lockdowns (21% and 13%). Being habitually physically active, older and male were protective factors. Similar but opposite trend was observed for frequency of feeling happy with older adults 55-67 years being the happiest. The age inequality in experiences were reduced as lockdown continued. The most prevalent stressors were worries about catching COVID-19 (10%), finances (9%) and marriage/partnership (15%). These data indicate that when countries faceing potential future lockdowns, the highest levels of depression should be expected in the early stages of lockdown. These data also suggest the importance of supporting young adults and encouraging political strategies to promote physical activity during lockdowns.","Jandackova, V.

"SOCIAL SUPPORT MITIGATES THE EFFECT OF STRESS ON SEXUAL AND GENDER MINORITY PEOPLE'S MENTAL HEALTH DURING COVID-19","Sexual and gender minority (SGM) people face pre-existing inequalities that may have been exacerbated by the Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. Canadian sexual minorities are twice as likely to live alone compared to heterosexual people and are more vulnerable to anxiety, depression, self-harm, and substance abuse. Despite these vulnerabilities, several studies suggest that social support and community solidarity can mitigate the effect of stress on SGM mental health. Using a cross-sectional online survey, our team examined SGM and cisgender heterosexual mental health and social support during the first four months of the COVID-19 crisis in Quebec, Canada. A total of 2900 adults (n = 304 SGM people, n = 2596 cisgender heterosexual people) completed questionnaires measuring perceived social support, perceived stress, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and loneliness. A series of one-way ANOVAs revealed that SGM people presented worse health outcomes than cisgender heterosexual people on all questionnaires (p &lt; .001). Post hoc analyses also showed that some particularly marginalised SGM sub-groups, including bisexual and asexual people, showed the worst health outcomes. Moderation analyses later revealed that social support moderated the relationship between perceived stress and depressive symptoms among both SGM and cisgender heterosexual people - but this effect was four times stronger among SGM people (<U+0394>R2 = .041;p &lt; .001) than among cisgender heterosexual people (<U+0394>R2 = .010;p &lt; .001). These results suggest fostering social connectedness among SGM people may be especially beneficial in buffering against distress in the face of a crisis. To better understand how SGM mental health is evolving during this pandemic, our team is currently conducting a follow-up longitudinal study examining mental health, trauma, coping strategies and resilience among SGM and cisgender heterosexual adults before and after vaccination efforts started in Canada (to date, N = 6083). Preliminary results from time 1 (July 2020) and 2 (Fall 2021) are being treated and will also be presented.","Jacmin-Park, S.; Rossi, M.; Villeneuve, S.; Lupien, S. J.; Juster, R.

"MENTAL HEALTH, FINANCIAL HARDSHIP, AND SOCIAL CONNECTIONS AMONG OLDER ADULTS WITH PROBABLE COVID-19 INFECTION: A LONGITUDINAL COHORT STUDY","Background: Despite a large body of research documenting the adverse psychosocial consequences of infectious diseases, little is currently known regarding the impact that contracting COVID-19 may have on the individual's mental health, personal finances, and social relationships. We investigated the immediate and longer-term impact (over 4-6 months) of probable COVID-19 infection on mental health (depression and anxiety), wellbeing (quality of life and loneliness), financial hardship, and social interactions among older people living in England. Methods: Data were analysed from 5,146 older adults participating in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing who provided data before the pandemic (2018-19) and at two COVID-19 assessments in 2020 (June-July and November-December). The associations of probable COVID-19 infection at the first COVID-19 assessment with depression, anxiety, poor quality of life (QoL), loneliness, financial hardship, and amount of real-time/written social contact with family and friends at the first and second COVID-19 assessments were tested using linear/logistic regression and were adjusted for pre-pandemic outcome measures and other confounding factors. Results: Participants with probable COVID-19 infection had higher levels of depression and anxiety, poorer QoL, and greater loneliness scores compared with those without probable infection at both the first (ORdepression=1.62[95%CI:1.16,2.26];ORanxiety=1.59[95%CI:1.00,2.51];bpoorQoL=1.34[95%CI:0.66,2.02];bloneliness=0.49[95%CI:0.25,0.74]) and second (ORdepression=1.56[95%CI:1.17,2.09];ORanxiety=1.55[95%CI:1.02,2.37];bpoorQoL=1.38[95%CI:0.74,2.03];bloneliness=0.31[95%CI:0.04;0.58]) assessments. Participants with probable infection also experienced greater financial difficulties than those without infection at the first assessment (OR=1.50[95%CI:1.10,2.05]). In contrast, the levels of social contact were similar in participants with and without probable infection. Similar results were observed when propensity score weighting was used to account for confounding. Conclusion: Probable COVID-19 infection is associated with longer-term deterioration of mental health and wellbeing and short-term increases in financial hardship among older adults.The mental health and wellbeing of older people affected by COVID-19 should be monitored both in the acute and recovery phases of the disease.","Iob, E.; Zaninotto, P.; Steptoe, A.","https://www.google.com/search?q=MENTAL+HEALTH,+FINANCIAL+HARDSHIP,+AND+SOCIAL+CONNECTIONS+AMONG+OLDER+ADULTS+WITH+PROBABLE+COVID-19+INFECTION:+A+LONGITUDINAL+COHORT+STUDY","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychosomatic Medicine; 84(5):A21, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-09","",37299,""
"Postpartum Mental Health and Infant Development During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: Infection mitigation strategies implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic influenced social experiences for new mothers and their infants, with potential to negatively impact infant development. Early reports during the pandemic show postpartum women have increased rates of anxiety and depression which are known risk factors for developmental delay. Additionally, stay-at-home orders, social distancing, and use of face masks may alter visual input (facial expressions and oral motor movements) infants receive with the potential to negatively impact social-emotional and communication development. Thus, there is need to examine the developmental trajectory of infants born during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesized that higher COVID impact and maternal symptoms of anxiety and depression would be linked to greater risk for developmental delay. Methods: We recruited 125 first-time mothers of infants less than 3 months of age from four pediatric primary care offices in Pennsylvania and Delaware (June 2020 - February 2021). Mothers completed a self-report interview when their infants were less than 3 months of age (baseline) and again at 6 months of age (follow-up), asking about COVID-19 family impact, anxiety and depression symptoms (EPDS Total, Anxiety, Depression), infant development (ASQ-3 at 3 months and 6 months and ASQ-SE at 6 months), and items inquiring about the frequency of mother-child caretaking activities across a range of behaviors. Results: Bivariate correlations found that while perceived family impact from COVID-19 was related to maternal self-report of postpartum depression symptoms at baseline (r = .32, p = .001), it was not related to the frequency of mother-child caretaking activities or infant development in the first 6 months of life. However, hierarchical linear regression found when controlling for COVID-19 family impact, baseline postpartum depression symptoms were related to fewer concurrent motherchild caretaking activities (ÃŸ =.24, p = .007) and predicted poorer infant social-emotional development at 6 months of age (ÃŸ = .23, p = .013). Conclusion: Consistent with prior literature, maternal postpartum depression symptoms were related to fewer concurrent mother-child caretaking activities and poorer infant social-emotional development at 6 months of age. However, despite anecdotal maternal concern, there was not a relationship between the effect of COVID-19 on the family unit and infant development. It is possible that COVID-19 pandemic effects will play a more prominent role as infants' complex language and social skills emerge. However, the current findings do not support a direct effect of pandemic family impact on infant development during the first six months of life, instead underscoring the importance of maternal wellbeing and functioning for infant social-emotional development.","Harrison, M.; Rohde, J.; Hatchimonji, D.; Berman, T.; Flatley, C.

"PSYCHOSOMATIC INTERVENTIONS FOR FUNCTIONAL POST-COVID SYNDROMES: OPEN-LABEL PLACEBO AND PACED BREATHING AS PATIENT-TAILORED INTERVENTIONS","Background: Up to 80% of patients suffering from persistent symptoms more than six months after a COVID-19 infection complain about a variety of psychosomatic symptoms with no organ cause. Most patients suffer from chronic fatigue, pain, depression or difficulty concentrating. Experimental studies showed that these symptoms could be significantly improved after an open administration of placebos (â€œopen-label placeboâ€) or with heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback such as paced breathing. However, we insufficiently understand which patients benefit from which treatment. Methods: Patients (m/f) without organic causes for the complaints are randomised to three groups: an open-label placebo intervention (OLP), a paced breathing training (PBT) or no additional treatment (TAU). To detect a mean effect using a 2x3 ANOVA, N=90 patients will be included, and predictor analyses are performed. The OLP group takes 2 placebos/day and receives the information that placebos can significantly improve symptoms, e.g. via the activation of â€œself-healing powersâ€. The PBT group receives a standardized training to breath at 6 breaths/min for 10 min/day. At inclusion (T0) and after four (T1) and eight weeks (T2), treatment expectations, fatigue (FSMC), somatoform complaints, depressiveness, anxiety (PHQ), general health (SF-36) and quality of life, as well as cognitive performance using Corsi Span and Colour Stroop tests, will be assessed by questionnaires and tests, and an ECG will be recorded. Results: Preliminary results point to effective reductions of fatigue and other symptoms for both interventions compared to TAU, dependent on patients' individual factors such as treatment expectations, symptom severity during Covid-19 infection and at inclusion. HRV data will be analysed at the end of the study. Preliminary results will be presented at the conference. Conclusion: Patients with functional post-COVID syndromes can benefit from psychosomatic interventions aiming to improve treatment expectations and heart rate variability, depending on individual patients' factors. Patient-tailored interventions should be further investigated.","Hamberger, J.; Hinterberger, T.; Loew, T.; Meissner, K.; Beschoner, P.; Roder, E.; Jarczok, M.

"Perceptions of Anxiety and Depression Among Pediatric Frontline Health care Providers During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: Our frontline nurses and physicians seemed to have increased anxiety at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and increased depression as the year progressed. Perceptions of anxiety and depression coincided with concern for one's own health, limited knowledge of how to care for patients during a pandemic, limited personal protective equipment (PPE), and/or financial constraints. To date, there are no studies looking at pediatric frontline healthcare providers and their rates of anxiety and depression over the course of a pandemic. Furthermore, nurses and physicians have distinct roles in the emergency setting that affect their perceptions of anxiety and depression. Currently, there are limited studies comparing nurse and physician anxiety and depression rates during a pandemic. The purpose of this study was to determine if there was a difference in perceptions of anxiety and depression among our Pediatric Emergency and Urgent Care frontline providers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This was a prospective cross-sectional study at a large quaternary level 1 trauma center including 3 emergency departments and 7 urgent care sites. We used the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), both standardized validated screening tools for identifying anxiety and depressive disorders, respectively. The GAD-7 scores range from 0-21 points, with 0-4 considered minimal anxiety, 5-9 mild anxiety, 10-14 moderate anxiety, and 15-21 severe anxiety. PHQ-2 scores range from 0-6 points with 3-6 considered likely major depressive disorder. We surveyed healthcare providers including physicians and nurses twice with the GAD-7, once at the beginning of the pandemic in Spring 2020 and again after vaccine implementation in Spring 2021. We surveyed healthcare providers once after vaccine implementation with the PHQ-2. Results: 396 surveys were distributed in Spring 2020 and 466 surveys were distributed in Spring 2021, with one-third physician and two-thirds nurse response each time. Table 1 shows the average GAD-7 and PHQ2 scores for healthcare providers by role. The average GAD-7 score decreased for both nurses and physicians from the beginning of the pandemic to after vaccine implementation. Nurses on average had higher anxiety scores with mild score range compared to minimal score range for physicians. Nurses on average had higher depression scores compared to physicians but both roles had scores in the low likelihood range. Conclusion: Many healthcare providers perceived higher anxiety and depression levels during the pandemic. The anxiety levels appeared to decrease after vaccine implementation although hospital-wide pandemic relief efforts may have played a role in improved perceptions. Even though nurses had higher anxiety scores, the difference in the score is unlikely to be clinically significant. Our data supports rigorous mental health infrastructure during pandemic preparedness to support the sudden feelings of anxiety and depression in frontline healthcare providers.","Gupta, N.

"Prevalence of Fatigue in Post Covid 19","Background: Following covid 19, most patients have variety of neurological symtoms (headache, dizziness, tinnitus, paraesthesia, sleep disorders, loss of taste and smell, mental fog, concentration issues, anxiety, depression) persisting even after resolution of fever, cough. Fatigue is the most frequently described and globally recognized as a disabling symptom following covid. Fatigue reflects subjective state, decreased capacity to perform, decrement in vigilance. General psychophysiological phenomenon in which motivational decrement, diminished ability to perform tasks with alertness, vigilance is reduced. Several weeks after COVID 19, some patients are still dealing with lung complications and crushing fatigue. The long-term consequences of covid 19 are being studied. The aim of the study is to understand persisting fatigue, investigate associated risk factors, disease severity. Materials and methods: COVID 19 post-acute outpatient clinic. Outpatients who met WHO criteria for discontinuation of quarantine i.e., no fever for 3 consecutive days, improvement in other symptoms, RT PCR negative. Results: 19 of 53 patients reported of chronic fatigue syndrome. No association between severity of illness, inflammatory markers and fatigue. Persistent fatigue following SARS-CoV-2 is common and independent of severity of initial infection. Conclusion: Fatigue persists after COVID 19.

"PANDEMIC GRIEF STUDY (PANGS): ACUTE GRIEF OF BEREAVED RELATIVES FOLLOWING DEATHS DURING COVID-19","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the death of over 700,000 Americans, with each death leaving 9 surviving Americans (i.e., over 6 million bereaved). One harsh reality of the pandemic has been that survivors have often not been able to care for their dying loved ones, and grieve for them in traditional ways (e.g., wakes, funerals), due to social distancing. The present study used semi-structured clinical interviews to investigate acute grief during the pandemic. Methods: Participants were interviewed by phone, including the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale, a 20-item measure of depression;the Prolonged Grief Disorder scale, a 13-item measure of prolonged grief disorder;the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), a 5-item measure assessing for adjustment after major life events;the Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG) scale, a 10-item measure of growth following a traumatic event such as the death of a loved one;the Utrecht Grief Rumination Scale (UGRS), a 15-item scale measuring various aspects of grief-related rumination;the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (ISEL), a 12-item measure assessing for social support following a major life event. Results: Participants (N = 51, 74.5% White, 80.4% non-Hispanic) had an average age of 51 (SD = 15.9) and were mostly female (76.5%). 53.0% said they were unable to provide support for their dying loved one, 45.1% said they were not able to say good-bye, 47.1% said they were not prepared, 45.1% said they should have been present for the death. The sample experienced sub-clinical depressive symptoms (M = 10.04, SD = 7.03), and moderate prolonged grief symptoms (M = 23.0, SD = 9.15). Participants had a mean of 7.61 (SD = 10.02) on the WSAS, 23.24 (SD = 13.50) on the PTG, 17.31 (SD = 14.50) on the UGRS, and 30.25 (SD = 4.63) on the ISEL. Conclusion: Despite feeling unprepared for the death of their loved ones during the pandemic, depression and grief scores suggest that many individuals are resilient, given their moderate prolonged grief and sub-clinical depression scores on average. The scores for the WSAS suggest that people are adjusting to work and social life following the death of their loved ones. Clinical intervention should focus on the small proportion who are not adjusting during pandemic bereavement.","Friedman, S. E.; Merritt, L.; West, M.; O'Connor, M.

"Analysis of Telemedicine Comprehensive Health Assessments for Children in Foster Care Performed During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: Study of telemedicine programs deployed during the COVD-19 emergency will inform optimal and equitable use post-pandemic. Given unique health care needs and barriers experienced by children in foster care, studies of telemedicine dedicated to this population are needed. Our objectives were to describe outcomes of a telemedicine program serving children in foster care during the pandemic and to compare outcomes between telemedicine and in-person comprehensive health assessments (CHA). Methods: An evaluation model clinic for children in foster care conducted CHA via telemedicine when inperson visits were restricted during the pandemic. Our institution conducts telemedicine through our patient portal app. Consent is required during the telemedicine login process, and advocacy efforts led to our county's commissioner of child protective services consenting to telemedicine visits for children in care during the pandemic. Outcomes of telemedicine referrals were tracked in REDCap. Questions from the validated Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ) were completed by physicians who rated their ability to: hear patients, see patients and express themselves after each telemedicine visit. Prevalence of laboratory testing completion, prescriptions, and referrals (medical, behavioral, and developmental health) among children undergoing telemedicine CHA was compared to children undergoing in-person CHA at the same clinic the year prior. Descriptive statistics, Chi-squared and Fischer-exact tests were used. Results: Of 91 referrals reviewed, 83 (91%) resulted in completed telemedicine CHA, 3 never logged in to scheduled visit(s), 3 had prohibitive technology barriers, and 2 were determined to require in-person CHA. Mean age of telemedicine patients was 9.2 years (SD 5.7) (table 1). Seven patients missed 9 appointments for an attendance rate of 90% (83/92). Mean duration of visits was 66 minutes (SD 24.5). Response rate for TUQ (81 sent to attendings, 58 to fellows) was 98% and figure 1 displays results. Table 1 details medical recommendations following telemedicine CHA compared to in-person CHA. Conclusion: Telemedicine successfully enabled healthcare delivery to children in foster care while in-person visits were restricted. Over 2/3 of telemedicine patients received referrals and over 1/4 received prescriptions. High show rates suggest telemedicine was accessible to most families. Results can inform post-pandemic use of telemedicine. Low physician ratings of being able to see patients as well as if in person, as well as lower rates of referrals for vision services and lab work highlight essential in-person components of CHA. Once components of CHA such as detailed skin exam, vision screen and lab work are completed in-person, telemedicine could be used for follow-up visits. Need for specialty services was high, and in cases where access is limited by transportation barriers, in-person components of care could be completed by local providers coupled with care coordination for specialized care via telemedicine. Ongoing advocacy to overcome unique consent and potential technology barriers is needed.","Fortin, K.; Dawson, J.; Scribano, P.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Analysis+of+Telemedicine+Comprehensive+Health+Assessments+for+Children+in+Foster+Care+Performed+During+the+COVID-19+Pandemic","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Pediatrics; 149, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-09","",37305,""
"Social Determinants of Health in Children with Severe and Non-severe sars-cov-2 Infection","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has been shown to have a compounding effect on families across various social and healthcare needs. However, the impact of social determinants of health (SDOH) on COVID-19 disease severity in children is unknown. Our objectives were to describe the SDOH in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection and determine their association with severity of the infection Methods: This prospective observational study was supported by the National Institutes of Health RADx program and conducted in the emergency department (ED) of two large children's hospitals. Children = 18 years of age with symptoms due to SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive RT PCR test, serology or epidemiological link) were enrolled between 03/29/2021 and 05/30/2021. Data collected from electronic medical records included demographics, clinical features, treatment, disposition, and outcomes. Severe cases were defined as the following within 30 days of test positivity: diagnosis of Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children or Kawasaki disease, requirement for oxygen &gt; 2L, inotropes, mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), or death. Following informed consent, caregivers were surveyed via an electronic device on previously validated PhenX questions. Aligned with the Healthy People 2020 SDOH framework, caregivers reported on economic stability, education, social and community context, health and health care, and neighborhood and built environment. Stata was used to analyze descriptive statistics, and unadjusted comparisons between groups were assessed using two sample t-tests for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables due to small sizes. Results: A total of 107 children (mean age 6.9 (Â±5.9) years, 44.9% males), with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled, and 85 caregivers (79.4%) completed the survey (71.4% Black). In this sample, 97% of children were RT PCR positive, 3% had an epidemiological link, and 23 (27.1%) were categorized as severe. Almost half of caregivers (47.6%) reported employment or income loss due to COVID-19. The three most common SDOH needs identified were that of childcare (22.0%), housing instability (22.0%), and food insecurity (21.7%). Children with severe COVID-19 were significantly more likely to have a caregiver who was single, including never married, separated/divorced, and widowed (82.6% vs. 52.5%;Table 1). Although not statistically significant, children with severe COVID-19 tended to have higher levels of social needs including housing instability, poor caregiver mental health, and lower levels of social support compared to children with nonsevere infection (Table 2). Conclusion: Our preliminary data on SDOH suggest that among children with SARS-CoV-2 infection, housing instability, food insecurity and childcare needs are particularly prevalent. Children with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection were more likely to have single caregivers. Family structure may influence severe COVID-19 in children and programming and supports for single parent households should be considered. Larger studies in the ED setting will help confirm these findings and to direct resources to address these social needs.","Ettinger, A.

"Multiparametric CMR Findings in Mrna COVID-19 Vaccine-induced Myocardit is: A Case Series","Introduction: Within weeks of the pediatric coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination campaign beginning, reports of acute myocarditis after adolescents' second vaccination began. The present research describes the clinical and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging characteristics of three adolescents recently vaccinated with a mRNA vaccine and admitted for myopericarditis treatment. Case Description: This retrospective case-series investigated adolescents admitted within a week of their second mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. The electronic medical record was queried for all patients =12 years old, admitted for acute myocarditis or pericarditis (International Classification Diseases-Version 10;I30.xx, I40.xx respectively) since April 1, 2021. Patients were included if they had a documented mRNA vaccination in the prior seven days. Three patients met inclusion criteria. All three had acute onset chest pain within 48 hours of receiving their second mRNA vaccine. All had elevated troponins, all were eventually admitted and had mild clinical courses. All met Lake Louise criteria for acute myocarditis despite only one patient having mild depression of cardiac function on echocardiography. All patients were negative for COVID-19 and none had a clinical history or immunologic evidence of prior COVID-19. The patient with the most diffuse pattern of late gadolinium enhancement on CMR (Figure 1) developed ventricular tachycardia three weeks after discharge. Discussion: Vaccine induced myopericarditis is rare in inactivated vaccines, but is a known entity with live vaccines, especially the smallpox vaccine. Since the 1950's, cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported in association with vaccination. Research using VAERS has previously found that from 1990- 2018, 0.1% of reports were for myopericarditis associated with vaccination. The rates of mRNA vaccine-induced myocarditis are currently unknown, but our clinical findings are similar to other recently published case series of pediatric mRNA associated myopericarditis. We have observed differences in CMR patterns between our patients from this series and previous reports of patients with cardiac involvement from COVID-19 (Table 1). We remain uncertain regarding the precise pathophysiology in these patients with myocardial inflammation following mRNA vaccine administration. However, the relatively focal pattern of involvement, and the relative preservation of global function, suggest a milder involvement of the myocardium-in most of these patients-than has previously been observed in classic viral and COVID-19 myocarditis. Conclusion: Three adolescent males developed acute myocarditis within days of their second mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. CMR in combination with serum troponin measurements was critical for diagnosis, and arrythmia monitoring was critical in their follow up. Repeat CMR studies over the six months following diagnosis will be important to rule out development of post-inflammatory fibrosis and long-term arrhythmias.

"THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN FACETS OF MINDFULNESS AND COVID-19 RELATED DISTRESS","Background: Since the outbreak of COVID-19 several reports have shown that the pandemic has led to increased mental health problems and distress. Trait mindfulness could function as a protective factor against distress during this period. The current study therefore investigated the possible protective character of the five distinct facets of mindfulness in COVID-19 related distress. Methods: An online self-report study was conducted in a Dutch sample (N = 811;Mage = 49Â±17;54.5% female) in February 2021. The five subscales of dispositional mindfulness were assessed with the 24-item Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, and the 36-item COVID Stress Scale (CSS) was used to assess COVID-19 related distress. To examine the relationship between the trait mindfulness facets and COVID-19 related distress, multivariate regression analyses were performed. Findings: In the analysis predicting the CSS score, 11.2% of the variance was explained, and the total model was significant (F (10, 789) = 9.96, p &lt; .001). The mindfulness facets describing (ÃŸ =-.12, p = .002), acting with awareness (ÃŸ =-.08, p = .040), and non-judging (ÃŸ =-.12, p = .003), were (negatively) related to distress about COVID-19. The facets observing and non-reacting were unrelated to COVID-19 distress. Discussion: The results may indicate that individuals high in the mindfulness traits describing, acting with awareness, and non-judging, experience less distress during the pandemic. Given that mindfulness can be enhanced with practice, teaching these skills using e-Health interventions could potentially lead to increased resilience to the psychosocial effects of stressful global situations like pandemics.","Duijndam, S.; Boekhorst, M.","https://www.google.com/search?q=THE+ASSOCIATION+BETWEEN+FACETS+OF+MINDFULNESS+AND+COVID-19+RELATED+DISTRESS","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychosomatic Medicine; 84(5):A49, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-09","",37308,""
"PUBLIC VIEWS DURING THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC: A UK BASED MIXED METHOD STUDY","Introduction: The coronavirus pandemic presents the greatest challenge to public health in living memory. To slow the spread of the virus the UK initiated periods of strict social distancing, or lockdown. The ongoing social and psychological impacts of the pandemic and lockdowns are still under investigation. We aimed to explore longitudinally the attitudes and behaviors of members of the UK public from the start of UK lockdowns in March, 2020. We focused on mental health, adherence to health behaviours and government regulations, perceptions of vaccinations, and impact on Black, Asian, Minority Ethnic (BAME) participants. Method: Focus groups (2-8 people, 60 min) and surveys were conducted with 57 UK residents from March 23, 2020 to the present at 5 different timepoints that captured lockdowns and firebreaks (93% retention). Participants were 51% Female, mean age 37.1 (Range: 20-60), 72% White, 5% Mixed or Multiple ethnic groups, 16% Asian or Asian British, and 7% Black, African, Caribbean or Black British. Surveys included the Patient Health Questionnaire - Somatic, Anxiety, and Depressive Symptoms (PHQ-SADS), the Capabilities, Opportunities, Motivations and Behaviours questionnaire (COM-B), and coronavirus specific questions such as vaccination intention. Qualitative results: The central theme was that of loss;'practical losses' e.g. income and 'psychological losses' e.g. motivation. Loss improved, but uncertainty and anticipatory anxiety continued across timepoints. Reported mental health issues improved over Summer 2020 and worsened in Nov 2020. Alert fatigue and learned helplessness emerged as the main themes at that time and marginalization by BAME participants. Behavioural adherence and vaccination uptake focused around perception of risk and community vs individual responsibility. Quantitative results: Data will be analysed following the current wave of data collection (Nov-Dec 2021) and will presented in March, 2022. Conclusion: Mental health fluctuated with the ability to socially connect with others outside of the household. Feelings of loss improved over time. Alert fatigue and general mistrust in government increased as did learned helplessness resulting in a loss of motivation. Results have had a significant policy and media impact in the UK and resulted in several publications to date.","Dienes, K. A.; Armitage, C.

"CORRELATES OF SLEEP DURATION AMONG YOUNG ADULTS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted sleep and mental health. This is true for college students, who are vulnerable to short sleep and have endorsed high rates of anxiety, stress, and depression throughout the pandemic. Research suggests that sleep duration may have improved for some individuals during the pandemic;while shorter sleep may be associated with perceived stress (PS), anxiety, depression, and COVID-19 related worry (CRW). We examined differences in sleep duration based on timing of survey completion (i.e., pre-quarantine, quarantine, post-vaccine phases) and tested the hypothesis that shorter sleep would be associated with higher levels of depression, anxiety, PS, and CRW. Undergraduate students (N=1,035;Mage=18.81 (SD=1.25);27% male) completed self-report measures online from March 2020-October 2021. After data were coded based on timing of survey completion, regression was used to test differences in sleep duration, sleep quality, depression, anxiety, PS and CRW across study phases. Associations between sleep duration and sleep quality, depression, anxiety, PS and CRW were then examined within each study phase while adjusting for age and sex. During the quarantine participants slept 34 minutes longer on average, relative to those who completed the survey pre-quarantine (b=-0.57, p= 0.04), and 16 minutes longer relative to those who completed the survey post vaccine roll out (b=-0.26, p&lt;.01, R2=.01). There were no differences in sleep quality, depression, anxiety, PS or CRW across the three survey phases (all ps &gt;.05). Shorter sleep was not significantly associated with sleep quality, depression, or anxiety during the pre-quarantine phase (all ps &gt;.05). Shorter sleep was associated with higher anxiety (b=-0.01, p&lt;.004, R2=.02;b =-.014, p &lt;.001, R2=.02), depression (b=-0.03, p&lt;.001, R2=.04;b=-0.02, p&lt;.001, R2=.03) and poorer sleep quality (b=-0.62, p&lt;.001, R2=.09;b=-0.66, p&lt;.001, R2=.10) during quarantine and post-vaccine roll out phases respectively. Shorter sleep was unrelated to PS or CRW across all 3 study phases (all ps &gt;.05). Sleep duration was longest during quarantine and shortest pre-quarantine, with post vaccine roll out falling between the two. Anxiety and depression may be important correlates of sleep duration during the pandemic. Promoting healthy sleep may be particularly important for mental health.","Decker, A. N.; Marquez, F.

"Vipassana meditation on anxiety state, depression and quality of life of professionals in social isolation in the lockdown period -2020/COVID-19","The objective of this study to evaluate the effects of Vipassana meditation (VM) program on the state of anxiety, depression and quality of life (QoL) of professionals in social isolation during the Lockdown period in pandemic COVID19/2020. This is an experimental study with intervention based in VM exercises with pre -and post-test measures of experimental and control groups, with simple randomization. VM is a training in attention and awareness, aiming to keep mental processes under voluntary control, developing skills such as calm, concentration and focus. Fifteen sessions of VM were held, lasting from 5 -10 minutes/session. The results showed improvement in the scores of depression ( increment % =-47.6%), anxiety ( increment %=-47.7%) and QoL indicators ( increment %= 9.53), during the lockdown COVID-19/2020. It was concluded that MV was effective for all variables studied in comparison with the control group.

"BIOLOGICAL PREDICTOR OF BURNOUT: THE HAIR CORTISOL CHANGE AT COVID-19 PANDEMIC ONSET PREDICTS BURNOUT SYMPTOMS AMONG HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS","Context: Since March 2020, healthcare workers have been under continued stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Biological variables have been largely neglected in studies exploring burnout and psychopathology, such as depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder among healthcare workers dealing with COVID-19. Methods: Of 467 Quebec, Canada healthcare workers who responded to our electronic survey three months after the beginning of the pandemic, 372 (which corresponds to 80%) furnished a sample of their hair. The survey included questionnaires on mental health outcomes and associated factors. The length of the hair sample was 3 to 6 cm, providing an estimation of the cortisol, a stress hormone, secreted in the three months preceding the pandemic and the three months following its onset. We applied a multivariable regression model and a receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) to examine hair cortisol as an early indicator of burnout and mental health, combined with individual, occupational, social, and organizational factors. Results: As we anticipated, hair cortisol levels soared after the beginning of the pandemic (relative change: +38% [SD = 67%]). Burnout symptoms and cortisol were significantly associated, healthcare workers in the second quarter experiencing lower burnout odds. There was no association between cortisol change and depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. Introducing cortisol in our burnout model with individual-occupational-socio-organizational factors strengthens its predictability pronouncedly. Conclusion: A modest relative change in hair cortisol levels (second quarter of change) forecasted burnout in this population. A non-invasive biological indicator of stress exposure, hair cortisol levels, could profit from additional clinical or research efforts. The final aim would be to prevent and control burnout in health personnel facing a significant stress factor.","Cyr, S.; Marcil, M. J.; Marin, M. F.; Rosa, C.; Tardif, J. C.; Guay, S.; Guertin, M.

"Understanding the Health care Needs of Migrant Children in Government Custody","Background: There are increasing numbers of immigrant children held in government custody at the US-Mexico border and across the US. Further, anti-immigrant policies and the US COVID-19 pandemic response exacerbated detention conditions under the Trump administration. Thus, there is a greater need to identify the health concerns and challenges clinicians face when caring for these children. Methods: A national cross-sectional 66- question online survey was distributed from October 2020 to January 2021 through national pediatric and migrant health listservs including the Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). The reported total number of listserv members was 6200, but the degree of redundancy among these groups was not able to be assessed. Clinicians were asked about care delays, health problems encountered, and resources needed while caring for children under government custody. â€œChildren in government custodyâ€ was defined as children (0-17 years) who currently or previously (in the past 5 years) were under the custody of the US Immigration Customs Enforcement, Customs Border Protection and/or the Office of Refugee and Resettlement. Results: Eightytwo clinicians responded and cared for children clinically. Thirty four cared for children who were in government custody. About 1/3 of this subset of respondents noted care delays while in custody and delays in establishing primary care after custody release. The two main health issues seen were a lack of routine health maintenance and traumatic exposures. Most commonly, children were behind on vaccinations and needed mental health screening. Exposure to violence was the most common traumatic exposure. Furthermore, 47% of clinicians felt that their current resources were inadequate and requested legal assistance and mental health support. Importantly, 58% of respondents were not aware of or were unsure of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention domestic refugee health guidelines for the care of migrant children and adults. Conclusion: Children who experience detention have significant healthcare needs, many of which clinicians do not feel equipped to address. The reported health complications emphasize the need for policy measures, such as those recommended by the AAP, namely, the provision of evidence-based medical evaluations, trauma-informed care, and family-centered medical homes with comprehensive primary care and embedded mental health and legal support systems. Child detention should end. If present, children should be released to ORR shelters with pediatric clinicians providing healthcare and oversite until children can be safely released to vetted legal guardians and established in medical homes. This process should be swift with improved integration of detainment and post-detainment healthcare. Clinicians can be supported with training on immigrant screening guidelines. Of note, the low response rate and inability to distinguish between ICE, CBP, and ORR on the survey limits these results. Nonetheless, these findings support further research and recommendations for policy changes to improve the health and well-being of newly-arrived immigrant children.","Charite, J. M.

"Parenting During a Pandemic: Providing Online Parenting Supportto Mothers of Infants","Background: Adverse experiences in early childhood can have short and long-term consequences on an individual's physical and mental well-being (1). Inversely, secure attachments between infants and their parents help foster healthy social, emotional and cognitive child development (2). However, parenthood can be a period of heightened stress, even under ideal circumstances (3,4). The year 2020 brought forth new parenting challenges, with the presence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased levels of unemployment, financial insecurity, school closures, decreased communal support and social isolation led to augmented parental stress and burnout, which has shown to result in higher cases of abuse and neglect (3,4). Now more than ever, it is crucial that appropriate parenting interventions be available to families with infants (1). Programs like the Incredible Yearsâ„¢ Parents and Babies (IYPB), foster peer support networks and shared learning (5). This study aims to evaluate the impact of the IYPB curriculum for parents with infants. Methods: IYPB is a structured parent-baby group. This pilot study will evaluate the effects of IYPB on parenting confidence, maternal attachment, and infant well-being and development. It will also evaluate the implementation and acceptance of IYPB online. Recruitment was limited to 36, English or Spanish speaking mothers and their infants aged 0-12 months. Four, 8 weeklong workshops of 9 mother-infant dyads each will be conducted by two trained facilitators through a secure virtual platform. Pre- and post-intervention questionaries will be completed (demographics, Ages and Stages, Edinburgh postnatal depression scale, maternal attachment inventory, Karitane parenting confidence scale). Parents will complete an evaluation after each class, and after the final session, they will complete a satisfaction survey and participate in a focus group. Results: One online group with 9 parents took place from 2/13 to 4/10/2021. The average age of infants was 24 weeks and mean age of mothers was 31 years. Preliminary themes from focus group transcripts highlight the benefits of networking and learning from other parents and experts. Participants thought follow-up communication with facilitators was beneficial for those who felt alone during the pandemic. Some comments included: â€œI liked meeting with other moms and professionals in a safe space and learning skills to help with babies' development. I also appreciated being able to talk in small groups and normalize our experiences as parents with young children and feel seen and heard.â€ â€œI just feel so much more capable and comfortable raising a child after having had these foundational building blocksâ€. Barriers to participation included time constraints, work obligations, and childcare. Conclusion: Online parenting groups during a pandemic have allowed mothers to connect with one another and build support networks. Recruitment is ongoing and additional data will be collected and analyzed to determine the effects of IYPB on maternal attachment and infant development.","Camero, K.

"Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic on Pediatric Emergency Medicine Fellowship Training","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic brought shelter-in-place orders by public health organizations and eliminated large gatherings. Training programs abruptly stopped in-person learning to ensure the safety of medical trainees and redesigned curricula to use virtual platforms for didactic learning with variable success. Trainees had decreased patient contact time as pediatric emergency department (ED) patient volumes dropped, operative cases were canceled, clinic visits rescheduled, and use of telehealth visits became more prominent. Resident well-being became even more vital with social isolation and fears of infecting loved ones increased. Our study evaluated the impacts of COVID-19 on pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) fellowship programs, including effects on fellows' clinical, didactic, and research experiences, and effects on fellows' health and wellbeing. Methods: Two surveys were developed using an iterative process by the PEM Collaborative Scholarship Committee, 1 for program leadership (29 questions) and 1 for trainees (27 questions). Surveys were approved and distributed by the PEMPD Survey Committee to program directors (PD) a total of 3 times in 2-week intervals. PDs were asked to forward the trainee survey to their fellows. Survey responses were anonymous. Survey questions met our study objectives and consisted of multiple choice, 5-point Likert scale, and free text responses. Surveys were completed online using Qualtrics software between March 17, 2021 and April 19, 2021. Results: PDs had a 56.8% (50/88) response rate, fellows 34.6% (144/416). The majority of PD responses represented the Northeast US (n = 18) followed by the Midwest (n = 10). For trainees, responses mostly represented the Midwest (n = 39) followed by the Northeast (n = 38). Fifty-seven respondents self-identified as 1st year, 41 as 2nd years, 45 as 3rd years and 1 as 4th year fellows. All PDs reported a decrease in patient volumes during the height of the pandemic, estimating volumes decreased by 25-50% (n = 17, 36%), 51-75% (n = 20, 43%), or &gt;75% (n = 10, 21%). Most common responses included change in rotations and block schedules, didactics moving to a virtual platform, increased frequency of speakers from outside the institution, fellows being able to participate in COVID related research, and additional mental health services for providers (see Table 1). Reasons for changes to the rotation schedules included rotation cancelations, extra time in the pediatric ED, modifications to rotations, and pregnancy (see Figure 1). PDs and trainees report being required to provide service to COVID patients outside of a pediatric ED. Commonly cited locations included the adult ED and medical intensive care units (MICU). Conclusion: COVID-19 had a clear impact on PEM fellowship training including decreases in pediatric patient volumes, canceled electives, increased care of adults, and altered didactics/conferences in accordance to CDC guidelines. The impact of these changes remains unclear. Future research might assess pandemic-related differences on intraining exam scores or how prepared fellows feel for unsupervised practice.","Cagler, D.; Ngo, T.

"Increased Mental Health Needs in Pediatric Admissions During COVID-19: The Epidemic Within the Pandemic","Background: Pediatric patients with increasing psychiatric needs introduce a substantial challenge for inpatient care. This study illustrates how the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced the number and acuity of psychiatry and psychology consults among pediatric inpatients at a tertiary care hospital. Methods: The study population included all pediatric patients (ages 0-25) admitted to University of Michigan's C.S. Mott Children's Hospital between March 2019 and March 2021 who received a psychology and/or psychiatry consult. Three time periods were defined: pre-pandemic, 3/1/19-3/15/20;early pandemic, 3/16/20-6/30/20;and steady-state pandemic, 7/1/20-2/28/21. The patients were described demographically and clinically. To assess differences among time periods, ANOVA testing was conducted for numeric variables and chi-square tests were used for categorical variables. The number of pediatric inpatients receiving psychiatry and/or psychology consults was reported for each month of the study period as a count and as a percent of all pediatric admissions. Psychiatric acuity was described in terms of length of stay and use of restraints and as-needed medication. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of requiring restraints based on time period, controlling for relevant demographic and clinical variables (age, sex, race, length of stay, and use of benzodiazepines and psychotropics). Logistic regression was also used to estimate the odds of patients requiring as-needed medications (midazolam, lorazepam, diazepam, clonazepam, alprazolam, haloperidol, chlorpromazine, quetiapine, risperidone, aripiprazole, olanzapine, and ziprasidone) based on time period, controlling for clinical and demographic variables (age, sex, race, length of stay, and restraint use). Results: Among the 1,636 patients in the study, average age was 14.0 years (IQR 8.1 to 17.2) and 57.9% were female. Overall, 68.6% were White, 13.6% were Black, and 2.4% were Asian. Among all races, 5.7% identified as Hispanic. Percent of pediatric patients receiving psychiatry and/or psychology consults was higher on average during the pandemic months (71.2% during steady-state pandemic compared to 47.9% pre-pandemic). Across all participants, 2.1% required restraints, 34.4% used psychotropics, and 42.6% used benzodiazepines. During the pandemic, admissions became proportionally more female (64.1% during steady-state pandemic vs. 55.3% pre-pandemic) and older (average age 14.8 years during steady-state pandemic vs. 13.4 years pre-pandemic). During steady-state pandemic, children admitted had 5.70 times higher odds of requiring restraints and 1.78 times higher odds of using psychotropics, compared to children admitted pre-pandemic. Length of stay decreased during the pandemic, and was associated with psychotropic use, benzodiazepine use, male sex, and younger age. Conclusion: A higher proportion of pediatric admissions during the COVID-19 pandemic required psychiatry and/or psychology consults. Additionally, these patients were of higher psychiatric acuity, based on increased use of as-needed medications and restraints. These findings highlight the dramatic changes experienced by individual patients and their healthcare teams during the pandemic.","Brieger, K. K.; Leith, T.; Kullgren, K.; Monroe, K.

"Learning from COVID-19-Analysis of Housing and Urban Design Influence on Users","COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to putting severe pressure on the health and economic systems, has caused considerable changes in people's lives. The influence of the environment on the psycho-social and physical state of people is an established fact in scientific research and literature but the pandemic, with its related, necessary restrictions, brought to the fore some topics that are already well-known in areas such as environmental psychology and sociology. The paper aims to analyse researches that have shown a correlation between the lived environment, private or public, well-being and mental health, with particular reference to the domestic environment. The uncertainty and the feeling of not having control over one's own life and actions can be sharpened or mitigated by the environment in which one carries out their daily activities. There is evidence that the environment is an important determinant of health and, in particular at a time of strong emotional and psychological stress such as a lockdown, significant correlations have been found between the environment and states of stress. Design strategies can therefore positively influence the relationship between man and environment. The pandemic period has led to ""borderline scenarios"" not only in hospitals but also, for example, in public spaces or at home, which has become a place where numerous activities are carried out, sometimes simultaneously: sleeping, eating, working, socializing, doing sports, etc. Parks, gardens, tree-lined streets have become the favourite spaces to have a short break from the house routine. It has been demonstrated that nature, in this period, is an essential factor from a restorative point of view and for the mental balance. This extreme situation must be used to develop design strategies that best meet the new needs of everyday life. Such needs, even when the infectious risk is over, will definitely be changed compared to before.","Biolchini, E.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Learning+from+COVID-19-Analysis+of+Housing+and+Urban+Design+Influence+on+Users","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Making Healthy Cities for People (Hurbe2021): Education, Research, Practice in Planning, Architecture and Engineering;2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-09","",37317,""
"Social Housing: How Covid-19 Has Affected/Infected and What Care/Design Strategy is Needed","For over a year, Covid-19 has rapidly imposed many changes not only in daily habits, but also in the adaptive capacity of the domestic space, imposing a functional reinterpretation to make it more flexible for multiple uses, such as home, office, gym, etc. Sensitive data on the indirect effects of the lockdown and on the houseinhabitant relationship show how new spatial needs have conditioned our physical and mental health as well as having produced cultural and socio-economic implications. Thus, the need to review home comfort and improve the quality of the indoor environment has become urgent, as well as to enhance contact with nature to live happier. This becomes more relevant in Social Housing, where moments and spaces for sharing represent the most characterizing aspect of the life of low and middle-income residents. The sector literature has dealt with this issue several times, especially in more recent times, but the results of the interrelation between Covid-19 and Social Housing are still poorly investigated and deserve further investigation. This paper aims to investigate the specific housing typology and to propose appropriate treatments as design strategies, to ensure healthier conditions of urban life. Through practical experimentation on an Italian case study, an emblematic example of economic and public housing in the urban history of Rome, the study will provide design solutions, graphic results and best practices that demonstrate the necessary updating of the architectural discipline in the light of a global pandemic, within the limits of a preliminary investigation which will suggest new ideas for the current debate on the subject.","Belibani, R.; Lefosse, D.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Social+Housing:+How+Covid-19+Has+Affected/Infected+and+What+Care/Design+Strategy+is+Needed","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Making Healthy Cities for People (Hurbe2021): Education, Research, Practice in Planning, Architecture and Engineering;2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-09","",37318,""
"Poisoning-related Pediatric Emergency Department Visits During the COVID-19 Pandemic at Three Mid-atlantic Hospitals","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic restructured daily life for children and adolescents in the United States and may have altered injury risk patterns. Studies exploring a possible increase in pediatric poisoning events are equivocal, with some indicating increased calls to poison control centers but no increased pediatric emergency visits for poisoning. This study aimed to i) compare the proportion of Emergency Department (ED) visits related to poisoning for pediatric patients before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and ii) describe the acuity and patient characteristics associated with these visits. Methods: This is a repeated cross-sectional study of ED health records for patients 0 to 18 years of age at three hospitals in the mid-Atlantic region from 2018 through 2020. Poisoning-related visits were identified through International Classification of Disease (ICD-10) code or chief complaint. Relevant ICD-10 codes included T36-50 â€œPoisoning by, adverse effect of and underdosing of drugs, medicaments and biological substances,â€ T51-65 â€œToxic effect of substances chiefly nonmedical as to source,â€ and F10-19 â€œMental and behavioral disorders due to psychoactive substance use.â€ Poisoning-related keywords in the chief complaint included â€œPoison/Poisoning,â€ â€œIngestion,â€ â€œOverdoseâ€ and â€œToxin.â€ These identifiers do not distinguish between intentional and unintentional poisonings. Patient demographic characteristics (age, sex, race, ethnicity), illness acuity, and disposition were reported. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression on the odds of poisoning-related ED visits compared to ED visits for other reasons. Results: Of 147,736 total ED visits over the three-year study period, 2,478 (1.68%) were related to poisoning. There was a higher proportion of poisoning-related ED visits in 2020 (2.07% [721/34,835], 95%CI 1.92%-2.22%) compared to 2019 (1.49% [845/56,814], 95%CI 1.39%-1.59%) or 2018 (1.63% [912/56,087], 95% CI 1.52%-1.73%). The most common substances referenced in poisoning-related codes included cannabis (12.2%), non-opioid analgesics (7.7%), and alcohol (6.9%). The odds of poisoning-related ED visits increased for each increase in acuity along a 5-point scale (adjusted OR 2.18, 95%CI 1.90 - 2.50). The odds of poisoningrelated ED visits increased in 2020 compared to 2018 (OR 1.28, 95%CI 1.16 - 1.41) and to 2019 (OR 1.40, 95%CI 2.53 - 2.79), but results did not persist when adjusted for acuity and demographic characteristics. Teenagers and females displayed higher odds of poisoning-related ED visits (Table 1). Median acuity differed by year according to the Kruskal-Wallis test (X2(2) = 35, p&lt;0.001). Post-hoc Dunn testing revealed median acuity differed in 2020 compared to 2018 (p&lt;0.0001) or 2019 (p&lt;0.0001), which suggests increased acuity of poison-related visits over time (Figure 1). Conclusion: Poisoning-related ED visits represented a higher proportion of total ED visits in 2020 compared to prior years;this was likely driven by the higher acuity of poisoning-related visits. Public health interventions should be targeted to decrease the frequency and acuity of pediatric poisoning events. Proportion of ED visits with a Triage Acuity Score of 1-2 for poisoning-related ED visits compared to ED visits for other reasons from 2018-2020. The number of poisoning-related ED visits with an acuity score of 1 or 2 was 432, 422, and 450 in 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. The number of other ED visits with an acuity score of 1 or 2 was 8,882, 9,489, and 6,656 in 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively.","Bechard, M. A.; Gielen, A.; Ryan, L. M.; McDonald, E.

"Promoting Emotional Safety for Youth in Foster Care: A Clinic's Approach to Supporting Caregivers' Understanding and Use of Youth Crisis Interventions Services","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the mental health of children, especially child welfare-involved youth, who are at a higher risk for behavioral health issues (Turney, K., & Wildeman, C. 2016). Approximately a quarter of Massachusetts youth who previously received psychotherapy discontinued care at the beginning of social distancing restrictions in 2020 (Massachusetts Health Policy Commission, 2021) and similarly the utilization rate of mental health services like Youth Mobile Crisis Intervention (YMCI) teams declined during the pandemic (Commonwealth of Massachusetts: MCI, 2021). YMCI teams provide urgent mental health evaluation and stabilization services for children in crisis either in the child's home or school, reducing emergency department visits. This project aims to identify and address barriers children in foster care may face when accessing YMCI. The goals are to 1. Characterize the Foster Children Evaluation Services (FaCES) clinic staff's and community organizations' understanding of YMCI use by foster parents 2. Create resources that guide families on when and how to access YMCI. Methods: Strategic exploration discussions were held with community organizations involved with foster youth to identify barriers to accessing YMCI. Additional meetings were organized with members of the FaCES interdisciplinary pediatric and behavioral health team, which ncludes clinicians and foster caregivers, to better understand the clinical team's current experience with utilizing YMCI as well as identifying when clinicians discuss YMCI with caregivers. Clinic workflow was reviewed to identify how educational materials may be provided to patients and foster families. Results: Based on discussions with the FaCES clinic team and community organizations, a lack of knowledge about YMCI among foster caregivers was identified. This included confusion about when to call YMCI and misunderstandings regarding the possible outcomes of a YMCI evaluation. Targeted educational handouts were created to help foster caregivers better understand accessing YMCI when a child is in a mental health crisis. These resources were integrated into the clinic's current workflow as handouts clinicians can e-mail to foster parents and posted on the clinic's website. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated and exposed the mental health needs of children in foster care. Discussions with foster caregivers, clinical providers, and other professionals revealed a need for clear guidelines on accessing resources, such as YMCI, for youth in foster care experiencing mental health crises. The created materials guide families on how to access these resources to help keep youth in their care emotionally and physically safe.","Banson, K.; Repetti, C.; Saiprasad, M.; Forkey, H.; Morgan, W.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Promoting+Emotional+Safety+for+Youth+in+Foster+Care:+A+Clinic's+Approach+to+Supporting+Caregivers'+Understanding+and+Use+of+Youth+Crisis+Interventions+Services","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Pediatrics; 149, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-09","",37320,""
"Severe Rhabdomyolysis Temporally Associated with sars-cov-2 Vaccine in an Adolescent","Introduction: Serious pediatric systemic adverse events following receipt of the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines such as Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine (BNT162b2-V) are rare, with the most common being myocarditis. We report a case of severe rhabdomyolysis following receipt of BNT162b2-V and review the literature for reports in children. To our knowledge, this is the first case of severe rhabdomyolysis temporally associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine in a healthy adolescent without a predisposing cause. Case Description: A previously healthy16-year-old female developed extensive and severe myalgias and generalized weakness following dose two of BNT162b2-V. She had severe rhabdomyolysis with a peak creatinine kinase (CK) of 246,900 U/L at 92 hours post-vaccination. SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and antibody to nucleocapsid were negative. Extensive workup revealed no alternative causes. The patient was treated effectively with intravenous hyperhydration over a 3-day hospital admission. As of July 9th, 2021, four pediatric cases of rhabdomyolysis temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination were identified in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database. Case 1 was a 17-yearold male with drug overdose (loratadine and doxylamine) 5 days post dose two of BNT162b2-V. He was found to have rhabdomyolysis and myocarditis. Case 2 was a 12-year-old female with bilateral arm weakness post dose two of BNT162b2-V and a peak CK of 7000 U/L. Rigorous exercise was implicated as a cause in this case. Case 3 was a 14-year-old female who accidently received a triple BNT162b2-V dose (undiluted dose) and developed chest pain, her CK was 7000 U/L. Case 4 was a 14-year-old male who developed myalgias post dose one of BNT162b2-V and had mild rhabdomyolysis with a CK of 1600 U/L. Discussion: Rhabdomyolysis has been reported following vaccines including BNT162b2-V but without a causal link. Although our case is the fifth adolescent reported, our case is unique given the absence of an identifiable trigger and the severity of rhabdomyolysis. The development of symptoms in close proximity to vaccine administration and in the absence of another identifiable trigger raises concerns about a potential link. Although exaggerated immune response in vaccine recipients who have had previous SARS-CoV-2 infection has been postulated, the absence of nucleocapsid antibodies does not support this in our patient. Immune mediated or aberrant autoimmune responses to adjuvants in the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, as seen in the autoimmune inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA) is another possibility. Post-vaccination autoimmune phenomena have been documented in connection to various vaccines. Conclusion: As more healthy adolescents with robust immune systems become vaccinated, it is important for clinicians to identify rhabdomyolysis post- SARS-CoV-2 vaccination to allow for timely intervention and prevent adverse outcomes such as acute kidney injury.","Baird, T.; Abdulsatar, F.; Forbes, M.

"EFFICACY OF YOGA-BASED BREATHING INTERVENTION IN COVID-19 POSITIVE, POST-COVID AND HEALTH CARE WORKERS: A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL","SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious and has ability to mutate into newer, more contagious, and lethal strains. Moreover, presence of comorbidities and low immunity increases the COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. Thus, COVID-19 is challenging to treat and eradicate globally. This increase stress and anxiety among the patients, worsening their condition. Even health care workers (HCWs) are distressed and anxious while managing the COVID-19. Mental stress and depression increases risk of COVID-19. Yogic breathing techniques may be beneficial in improving immunity and reducing stress and anxiety. The present study investigated the effectiveness of short and controlled Yoga-based breathing protocols in COVID-positive, COVID-recovered and HCWs. Study subjects were recruited from Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India from 13th October, 2020 to 7th January 2021. Each group was randomly divided into intervention or yoga group and non-intervention or control group. COVID-positive practiced a 5-min routine and COVID-recovered and HCW practiced 5-min and 18-min routines for 15 days. Pre-post estimation of neuropsychological parameters and heart rate variability and baseline, 7th and 15th day estimation of biochemical parameters, 6-minute walk and 1-minute sit-stand tests were conducted. Based on Ayurveda, Prakriti-type was assessed. WBC count was elevated in COVID-positive intervention (p&lt;0.001) and control groups (p=0.003). WBC count (p=0.002) and D-dimer (p=0.002) was decreased in COVID-recovered intervention. A non-significant reduction in perceived stress and tension was noted in COVID-positive intervention. Tension was reduced and quality of life improved in HCW intervention (p&gt;0.05). The Kapha Prakriti (48.9 %) was dominant among COVID-19 infected (positive and recovered) subjects. Distance covered in 6-min increased after intervention in COVID-positive (p=0.01) and HCW (p=0.002). The covered distance was more after intervention in all groups than control sub-group. COVID-positive intervention group shows reduced heart rate (p&gt;0.05) and high-frequency power (p=0.01). The interventions were capable of improving exercise capacity in patients and HCW and reduced cardiovascular risk in COVID-19. The studied breathing protocol can be integrated for the management of COVID-19 and is beneficial to HCWs.","Anand, A.; Rain, M.; Puri, G.

"Food Insecurity During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Spotlight on Latinx Communities","Purpose/Objectives: Food insecurity has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which creates additional disproportionate hardship on vulnerable communities such as refugees and immigrants. Preliminary data support the existence of this disparity on a local level. Workers with service-related jobs have been shown to be at increased risk of FI due to the pandemic. Further, immigrants in the United States are disproportionately represented in food service and domestic household services, with Latinx population especially impacted by the pandemic's economic and health effects such as job loss and disease rates. This survey aims to better understand FI during the pandemic among refugee and immigrant populations in Southwest Virginia. This local area as a resettlement area for many Latinx immigrants can provide insights into causes of FI in the setting of the pandemic and rising unemployment. This information helps identify areas of additional disproportionate effects due to COVID-19 on these populations. The primary objective was to measure the degree of FI and determine relevant causes and their consistency with national COVID-19 impacts. Design/Methods: A 10-question survey was administered to 132 households with assistance of a language interpreter. The Hunger Vital Sign questionnaire, a validated tool, was used to screen for FI. The remainder of the survey collected deidentified demographics, along with household size, including number of children, and potential causes of FI. Results: 86.2% of households reported having at least one child at home. 46.8% of households with children screened positive for FI, with reported causes shown in Figure 1. 50.9% of respondents were of Latin American origin (Figure 2). Of those, 56.7% were food insecure with 76.3% of the FI also reporting job loss/unemployment as a cause. 10.6% of total respondents were asylum-seekers reached by a sponsor, with 87.5% being of Latinx origin and having at least one child at home. 100% of asylum-seekers responded as food insecure and 100% of those listed job loss/unemployment as a cause. Conclusion/Discussion: Immigrants and refugees are facing FI at significantly higher levels than national rates on the local level. The Latinx population has been disproportionately affected by the pandemic contributing to food health disparities. Households with children are facing FI with job loss/unemployment as a leading cause. Moreover, the rate of attribution to job loss is higher within the Latinx community than immigrants overall.

"Stressors and uplifts of confinement due to covid-19: A longitudinal study on mental health in a sample of academic and administrative university staff in Spain","The rapid spread of COVID-19 caused many countries to decide to enter full lockdown, a circumstance that impacted all aspects of life, including mental health. The present longitudinal study aimed to analyze how stressors and uplifts of confinement were linked to psychological symptoms at three different time points: during the full lockdown (wave 1), after the gradual lifting of restrictions (wave 2) and after confinement (wave 3). The sample was made up by one hundred and twenty academic and administrative staff from a big University in Spain, they all completed an online survey. Results showed that psychological status did not change over time, but a significant interindividual variability was found throughout. Some stressors were only linked to symptoms at wave 1, but others maintained their associations during waves 2 and 3. Uplifts were, for the most part, inversely (and exclusively) linked to symptoms at wave 1. However, some of them, although enjoyable, were paradoxically linked to worse mental health at wave 1, and even at waves 2 and 3. These findings highlight the importance of providing preventive psychological strategies for mental distress before, during and after confinement. This article is protected by copyright.

"Changes in Adults' Eating Behaviors During the Initial Months of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Narrative Review","Factors such as regulations and health concerns shifted daily habits, including eating behaviors, during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. This comprehensive narrative review synthesizes research on eating behavior changes during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic (February-June 2020) including changes in amount, rate and timing of food consumption, types and healthfulness of foods consumed, the occurrence of other specified eating behaviors (e.g., restrained eating, binging), and reasons for eating (e.g., stress, cravings), among adults. A literature search using three EBSCOhost databases and Google Scholar was conducted to identify relevant articles made available in 2020. A total of 71 articles representing 250,715 individuals from over 30 countries were reviewed. Findings show eating behaviors changed little during the early pandemic for most participants. Among those whose eating behaviors changed, increases in both intake and frequency of eating meals and snacks were more common than decreases. Findings on timing of eating and healthfulness of food consumed showed mixed results. However, when changes occurred in the type of food consumed, increases were more common for snacks, homemade pastries, white bread/pasta, legumes, and fruits/vegetables; decreases were more common for meats, seafood/fish, frozen foods, fast food, dark breads/grains, and dark leafy green vegetables. During the pandemic, binging, uncontrolled eating, and overeating increased, meal skipping decreased, and restrictive eating had mixed findings. Changes in factors such as emotions and mood (e.g., depression), cravings, and environmental factors (e.g., food insecurity) were related to changes in eating behaviors. Findings can inform clinical practitioners in efforts to mitigate disruptions to normal, healthy eating patterns among adults both in and outside of global health catastrophes.","Johnson, Clockston, Fremling, Clark, Lundeberg, Mueller, Graham","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2022.08.132","20220908","COVID-19; dietary patterns; eating behaviors; food consumption; review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-09","",37326,""
"Child and Maternal Mental Health Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Longitudinal Social Inequalities in a Brazilian Birth Cohort","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused major stress for families and children, particularly in the context of prolonged school closures. Few longitudinal studies are available on young children's mental health, including data both before and during the pandemic. This study examined experiences that might increase risk for mental health problems among caregivers and young children during the pandemic, and inequalities driven by pre-pandemic disadvantage. In this prospective, population-based birth cohort study in Pelotas, Brazil, we analyzed 2,083 children and caregivers with data from both before the pandemic in 2019, when children were aged 4 years old, and again in 2020, when schools were closed for a long period during the pandemic. Child conduct problems, emotional problems and hyperactivity-inattention problems were assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Family financial hardship, relationship difficulties, caregiver mental health, parenting practices, and child fears and isolation were considered as potential risk factors. Across the whole population, the only significant increase in mental health problems from before to during the pandemic was found for maternal depression. However, poorer families were at far greater risk of experiencing serious financial problems, food shortages, increased conflict in adult relationships, parenting problems, and child worries about food availability during the pandemic. In turn, these difficulties were associated with increases in multiple mental health problems for both caregivers and children. Increased child mental health problems were most strongly associated with concurrent: maternal anxiety (b &gt; 0.20, p &lt; .001, for each of child conduct, emotional and hyperactivity problems), maternal depression (b = 0.26, p &lt; .001, for child emotional problems), partner-criticism (b = 0.21, p &lt; .001, for child conduct problems), and harsh parenting (b &gt; 0.20, p &lt; .001, for both child conduct and hyperactivity problems). Child worry about coronavirus was associated with increased emotional problems (b = 0.14, p &lt; .001), but children's isolation was not associated with their mental health. Overall, the impact of the pandemic on mental health is a mixed picture, but for families in poverty, there were marked material and interpersonal difficulties that associated with increases in mental health problems among children and caregivers.","Murray, Bauer, Loret de Mola, Martins, Blumenberg, Esposti, Stein, Barros, Hallal, Silveira, Bertoldi, Domingues","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2022.07.832","20220908","COVID-19 pandemic; children; inequality; mental health; parenting","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-09","",37327,""

An NGS-based molecular assay was used to assess SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses. After the second dose, 58% (166/284) of sero-positive and 45% (99/221) of sero-negative patients display anti-spike T-cells. The percentage of patients who displayed T cell response was higher among patients receiving mRNA-1273 vaccines compared to those receiving BNT162b2 vaccines. After the third vaccination, 40% (137/342) of patients seroconverted although only 22% displayed sufficient antibody levels associated with the production of neutralizing antibodies. 97% (717/738) of patients who were sero-positive before the third dose had markedly elevated anti-spike antibody levels. Anti-spike antibody levels, but not T-cell responses, were depressed by B cell-directed therapies.

"Moral values predict county-level COVID-19 vaccination rates in the United States","Despite the widespread availability of COVID-19 vaccines, the United States has a depressed rate of vaccination relative to similar countries. Understanding the psychology of vaccine refusal, particularly the possible sources of variation in vaccine resistance across U.S. subpopulations, can aid in designing effective intervention strategies to increase vaccination across different regions. Here, we demonstrate that county-level moral values (i.e., Care, Fairness, Loyalty, Authority, and Purity) are associated with COVID-19 vaccination rates across 3,106 counties in the contiguous United States. Specifically, in line with our hypothesis, we find that fewer people are vaccinated in counties whose residents prioritize moral concerns about bodily and spiritual purity. Further, we find that stronger endorsements of concerns about Fairness and Loyalty to the group predict higher vaccination rates. These associations are robust after adjusting for structural barriers to vaccination, the demographic makeup of the counties, and their residents' political voting behavior. Our findings have implications for health communication, intervention strategies based on targeted messaging, and our fundamental understanding of the moral psychology of vaccination hesitancy and behavior.

"Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Among Health Care Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has taken a significant toll on people worldwide, and in particular, on the health care workers (HCWs) who have worked on the frontlines in the fight against the pandemic. The goal of this study was to investigate the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and related factors in HCWs in the era of COVID-19. This cross-sectional survey study was conducted between September 15, and October 15, 2020, among HCWs in Turkey. The survey consisted of self-administered questionnaires, which included questions about sociodemographic variables, experiences caring for patients with COVID-19, and the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), a trauma screening tool. The online survey was completed by 1833 HCWs. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify independent predictors of PTSD. The mean age of the participants was 32.7Ã‚Â±7.0 years; 81.9% were physicians, and 56.5% were female. The rates of COVID-19 history in the respondents, a family member, or a coworker were 13.6%, 32.3%, and 12.6%, respectively. Among the HCWs who participated, 39.9% met the criteria for PTSD. Compared with the physicians, the nonphysician HCWs had a higher rate of PTSD (49.5% vs. 36%) (P&lt;0.001) and higher PCL-5 scores (53.31Ã‚Â±19.6 vs. 42.5Ã‚Â±20.3) (P&lt;0.001). In addition, 9.7% of the surveyed HCWs reported having suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Independent predictors of PTSD in HCWs were working on a COVID-19 unit, feeling isolated, suicidal ideation, being a nonphysician HCW, fear of spreading coronavirus to family, female sex, and a history of having COVID-19. HCWs were at risk for impairment in mental well-being in the era of COVID-19, with a significant number experiencing PTSD as well as suicidal ideation. Therefore, HCWs, especially those who are working on a COVID-19 unit and are female, should be monitored regularly for PTSD.","Bayazit, Ozel, Arac, Dulgeroglu-Bayazit, Joshi","https://doi.org/10.1097/PRA.0000000000000661","20220908","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-09","",37331,""
"A qualitative study of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women seeking pelvic organ prolapse surgery in Alberta, Canada","In addition to altering public infrastructure and social patterning, the COVID-19 pandemic has delayed many pelvic organ prolapse (POP) surgeries. POP-related stigma, symptomology and the experience of waiting for POP surgery can negatively impact women's quality of life and mental health. The experience of preoperative POP patients during the pandemic thus entails a new intersection of gendered, stigmatic and medical realities. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 26 preoperative POP patients as part of a larger qualitative study, 20 of whom spontaneously volunteered information about how the pandemic coloured their experience living with and awaiting surgery for POP. Interviews occurred between January and July 2021, which coincided with the second and third waves of the pandemic in Alberta, Canada, and before full immunisation was available for all Albertans. Pandemic-related interview excerpts were thematically analysed, and four main findings emerged. (1) Though surgical delay meant living with unpleasant symptoms for longer than anticipated, some sought this out in order to protect vulnerable loved ones from possible hospital-acquired infection, (2) shifting and unclear hospital policies and logistics resulted in intense preoperative stress, at times causing women to temporarily cease treatment, (3) decreased access to public restroom infrastructure caused women to reduce their outings and (4) the imperative to minimise social gatherings made it easier for women to engage in POP-related, shame-based self-isolation without the notice of friends and family. As they can influence postoperative outcomes and treatment adherence, trends observed should be of interest to clinicians and policymakers alike.","Knox, Ramage, Scime, Ducey, Brennand","https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.14020","20220908","COVID-19 pandemic; hospital policy; pelvic organ prolapse; self-isolation; stigma; surgery; urinary incontinence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-09","",37332,""
"Nightmare frequency and nightmare distress during the COVID-19 pandemic","The current study investigated nightmare frequency and distress during the pandemic and associated factors. 1718 participants completed a survey, 747 of which were youth. The MADRE dream questionnaire was used to collect self-reported data on nightmare frequency and distress. In addition, personality traits, current stressors and COVID-related anxiety were also measured. An ordinal regression model was used for statistical analysis, and p &lt; 0.05 was considered significant. The findings from this study suggest (1) COVID-related anxiety is associated with the frequency of nightmares and the severity of nightmare distress experienced by a person; and (2) findings support the continuity hypothesis, which suggests waking life experiences are related to nightmares; and (3) increased COVID-related anxiety contributes independently to nightmare frequency. COVID-related anxiety appeared to be more prevalent within adults (<i>p</i>&lt;.001, effect size = 0.18) compared to youth. Similar results were found for nightmare distress. The risk of nightmares may have increased due to disruptions in mental health and sleep caused by the COVID-19 crisis.

Different aspects of lifestyle are highly interconnected. For people with SMI, loss of routine and good sleep, poor diet and lack of exercise can compound each other, leading to a decline in physical and mental health.

"Financial toxicity and mental well-being of the oral cancer survivors residing in a developing country in the era of COVID 19 pandemic - A cross-sectional study","The primary outcome measures evaluated the financial toxicity and mental well-being of the oral cancer survivors. A cross-sectional study of oral cancer survivors who were disease-free for more than six months after treatment and visited the hospital for a routine follow-up is included in the study. Mental well-being and financial toxicity were evaluated using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale - 21 (DASS 21) and Comprehensive Score for financial Toxicity (COST- FACIT) questionnaires. A literature review was done to compare the results with financial toxicity and mental health in cancer patients from the pre-pandemic era. A total of seventy-nine oral cancer survivors were included in the study, predominantly males (M: F=10:1). The age ranged from 26 to 75 years (The median age is 49). The full-time employment dropped from 83.5% in the pre-treatment period to 21.5% post-treatment. Depression was observed in 58.2% and anxiety in 72.2%. Unemployed survivors were observed to have more depression (OR =1.3, 95% CI=0.3 -5.4, p=0.6), anxiety (OR= 3.5, 95% CI= 0.3 -21.2, p= 0.1) and stress (OR =1.6, 95% CI= 0.3 -6.6, p= 0.5) than rest of the cohort. On univariate analysis, unemployed survivors (M=11.8Ã‚Â±3.8, p=0.01) had significantly poorer financial toxicity scores. Survivors with depression (M=16.4Ã‚Â±7.1, p=0.06) and stress (M=14.4Ã‚Â±6.8, p=0.002) had poor financial toxicity scores. On multifactorial analysis of variance, current employment (p=0.04) and treatment modality (p=0.05) were significant factors impacting the financial toxicity. There is a trend towards increased incidence of depression, anxiety, and stress among oral cancer survivors compared to the literature from the pre-COVID era. There is significant financial toxicity among either unemployed or part-time workers. This calls for urgent public/government intervention to prevent the long-term impact of financial toxicity on survival and quality of life. This article is protected by copyright.

In the cohort, 31.1% of employees showed dropout intention and 13.2% of employees were experiencing burnout in March 2021. Hospital workers were more motivated by a sense of contribution and accomplishment, which could balance increased exhaustion in March 2021. The following factors associated with burnout remained to be solved: self-quarantine, unfavorable patient prognosis, poor communication of information, lack of sleep in comparison to the pre-COVID-19 period, and desire for good communication of information. It is important to continuously evaluate the mental health status of employees and to provide targeted prevention and intervention in order to mitigate psychological distress and avoid burnout and resignation.","Yamada, Kishimoto, Sakai, Kuwahira, Chino, Ebihara, Shiraishi, Nishizaki","https://www.google.com/search?q=Transitional+Changes+in+Job+Stress+and+Psychological+Adjustment+of+Hospital+Workers+During+the+COVID-19+Pandemic+in+Japan.","20220908","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-09","",37337,""
"COVID-19-Related Stressors and Mental Health Disorders Among US Adults","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to severe mental health repercussions. We examined rates of anxiety and depression in the United States during the pandemic by demographic characteristics, individual stressors, and COVID-19 infection rates and policy contexts. We merged data from the April 2020-March 2021 US Household Pulse Survey with state-level data on COVID-19 rates and mitigation policies, including stay-at-home orders, face mask mandates, and restaurant closures. We estimated weighted logistic regression models to assess correlates of anxiety and depression. Rates of anxiety and depression peaked in late 2020 at 39% and 32%, respectively. Food insecurity and disrupted medical care were associated with more than twice the odds of anxiety and depression (food insecurity: odds ratio [OR] = 2.58 for anxiety and 2.61 for depression; disrupted medical care: OR = 2.40 and 2.27). Being not employed (OR = 1.32 for anxiety and 1.45 for depression), uninsured (OR = 1.30 and 1.38), housing insecure (OR = 1.41 and 1.34), and experiencing disruptions in education (OR = 1.28 and 1.25) were linked to 25% to 45% increased odds of anxiety and depression. Increases in state COVID-19 infection rates were associated with significantly heightened odds of anxiety and depression (OR = 1.01 for anxiety and depression), but state mitigation policies were not. Levels of anxiety and depression rose during the pandemic, particularly among economically vulnerable individuals and those experiencing economic and service disruptions.

"When uncertainty becomes the norm: The Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital's Speech Therapy and Audiology Department's response to the COVID-19 pandemic","Ã‚Â In March 2020 the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic. Management of this pandemic had significant implications for clinical departments across the world. Healthcare systems were urgently required to reorganise and redesign patient care as well as repurpose staff. Ã‚Â We will share the lived experience of our response as speech therapy and audiology (STA) clinicians to the COVID-19 pandemic. Ã‚Â This study adopted an autoethnographic approach within Bronfenbrenner's bioecological model to describe STA clinicians' response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Ã‚Â Adaptations to practice were made to continue service provision whilst adhering to COVID-19 regulations. We assisted in other areas to meet the immediate needs of the hospital. Service delivery strategies consisted of a review of clinical and quality assurance protocols. We developed a telehealth service package which included a hybrid approach, within a context of digital poverty. We created resources to ensure continuity of care. Collaboration within our systems facilitated innovative solutions. Mental health and well-being of staff members were key to the response developed. Ã‚Â South African healthcare systems' inequalities were highlighted by the pandemic. The response showed that the needs of vulnerable populations were not accounted for when developing this public health response. Lessons learnt included the importance of adaptability, becoming comfortable with uncertainty and maintaining open and transparent communication. Consultation and collaboration within various levels of our healthcare system were critical in responding to the needs of patients. Commitment to compassionate leadership and staff well-being were crucial.","Balton, Vallabhjee, Pillay","https://doi.org/10.4102/sajcd.v69i2.913","20220908","COVID-19; South Africa; Speech Therapy and Audiology; adaptations; autoethnography; bioecological framework; collaboration; microsystem; solutions; telehealth; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-09","",37339,""
"The effects of COVID-19 on the rehabilitation of persons with aphasia: A scoping review","Ã‚Â The impact of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was more pronounced on the well-being of persons with disabilities, especially in low- and middle-income countries. There is documented evidence of the rippling effects of COVID-19 on persons with disabilities. However, not much is known about the impact of COVID-19 on the rehabilitation of persons with aphasia. Ã‚Â The scoping review explores how COVID-19 affected the rehabilitation of persons living with aphasia. Ã‚Â A scoping review was conducted using Arksey and O'Malley's framework. A search was conducted on Science Direct, PubMed, Medline, Scopus, ProQuest and Google Scholar, to identify relevant studies published between 2019 and 2022. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Ã‚Â Most studies regarding the effects of COVID-19 on persons living with aphasia were conducted in the United Kingdom. Five themes emerged from the data, namely, (1) negative impact on rehabilitative care, (2) telehealth and its limitations, (3) impact on social participation, (4) compromised caregiver involvement and (5) mental health challenges. Ã‚Â Findings highlight the need for healthcare professionals to pursue innovative ways in which aphasia rehabilitation and conversational support programmes can be made accessible to persons with aphasia, despite the limitations brought about by a pandemic. Telerehabilitation programmes need to be tailored to the needs of persons with aphasia if they are to be successful. This study highlights the importance and need for the prioritisation of mental health services for persons with aphasia and their caregivers during a pandemic.","Masuku, Khumalo, Shabangu","https://doi.org/10.4102/sajcd.v69i2.920","20220908","COVID-19 pandemic; aphasia; rehabilitation; social participation; telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-09","",37340,""
"Vulnerable individuals and changes in suicidal behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic in Korea","The COVID-19 pandemic poses a major threat to mental health and is associated with an increased risk of suicide. An understanding of suicidal behaviours during the pandemic is necessary for establishing policies to prevent suicides in such social conditions. We aimed to investigate vulnerable individuals and the characteristics of changes in suicidal behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with suicide attempts who visited the emergency department from February 2019 to January 2021. We analysed the demographic and clinical characteristics, risk factors and rescue factors of patients, and compared the findings between the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods. In total, 519 patients were included. During the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods, 303 and 270 patients visited the emergency department after a suicide attempt, respectively. The proportion of suicide attempts by women (60.1% <i>v</i>. 69.3%, <i>P</i> = 0.035) and patients with a previous psychiatric illness (63.4% <i>v</i>. 72.9%, <i>P</i> = 0.006) increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, patients' rescue scores during the pandemic were lower than those during the pre-pandemic period (12 (interquartile range: 11-13) <i>v</i>. 13 (interquartile range: 12-14), <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). Women and people with previous psychiatric illnesses were more vulnerable to suicide attempts during the COVID-19 pandemic. Suicide prevention policies, such as continuous monitoring and staying in touch with vulnerable individuals, are necessary to cope with suicide risk.","Lee, Kim, Lee, Hong, Park, Kim, Baek, Jeon","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.569","20220908","COVID-19; Korea; Suicide attempt; mental health; risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-09","",37341,""
"Non-pharmacological interventions of travel restrictions and cancelation of public events had a major reductive mortality affect during pre-vaccination coronavirus disease 2019 period","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a severe acute respiratory disease that poses a continuous threat to global public health. Many non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) have been implemented to control the COVID-19 pandemic since the beginning. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of various NPIs on COVID-19 mortality during pre-vaccination and vaccination periods. The COVID-19 data used in this study comes from Our World in Data, we used the Oxford Strict Index (OSI) and its five combination interventions as independent variables. The COVID-19 mortality date (MRT) was defined as a date when daily rate of 0.02 COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 population in a country was reached, and the COVID-19 vaccination date (VRT) was defined as people vaccinated reaching 70%. Linear regression and random forest models were used to estimate the impact of various NPI implementation interventions during pre-vaccination and vaccination periods. The performance of models was assessed among others with Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) explaining the prediction capability of the model. During the pre-vaccination period, the various NPIs had strong protective effect. When the COVID-19 MRT was reached, for every unit increase in OSI, the cumulative mortality as of June 30, 2020 decreased by 0.71 deaths per 100,000 people. Restrictions in travel (SHAP 1.68) and cancelation of public events and gatherings (1.37) had major reducing effect on COVID-19 mortality, while staying at home (0.26) and school and workplace closure (0.26) had less effect. Post vaccination period, the effects of NPI reduced significantly: cancelation of public events and gatherings (0.25), staying at home (0.22), restrictions in travel (0.14), and school and workplace closure (0.06). Continued efforts are still needed to promote vaccination to build sufficient immunity to COVID-19 in the population. Until herd immunity is achieved, NPI is still important for COVID-19 prevention and control. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the stringency of NPI implementation had a significant negative association with COVID-19 mortality; however, this association was no longer significant after the vaccination rate reached 70%. As vaccination progresses, ""cancelation of public events and gatherings"" become more important for COVID-19 mortality.","Wen, Shi, Liu, Xie, Qin, Wang, Liu, Bai, Hong, Ma, Yu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2022.914732","20220908","COVID-19; mortality; public health interventions; random forest; vaccines","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-09","",37342,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Social Isolation on the Sexual Functioning of Women Who Have Been Treated for Vaginismus","Multiple factors that impact the mental and hormonal condition of the person influence female sexual function. To our knowledge, however, hardly any research has investigated the sexual function during the COVID-19 pandemic for women who were treated for vaginismus. The purpose of this research is to examineÃ‚Â how sexual function, frequency ofÃ‚Â sexual activity, and dyspareunia altered in women who had been treated for vaginismus before the pandemic. This observational study ultimately included 204 patients with completely treated vaginismus at the Women's Health Clinic . Before and during the pandemic, the following data was collected: age, education level, profession, frequency of sexual activity, Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale (ASEX) scores, Golombok-Rust Inventory of Sexual Satisfaction (GRISS) scores, and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores. Before the pandemic, the mean ASEX score of women in the research group was 12.56Ã‚Â±3.41 , and during the pandemic, ASEX average scores of the women significantly increased to 16.88Ã‚Â±5.56 . The GRISS total scores were 28.7Ã‚Â±10.1 (range, 14-50) following therapy and 23.9Ã‚Â±14.8 (8-58) during the pandemic. After therapy, the HDRS score was 9.58Ã‚Â±5.53 (1-19) , while it was 15.21Ã‚Â±6.43 (5-26) during the pandemic. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, mental health declined significantly, indicating a mild state of depression unrelated to vaginismus.Ã‚Â During the pandemic, the mean frequency of sexual activity was 2.9Ã‚Â±1.4 per week, and the frequency of sexual encounters did not considerably vary. Therapists should examine the pandemic's impacts on all sexual function symptom categories and modify their treatment plans appropriately. The findings indicate that lowering COVID-19-related stress may be especially useful in minimizing the negative impact of COVID-19 on symptoms. We noticed that vaginismus-treated women did not relapse during the pandemic. The study population was comprised of women attending a particular women health clinic. This can place a certain bias on the demography of the patient population. The present research indicated that the frequency of sexual activity among women treated for vaginismus did not alter, and notwithstanding a rise in stress and depression ratings, the majority of sexual function scores, including pain, improved during the pandemic. Nonetheless, dissatisfaction and anorgasmia subscales deteriorated, while ASEX satisfaction did not improve to the same extent, suggesting deleterious consequences on sexual function.","ZÃƒÂ¼lfikaroglu","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.28736","20220908","asex; cognitive and behavioral therapy; covid-19 retro; female sexual dysfunction; griss; hdrs; treatment outcome; vaginismus","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-09","",37343,""
"Psychoactive substance use, internet use and mental health changes during the COVID-19 lockdown in a French population: A study of gender effect","COVID-19 has enormous impacts on each individual. The goals of our study were (1) to assess the rate of internet and psychoactive substance use, clinical depression and anxiety in a French population during the lockdown (2) to study the role of clinical and socio-demographic variables (especially, gender). During lockdown, an online anonymous questionnaire was used to assess socio-demographic and health data, previous psychiatric history, anterior and current internet and psychoactive substance use, current anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation. The associations of socio-demographic, clinical variables with anxiety, depression, internet or psychoactive substance use were examined. The study included 263 participants (aged 38.1 Ã‚Â± 15.3-197 males and 64 females). During the lockdown, internet use increased in 14.4% of cases, alcohol use in 20.2%, and tobacco use in 6.8%. In contrast, more participants reported a decrease in alcohol, tobacco or illicit drug use (25.9, 24, and 27.8% respectively). Anxiety was reported in 62.4% and depression in 20.2% of cases; 29.7% of participants reported an increase in anxiety and 25.5% an increase in depression. Depression was associated with an increase in internet and tobacco use. Tobacco and alcohol use were positively associated and an increase in use was more frequent in previous users of both substances. Maintaining a daily routine and relationships with family, being self-employed were associated to lower risks of depression and anxiety. Higher rates of internet use, as well as depression and anxiety, were observed during the lockdown. Gender was not a significant associated factor.","Malandain, Fountoulakis, Syunyakov, Malashonkova, Smirnova, Thibaut","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.958988","20220908","COVID-19; alcohol; anxiety; depression; internet; lockdown; mental health; tobacco","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-09","",37344,""
"Cultivation of Positive Psychological Quality of College Students' English Learning Under the Online and Offline Teaching Mode During the Epidemic","During the COVID-19 pandemic, long-term isolation and loneliness will cause college students' psychological fluctuations. Especially in online teaching, the lack of communication for a long time has led to a greatly reduced learning enthusiasm of college students. Therefore, this paper aims to explore the cultivation methods of the positive psychological quality of college students under the epidemic situation through the research on the positive psychology of college students' English learning. Aiming at the psychological status of college students, this paper focuses on analyzing the relationship between social support, psychological capital, and psychological health to explore more targeted ways of cultivating positive psychology. Because of the online and offline teaching mode, this paper focuses on analyzing the support environment of the online teaching mode, and analyses the current forms of English teaching. Experiments show that the direct path from psychological capital to mental health is not significant. However, the mediating path of psychological capital to mental health through social support was significant (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). It shows that social support plays a complete mediating role, and the effect size of the mediation model reaches 49.70%. It shows that the current college students' English learning positive psychological quality is not high. In response to this, it is necessary to strengthen the tendency and ability to use social support and use the family environment to communicate more to achieve the cultivation of positive psychological quality.","Yu, Li","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.929027","20220908","BP neural network; electronic games; health education; positive psychology; post-pandemic era","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-09","",37345,""
"The Frequency of Infant-Feeding Presentations at English Emergency Departments During the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic: A Nation-Wide Electronic Health Records Study","To examine the frequency and distribution of infant feeding-related presentations at emergency departments (EDs) before and during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Attendances at 48 major EDsÃ‚Â in England in two 50-week periods before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: period 1, April 2, 2019 to March 10, 2020 and period 2, April 1, 2020 to March 10, 2021. We estimated the change in frequency of ED presentations by age group and diagnosis before and after the start of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in England.Ã‚Â We compared changes in the frequency of attendances of infant-feeding related presentations by infant age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, rurality, arrival mode, arrival time, acuity, mother's age, gravidity and mental health, birth length of stay, attendance duration, and disposal (i.e., admission or discharge). While total ED attendances fell by 16.7% (95% CI -16.8% to -16.6%), infant attendances increased for feeding problems (+7.5% 95% CI 2.3% to 13.0%), neonatal jaundice (+12.8%, 95% CI 3.3% to 23.3%) and gastro-esophageal reflux (+9.7%, 95% CI 4.4% to 15.2%).Ã‚Â These increases were more pronounced amongst first babies (+22.4%, 95% CI 13.1% to 32.5%), and where the stay in hospital after birth was brief (0-1 days, +20.1%, 95% CI 14.8% to 25.7%).Ã‚Â Our analysis suggests that many of these attendances were of low acuity. While ED attendances reduced dramatically and systematically with the COVID-19 pandemic, presentations for infant feeding issues increased, implying growth in the unmet needs of new mothers and infants.","Wyatt, Aldridge, Ross, Narayanan, Zuccolo","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.27645","20220908","breastfeeding; covid-19; emergency department; gastro-oesophageal reflux; infant feeding; neonatal jaundice; sars-cov2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-09","",37346,""
"Personal network protects, social media harms: Evidence from two surveys during the COVID-19 pandemic","The classic debate regarding the complex relationships between personal network, social media use, and mental well-being requires renewed examination in the novel context of pandemic-related social isolation. We present two surveys conducted at (i) the earlier months of the pandemic and (ii) the end of large scale social-lockdown measures in the U.S. to explore the social and behavioral antecedents of mental health states relating to social media use. Study 1 tracked the longitudinal changes of personal network, social media use, and anxiety level of a group of individuals (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°147) over a three-month period during the pandemic. Study 2 replicated and extended the theoretical model to a race-representative U.S. adult sample (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°258). Both studies consistently show that (1) more time on social media worsens anxiety. It also mediates the relationship between personal network size and anxiety. That is, a small personal network predicts more social media use, which is in turn related to increased anxiety. (2) Moreover, the effect of social media use on anxiety is mainly explained by news consumption on social media, rather than non-news related usage. (3) This link's strength is moderated by one's perception of COVID-19 impact, such that news consumption on social media increases anxiety more when the perceived impact is higher. These results demonstrate communication technologies' increasingly critical and multifaceted role in affecting mental health conditions.","Ren, Yan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.964994","20220908","COVID-19; anxiety; news exposure; social media use; social networks","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-09","",37347,""
"Loneliness in pregnant and postpartum people and parents of children aged 5Ã‚Â years or younger: a scoping review","Despite evidence that loneliness increases during times of transition, and that the incidence of loneliness is highest in young adults, loneliness during pregnancy and new parenthood has not been developed as a program of research. Because loneliness research has primarily focused on older adults and other high-risk populations, the concept of loneliness and its effects on this population are not well understood, leaving a gap in our understanding of the psychosocial needs and health risks of loneliness on pregnant people and new parents. A scoping review has been completed in order to map and synthesize the literature on loneliness experienced during pregnancy and the first 5Ã‚Â years of parenthood prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. To address the aim of this review, a wide net was cast in order to detect experiences of perinatal or parental loneliness and/or instances where loneliness was measured in this population. Among the inclusion criteria were loneliness in people who were pregnant, who were parents in the postpartum period, or who had children aged 5Ã‚Â years or younger. A search for literature was conducted in December 2020 using nine databases: MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Elsevier), SCOPUS (Elsevier), Cochrane Library including CENTRAL (Wiley), CINAHL (Ebscohost), PsycINFO (Ebscohost), Dissertations &amp; Theses Global (ProQuest) and Sociological Abstracts (ProQuest), and the Web of Science Core Collection (Clarivate). Perinatal and parental loneliness studies are limited and have rarely been targeted and developed through a program of research. Loneliness inquiry in this population was frequently studied in relation to other concepts of interest (e.g., postpartum depression). Alternatively, the importance of loneliness emerged from study participants as relevant to the research topic during qualitative inquiry. Across studies, the prevalence of loneliness ranged from 32 to 100%. Loneliness was commonly experienced alongside parenting difficulties, with parents feeling as though they were alone in their struggles. As loneliness has been called a sensitive indicator of mental wellbeing, we believe screening will help healthcare professionals identify common difficulties and early signs of depression experienced during pregnancy and parenthood.

"What are the barriers and facilitators to seeking help for mental health in NHS doctors: a systematic review and qualitative study","The mental health of healthcare professionals is reaching a breaking point, and the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated current mental health issues to unprecedented levels. Whilst some research has been carried out on the barriers that doctors face when seeking mental health help, there is little research into factors which may facilitate seeking help. We aimed to expand the research base on factors which act as barriers to seeking help, as well as gain insight into facilitators of help-seeking behaviour for mental health in NHS doctors. We conducted a systematic literature review which identified the barriers and facilitators to seeking help for mental health in healthcare professionals. Following this, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 31 NHS doctors about their experiences with mental health services. Finally, through thematic analysis, key themes were synthesised from the data. Our systematic literature review uncovered barriers and facilitators from pre-existing literature, of which the barriers were: preventing actions, self-stigma, perceived stigma, costs of seeking treatment, lack of awareness and availability of support, negative career implications, confidentiality concerns and a lack of time to seek help. Only two facilitators were found in the pre-existing literature, a positive work environment and availability of support services. Our qualitative study uncovered additional barriers and facilitators, of which the identified barriers include: a negative workplace culture, lack of openness, expectations of doctors and generational differences. The facilitators include positive views about mental health, external confidential service, better patient outcomes, protected time, greater awareness and accessibility, open culture and supportive supervisors. Our study began by identifying barriers and facilitators to seeking mental health help in healthcare workers, through our systematic literature review. We contributed to these findings by identifying themes in qualitative data.. Our findings are crucial to identify factors preventing NHS doctors from seeking help for their mental health so that more can be done on a national, trust-wide and personal level to overcome these barriers. Likewise, further research into facilitators is key to encourage doctors to reach out and seek help for their mental health.","Zaman, Mujahid, Ahmed, Mahmud, Naeem, Riaz, Ullah, Cox","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-04202-9","20220907","Barriers; Facilitators; Help-seeking behaviour; Mental health; NHS doctors; Qualitative study; Systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-09","",37349,""
"Suicidality in psychiatric emergency department situations during the first and the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic","Psychiatric patients are prone to mental health deterioration during the Covid-19 pandemic. Little is known about suicidality in psychiatric patients during the Covid-19 pandemic. This study is a retrospective chart review of psychiatric emergency department (pED) presentations with present or absent suicidality (5634 pED attendances, 4110 patients) in an academic pED in Berlin, Germany. Poisson regression analysis was performed on the effect of Covid-19 period on suicidality (suicidal ideation (SI), suicide plans (SP) or suicide attempt (SA)) during the first (3/2/2020-5/24/2020 ""first-wave"") and second (9/15/2020-3/1/2021 ""second-wave"") wave of the Covid-19 pandemic compared to the same periods one year earlier.

"Vaccination willingness in association with personality traits in patients with multiple sclerosis in the course of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic","Vaccination is a key strategy for controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Acceptance of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines by chronically ill patients, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, plays an important role in prevention of complicated disease course. This longitudinal, prospective, multi-centre-study of German MS-patients aimed to detect socio-demographic, clinical, or psychological determinants of attitudes towards standard vaccines, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, and governmental measures before/during the pandemic. Exactly 404 MS-patients were investigated by standardized questionnaires and structured interviews on socio-demographic, clinical-neurological, and psychological characteristics, vaccination status, and vaccination from June 2019. Data on SARS-CoV-2 vaccination willingness were collected in two follow-up assessments (1st: June to July 2020, before SARS-CoV-2 vaccine availability, NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°200; 2nd: March to May 2021, after SARS-CoV-2 vaccine availability, NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°157). Age, sex, MS course type, depression, and personality characteristics (Extraversion, Novelty seeking, Self-directedness, and Cooperativeness) were significantly associated with vaccination willingness. Although the majority of MS-patients showed SARS-CoV-2 vaccination willingness at both follow-ups (1st: 60%, 2nd: 61%), a substantial proportion had concerns and were undecided or opposed to vaccination. Socio-demographic variables like age and sex, psychopathological status, and various personality characteristics might influence vaccination willingness and should be considered when discussing with MS-patients about SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.","Heidler, Baldt, Frahm, Langhorst, Mashhadiakbar, Streckenbach, Burian, Zettl, Richter","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-18912-3","20220907","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-09","",37351,""

"Depression and Anxiety Symptoms Among Kenyan adolescents: Prevalence Rates and Associations with Socio-demographic and Psycho-social Factors During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: Research dedicated to youth mental health problems in low â€“ resource countries is an urgent and critical global health priority. Prior to COVID-19, only a handful of studies had estimated the prevalence rates of youth depression and anxiety and identified the associations between these problems with socio-demographic and psychosocial variables. As COVID-19 has emerged as a stressor for youth mental health, new studies on youth mental health during and post COVID-19 may yield important research, policy, and practice implications. Here, we assessed the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms and their associations with psychosocial and sociodemographic variables in a large sample of school-going youths in Kenya. Method: Measures of depression (PHQ-8) and anxiety (GAD-7), social support, perseverance, optimism, perceived control, connectedness, happiness, purpose in life, and gratitude were administered to 1,498 Kenyan adolescents (55.47% male) aged 13-to-21 years (M age = 16.33) in mid-2021 when schools re-opened after the COVIDâ€“19 school closures. Results: Some 42.46% and 37.56% youths met the clinical cut-off for elevated depression and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Adolescents whose academic performance was not satisfactory endorsed higher depressive and anxiety symptoms. Female adolescents and those who lived with a single parent endorsed higher depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Subjective wellbeing and perceived control were negatively associated with depressive symptoms. Conclusion: The prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms among Kenyan adolescents has remained steady when compared to pre-pandemic studies. However, symptoms were high when compared to those of adolescents in other countries during COVID-19. This study also identified potential important risk and protective factors.","Tom L.
