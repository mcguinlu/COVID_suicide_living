"Contraceptive use and pregnancy planning in Britain during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic: findings from a large, quasi-representative survey (Natsal-COVID)","Background Reproductive health services were significantly disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic in Britain. We investigated contraception-related health inequalities in the first year of the pandemic. Methods Natsal-COVID Wave 2 surveyed 6,658 adults aged 18-59 between March-April 2021, using quotas and weighting to achieve quasi-representativeness. Our analysis included sexually active participants aged 18-44, described as female at birth. We analysed contraception use and switching, contraceptive service access, and pregnancy plannedness in the year from March 2020. Findings Amongst all participants (n=1,488), 14.3% (12.5%-16.3%) reported switching or stopping contraception due to the pandemic. Of participants at risk of unplanned pregnancy (n=1,169), 54.1% (51.0%-57.1%) reported routinely using effective contraception in the past year. 3.2% (2.0%-5.1%) of those using effective methods pre-pandemic switched to less effective methods, while 3.8% (2.5%-5.9%) stopped. Stopping/switching was more likely amongst participants of younger age, non-white ethnicity, and lower social grade. 29.3% of at-risk participants (26.9%-31.8%) reported trying to access contraceptive services; of whom 16.4% (13.0%-20.4%) reported their needs went unmet. Unmet need was associated with younger age, diverse sexual identities and anxiety symptoms. Of 199 pregnancies, 6.6% (3.9%-11.1%) were scored as 'unplanned'; less planning was associated with younger age, lower social grade and unemployment. Interpretation Although many participants reported accessing contraceptive services during the pandemic, one-in-six of these reported an unmet need. Inequalities in unmet need and risk of unplanned pregnancy - related to age, ethnicity, social disadvantage and mental health - potentially exacerbated existing reproductive health inequalities. These should be addressed in the post-pandemic period and beyond.","Andrew J Baxter; Rebecca Geary; Emily Dema; Raquel Boso Perez; Julie Riddell; Malachi Willis; Anne Conolly; Laura Oakley; Andrew Copas; Jo Gibbs; Chris Bonell; Pam Sonnenberg; Catherine Heather Mercer; Soazig Clifton; Kirstin R Mitchell; Nigel Field","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.10.14.22281078","20221017","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-18","",39374,""

"Incorporating DEI informed-frameworks and increasing access to parent-focused interventions in pediatric psychology","Objective: The ethical imperative to work with the parents, caregivers, and guardians (hereafter, parents) of pediatric patients has been highlighted. However, parents continue to be underserved in pediatric health care settings. The syndemics of COVID-19 and mental health further magnified health disparities and the differential impacts of social determinants of health on the wellbeing of those from minority or disadvantaged backgrounds. Therefore, dedicated efforts to developing holistic, culturally responsive, accessible, and effective interventions that meet the needs of the child and parents have never been more needed. Methods: Papers highlighting the role of pediatric psychology in working with parents while also emphasizing issues of diversity, equity, inclusion and access in screening and interventions were solicited and considered for this issue. Results: This Special Issue includes 11 articles highlighting efforts to (a) support parents' unmet needs in medical subspecialty settings, (b) utilize a diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) framework to develop and adapt interventions specifically designed to support these populations;and (c) improve access to behavioral health for vulnerable populations through different modes of care. This issue also includes a commentary outlining advocacy actions which can be taken by pediatric psychologists working with the families of transgender and gender diverse youth, with implications for advocating across populations. Conclusions: This issue highlights opportunities for pediatric psychologists to collectively and individually better support families and close health equity gaps through clinical and research avenues, as well as through opportunities for advocacy.

"The effects of type III traumatic stressors of the protracted conflict and prolonged COVID-19 on Syrians internally displaced: A validation study of type III continuous traumatic stressors and their impact","This study aimed to validate the Type III continuous traumatic stress model assumptions and use it to assess the effect of intersected traumas of civil war and COVID-19 stressors on internally displaced Syrian people. We recruited 891 Syrians from camps (46.5% females, aged 18-90 years [M = 30.81, SD = 12.04]). We measured COVID-19 stressors, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), complex PTSD (CPTSD), depression, anxiety, and executive functions to assess the variables related to peri-post Type III mental health syndrome. We measured Type I, II, and III traumas and Type III trauma subtypes. To explore the significance of differences between correlation sizes and the comparative severity of each trauma type, we calculated Fisher z scores. We performed path analysis with trauma Types III and II as correlated independent variables and COVID-19 stressors' impact on peri-post Type III trauma mental health syndrome to check their proliferation and impact. Of the sample, COVID-19 had infected 45.9%, 33.1% fit the diagnostic criteria for CPTSD, and 13.9% fit the diagnostic criteria for PTSD. All trauma types were associated with mental health, cognitive deficits, and COVID-19 severity, with a significantly higher association with trauma Type III. Type III-a subtype (intersected discrimination) had the highest associations with each variable. Type III was bidirectionally correlated with Type II and proliferated to Type I traumas (single past events) and COVID-19 stressors, with Type III having a larger effect size on peri-post Type III trauma mental health syndrome. The clinical and conceptual implications of the findings are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement This study helps understand the intersection between intergroup conflicts and intersected discrimination with COVID-19 pandemic stressors that amplifies its impact on mental health and cognitive functioning in Syrian internally displaced people. This study addresses the United Nations sustainable development goals of empowering and promoting the social, economic, and political inclusion of all, irrespective of age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic, or other status by unpacking some of the powerful mechanisms behind intergroup conflicts and intersected discrimination interfaced with COVID-19. This study validates the continuous stress Type III trauma framework and proposes corrective and treatment strategies that address inequalities and discrimination and their impact.

"Can a new role, the (Trainee) Associate Psychological Practitioner (T/APP), add value in General Practice? Results from the pilot year evaluation","Background:The deployment of (Trainee) Associate Psychological Practitioners (T/APPs) to deliver brief psychological interventions focusing on preventing mental health deterioration and promoting emotional wellbeing in General Practice settings is a novel development in the North West of England. As the need and demand for psychological practitioners increases, new workforce supply routes are required to meet this growth.Aims:To evaluate the clinical impact and efficacy of the mental health prevention and promotion service, provided by the T/APPs and the acceptability of the role from the perspective of the workforce and the role to T/APPs, patients and services.Methods:A mixed-methods design was used. To evaluate clinical outcomes, patients completed measures of wellbeing (WEMWBS), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7) and resilience (BRS) at the first session, final session and at a 4â€“6 week follow-up. Paired-samples t-tests were conducted comparing scores from session 1 and session 4, and session 1 and follow-up for each of the four outcome measures. To evaluate acceptability, questionnaires were sent to General Practice staff, T/APPs and patients to gather qualitative and quantitative feedback on their views of the T/APP role. Quantitative responses were collated and summarised. Qualitative responses were analysed using inductive summative content analysis to identify themes.Results:T-test analysis revealed clinically and statistically significant reductions in depression and anxiety and elevations in wellbeing and resiliency between session 1 and session 4, and at follow-up. Moderateâ€“large effect sizes were recorded. Acceptability of the T/APP role was established across General Practice staff, T/APPs and patients. Content analysis revealed two main themes: positive feedback and constructive feedback. Positive sub-themes included accessibility of support, type of support, patient benefit and primary care network benefit. Constructive sub-themes included integration of the role and limitations to the support.Conclusions:The introduction of T/APPs into General Practice settings to deliver brief mental health prevention and promotion interventions is both clinically effective and acceptable to patients, General Practice staff and psychology graduates.","Budd, Miranda, Gardner, Rebecca, Bhutani, Gita, Gardner, Kathryn, Iqbal, Ameera, Harding, Charlotte, Baguley, Clare, Chauhan, Umesh","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1463423622000482","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Primary Health Care Research & Development; 23, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-18","",39378,""

"Domestic violence, analysis of the violent bond in the test of confinement","Aim: The aim of this article is to present the preliminary results of a multidisciplinary research project, which focuses on the potential effects of lock-down on intra-family and domestic violence. More specifically, it is a question of considering the effects of confinement on the precipitation of the violent marital bond, in order to consider the difficulties and levers identified by the perpetrators as well as the victims to get out of the violent circularity. Method: Questionnaires were widely distributed on social networks. Some are intended for perpetrators, others for victims. All question the evolution of the marital bond in the test of lock-down and the way in which the subject positions himself in the couple relationship. Interview grids have also been developed. Perpetrators and victims of domestic violence were therefore able to be met in the context of semi-structured interviews aimed at evaluating the impact of confinement on the dynamics of the violent bond between the two partners. Results: The first trends indicate a magnifying effect on the effects of influence in the couple, increasing the expression of violence, whether pre-existing to the lock-down, or revealed by them. The hold in the relationship and the attempt to master the other are, it would seem, to be read from the angle of a counterbalancing of the experience of passivity linked to the fact of feeling ""locked in"", subject to constraints. imposed spaces. The resources to get out of this violent circle and the process of constraint, do not seem to be able to be mobilized, as if lock-down removed any possibility of seizing the levers likely to stop the violent process.

"Integrated primary mental health care in rural and remote contexts: The Australian experience","There is a growing burden of disease nationally and internationally from mental illness, both as a stand-alone problem and also comorbid with the growing epidemic of chronic, non-communicable diseases. The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 and ongoing climate change sequelae have exacerbated these mental health risks exponentially, creating massive service delivery dilemmas globally. In many countries, people in regional and particularly rural and remote areas, bear a greater disease burden from mental health conditions, due largely to the unique stressors inherent in rural life and inequitable access to appropriate services. This chapter canvases these issues and includes a brief discussion of optimally integrated care, risk factors and needs specific to rural people, the impact of Indigeneity, the role of socioeconomic factors in general and mental health, and inequity of access to primary mental healthcare services. These factors are illustrated by focusing on Australia as a case study, exemplifying both generic characteristics and those unique to that country that are relevant to service delivery in rural areas. The chapter was accepted for publication prior to Australia's worst bushfires on record (in the summer of 2019-2020), subsequent floods in early 2020, and the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic in February-March 2020 (ongoing). Most of the highlighted factors, however, remain the same -albeit greatly exacerbated by these extraordinary events. Information is provided in relation to the distribution of four relevant mental health specialties, with recommendations made-specific to Australia and also in the global context-with regard to optimally integrated primary mental health care.Across the settled world, there is a huge need to systematically roll-out integrated mental health services, using a number of modalities, to meet rural need. It is recommended that changes include: interprofessional education to facilitate team-based care;co-location of multidisciplinary primary healthcare teams;development and integration of culturally appropriate health services for Indigenous clients;mapping of required services in regional, rural, and remote areas;and optimal and strategic use of available funding and telehealth options. It is also strongly recommended that integration of lifestyle interventions be included in all mental health treatment, to facilitate optimal outcomes. These initiatives are now particularly pertinent, given the post-COVID ""mental health pandemic"" predicted by health experts globally.

"The Role of Emotion Regulation in Mental Health during the COVID-19 Outbreak: A 10-Wave Longitudinal Study","The COVID-19 pandemic elicited a lot of concerns among citizens, thereby potentially compromising their well-being. This study sought to examine the role of individuals' emotion regulation styles (i.e., emotional dysregulation, emotional suppression, and emotional integration) in handling these concerns and their experiences of well-being (i.e., satisfaction with life and sleep quality) and ill-being (i.e., anxiety and depressive symptoms). The study had a unique 10-wave longitudinal design (N = 986; M<sub>age</sub> = 41.28; 76% female) and was conducted during the outbreak of the pandemic in March-May 2020. Multilevel analyses showed, first, that weekly variation in COVID-19 related concerns related negatively to weekly variation in well-being and positively to weekly variation in ill-being. Second, at the between-person level, emotional dysregulation and suppression related positively to between-person vulnerability in ill-being and lower well-being (across all waves). Third, between-person differences in emotional dysregulation amplified the strength of the within-person association between concerns and depressive complaints and lowered life satisfaction. Unexpectedly, integrative emotion regulation amplified the strength of the within-person association between concerns and anxiety. The discussion focuses on the critical role of emotion regulation in handling the uncertainty elicited by the pandemic and provides directions for further research.

"Caring texts, a strength-based, suicide prevention trial in 5 native communities: Research design and methods","Despite their intrinsic strengths and resilience, some American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities experience among the highest rates of suicide of any racial and ethnic group. Caring Contacts is one of the only interventions shown to reduce suicide in clinical trials, but it has not been tested in AI/AN settings. To compare the effectiveness of Enhanced Usual Care (control) to Enhanced Usual Care augmented with a culturally adapted version of Caring Contacts (intervention) for reducing suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide-related hospitalizations. We are implementing a single blind randomized controlled trial of Caring Contacts in five AI/AN communities across the country (South Dakota, Montana, Oklahoma, and Alaska). Eligible participants have to be (1) actively suicidal or have made a suicide attempt within the past year; (2) at least 18Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years of age; (3) AI/AN; (4) able to speak and read English; (5) able to participate voluntarily; (6) willing to be contacted by text, email or postal mail; and (7) able to provide consent. Following consent and baseline assessment, participants are randomized to receive either Enhanced Usual Care alone, or Enhanced Usual Care with 12Ã¢â‚¬Â¯months (25 messages) of culturally adapted Caring Contacts. Follow-up assessments are conducted at 12 and 18Ã¢â‚¬Â¯months. If effective, this study of Caring Contacts will inform programs to reduce suicide in the study communities as well as inform future research on Caring Contacts in other tribal settings.

"Maternal and Neonatal Outcomes Associated with Mild COVID-19 Infection in an Obstetric Cohort in Brazil","Previous coronavirus epidemics were associated with increased maternal morbidity, mortality, and adverse obstetric outcomes. Reports for SARS-CoV-2 indicate that the obstetric population is at increased risk for severe illness, although there are still limited data on mild COVID-19 infection during pregnancy. To determine the association between mild COVID-19 infection during pregnancy, and maternal and neonatal outcomes, we performed a prospective cohort study among pregnant women with COVID-19 and a control group. Postnatal depressive symptoms were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. We recruited 84 pregnant women with mild COVID-19 and 88 pregnant women without COVID-19. All participants were unvaccinated. The most common acute COVID-19 symptoms were headache (82.1%), loss of smell (81%), and asthenia (77.4%). The median duration of long COVID symptoms was 60 days (interquartile range, 130). Pregnant women with a COVID-19 diagnosis were at greater risk for obstetric ultrasound abnormalities-mainly, fetal growth restriction (relative risk [RR], 12.40; 95% CI, 1.66-92.5), premature birth (RR, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.07-6.43), and postpartum depression (RR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.24-4.21). Our results alert clinicians to the consequences of COVID-19 during pregnancy, even in mild cases, given the increased risk of ultrasound abnormalities, premature birth, long COVID symptoms, and postpartum depression. National guidelines on preventive measures and treatments should be based on scientific evidence, including attention to the impact on health and family needs during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Santos, Fonseca Filho, Alves, Macedo, Pontes, Paula, Barreto, Zeneide, Nery, Freitas, D'Souza-Li","https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.22-0421","20221017","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-18","",39384,""

"Identifying correlates of suicide ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional analysis of 148 sociodemographic and pandemic-specific factors","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created a global health crisis, with disproportionate effects on vulnerable sociodemographic groups. Although the pandemic is showing potential to increase suicide ideation (SI), we know little about which sociodemographic characteristics or COVID-19 experiences are associated with SI. Our United States-based sample (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 837 adults [mean ageÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 37.1 years]) completed an online survey during August-September 2020. The study utilized an online convenience sample from a prior study, which was enriched for exposure to trauma and experiences of posttraumatic stress symptoms. We assessed SI using the Beck Depression Inventory-II. Traditional (i.e., logistic regression) and machine learning (i.e., LASSO, random forest) methods evaluated associations of 148 self-reported COVID-19 factors and sociodemographic characteristics with current SI. 234 participants (28.0%) reported SI. Twenty items were significantly associated with SI from logistic regression. Of these 20 items, LASSO identified seven sociodemographic characteristics (younger age, lower income, single relationship status, sexual orientation other than heterosexual as well as specifically identifying as bisexual, non-full-time employment, and living in a town) and six COVID-19 factors (not engaging in protective COVID-19 behaviors, receiving mental health treatment (medication and/or psychotherapy) due to the COVID-19 pandemic, socializing during the pandemic, losing one's job due to COVID-19, having a friend with COVID-19, and having an acquaintance with COVID-19) associated with SI. Random forest findings were largely consistent with LASSO. These findings may inform multidisciplinary research and intervention work focused on understanding and preventing adverse mental health outcomes such as SI during and in the aftermath of the pandemic.","Dolsen, Nishimi, LeWinn, Byers, Tripp, Woodward, Khan, Marx, Borsari, Jiha, Neylan, O'Donovan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.10.009","20221017","Covid-19; Depression; Machine learning; Posttraumatic stress disorder; Suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-18","",39386,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Associated Control Measures on the Mental Health of the General Population : A Systematic Review and Dose-Response Meta-analysis","To what extent the COVID-19 pandemic and its containment measures influenced mental health in the general population is still unclear. To assess the trajectory of mental health symptoms during the first year of the pandemic and examine dose-response relations with characteristics of the pandemic and its containment. Relevant articles were identified from the living evidence database of the COVID-19 Open Access Project, which indexes COVID-19-related publications from MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase via Ovid, and PsycInfo. Preprint publications were not considered. Longitudinal studies that reported data on the general population's mental health using validated scales and that were published before 31 March 2021 were eligible. An international crowd of 109 trained reviewers screened references and extracted study characteristics, participant characteristics, and symptom scores at each timepoint. Data were also included for the following country-specific variables: days since the first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the stringency of governmental containment measures, and the cumulative numbers of cases and deaths. In a total of 43 studies (331Ã‚Â 628 participants), changes in symptoms of psychological distress, sleep disturbances, and mental well-being varied substantially across studies. On average, depression and anxiety symptoms worsened in the first 2 months of the pandemic (standardized mean difference at 60 days, -0.39 [95% credible interval, -0.76 to -0.03]); thereafter, the trajectories were heterogeneous. There was a linear association of worsening depression and anxiety with increasing numbers of reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and increasing stringency in governmental measures. Gender, age, country, deprivation, inequalities, risk of bias, and study design did not modify these associations. The certainty of the evidence was low because of the high risk of bias in included studies and the large amount of heterogeneity. Stringency measures and surges in cases were strongly correlated and changed over time. The observed associations should not be interpreted as causal relationships. Although an initial increase in average symptoms of depression and anxiety and an association between higher numbers of reported cases and more stringent measures were found, changes in mental health symptoms varied substantially across studies after the first 2 months of the pandemic. This suggests that different populations responded differently to the psychological stress generated by the pandemic and its containment measures. Swiss National Science Foundation.

"Change in Substance Use and the Effects of Social Distancing on Health-Related Quality of Life and Depressive Symptoms During the COVID-19 Pandemic in People Living With and Without HIV","Little is known about the impact of social distancing on health-related quality of life and depressive symptoms in older people with HIV during the COVID-19 pandemic. HIV-positive and HIV-negative AGEhIV Cohort Study participants. In September-November 2020, participants completed questionnaires on social distancing, change in substance use, health-related quality of life (EQ-6D, including EQ-VAS), and depressive symptoms (PHQ-9). Associations between social distancing and (1) EQ-VAS or (2) PHQ-9 score Ã¢â€°Â¥10 (clinically relevant depressive symptoms) were analyzed using fractional and binomial logistic regression, respectively. Two hundred fourteen HIV-positive and 285 HIV-negative participants were analyzed. 77.4% found social distancing important and 66.9% reported good adherence to these measures, without significant differences between HIV-positive and HIV-negative participants. In both groups, &lt;5% reported increased smoking or recreational drug use, but more HIV-positive (12.2%) than HIV-negative (4.9%) participants (P = 0.005) reported increased/more frequent alcohol use. Median EQ-VAS was slightly lower in HIV-positive (80 IQR = 73-90) than HIV-negative (84 IQR = 75-90) participants (P = 0.041). The prevalence of clinically relevant depressive symptoms was similar (HIV-positive, 8.4% and HIV-negative, 8.8%). Worrying about contracting COVID-19 and having Ã¢â€°Â¥3 (vs no) comorbidities were associated with lower EQ-VAS and finding social distancing easy with higher EQ-VAS. Worrying about contracting COVID-19 and younger than 60 years (vs Ã¢â€°Â¥65) were associated with higher odds of clinically relevant depressive symptoms. HIV status was associated with neither outcome. Initially during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands, a similar majority of HIV-positive and HIV-negative participants reported adhering to social distancing. Irrespective of HIV status, concerns about contracting COVID-19 negatively affected participants' perceived current health and increased risk of depressive symptoms.","Schaaf, Verburgh, Boyd, Wit, Nieuwkerk, Schim van der Loeff, Reiss","https://doi.org/10.1097/QAI.0000000000003055","20221017","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-18","",39388,""
"Early Learning from a Low-Resource COVID-Response Virtual Mental Health Crisis Ward: A Mixed Methods Study","The COVID-19 pandemic saw the accelerated uptake of virtual care and a proliferation of virtual ward models as alternatives to facility-based care. Early in the pandemic, our program implemented a virtual mental health crisis ward (vWard) to provide options for individuals needing intense psychiatric and/or crisis support but who preferred to remain in community and were safe to do so. This study aimed to identify early learnings from the vWard implemented rapidly in a resource constrained environment, to inform the future state should it be sustained beyond the pandemic. Mixed methods of data collection were used to evaluate provider perspectives on the vWard, develop archetypes for individuals who are a good fit for the vWard model, and create a driver diagram. Data sources included an anonymous survey of clinical and managerial staff involved in the vWard, a service planning workshop, and analysis of program discharge forms for all individuals admitted between March 2020 and April 2021. Survey responses were coded for themes under categories of ""Benefits"" and ""Challenges."" Discharge forms where the team indicated that the vWard was a good fit for an individual, were examined for characteristics common to these admissions. These findings were reviewed in the service planning workshop and refined with input from the participants into patient archetypes. A driver diagram was created for the future state. Survey respondents (N=60) represented diverse roles in crisis services and the vWard team. Ten providers took part in the service planning workshop. A total of 467 discharge forms were reviewed. The vWard was felt to be a model that worked by 39 survey respondents, 1 felt it did not work, and the remaining had no response. A number of benefits for the individual and the system were identified, alongside challenges - some process and material related to the nature of rapid implementation during the pandemic, and others due to lack of fit for certain individuals. The model was felt to a good fit for 67.5% of admissions. Four patient archetypes representing good fit with the model were developed. The driver diagram connected the program aim with primary drivers - (1) reduce barriers to care, (2) improve outcomes, and (3) provide collaborative, patient- and family-centered care - linked to secondary drivers and interventions that leveraged virtual technology among other crisis care interventions. Despite some challenges, the vWard demonstrated high levels of provider acceptance and a range of mechanisms by which the model works for a variety of patient archetypes. These early learnings provide a foundation for growth, sustainability and spread going forward beyond the pandemic.","Lee, Bolton, Shterenberg, Bolton, Hensel","https://doi.org/10.2196/39861","20221017","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-18","",39389,""
"Coping during the COVID-19 pandemic among young adults experiencing homelessness and unstable housing: A qualitative study","Young adults experiencing homelessness (YAEH) experience more stressors compared to housed peers, yet little is known about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these youth. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore how YAEH perceived the pandemic's impact on their well-being and coping. YAEH were recruited from those participating in an HIV prevention study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted and analysis was guided by Lazarus and Folkman's transactional theory of stress and coping. Four major themes were identified from interviews with 40 youth: (1) ongoing harms, (2) COVID-19 as a stressor, (3) mental health impacts, and (4) coping strategies. Participants described unmet basic needs, emotions of frustration and anxiety, and several coping strategies including substance use. Many YAEH reported experiencing continued challenges that were compounded by the stressors related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Special considerations are needed to address pandemic-related exacerbations of mental health symptoms and substance use among YAEH.","Gibbs, Jones, LaMark, Abdulmooti, Bretz, Kearney, Narendorf, Santa Maria","https://doi.org/10.1111/phn.13136","20221017","COVID-19; mental health; substance use; young adults; youth experiencing homelessness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-18","",39390,""
"Exacerbation of household food insecurity among low-income families in Hong Kong during the COVID-19 pandemic","The economic depression and reduced physical mobility associated with COVID-19 potentially affected the food security status of the poor. This study aimedÃ‚Â to assess the possible worsening of perceived food insecurity among low-income families in Hong Kong. Families either receiving government subsidies or living in a subdivided flat referred by local non-governmental organisations were invited to participate in a telephone survey. Food security status before (by recalling) and during the pandemic were assessed using Household Food Insecurity Access Scale. Chi-square analysis and ANOVA were used to test the difference between the percentage of participants who responded affirmatively to survey questions and various categories of food insecurity. Paired t-test was used to examine the reported change in food insecurity score before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Association between socio-demographic factors and change in food insecurity score was then assessed by multiple linear regression using backward stepwise elimination. Findings from the 212 households revealed that, for all nine questions concerning food insecurity, there wasÃ‚Â a significantly higher percentage of affirmative responses during versus before the pandemic. The proportion of food-secure households dropped from 16.5% to 7.1% amidst the pandemic. By contrast, households with severe food insecurity increased from 19.3% to 33.5%. Regression analysis showed that those households who were living in subdivided flats and with high monthly housing expenses, were likely to experience an exacerbation of food insecurity. Meanwhile, households with divorced parents (probably due to consistent social subsidy) and high household incomes, showed resilience toward food insecurity. Concurrently, about one fifth of children in these households had an experience of starvation for a whole day due to financial constraints. The exacerbation of food insecurity among low-income families during the COVID-19 pandemic necessitates timely assessments and the implementation of appropriate measures to prevent them from experiencing physiological harm. These initiatives can be guided by the identified at-risk socio-economic characteristics in the present study.","Yung, Tsang, Tam","https://doi.org/10.1111/1747-0080.12782","20221017","COVID-19; food security; low-income families; undernutrition","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-18","",39391,""

"What happened to the predicted COVID-19-induced suicide epidemic, and why?","TwoÃ¢â‚¬â€°years ago, in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, there were widespread and grim predictions of an ensuing suicide epidemic. Not only has this not happened but also by the end of 2021 in the majority of countries and regions with available data, the suicide rates had, if anything, declined. We discuss four reasons why the predictions of suicide models were exaggerated: (1) government intervention reduced the economic and mental costs of lockdowns, (2) the pandemic itself and lockdowns had less of an effect on mental health than assumed, (3) the evidence for a link between economic downturns, distress and suicide is weaker and less consistent than the models assumed and (4) predicting suicide is generally hard. Predictive models have an important place, but their strong modelling assumptions need to acknowledge the inherent high degree of uncertainty which has been further augmented by behavioural responses of pandemic management.","Glozier, Morris, Schurer","https://doi.org/10.1177/00048674221131500","20221017","COVID-19; Suicide; prediction; unemployment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-18","",39393,""
"Prevalence and risk factors of sleep problems in Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review and meta-analysis","The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has altered people's lives worldwide and fostered the emergence of sleep problems. However, no systematic review and meta-analysis has yet been conducted to rigorously evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on sleep problems from a Bangladeshi perspective. As a result, the current systematic review and meta-analysis aims to fill this knowledge gap, which may lead to a better understanding of the prevalence and risk factors associated with sleep problems. To conduct this systematic review<b>,</b> PRISMA guidelines were followed; a literature search was conducted to include studies published till 5th March 2022 from the inception of COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh searching databases such as PubMed, Scopus. A total of eleven studies were included. The JBI checklist was used to assess the methodological quality of included studies. The overall estimated prevalence of sleep problems was 45% (95% CI: 32% to 58%, I<sup>2</sup> =99.31%). General populations were more affected by sleep problems [52% (95% CI: 36% to 68%, I<sup>2</sup> =98.92%)] than the healthcare professionals [51% (95% CI: 23% to 79%, I<sup>2</sup> =97.99%)] (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 137.05, <i>p</i> &lt;0.001).

"The corona blues according to daily life changes by COVID-19: A partial least squares regression model","This study identifies determinants of the variation in depression resulting from COVID-19, specifies in detail the changes to daily life, and then compares the determinants' magnitude. The determinants were combined into three groups: first, the unpredictability of the disease and side effects by its response measures (specifically, restrictions on the freedom of movement and strain on social relationships); second, (mis)information through social media, public authorities, and mass media; and third, income reductions and other sociodemographic factors. Daily life changes were divided into four categories: travel/mobility, time at home (alone and with family), domestic activities (remote work, online shopping, food deliveries, reading, and online networking), and conflicts (with family and neighbors). We measured the total 29 predictors using data from the 2020 Seoul Survey, which is based on face-to-face interviews with a probability sample of adult residents. We made our estimations using partial least squares regression, which can analyze all original variables regardless of collinearity. The regression model found that major stressors include declines in out-of-home offline networking and the rise of domestic activities-and subsequent conflicts with family-restrictions on mobility (specifically, those of leisure travel), and income reductions. In contrast, changes to working and shopping (to remote work and online shopping) rather than leisure increased uses of private transportation modes. Moreover, we found influences of all forms of communications and media to be insignificant.

"From Diagnosis to Therapy: The Role of Virtual and Augmented Reality in Orthopaedic Trauma Surgery","By reducing procedure-related problems, advancements in computer-assisted surgery (CAS) and surgical training aim to boost operative precision and enhance patient safety. Orthopaedic training and practice have started to change as a result of the incorporation of reality technologies like virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) into CAS. Today's trainees can engage in realistic and highly involved operational simulations without supervision. With the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there is a greater need for breakthrough technology adoption. VR is an interactive technology that enables personalised care and could support successful patient-centered rehabilitation. It is a valid and trustworthy evaluation method for determining joint range of motion, function, and balance in physical rehabilitation. It may make it possible to customise care, encourage patients, boost compliance, and track their advancement. AR supplementation in orthopaedic surgery has shown promising results in pre-clinical settings, with improvements in surgical accuracy and reproducibility, decreased operating times, and less radiation exposure.Ã‚Â As little patient observation is needed, this may lessen the workload clinicians must bear. The ability to use it for home-based therapy is often available commercially as well. The objectives of this review are to evaluate the technology available, comprehend the available evidence regarding the benefit, and take into account implementation problems in clinical practice. The use of this technology, its practical and moral ramifications, and how it will affect orthopaedic doctors and their patients are also covered. This review offers a current and thorough analysis of the reality technologies and their uses in orthopaedic surgery.","Gupta, Ambade","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.29099","20221017","augmented reality; orthopaedic trauma surgery; rehabilitation; technology; virtual reality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-18","",39396,""

We aimed to understand how HCWs and key personnel working in healthcare settings in Melbourne, Australia perceived their employing organizations' responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. In this qualitative study, conducted May-July 2021 as part of the longitudinal Coronavirus in Victorian Healthcare and Aged Care Workers (COVIC-HA) study, we purposively sampled and interviewed HCWs and key personnel from healthcare organizations across hospital, ambulance, aged care and primary care (general practice) settings. We also examined HCWs' free-text responses to a question about organizational resources and/or supports from the COVIC-HA Study's baseline survey. We thematically analyzed data using an iterative process. We analyzed data from interviews with 28 HCWs and 21 key personnel and free-text responses from 365 HCWs, yielding three major themes: <i>navigating a changing and uncertain environment, maintaining service delivery during a pandemic</i>, and <i>meeting the safety and psychological needs of staff</i> . HCWs valued organizational efforts to engage openly and honesty with staff, and proactive responses such as strategies to enhance workplace safety (e.g., personal protective equipment spotters). Suggestions for improvement identified in the themes included streamlined information processes, greater involvement of HCWs in decision-making, increased investment in staff wellbeing initiatives and sustainable approaches to strengthen the healthcare workforce. This study provides in-depth insights into the challenges and successes of organizational responses across four healthcare settings in the uncertain environment of a pandemic. Future efforts to mitigate the impact of acute stressors on HCWs should include a strong focus on bidirectional communication, effective and realistic strategies to strengthen and sustain the healthcare workforce, and greater investment in flexible and meaningful psychological support and wellbeing initiatives for HCWs.","McGuinness, Josphin, Eades, Clifford, Fisher, Kirkman, Russell, Hodgson, Kelsall, Lane, Skouteris, Smith, Leder","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.965664","20221017","COVID-19; healthcare workers; mental health; occupational health; pandemic; perceptions; workplace responses","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-18","",39398,""
"The influence of college students' academic stressors on mental health during COVID-19: The mediating effect of social support, social well-being, and self-identity","COVID-19 caused harmful mental consequences to the public, and mental health problems were very common among college students during the outbreak of COVID-19. Academic stressors were the main stress for college students, and social support, social well-being, and self-identity were widely known as protective factors for mental health. Therefore, the study aimed to investigate the influence of academic stressors on mental health and the mediating effect of social support, social well-being, and self-identity among college students during the outbreak of COVID-19. With 900 college students as subjects, using the college students' academic stressors questionnaire, social support questionnaire, social well-being scale, self-identity scale, and depression anxiety stress scales (DASS-21), the results showed that: (1) academic stressors had a significantly negative correlation with social support, social well-being, and self-identity while having a significantly positive correlation with mental health; (2) academic stressors could positively predict mental health; (3) this effect was mediated by social support, social well-being, and self-identity; (4) work stressor was an important stressor during COVID-19, and had the same role as academic stressors in the structural equation model. The results of this study suggested that adjusting the academic stressors or work stressors of college students and enhancing social support could improve social well-being and self-identity, and might effectively protect their mental health under the COVID-19 pandemic environment.","Li, Yang, Zhou, Zhao, Liu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.917581","20221017","academic stressors; mental health; self-identity; social support; social well-being; work stressor","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-18","",39399,""

Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis. Two-thirds of providers were female, with a median age of 33 years, and provided direct services to Latinx clients and had extensive experience working with immigrant families, particularly in Massachusetts. Key themes identified describing the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health needs of Latinx families included: (1) exacerbation of mental health symptoms, (2) financial stressors, (3) preoccupation regarding transnational lives, (4) secondary needs becoming more salient, and (5) immigration status as a main driver of inequality. Our findings highlight the importance of focusing on the mental health needs of Latinx immigrants and ensuring their access to mental health services.

"Do patients with and survivors of COVID-19 benefit from telerehabilitation? A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) significantly impacts physical, psychological, and social functioning and reduces quality of life, which may persist for at least 6 months. Given the fact that COVID-19 is a highly infectious disease and therefore healthcare facilities may be sources of contagion, new methods avoiding face-to-face contact between healthcare workers and patients are urgently needed. Telerehabilitation is the provision of rehabilitation services to patients at a distance <i>via</i> information and communication technologies. However, high-quality evidence of the efficacy of telerehabilitation for COVID-19 is still lacking. This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the efficacy of telerehabilitation for patients with and survivors of COVID-19. We searched the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Medline (<i>via</i> PubMed), PEDro, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from January 1st, 2020 to April 30th, 2022 for randomized controlled trials published in English, which aimed to evaluate the efficacy of telerehabilitation vs. face-to-face rehabilitation, usual care, or no treatment for COVID-19. Methodological quality and overall evidence quality of the included studies were assessed. The statistical reliability of the data was quantified using the trial sequential analysis. Seven randomized controlled trials with eight comparisons were included and all of them were used for meta-analysis. The meta-analyses of absolute values showed the superiority of telerehabilitation over no treatment or usual care for dyspnea (Borg scale: mean difference = -1.88, -2.37 to -1.39; Multidimensional dyspnea-12: mean difference = -3.70, -5.93 to -1.48), limb muscle strength (mean difference = 3.29; 2.12 to 4.47), ambulation capacity (standardized mean difference = 0.88; 0.62 to 1.14), and depression (mean difference = -5.68; -8.62 to -2.74). Significant improvement in these variables persisted in the meta-analyses of change scores. No significant difference was found in anxiety and quality of life. No severe adverse events were reported in any of the included studies. Moderate- to very low-quality evidence demonstrates that telerehabilitation may be an effective and safe solution for patients with and survivors of COVID-19 in dyspnea, lower limb muscle strength, ambulation capacity, and depression. Further well-designed studies are required to evaluate the long-term effects, cost-effectiveness, and satisfaction in larger samples.","Huang, Fan, Zhao, Yang, Zhao, Chen, Yang, Wang, Qu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.954754","20221017","COVID-19; eHealth; meta-analysis; physical function; psychological function; telemedicine; telerehabilitation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-18","",39401,""
"Parental perspectives of home-schooling of children with special educational needs and disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic: a review","The purpose of this paper is to review recent literature on parental perspectives of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the home-schooling of children with special educational needs and disabilities, as well as to consider implications for their education and well-being. Eleven papers were reviewed, published between 2020 and 2021, selected according to a systematic protocol from three widely used online databases. Analysis of the reviewed papers found that transitioning to home-schooling during the pandemic had negative consequences for most of the children, as well as for their parents, though a small but significant number reported positive consequences. Three key areas of concern were identified in the analysis: balancing home-schooling with parent work activities; parent relationships with schools and support services and agencies and home-schooling effects on the well-being and mental health of parents and children.","Dobosz, Gierczyk, Hornby","https://doi.org/10.1111/1471-3802.12575","20221017","COVIDÃ¢â‚¬Â19; disabilities; homeÃ¢â‚¬Âschooling; parental perspectives; special educational needs","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-18","",39402,""
"Perceived stress of adolescents during the COVID-19 lockdown: Bayesian multilevel modeling of the Czech HBSC lockdown survey","Long-term isolation, including lockdowns and quarantines, may have a distressing effect on anyone experiencing it. Adolescent brain architecture is very sensitive to environmental adversities, and the mental health development of adolescents may be particularly vulnerable during the pandemic era. In order to better understand the triggers for perceived adolescent stress (PSS) during the COVID-19 lockdown, the present study aimed to assess the effects of social well-being and changes in time use during the lockdown, as well as the family COVID experience of adolescents. The sample for this study comprised <i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3,440 adolescents (54.2% girls; mean ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°13.5Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.6Ã¢â‚¬â€°years). Bayesian correlations between PSS, health and well-being variables were assessed. PSS was then modeled as an outcome variable in a series of nested Bayesian multilevel regression models. The negative impact of the COVID-19 lockdown was more apparent in girls. PSS was moderately correlated with adolescent health and well-being. The strongest predictor of higher level of PSS was frequent feeling of loneliness. On the contrary, lower level of PSS was most associated with having someone to talk to. Long-term social isolation of adolescents could be harmful to their mental health. Psychological coping strategies to prevent the consequences of social isolation and development of mental health problems should be promoted on the individual, family, and even community level.","Furstova, Kascakova, Sigmundova, Zidkova, Tavel, Badura","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.964313","20221017","Bayesian multilevel regression; COVID-19 lockdown; HBSC; adolescent; perceived stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-18","",39403,""
"Influence of anxiety on university students' academic involution behavior during COVID-19 pandemic: Mediating effect of cognitive closure needs","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant negative effect on university students' mental health worldwide. The pandemic has resulted in individuals experiencing increased levels of anxiety and stress as well as intensified concerns about the future due to a rise in uncertainty. To eliminate the anxiety and stress caused by uncertainty, individuals who have high cognitive closure needs are strongly motivated to achieve certainty and seek answers, even if the decisions they make in the process are inappropriate or even irrational. This study attempts to analyze the influence of anxiety and stress on university students' academic involution behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic through the mediating effect of the need for cognitive closure. Analyzing the survey data collected from 402 university students from 3 different universities through the mediating effect model and path analysis with latent variable (PA-LV), our results indicate that: (1) The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased the levels of anxiety and stress experienced by university students. The path coefficient of the perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 to perceived emotions (including anxiety and stress) was 0.352 (<i>p</i> &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01), (2) anxiety and stress significantly and positively affect academic involution behavior. For each unit of increase in the scores of anxiety and stress, the scores of academic involution behavior increased by 0.408 (<i>p</i> &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01) and 0.398 (<i>p</i> &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01) units, respectively, and (3) The need for cognitive closure had a complete and partial mediating effect on the relationship between the perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 and academic involution behavior, as well as anxiety and academic involution behavior, respectively. The results of PA-LV showed that the mediating effect values were 0.106 and 0.044, respectively. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has not yet come to an end and so clarifying the relationship between anxiety and academic involution behavior will assist university students to optimize the relationship in their own subjective situations, to establish good learning habits, and reduce psychological distress.","Yan, Zhang, Guo, Zeng","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1005708","20221017","COVID-19; academic involution behavior; anxiety; need for cognitive closure; perceived risk; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-18","",39404,""
"Tertiary students maintaining control over depression, anxiety, and stress during the pandemic-An emerging market perspective","The higher education sector was affected by this pandemic, managing enduring challenges since early 2020. Institutions of higher learning (IHL) are prepared to address unsurmountable challenges to ensure that students are not deceived and are being given the proper nurture, coupled with adherence to syllabuses. Simultaneously, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused unscrupulous pressure on students of these institutions. The psychological waves are creating mammoth consequences, affecting the beneficiaries of the higher education system and their families. In recent years, with limited studies on psychological impact among tertiary students on a cross-country basis, general self-efficacy, and the degree of coping strategies, we were motivated to investigate the degree of depression, anxiety, and stress (DAS), among this cohort of students encompassing the pre-university/Diploma, 1st-4th-year undergraduate, and postgraduate students from private universities in Malaysia, Indonesia, India, Southern Africa, and China, representing the emerging economies. A cross-sectional survey was conducted, followed by quantitative analysis. The objective of this study was to recognize whether there is a relationship between the psychological impact of DAS and the coping strategies adopted by the undergraduate students responding during the lockdown. The findings of this study revealed that with a sample size of 397, DAS lacked any severe impact on students across gender, country, household income, and level of education. DAS was established to be well managed with a coping strategy and self-efficacy established. This study resulted in a deeper understanding of DAS among undergraduates in emerging economies and their degree of coping behavior, providing a glimpse of the approach of millennials to handle DAS during the pandemic.","Ivascu, Arulanandam, Artene, Selvarajah, Ching, Ragunathan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.990192","20221017","anxiety; coping strategies; depression; higher education; self-efficacy; strategy; stress; student","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-18","",39405,""
"One uncertainty added on top of another: Challenges and resources of mothers of preterm infants during the COVID-19 pandemic","To qualitatively explore COVID-19-related experiences of mothers of preterm infants in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), the main challenges they face, and the resources available for them. The birth of a preterm infant is a stressful event under otherwise normal circumstances. The outbreak of COVID-19, the uncertainty about the virus and how it spreads, and the restrictions imposed, may have exacerbated the stress of caring for a preterm infant. Retrospective interviews. In-depth interviews with 12 mothers of preterm infants who were hospitalized in the NICU at the time of study. The interview addressed challenges and resources related to coping with the pandemic. The interviews were transcribed and content analyzed, based on Lieblich et al's model for narrative analysis. This research was conducted in accordance with the COREQ checklist. The overarching experience shared by all mothers was accumulative stress caused by a combination of factors related to the infant's health and COVID-19-related stressors. A central theme was the dissonance between the mothers' expectations from the birth and infant, and the reality they encountered. Other themes included fear of infecting the infant, loneliness, and stress caused by the restrictions that disrupted daily routines. Resources included a sense of shared fate regarding the pandemic, improvements in the infant's condition, religious faith, emotional support from the partner, and support from professional staff. Caring for a preterm infant during a pandemic is a challenging experience on many levels. The loss of significant support resources puts mothers of these infants at a higher risk for psychological distress. Awareness of mothers' accumulative stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic may assist the staff in developing procedures that can alleviate parental stress, for example by enabling mothers to connect to each other, giving clear information to compensate for physical and social distancing and providing professional mental health support.","Shoshi, Tuval-Mashiach, Bin Nun","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.968192","20221017","COVID-19; challenges; coping; mothers; neonatal intensive care unit; preterm (birth); resources; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-18","",39406,""
"Relationship Between Depression and Risky Alcohol Consumption in Women: the Mediating Role of Coping Styles and Age","Women are more likely to use alcohol as a coping strategy for psychological distress, with higher rates of comorbidity with depression being found in those with an alcohol use disorder. The objective of this study was to analyze changes in problematic alcohol consumption and depression during the COVID-19 lockdown, and to establish a predictive model based on age. A total of 1889 women aged 18-64Ã‚Â years (<i>M</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°36.14) participated. The Patient Health Questionnaire was applied for depression, the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Short Version for alcohol, and active and avoidant coping were considered. In the period prior to the pandemic, depression and avoidant coping were good predictors of alcohol consumption in women, regardless of age. During lockdown, this predictive capacity was only maintained in women aged 35-64Ã‚Â years. In the mediational models, differences were observed according to age. For women aged 18-34Ã‚Â years, depression was the predictor variable of problematic alcohol consumption, but for women aged 35-64Ã‚Â years it was the avoidant coping style, which is the predominant style in women of this age with clinical depression. The relevance of age in the combined treatments of depression and problematic alcohol consumption is highlighted, and training in active coping strategies is suggested.","Villanueva-Blasco, J, Villanueva-Silvestre, VÃƒÂ¡zquez-MartÃƒÂ­nez","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-022-00931-w","20221017","Age; Alcohol; Coping styles; Depression; Women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-18","",39407,""
"Profiles of emerging adults' resilience facing the negative impact of COVID-19 across six countries","Although emerging adults (i.e., individuals aged 18-29 years old) may be at a lesser risk of COVID-19 severe illness and mortality, studies have found that the negative impact of COVID-19 on mental health and well-being is higher among emerging adults when compared to other age groups. The current study aimed to identify profile(s) based on resilience resources, which could help emerging adults in managing the disruptions to their lives following the pandemic. A cross-national sample of 1,768 emerging adults from China, Italy, Lithuania, Portugal, Slovenia, and the US was utilized to identify profiles based on different resilience dimensions (ego-resiliency, positivity, religiosity, socioeconomic status, family support, peer support). Results of the Latent Profile Analysis suggest the presence of four different profiles: no resources, only peer, only family, and well-equipped. The association of these profiles with demographic variables, adulthood markers, self-perceived COVID-19 impact, present well-being, and future life perception was investigated. Implications for resilience theory as well as for future interventions are discussed.

"Effect of home training during the COVID-19 lockdown on physical performance and perceptual responses of team-sport athletes: a mini-review","This article aims to summarize the effects of home training performed during the COVID-19 lockdown on physical performance and perceptual responses among team-sport athletes. Studies with comparison of pre-post lockdown results of physical performance and perceptual responses were considered. A search was made in PubMed and SPORTDiscus databases. The PICO criteria were used for the keywords ""athlete"" AND ""home-based training"" AND ""performance"" OR ""mental health"", with their respective entry terms. The multistage process of selection followed the PRISMA 2020 recommendations. Of 586 records identified, 9 articles were available for the final process. Physical performance was evaluated for 8 studies with the VO<sub>2max</sub> change ranging from 5.7% to -9%; an increase in the duration of sprint test ranging from 0.4% to 36%; an increase of agility duration of 12.4%; a decrease in maximal repetition load of 2.9%; and changes in countermovement jump height ranging from -4.7% to +15.4% after home training. Regarding the perceptual responses, no significant changes in wellbeing and mental index and a significant decrease in motivation and perceived effort were reported during the home training in lockdown. Based on the articles selected, home training programmes performed by athletes from team sports during the COVID-19 lockdown presented inconsistent results in physical performance, decreasing by up to 36%, and maintaining the wellbeing and mental index, but with a significant drop in training motivation and perceived effort. Caution should be taken considering the small number of articles included in the study.","Paludo, Karpinski, Silva, KumstÃƒÂ¡t, SajdlovÃƒÂ¡, Milanovic","https://doi.org/10.5114/biolsport.2022.117040","20221017","Athletes; Home exercise; Mental health; Pandemic; Performance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-18","",39409,""
"Narratives of the worst experiences associated with peritraumatic distress during the COVID-19 pandemic: a mixed method study in the USA and Italy","<b>Background:</b> Although symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been associated with the COVID-19 pandemic experiences, no study has explored yet the association of specific COVID-19 narratives with peritraumatic distress, the precursor of PTSD. <b>Objective:</b> To explore the worst experiences associated with peritraumatic distress during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Method:</b> Adult residents (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1098), from the US (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°741) and Italy (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°357), completed an online survey including socio-demographic data, COVID-19-related experiences, the Peritraumatic Distress Inventory and an open question on their worst experiences during the first period of the COVID-19 pandemic (April-May 2020). A thematic content analysis (TCA) was conducted on the answers to the open question and a classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was used to identify the themes that best predicted the clinical levels of peritraumatic distress. <b>Results:</b> The main TCA themes related to participants' worst COVID-19 experiences were anxiety, threat, loss, anger, stress and constriction. Threat was the most prevalent theme and correlated with experiences such as being quarantined, being infected and a loved one receiving the diagnosis. US participants' descriptions of their worst experiences related more to life-threat and loss, while Italians reported more threat to the world, stress, social isolation, and feeling trapped. In the CART analysis, the main predictor (79.9%) was perceiving negative effects from the COVID-19 crisis. Among them, a COVID-related threat to self-experience was the most robust predictor. In its absence, being deprived of resources or experiencing high levels of anxiety were other robust predictors. <b>Conclusions:</b> The study provided evidence of the utility of a mixed-method approach in conceptualizing experiences associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the risk of traumatic symptoms. Its findings may inform healthcare interventions and policies for tackling the new challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>HIGHLIGHTS</b> Clinically significant levels of peritraumatic distress symptoms were prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic.Clinically significant levels of peritraumatic distress during the COVID-19 pandemic were related to experiences of life-threat, resource deprivation, and anxiety, cross-cutting the themes articulated by the thematic content analysis of anxiety, threat, loss, anger, stress and constriction.The US and Italian participants' descriptions of their worst experiences differed in subtle but important ways, with Americans reporting more life-threat and losses compared to Italians reporting more threat to the world, stress, social isolation, and feelings of being trapped. <b>Antecedentes:</b> Aunque los sÃƒÂ­ntomas del trastorno de estrÃƒÂ©s postraumÃƒÂ¡tico (TEPT) se han asociado con las experiencias de la pandemia de COVID-19, ningÃƒÂºn estudio ha explorado aÃƒÂºn la asociaciÃƒÂ³n de las narrativas especÃƒÂ­ficas de COVID-19 con el distres peritraumÃƒÂ¡tico, el precursor del TEPT.<b>Objetivo:</b> Explorar las peores experiencias asociadas al distres peritraumÃƒÂ¡tico durante la primera ola de la pandemia COVID-19.<b>MÃƒÂ©todo:</b> Adultos residentes (<i>N</i> = 1098), de los EE.UU. (<i>n</i> = 741) e Italia (<i>n</i> = 357), completaron una encuesta en lÃƒÂ­nea que incluÃƒÂ­a datos sociodemogrÃƒÂ¡ficos, experiencias relacionadas con la COVID-19, el Inventario de DistrÃƒÂ©s PeritraumÃƒÂ¡tico y una pregunta abierta sobre sus peores experiencias durante el primer perÃƒÂ­odo de la pandemia de la COVID-19 (abril-mayo de 2020). Se realizÃƒÂ³ un anÃƒÂ¡lisis de contenido temÃƒÂ¡tico (TCA, en sus siglas en inglÃƒÂ©s) sobre las respuestas a la pregunta abierta y se utilizÃƒÂ³ un anÃƒÂ¡lisis de ÃƒÂ¡rbol de clasificaciÃƒÂ³n y regresiÃƒÂ³n (CART, en sus siglas en inglÃƒÂ©s) para identificar los temas que mejor predecÃƒÂ­an los niveles clÃƒÂ­nicos de distres peritraumÃƒÂ¡tico.<b>Resultados:</b> Los principales temas del TCA relacionados con las peores experiencias de COVID-19 de los participantes fueron la ansiedad, la amenaza, la pÃƒÂ©rdida, la ira, el estrÃƒÂ©s y la constricciÃƒÂ³n. La amenaza fue el tema mÃƒÂ¡s prevalente y se correlacionÃƒÂ³ con experiencias como estar en cuarentena, estar infectado y que un ser querido recibiera el diagnÃƒÂ³stico. Las descripciones de los participantes estadounidenses de sus peores experiencias estaban mÃƒÂ¡s relacionadas con la amenaza a la vida y la pÃƒÂ©rdida, mientras que los italianos informaron mÃƒÂ¡s de la amenaza al mundo, el estrÃƒÂ©s, el aislamiento social y la sensaciÃƒÂ³n de estar atrapados. En el anÃƒÂ¡lisis CART, el principal predictor (79,9%) fue la percepciÃƒÂ³n de efectos negativos de la crisis COVID-19.

"Examining harmful impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and school closures on parents and carers in the United Kingdom: A rapid review","As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, school closures meant that for many households, home and school environments became intertwined. Parents and carers found themselves taking on the role as de-facto educators, as well as balancing working from home and caring for additional members of the household. Understanding the full extent of the effects incurred by parents and carers during school closures is vital to identifying and supporting vulnerable families. This rapid review aimed to appraise the available evidence on the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on UK parents and carers. Searches for academic literature were conducted using Proquest Central, Scopus, and Google Scholar between 21st and 28th April 2021 using search terms describing ""parents and carers"", ""COVID-19"" and the ""UK"". Additional literature was identified on relevant parents and carers' organisations websites including charity reports. Thirty-two articles were found relating to harms affecting parents and carers in the UK High levels of psychological distress, including anxiety and depression, were consistently identified in the general parent population, and especially in parents caring for a child with special educational needs and/or neurodevelopmental disorders (SEN/ND). Charity reports indicated that many parents, especially those from an ethnic minority background and kinship carers, were worse off financially and with food insecurities, whereas empirical evidence showed that mothers were more likely to initiate furlough for themselves compared with fathers or childless women. Domestic abuse support services also reported a sharp rise in demand during lockdown restrictions, and practitioners reported an increase in child and adolescent violence towards parents. Given the known impacts of parental stress, mental health problems, domestic violence and financial hardship on children's development, it is critical that these findings are taken into account in case of future pandemics to minimise harms both to parents and their families.","Christie, Hiscox, Halligan, Creswell","https://doi.org/10.1002/jcv2.12095","20221017","COVIDÃ¢â‚¬Â19; caregivers; families; mental health; parents; school closures; wellÃ¢â‚¬Âbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-18","",39411,""
"Health, well-being, and persisting symptoms in the pandemic: What is the role of psychological flexibility?","Finding psychological factors that can reduce the substantial impact of COVID-19 on mental and physical health is important. Here we replicate and expand a previous study regarding the role of psychological flexibility (PF) in this context. We employed a comprehensive and well validated measure of PF and examined its role in relation to health outcomes and persistent post COVID-19 symptoms. 1174 participants completed standardized measures of depression, anxiety, insomnia and the Multidimensional Psychological Flexibility Inventory (MPFI), and reported the presence of persistent symptoms associated with ""long COVID."" All PF and psychological inflexibility (PI) facets, except for acceptance, correlated with the three mental health outcomes and with persistent symptoms. PF and PI accounted for significant variance in depression, anxiety, and insomnia after adjusting for background and health status variables. A notable finding was the particularly stronger correlations obtained for the PI facets. Our findings emphasize the potentially mitigating effects of PF on mental ill health, as well as the particularly aggravating effects of PI, in the pandemic context. A novel finding is the significant association of PI with persisting symptoms of COVID.","McCracken, Buhrman, Badinlou, Brocki","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2022.10.003","20221017","Acceptance and commitment therapy; COVID-19; Long-COVID; MPFI; Pandemic; Psychological flexibility","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-18","",39412,""
"Coping styles mediate the association between psychological inflexibility and psychological functioning during the COVID-19 pandemic: A crucial role of meaning-centered coping","People's psychological response to the COVID-19 pandemic is significantly affected by their psychological inflexibility. One possible mechanism explaining the association between psychological inflexibility and psychological functioning concerns coping styles. While avoidance and approach coping styles were previously found to mediate this association, the mediating role of meaning-centered coping has not yet been explored. However, meaning-centered coping it is likely to be crucial in circumstances as uncertain as those at the onset of the COVID -19 pandemic. This study explored the mediating role of the three coping styles in the relationship of psychological inflexibility with ill-being and well-being. Slovenian adults (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1365) aged 18-81 years provided self-reports on the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, the PERMA Profiler, the Brief COPE Inventory, and the Meaning-Centered Coping Scale. In the context of the highly stressful beginning of the pandemic, psychological inflexibility contributed to higher ill-being and lower well-being directly and through increased use of avoidance coping, decreased use of meaning-centered coping, and, to a lesser extent, decreased use of approach coping. Avoidance coping predicted higher levels of ill-being, suggesting a maladaptive effect of this coping strategy. Approach coping positively but weakly predicted well-being, indicating a diminished value of this coping style in low-controllable circumstances of the pandemic. Finally, meaning-centered coping appeared to be the most beneficial in such circumstances, as it was associated with both lower levels of ill-being and higher levels of well-being. This finding suggests that meaning-centered coping should be studied as a stand-alone strategy, rather than as a combination of specific approach coping strategies. Consistent with previous research, this study demonstrates the importance of psychological inflexibility in effectively adapting to and actively coping with aversive situations. Furthermore, the results suggest that seeking or making meaning is vital, at least in a context characterized by low levels of control and high levels of uncertainty.","Avsec, Eisenback, Carreno, Kocjan, KavÃ„ÂiÃ„Â","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2022.10.001","20221017","Coping; Ill-being; Meaning-centered coping; Mediation; Psychological inflexibility; Well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-18","",39413,""
"Depressed mother penetrating her Baby's heart with a sewing needle during COVID-19 lockdown: A case report","The full lockdown was carried out in China as well as in other countries during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it proved to be effective in reducing the rate of transmission in the early stage of the pandemic. However, the negative effects of full lockdown on human mental health should be taken into consideration. During COVID-19 lockdown, a 3-month-old male infant was injured with a sewing needle penetrating into his heart by his mother with postpartum depression. The mother had a history of depression, and she reported depressive feelings during quarantine before injuring the infant. In addition, her own mother's health condition had worsened lately following long-term stroke sequelae. These factors may have contributed to her new depressive episode, which caused her to injure her baby with a threaded sewing needle with no witness. The injury was discovered the next day by the infant's paternal grandmother. The baby received an emergency sewing needle removal operation and recovered uneventfully. Special attention should be paid to persons with a high risk of mental disorder during this pandemic, in order to avoid devastating adverse events or deterioration of conditions for them and those around them.","Yang, Bai, Xiao, Deng, Wang, Luo, Huang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e10981","20221017","COVID-19; Case report; Depression; Heart; Mental health; Needle","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-18","",39414,""
"Coping during the COVID-19 pandemic: A mixed methods approach to understand how social factors influence coping ability","The COVID-19 pandemic and public health protection measures aimed at mitigating the transmission of the virus have both resulted in tremendous physical and mental health impacts. The study at hand used a gender-based analysis and social determinants of health approach to investigate which communities had trouble coping during times of strict protection measures and symptoms and strategies employed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were recruited from previously established cohorts as a part of the COVID-19 Rapid Evidence Study of a Provincial Population-Based Cohort for Gender and Sex (RESPPONSE) study. Being a young adult, female, woman, gender diverse, low-income earner or LGBTQ/2S+ was significantly associated with not being able to cope during the first wave of the pandemic. The effects for females, women, and gender diverse were attenuated yet still significant when controlling for various covariates. Those who reported not coping were more likely to present maladaptive coping symptoms and strategies. Our findings demonstrate the need to support marginalized communities in coping with the current ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and build proactive support for future pandemics.","Chankasingh, Booth, Albert, Kaida, Smith, Racey, Gottschlich, Murray, Sadarangani, Ogilvie, Galea, Brotto","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e10880","20221017","Adaptation; Coping; Gender identity; Mental health; Psychological; Social determinants of health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-18","",39415,""
"LW-CovidNet: Automatic covid-19 lung infection detection from chest X-ray images","Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) overtook the worldwide in early 2020, placing the world's health in threat. Automated lung infection detection using Chest X-ray images has a ton of potential for enhancing the traditional covid-19 treatment strategy. However, there are several challenges to detect infected regions from Chest X-ray images, including significant variance in infected features similar spatial characteristics, multi-scale variations in texture shapes and sizes of infected regions. Moreover, high parameters with transfer learning are also a constraints to deploy deep convolutional neural network(CNN) models in real time environment. A novel covid-19 lightweight CNN(LW-CovidNet) method is proposed to automatically detect covid-19 infected regions from Chest X-ray images to address these challenges. In our proposed hybrid method of integrating Standard and Depth-wise Separable convolutions are used to aggregate the high level features and also compensate the information loss by increasing the Receptive Field of the model. The detection boundaries of disease regions representations are then enhanced via an Edge-Attention method by applying heatmaps for accurate detection of disease regions. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed LW-CovidNet surpasses most cutting-edge detection methods and also contributes to the advancement of state-of-the-art performance. It is envisaged that with reliable accuracy, this method can be introduced for clinical practices in theÃ‚Â future.","Ahmed, Tan, Ma","https://doi.org/10.1049/ipr2.12637","20221017","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-18","",39416,""
"""<i>We left the crop there lying in the field</i>"": Agricultural worker experiences with the COVID-19 pandemic in a rural US-Mexico border region","California agricultural workers are predominately Latino/a, are medically underserved, and reside in larger households, placing them at elevating COVID-19 risk at work and at home. While some research has examined COVID-19 among agricultural workers in the interior of the United States, little research exists on experiences of COVID-19 along the US-Mexico border. Grounded in resilience thinking, this study aims to understand how agricultural workers navigated their heightened risk to COVID-19 at work and at home, and made use of available resources in a context of a bi-national community. Our study utilized qualitative interviews with 12 agricultural workers to understanding the COVID-19 experiences of resident and daily migrant agricultural workers in Imperial County, California, located along the US-Mexico border. Findings suggest that agricultural workers faced significant impacts and risks at work (work stoppages, stress about bringing COVID-19 home to family) and at home (contracting COVID-19, loss of friends and family, and mental health challenges). Agricultural workers and their employers often implemented COVID-19 precautions such as social distancing measures, personal protective equipment, hand washing and hand sanitizers, and isolation. Many agricultural workers did access testing resources on either side of the US-Mexico border and worked with US-based Spanish-speaking community-based organizations to register for vaccine appointments. To better support agricultural workers and their employers in the future, we recommend the following: 1. Prioritize agricultural workplace conditions to increase agricultural worker physical and mental health, 2. Extend public health services into agricultural work sites of transit and the workplace, and 3. Lastly, trusted Spanish-speaking community-based organizations can play a critical role in public health outreach.","Quandt, Keeney, Flores, Flores, VillaseÃƒÂ±or","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2022.09.039","20221017","Agricultural workers; COVID-19; Hispanic/latino; Qualitative inquiry; Resilience; US-Mexico","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-18","",39417,""
"Isolation, Loneliness and Aloneness in the Age of Covid-19: Reflections on Clinical Experiences","The Covid-19 pandemic brought a heightened fear of death and illness, and increased experiences of isolation, loneliness and aloneness. In this article we describe clinical experiences of psychotherapists in Argentina, the UK and Germany in order to explore how the impacts of the pandemic are variously felt and mediated by inner resources. We explore the capacity to relate internally to good experiences of infancy and a secure internal world, and the risks of loneliness, and interpersonal and intrapsychic withdrawal, that lead to vulnerability in patients and therapists. We contrast instances where psychotherapy in response to increased fears of death, infection and isolation is facilitative of change and growth, with situations where perverse, destructive or defensive relating predominate. We ask if we are witnessing and, through our therapeutic activities, contributing to the emergence of new ways of understanding the internal conflicts of this Covid-19 age, and tentatively identify some key emerging themes; the capacity for facilitative interactions and change; identifications with the powerful virus; an increase in paranoid anxieties and the potential for a more considerate, 'care-full' way of relating.","Goldblatt, Casado Sastre, Briggs, Lindner","https://doi.org/10.1111/bjp.12771","20221017","ALONENESS; COUNTERTRANSFERENCE; COVIDÃ¢â‚¬Â19; ISOLATION; ONLINE THERAPY; SUICIDE; TRANSFERENCE","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-18","",39418,""

The aim of this study was to test the effectiveness of and satisfaction with an app with gratitude exercises to improve theÃ‚Â mental health of people with reduced mental well-being due to the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as potential mechanisms of well-being change and dose-response relationships. A two-armed randomized controlled trial design was used, with two groups receiving the 6-week gratitude intervention app either immediately (intervention group, <i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°424) or after 6Ã‚Â weeks (waiting list control group, <i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°425). Assessments took place online at baseline (T0), six weeks later (T1) and at 12Ã‚Â weeks (T2), measuring outcomes (i.e., mental well-being, anxiety, depression, stress), and potential explanatory variables (i.e., gratitude, positive reframing, rumination). Linear mixed models analyses showed that when controlled for baseline measures, the intervention group scored better on all outcome measures compared to the control group at T1 (<i>d</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.24-.49). These effects were maintained at T2. The control group scored equally well on all outcome measures at T2 after following the intervention. Effects of the intervention on well-being were partially explained by gratitude, positive reframing, and rumination, and finishing a greater number of modules was weakly related to better outcomes. The intervention was generally appealing, with some room for improvement. The results suggest that a mobile gratitude intervention app is a satisfactory and effective way to improve the mental health of the general population during the difficult times of a pandemic.","Kloos, Austin, van 't Klooster, Drossaert, Bohlmeijer","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10902-022-00586-3","20221017","Gratitude; Intervention; Mobile application; Positive psychology; Randomized controlled trial; Well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-18","",39420,""
"Effects of COVID-19 restrictions on mechanization service providers and mechanization equipment retailers: Insights from phone surveys in Myanmar","Agrifood sector mechanization service providers (MSP) and mechanization equipment retailers (MER) have increasingly become the providers of mechanical technologies for smallholders in developing countries, including Myanmar. Evidence remains scarce on the effects of COVID-19 on these MSPs and MERs. This study provides insights into the effects of COVID-19 restrictions on MSPs and MERs in Myanmar, using unbalanced panel data from five rounds of phone surveys. Direct responses to COVID-19 involving movement restrictions, market disruptions, and growing financial challenges had significant negative effects on revenue prospects, service delivery, and sales of machines and equipment. Negative revenue prospects during a particular period can further hurt revenue prospects in subsequent periods. This is consistent with the hypotheses that MSPs who had incurred high sunk costs in machines can engage in more desperate and, thus, potentially suboptimal business practices to recover the sunk cost. Overall, policies to minimize movement restrictions and various financial struggles and mitigate any pessimism at the beginning of the production season are all important to make sure MSPs and MERs continue to function effectively under COVID-19.","Takeshima, Masias, Win, Zone","https://doi.org/10.1111/rode.12940","20221017","COVIDÃ¢â‚¬Â19; Myanmar; mechanization equipment retailers; mechanization service providers; panel data","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-18","",39421,""
"Emerging vocational rehabilitation strategies for people with diabetes mellitus","People with diabetes mellitus constitute an emerging vocational rehabilitation (VR) consumer population. The objective of this article is to (a) describe the characteristics and needs of Americans with diabetes mellitus, (b) examine the often devastating effects that this highly prevalent disease of the endocrine system has on employment and career development, and (c) suggest strategies that rehabilitation professionals can use to improve VR services and outcomes. Following an overview of the etiology, incidence, prevalence, and impact of this high incidence endocrinological disease, the authors present strategies to meet the service and support needs of Americans with diabetes mellitus across the phases of the VR process. The importance of individualized case planning, employer consultation, workplace accommodations, interface with medical and mental health professionals, and adherence to self-care and symptom management regimens is emphasized throughout the article. Diabetes mellitus is an emerging disability that can affect people of any age, one that disproportionally affects people of color and people who live in poverty.

"The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of workers and the associated social-economic aspects: A narrative review","The COVID-19 pandemic has struck nations worldwide, pushing worldwide health and socio-economic systems to extreme limits. Upon exposure to an exceeding number of patients and supply shortages, the resilience of healthcare resources has been broadly challenged. We will firstly discuss the mental health turmoil during the COVID-19 pandemic as the primary focus of this study and delve into the mental health repercussions among the workforce. Also, we debate the risk factors, particularly highlighting the impact of social behaviors and media exposure. We examine the pandemic's impact on occupational health services. Secondly, we thoroughly discuss the effect of socio-economic and race disparities in the COVID-19 contraction and the related psychologic sequelae. Economic outcomes are also highlighted, particularly alterations in poverty rates and occupational sectors. Peer-reviewed reports were extracted through Embase, PubMed, and Google Scholar until June 2022. A constellation of untoward spillover effects of the pandemic, including dramatic changes in public and workplace environments, enduring curfew, and low wages, have put socio-economic aspects of daily life under exuberant strain. Indeed, occupational and public health stakeholders presume a coinciding social crisis to occur, provided the pandemic's implications on socioeconomics and psychological wellbeing are not addressed well with evidence-based approaches and peer services. Evaluating the socio-economic and mental health impact is imperative to cope with the pandemic. Also, we should assess the predisposing and protecting factors in a broad array of life aspects associated with COVID-19.","Wang, Farokhnia, Sanchuli","https://doi.org/10.3233/WOR-220136","20221017","COVID-19; coronavirus; labor force; occupational health; psychological wellbeing; socioeconomics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-18","",39423,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of nursing students in Japan: a cross-sectional study","The effect of the prolonged coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on the mental health of nursing students is unclear. This study assesses the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and insomnia among nursing students in Japan during the pandemic and determines the risk factors associated with such symptoms. An online survey-based cross-sectional study was conducted from August 16 to October 16, 2021. Participants were first- to fourth-year nursing students enrolled in undergraduate programs at the eight universities in Japan. Anxiety, depression, and insomnia were assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and Insomnia Severity Index-7, respectively. We calculated descriptive statistics for each measurement item and performed univariate and logistic regression analyses to evaluate the potential risk factors. We received responses from 1,222 of 3,056 nursing students (response rate: 40.0%). After 25 participants were excluded due to missing outcome values, 1,197 students (valid response rate: 98.0%) were included in the analysis. The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and insomnia was 4.8%, 12.4%, and 18.0%, respectively. The risk of anxiety was lower among participants who did not have any relatives or friends who had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 than among those who did (aOR 0.36, 95% CI 0.14-0.94). The risk of depression was higher among participants whose financial status had worsened during the pandemic than among those whose financial status had not changed (aOR 3.44; 95% CI 1.98-5.96). Common factors that increased the risk of anxiety, depression, and insomnia were life satisfaction and fear of COVID-19. Mental health-related symptoms among nursing students in Japan have not necessarily worsened with the spread of COVID-19 but were exacerbated by the intensity of changes in daily living and fear, which are psychosocial effects associated with the pandemic.","Ito, Kako, Kajiwara, Kimura, Kakeda, Hamanishi, Sasaki, Yamanaka, Kiyohara, Wakiguchi, Endo, Harada, Koga, Ishida, Nishida, Kobayashi, Tsubaki","https://doi.org/10.1265/ehpm.22-00128","20221016","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Insomnia; Nursing student","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-18","",39424,""
"The Unusual Increase in Suicides Among Women in Japan During The COVID-19 Pandemic: A Time-Series Analysis until October 2021","Japan has witnessed an unusual increase in the number of suicides among women during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. An analysis is required to identify the influencing factors during the pandemic and develop new measures for preventing suicides. Data on the number of monthly suicides were collected from the National Police Agency of Japan. The expected number of suicides among women during the pandemic was estimated using a time-series model based on pre-pandemic data, considering year-to-year trends. The observation-to-expectation (O/E) ratio of suicides was estimated from March 2020 to October 2021 using job status, suicide motive, and age. The number of suicides among women in Japan increased beyond the expected number until October 2021. The O/E ratio based on job status, suicide motive, and age (except self-employed, unknown job status, and women Ã¢â€°Â¥80 years) was significantly above 1.0 from March-December 2020, and the increase in suicides continued in almost all categories in 2021. Although several reasons were reported for increased suicides among women in Japan during the pandemic (e.g., economic downturn, financial instability, and loneliness), suicides increased irrespective of job status, suicide motive, or age. The preventive measures for suicide without omission might have been important during the pandemic, as opposed to limiting interventions to the reported specific aspects.","Kikuchi, Anzai, Takahashi","https://doi.org/10.2188/jea.JE20220186","20221016","COVID-19 pandemic; Suicide; Time-series approach","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-18","",39425,""
"Psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and life satisfaction following COVID-19 infection: evidence from 11 UK longitudinal population studies","Evidence on associations between COVID-19 illness and mental health is mixed. We aimed to examine whether COVID-19 is associated with deterioration in mental health while considering pre-pandemic mental health, time since infection, subgroup differences, and confirmation of infection via self-reported test and serology data. We obtained data from 11 UK longitudinal studies with repeated measures of mental health (psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and life satisfaction; mental health scales were standardised within each study across time) and COVID-19 status between April, 2020, and April, 2021. We included participants with information available on at least one mental health outcome measure and self-reported COVID-19 status (suspected or test-confirmed) during the pandemic, and a subset with serology-confirmed COVID-19. Furthermore, only participants who had available data on a minimum set of covariates, including age, sex, and pre-pandemic mental health were included. We investigated associations between having ever had COVID-19 and mental health outcomes using generalised estimating equations. We examined whether associations varied by age, sex, ethnicity, education, and pre-pandemic mental health, whether the strength of the association varied according to time since infection, and whether associations differed between self-reported versus confirmed (by test or serology) infection. Between 21 Dec, 2021, and July 11, 2022, we analysed data from 54Ã¢â‚¬Ë†442 participants (ranging from a minimum age of 16 years in one study to a maximum category of 90 years and older in another; including 33Ã¢â‚¬Ë†200 [61Ã‚Â·0%] women and 21Ã¢â‚¬Ë†242 [39Ã‚Â·0%] men) from 11 longitudinal UK studies. Of 40Ã¢â‚¬Ë†819 participants with available ethnicity data, 36Ã¢â‚¬Ë†802 (90Ã‚Â·2%) were White. Pooled estimates of standardised differences in outcomes suggested associations between COVID-19 and subsequent psychological distress (0Ã‚Â·10 [95% CI 0Ã‚Â·06 to 0Ã‚Â·13], I<sup>2</sup>=42Ã‚Â·8%), depression (0Ã‚Â·08 [0Ã‚Â·05 to 0Ã‚Â·10], I<sup>2</sup>=20Ã‚Â·8%), anxiety (0Ã‚Â·08 [0Ã‚Â·05 to 0Ã‚Â·10], I<sup>2</sup>=0Ã‚Â·0%), and lower life satisfaction (-0Ã‚Â·06 [-0Ã‚Â·08 to -0Ã‚Â·04], I<sup>2</sup>=29Ã‚Â·2%). We found no evidence of interactions between COVID-19 and sex, education, ethnicity, or pre-pandemic mental health. Associations did not vary substantially between time since infection of less than 4 weeks, 4-12 weeks, and more than 12 weeks, and were present in all age groups, with some evidence of stronger effects in those aged 50 years and older. Participants who self-reported COVID-19 but had negative serology had worse mental health outcomes for all measures than those without COVID-19 based on serology and self-report. Participants who had positive serology but did not self-report COVID-19 did not show association with mental health outcomes. Self-reporting COVID-19 was longitudinally associated with deterioration in mental health and life satisfaction.

"A natural experiment in social security as public health measure: Experiences of international students as temporary migrant workers during two Covid-19 lockdowns","What is the impact of social security on public health? And what mechanisms does it operate through? To answer these questions, we take advantage of the unique circumstances of temporary migrant workers two Covid-19 lockdowns in Australia - one in which they were provided with social security, and one in which they were not. We undertook 47 qualitative interviews with South Asian international students who had lost their jobs in two lockdowns in 2020-2021. In Australia, international students represent the largest group of a growing temporary migration program, with many working in low-skilled occupations, in conditions below legal minimum standards. We compare our findings to two models of social security: the self-insurance model and state-insurance model. In first lockdown, without social security, participants struggled to comply with public health orders because of the need to work for income, lack of housing suitable for isolation, and lack of medical leave. Participants tended to avoid testing, and to work while potentially contagious. Participants reported high levels of anxiety, depression and emotional distress caused by job loss and exclusion from an implicit social contract with the rest of Australian society. In contrast, during the second lockdown, where temporary migrants were provided social security payments, participants reported avoiding risky work, undertook Covid-19 testing many times, and self-isolated successfully. There was little evidence of emotional distress. Participants felt like a valued part of Australian society. These results suggest a self-insurance model of social security does not protect the physical and psychological health of vulnerable populations and can exacerbate the spread of communicable diseases. In contrast, state-insurance and social welfare payments to marginalised communities, particularly unemployment benefits and medical leave, are crucial public health policy levers for both protecting vulnerable populations and tackling outbreaks of communicable diseases such as Covid-19.","Ullah, Harrigan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.115196","20221016","Covid-19; Migrant workers; Migration; Social welfare; Welfare state","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-18","",39427,""

The limited availability of care systems and the specific challenges of the pandemic have increased the burden and stress on family caregivers. This paper focuses on the burden of family caregivers in the light of their experiences with health and social services. Online questionnaire survey (n = 1004; active caregivers during COVID-19 pandemic: n = 491); data were analyzed using quantitative and qualitative (content analysis) methods. More than half of the active caregivers experienced an increasing burden in caregiving after the release of COVID-19. Associations are between the increase in caregiving burden during COVID-19 and the municipality type of caregiver's home, the cared for's dementia involvement, the use of home help or other care assistance, and employment. In addition, those who reported an increased burden due to the pandemic also perceived the caregiving role as more stressful. The most significant additional burden was the increased mental and psychological strain caused by restrictions, difficulties in providing care, and the pandemic. Our results suggest that the increase in caregiving burden during COVID-19 can be explained by the specific challenges of the pandemic. Family caregivers are particularly vulnerable and need special emergency services in such situations. The significantly increased mental strain in emergency situations draws attention to the need for mental health care for carers.

"Telomeres and oocyte maturation rate are not reduced by COVID-19 except in severe cases","COVID-19 does not affect the telomeres or fertility outcomes in mild cases. However, in women with severe symptoms, telomeres of granulosa cells are shorter, and the oocyte maturation rate is decreased. The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19 disease and affects primarily the lungs and also other organs, causing accelerated cell aging. One of the main pathways involved in aging is telomere attrition, which ultimately leads to defective tissue regeneration and organ dysfunction. Indeed, short telomeres in aged people aggravate the COVID-19 symptoms, and COVID-19 survivors showed shorter telomeres in blood cells. The SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in testis, but the ovaries, which express the viral entry factors, have not been fully explored. Our objective was to analyze telomeres and reproductive outcomes in women who had COVID-19 and controls. In this prospective cohort study, granulosa cells (GCs) and blood were collected from 65 women. Telomere length (TL) was measured by high-throughput in situ hybridization. Mean TL of GCs and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was alike in control and mild cases. However, mean TL of GCs was lower in severe cases compared to controls (P = 0.017). Control and COVID groups had similar ovarian reserve and number of total oocytes after puncture. However, the oocyte maturation rate was lower in severe cases (P = 0.018). Interestingly, a positive correlation between the oocyte maturation rate and TL of GCs was found in the control group (P = 0.024). Our findings point to a potential impact of the coronavirus infection on telomeres and reproductive outcomes in severe cases. This might be considered upon possible new SARS-CoV threats, to favor treatments that enhance oocyte maturation in women severely affected by coronavirus undergoing ART.","Chico-Sordo, Polonio, CÃƒÂ³rdova-Oriz, Medrano, Herraiz, Bronet, GarcÃƒÂ­a-Velasco, Varela","https://doi.org/10.1530/REP-22-0243","20221017","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-18","",39429,""
