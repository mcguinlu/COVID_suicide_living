"Impact of COVID-19 containment zone built-environments on studentsâ€™ mental health and their coping mechanisms","The 2nd wave of COVID-19 in 2021 had put several higher educational institutions in India into complete lockdowns and some were converted into containment zones to prevent the further spread of infection. A study was conducted on a student population (NÂ =Â 432) in one such institute campus across three different hostel complexes to understand the role of containment zone Built Environments in the prevalence of Anxiety and Depression. The results from the analysis revealed that students living in rooms which have access to qualitative Built Environment aspects such as quality window views overlooking greenery and sky in addition to presence of indoor plants and portrait/artworks, are at lower risk of depression and severity of anxiety. The linear regression results of Built Environment Variable (BEV) Score with CES-D and GAD-7 advocated for an inverted relationship. The multinomial logistic regression revealed that with each 1-unit increase in BEV Score there is a significant decrease of 1.3-unit of likelihood of Depression, 0.779, 0.712 and 0.614-unit decrease in the likelihood of mild, moderate and severe levels of anxiety respectively. For Adverse Effect on Productivity, a 1-unit increase in BEV Score increases the likelihood of No-effect on productivity by 1.277 units. In order to precisely predict the effect of individual aspects of University Campus Built environments on the mental health of students during such containment and quarantine situations, further multidisciplinary investigation is required on the spheres of Built Environment, Psychology, and Epidemiology.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.108107","20211001","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-12","",15873,""
