"Gender-affirming care, mental health, and economic stability in the time of COVID-19: a global cross-sectional study of transgender and non-binary people","Background Transgender and non-binary people are disproportionately burdened by barriers to quality healthcare, mental health challenges, and economic hardship. This study examined the impact of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and subsequent control measures on gender-affirming care, mental health, and economic stability among transgender and non-binary people globally. Methods We collected global cross-sectional data from 964 transgender and non-binary adult users of the Hornet and Her apps from April to August 2020 to characterize changes in gender-affirming care, mental health, and economic stability as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted Poisson regression models to assess if access to gender-affirming care and ability to live according to one's gender were related to depressive symptoms, anxiety, and changes in suicidal ideation. Results Individuals resided in 76 countries, including Turkey (27.4%,n=264/964) and Thailand (20.6%,n=205). A majority were non-binary (66.8%,n=644) or transfeminine (29.4%,n=283). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 55.0% (n=320/582) reported reduced access to gender-affirming resources, and 38.0% (n=327/860) reported reduced time lived according to their gender. About half screened positive for depression (50.4%,442/877) and anxiety (45.8%,n=392/856). One in six (17.0%,n=112/659) expected losses of health insurance, and 77.0% (n=724/940) expected income reductions. The prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety, and increased suicidal ideation were 1.63 (95% CI: 1.36-1.97), 1.61 (95% CI: 1.31-1.97), and 1.74 (95% CI: 1.07-2.82) times higher for individuals whose access to gender-affirming resources was reduced versus not. Discussion The COVID-19 pandemic has reduced access to gender-affirming resources and the ability of transgender and non-binary people to live according to their gender worldwide. These reductions may drive the increased depressive symptoms, anxiety, and suicidal ideation reported in this sample. To improve transgender and non-binary health globally, increased access to gender-affirming resources should be achieved through policies (e.g., digital prescriptions), flexible interventions (e.g., telehealth), and support for existing transgender health initiatives.","Brooke Jarrett; Sarah M Peitzmeier; Arjee Restar; Tyler Adamson; Sean Howell; Stefan Baral; S.

"The impact of lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic on mental and social health of children and adolescents","Importance: It is unknown how a lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic impacts childrens and adolescents mental and social health. Objective: To compare mental and social health of children and adolescents during the COVID-19 lockdown versus before, identify associated factors, describe the change in atmosphere at home and qualitatively assess the impact of COVID-19 regulations on daily life. Design: Cross-sectional study comparing two Dutch representative samples of children and adolescents (8-18 years); before COVID-19 (Dec2017-July2018) and during the COVID-19 lockdown (April/May 2020). Setting: Population-based Participants: Children and adolescents aged 8-18 years (M=13.4, 47.4% male), representative of the Dutch population on key demographics. Exposure(s): COVID-19 pandemic lockdown Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) domains: Global Health, Peer Relationships, Anxiety, Depressive Symptoms, Anger and Sleep-Related Impairment. Single item on atmosphere at home and open question regarding the impact of the regulations on the childs/adolescents daily life Results: Children and adolescents reported significantly worse PROMIS T-scores on all domains (absolute mean difference range, 2.1-7.1; absolute 95% CI range, 1.3-7.9) during the COVID-19 lockdown as compared to before COVID-19. More children reported severe Anxiety (during 16.7% vs. before 8.6%; relative risk 1.95; 95% CI 1.55-2.46) and Sleep-Related Impairment (during 11.5% vs. before 6.1%; relative risk 1.89; 95% CI 1.29-2.78). Fewer children reported poor Global Health (during 1.7 vs. before 4.6%; relative risk 0.36; 95% CI 0.20-0.65). More mental and social health complaints during the COVID-19 lockdown were found in children and adolescents growing up in a single-parent family, having >three children in the family, a negative change in work situation of parents due to COVID-19 regulations, and having a relative/friend infected with COVID-19. A small effect was found on atmosphere at home during the lockdown compared to before (mean difference, -3.1; 95% CI, -4.1 - -2.1). A large majority (>90%) reported a negative impact of the COVID-19 regulations on their daily life. Conclusions and Relevance: This study showed that governmental regulations regarding lockdown pose a serious mental and social health threat on children and adolescents that should be brought to the forefront of political decision making and mental health care policy, intervention and prevention.","Michiel A.J.

"The mental health of critical care and anaesthetic staff during COVID-19","Background. Intensive Care Unit (ICU), anaesthetic and theatres staff have faced significant challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic which have the potential to adversely affect their mental health Aims. To identify the rates of probable mental health disorder in ICU and anaesthetic staff in six hospitals during June and July 2020 Methods. An anonymised brief web-based survey comprising standardised questionnaires examining depression, anxiety symptoms, symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), wellbeing and alcohol use was administered to staff. Results. 709 participants completed the surveys comprising 291 (41%) Doctors, 344 (48.5%) Nurses, and 74 (10.4%) as other clinicians. Over half (58.8%) reported good wellbeing, however 45.4% met the threshold for probable clinical significance on at least one of the following measures: severe depression (6.3%), PTSD (39.5%), severe anxiety (11.3%) or problem drinking (7.2%). 13.4% of respondents reported frequent thoughts of being better off dead, or of hurting themselves in the past two weeks. We found that doctors consistently reported better mental health than nurses. Conclusions. We found substantial rates of probable mental health disorders, and thoughts of self-harm, amongst ICU staff; these difficulties were especially prevalent in ICU nurses. Our results a pressing need for a national strategy should be designed to protect the mental health of ICU staff whilst they carry out their essential work during COVID-19. This should target preventative actions, including reducing exposure of staff to psychological harm, as well as ensuring that staff who need formal treatment are able to access it in a timely manner.","Neil Greenberg; Dale Weston; Charlotte Hall; Tristan Caulfield; Victoria Williamson; Kevin Fong","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.03.20208322","20201104","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-04","",6730,""
"The relationship between anxiety, health, and potential stressors among adults in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objective: To estimate the prevalence of anxiety symptoms and the association between moderate or severe anxiety symptoms and health and potential stressors among adults in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic Methods: This analysis includes data from 5,250 adults in the Communities, Households and SARS/CoV-2 Epidemiology (CHASING) COVID Cohort Study surveyed in April 2020. Poisson models were used to estimate the association between moderate or severe anxiety symptoms and health and potential stressors among U.S. adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Greater than one-third (35%) of participants reported moderate or severe anxiety symptoms. Having lost income due to COVID-19 (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] 1.27 (95% CI 1.16, 1.30), having recent COVID-like symptoms (aPR 1.17 (95% CI 1.05, 1,31), and having been previously diagnosed with depression (aPR 1.49, (95% CI 1.35, 1.64) were positively associated with anxiety symptoms. Conclusions: Anxiety symptoms were common among adults in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic. Strategies to screen and treat individuals at increased risk of anxiety, such as individuals experiencing financial hardship and individuals with prior diagnoses of depression, should be developed and implemented.","Angela Parcesepe; McKaylee Robertson; Amanda Berry; Andrew R Maroko; Rebecca Zimba; Christian Grov; Drew Westmoreland; Sarah Kulkarni; Madhura Rane; William Salgado-You; Chloe Mirzayi; Levi Waldron; Denis Nash","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.30.20221440","20201104","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-04","",6731,""
"Delirium and Post-Discharge Neuropsychological Outcomes in Critically Ill Patients with COVID-19: an Institutional Case Series","Delirium is a serious and common complication among critically ill patients with COVID-19. The objective of this study was to characterize the clinical course of delirium for COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit, including post-discharge cognitive outcomes. A retrospective chart review was conducted for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (n=148) admitted to an intensive care unit at Michigan Medicine between 3/1/2020 and 5/31/2020. Delirium was identified in 107/148 (72%) patients in the study cohort, with median (interquartile range) duration lasting 10 (4 - 17) days. Sedative regimens, inflammation, deviation from delirium prevention protocols, and hypoxic-ischemic injury were likely contributing factors, and the most common disposition for delirious patients was a skilled care facility (41/148, 38%). Among patients who were delirious during hospitalization, 4/17 (24%) later tested positive for delirium at home based on caretaker assessment, 5/22 (23%) demonstrated signs of questionable cognitive impairment or cognitive impairment consistent with dementia, and 3/25 (12%) screened positive for depression within two months after discharge. Overall, patients with COVID-19 commonly experience a prolonged course of delirium in the intensive care unit, likely with multiple contributing factors. Furthermore, neuropsychological impairment may persist after discharge.","Jacqueline Ragheb; Amy McKinney; Mackenzie Zierau; Joseph Brooks; Maria Hill-Caruthers; Mina Iskander; Yusuf Ahmed; Remy Lobo; Phillip E.

"Experiences of living with mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK: a coproduced, participatory qualitative interview study","Purpose. Research is beginning to quantify the impact of COVID-19 on people with pre-existing mental health conditions. Our paper addresses a lack of in-depth qualitative research exploring their experiences and perceptions of how life has changed at this time. Methods. We used qualitative interviews (N=49) to explore experiences of the pandemic for people with pre-existing mental health conditions. In a participatory, coproduced approach, researchers with lived experiences of mental health conditions conducted interviews and analysed data as part of a multi-disciplinary research team. Results. Existing mental health difficulties were exacerbated for many people. People experienced specific psychological impacts of the pandemic, struggles with social connectedness, and inadequate access to mental health services, while some found new ways to cope and connect to community. New remote ways to access mental health care, including digital solutions, provided continuity of care for some but presented substantial barriers for others. People from black and ethnic minority (BAME) communities experienced heightened anxiety, stigma and racism associated with the pandemic, further impacting their mental health. Conclusion. There is a need for evidence-based solutions to achieve accessible and effective mental health care in response to the pandemic, especially remote approaches to care. Further research should explore the long-term impacts of COVID-19 on people with pre-existing mental health conditions. Particular attention should be paid to understanding inequalities of impact on mental health, especially for people from BAME communities.","Steven Gillard; Ceri Dare; Jackie Hardy; Patrick Nyikavaranda; Rachel Rowan Olive; Prisha Shah; Mary Birken; Una Foye; Josephine Ocloo; Ellie Pearce; Theodora Stefanidou; Alexandra Pitman; Alan Simpson; Sonia Johnson; Bryn Lloyd-Evans; NIHR Mental Health Policy Research Unit COVID Coproduction Research Group","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.03.20225169","20201104","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-04","",6733,""
"Psychological impact of infectious disease outbreaks on pregnant women: rapid evidence review","Infectious disease outbreaks can be distressing for everyone, especially those deemed to be particularly vulnerable such as pregnant women, who have been named a high-risk group in the current COVID-19 pandemic. This paper aimed to summarise existing literature on the psychological impact of infectious disease outbreaks on women who were pregnant at the time of the outbreak. The design of this study is a rapid review. Five databases were searched for relevant literature, and main findings were extracted. Thirteen articles were included in the review. The following themes were identified: negative emotional states; living with uncertainty; concerns about infection; concerns about and uptake of prophylaxis or treatment; disrupted routines; non-pharmaceutical protective behaviours; social support; financial and occupational concerns; disrupted expectations of birth, prenatal care and postnatal care and sources of information. Pregnant women have unique needs during infectious disease outbreaks and could benefit from up-to-date, consistent information and guidance; appropriate support and advice from healthcare professionals, particularly with regards to the risks and benefits of prophylaxis and treatment; virtual support groups and designating locations or staff specifically for pregnant women.","Brooks, Weston, Greenberg","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.09.006","20201103","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Disease outbreaks; Infectious diseases; Mental health; Pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-04","",6734,""
"Anxiety of Nurses to support Wuhan in fighting against COVID-19 Epidemic and its Correlation With Work Stress and Social Support","We aimed to investigate the anxiety of nurses who are supporting Wuhan in fighting against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and explore relevant influencing factors. The COVID-19 outbreak pose a major threat to public health worldwide. Nurses play an important role in this epidemic. However, available data on the mental health among these nurses is limited. A descriptive, cross-sectional survey was performed. An online questionnaire was completed by 200 nurses who went to Wuhan to help to fight against COVID-19 from another province. Data collection tools including the Chinese version of the Stress Overload Scale (SOS), the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES). Descriptive, single-factor correlation and multiple regression analyses were used in exploring related influencing factors. Reporting followed the STROBE guidelines. The score of SAS, SOS and GSES are range from 20 - 80, 22 - 110 and 10 - 40 respectively, the SAS (31.79Ã‚Â±7.32) and SOS (40.19Ã‚Â±12.92) and GSES scores (24.83Ã‚Â±6.60) were obtained. Anxiety was positively correlated with stress (r=0.679, P&lt;0.001) but negatively correlated with self-efficacy (r=-0.326, p&lt;0.001). Multiple regression analysis showed that professional qualification, sleep, stress, and self-efficacy were the main factors affecting nurse anxiety (p=0.006, &lt;0.001, &lt;0.001, 0.039, respectively). Nurses who are supporting Wuhan in fighting against COVID-19 were under a low level of anxiety.

"Emergency Stress Management Among Nurses: A Lesson from the COVID-19 Outbreak in China- A Cross-Sectional Study","To assess the level of stress response, self-efficacy, and perceived social support status of working nurses during the outbreak of the COVID-19 and investigate potential factors affecting their stress. The stress level of clinical nurses directly affects their physical and mental health and work efficiency. This study was a cross-sectional investigation, which was performed following the STROBE checklist. The current study was conducted in February 2020 by selecting clinical nurses from the Zigong First People's Hospital for investigation. At the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, we assessed clinical nurses with the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire, the General Self-Efficacy Scale and the Perceived Social Support Scale. Specifically, the nurses were divided into three groups: (i) Nurses supporting Wuhan; (ii) Nurses in the department of treating the COVID-19 patients in our hospital (Epidemic department); and (iii) Nurses in the general department without the COVID-19 patients in our hospital (Non-epidemic department). A total of 1092 clinical nurses were surveyed with 94 nurses in Wuhan, 130 nurses treating COVID-19 patients in our hospital and 868 nurses working without direct contact with diagnosed COVID-19 patients. The mean stress score of all surveyed nurses was 33.15 (SD: 25.551). There was a statistically significant difference in stress response scores between different departments. Noticeably, the nurses who went to support in Wuhan showed a weaker stress response than the nurses who stayed in our hospital (mean: 19.98 (Wuhan) vs. 32.70 (Epidemic department in our hospital) vs. 34.64 (Non-epidemic department in our hospital)). In addition, stress was negatively correlated with general self-efficacy and perceived social support. The present study suggested that the stress status of second-line nurse without direct contact with diagnosed COVID-19 patients was more severe than that of first-line nurses who had direct contact with COVID-19 patients. Our study indicated the importance of psychological status of second-line medical staff during the global pandemic.","Liao, Guo, Zhang, Zhang, Jiang, Zhong, Lin, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15553","20201103","COVID-19; Health care workers; Nurses; Self-efficacy; Social support; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-04","",6736,""

This study examined the perceptions of community-dwelling older adults regarding how COVID-19 restricted their daily lives. Six focus-group interviews were conducted with 24 participants (mean age, 78.2 Ã‚Â± 5.5 years) living in urban and rural areas in Japan. Then, a qualitative inductive content analysis was performed. Six themes were generated: &quot;fear of infection and public, watchful eyes,&quot; &quot;consistency in daily personal life,&quot; &quot;pain from reducing my social life,&quot; &quot;readiness to endure a restricted life,&quot; &quot;awareness of positive changes in myself,&quot; and &quot;concern for a languishing society.&quot; There was no change that would make their lives untenable, and they continued their daily personal lives at a minimum level. However, their social lives were reduced, which over the long term can lead to a lost sense of purpose in life. This was reported as an adverse factor in the development of other diseases and functional decline in previous studies. While there is no doubt that infection prevention is important, supporting older adults in engaging in activities that provide a sense of purpose in life could contribute to their present and future overall health including mental health.","Takashima, Onishi, Saeki, Hirano","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare8040450","20201103","COVID-19; community-dwelling older adults; inductive content analysis; rural; urban","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-04","",6738,""

Migrant careworkers work and live with populations extremely vulnerable to the novel Coronavirus, including the elderly and people with pre-existing physical conditions. This rapid assessment aimed to explore psychosocial status and mental wellbeing of migrant careworkers in Israel during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and determine risk and protective factors associated with mental distress, anxiety, and depression. This quantitative study was conducted via an online survey. The online survey collected social and demographic data, including country of origin, residence, age, sex, and time in Israel. In addition, questions were asked about knowledge of COVID-19 guidelines, access to supplies, and COVID-related racism. Respondents also completed a psychosocial screening tools, the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-10 (HSCL-10), which was used to screen for depression and anxiety. As of May 3rd, 2020, 307 careworkers responded to the online survey, of whom 120 (39.1%) were found symptomatic using the HSCL-10. Separating the HSCL-10 into subscales, 28.0% were symptomatically anxious, and 38.1% were symptomatic for depression. In multivariate regression, emotional distress was associated with household food insecurity (OR: 5.85; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), lack of confidence to care for oneself and employer during the pandemic (OR: 3.85; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), poorer general health (OR: 2.98; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.003), non-Philippine country of origin (OR: 2.83; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01), female sex (OR: 2.34; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.04),, and inversely associated with age (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.03).

"Covid-19 effects on the workload of Iranian healthcare workers","In this study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the workload and mental health of Iranian medical staff using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and NASA -Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) Questionnaire between March and April 2020, respectively. The present cross-sectional study was conducted from March 5th to April 5th, 2020. To evaluate the workload and mental health of participants NASA-TLX and GHQ-12 online questionnaires were distributed. Data were entered into software SPSS (Version 23) and T-test, ANOVA, Regression methods were used for data analysis. Health workers who encountered COVID- 19 patients, were subjected to more task load compared to those who had no contact with COVID- 19 patients at the workplace (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â 0.001). In terms of the subscale score of NASA-TLX, nurses had more scores in mental pressure, physical pressure, time pressure (temporal), and frustration compared to the other jobs (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â 0.05). Moreover, nurses had significantly more workload compared to the other jobs. Type of job, the shift of work, educational level, and facing COVID-19 affected the score of NASA-TLX. NASA-TLX scores were higher in nursing compared to the scores of other health staff groups. The results of this study indicate that the scores of NASA-TLX and GHQ-12 among staff who had contact with COVID-19 patients were significantly higher than those who did not face COVID-19 patients.

"Social Capital and Mental Health among Older Adults Living in Urban China in the Context of COVID-19 Pandemic","Although social capital has been found to be an important social determinant of mental health in later life, research on social capital in the context of COVID-19 and the interplay among subdimensions of social capital is lacking. The present study examined the mediating role of cognitive social capital on the relationship between structural social capital and mental health among older adults in urban China in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected from the Yangpu district in Shanghai, China, in July-August 2020. A quota sampling approach was used to recruit 472 respondents aged 60 years and older from 23 communities in the Yangpu district. Mental health was measured by depressive symptoms and life satisfaction. Cognitive social capital was assessed through trust and reciprocity, and structural social capital was assessed through organization memberships, and COVID-19 related volunteering and citizenship activity. Structural equation modeling was used to test the mediation model. The results show that cognitive social capital had a full mediation effect on the association between structural social capital and mental health indicators (life satisfaction: <i>b</i> = 0.122, <i>SD</i> = 0.029, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001; depressive symptoms: <i>b</i> = -0.343, <i>SD</i> = 0.119, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01).

"Does Physical Activity Matter for the Mental Health of University Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic?","Research indicates that university and college students are at higher risk of experiencing mental health problems than other populations. This study aims to examine the relationship between Physical Activity (PA) and the mental health of Ukrainian university students during the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic lockdown. The conventional sample consisted of 1512 students from 11 Ukrainian universities, with a mean age of 20 years (M = 20.06, SD = 3.05) and 69% of whom were female. The cross-sectional online survey was disseminated through the most popular social media channels in Ukraine (i.e., Facebook, Viber, Telegram) and included the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale to measure anxiety and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to assess depression. Data were collected from 14 May to 4 June 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in Ukraine. Among university students, 43% were engaged in PA Ã¢â€°Â¥ 150 min weekly, 24% met the criteria of GAD, and 32% met the criteria of depression. More students were involved in PA before the COVID-19 outbreak than during the national lockdown. Students with anxiety and depression were almost two times less likely to engage in PA than their counterparts without mental health disorders. The inactive group had higher scores of anxiety and depression than the physically active group. The relationship of PA with anxiety and depression was statistically significant but weak during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rogowska, Pavlova, KuÃ…â€ºnierz, Ochnik, Bodnar, Petrytsa","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9113494","20201103","GAD-7; PHQ-9; anxiety; depression; physical activity (PA); undergraduates; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-04","",6742,""
"Online University Counselling Services and Psychological Problems among Italian Students in Lockdown Due to Covid-19","<i>Introduction:</i> With the advent of Covid-19, Italian university students were overwhelmed by fear of the pandemic and the social restrictions of the lockdown phase, with all didactic activity provided online. These stress factors caused people to experience psychological problems and/or the aggravation of pre-existing mental symptomatology. Psychological support is, therefore, important for the university-student population. <i>Aims:</i> (1) Analyzing the psychological difficulties and mental problems relative to lockdown from Covid-19 of students who asked for help from the Center of Psychological Counseling of the University of Salerno. (2) Describing the online services of the university's psychological counseling treatment. <i>Participants:</i> 266 university students, but only 49 were undergoing psychological treatment during the Covid-19 lockdown at the center. <i>Methods:</i> (1) Semistructured interview; (2) Questionnaire consisting of sociodemographic information and ad hoc questions; and (3) Scl-90-r test. <i>Results and Conclusions:</i> Aim 1: The main results highlight high levels of anxiety and stress, concentration disorders, and psychosomatization. In several cases, there was a reactivation of previous traumas and sleep was found qualitatively compromised. Aim 2: Counseling services included telephone listening activities, online psychological interviews, psychoeducational groups for interventions of anxiety management, and workshops on study methods conducted in small groups. The online counseling intervention, in times of emergency, increased the resilience and identified any psychological problems in order to implement timely management.","Savarese, Curcio, D'Elia, Fasano, Pecoraro","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare8040440","20201103","Covid-19; PTSD; Psychological Counseling; anxiety and depression; online learning difficulties; psychosomatic symptoms; quality of life; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-04","",6743,""
"Concerns about the Coronavirus Outbreak among Health and Social Service Workers: The Mediating Role of Job Burnout","Background: The current worldwide coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has elicited widespread concerns and stress. The current research examined the links between tendency to worry, concerns related to COVID-19 and psychological distress (anxiety, depression, stress). We were specifically interested in the mediating role of job burnout. Methods: Ninety-eight health and social service workers participated in the study (including medical and paramedical staff members, therapists and more). Participants completed an online survey that included questionnaires related to COVID-19 concerns, tendency to worry (PSWQ), psychological distress (DASS) and job burnout (SMBM). Results: Significant correlations emerged between COVID-19-related concerns, tendency to worry and psychological distress. Our findings showed that individuals working in health and social services fields who reported a higher tendency to worry experienced more psychological distress and that job burnout mediated this link. Furthermore, the link between worry and concerns related to COVID-19 was mediated by psychological distress. Limitations: In comparison with other countries such as Italy, and China; the cases in Israel haven't exceeded the coping competencies of the health and social service staffs. Conclusions: These findings highlight the role of worry and job burnout in psychological distress among individuals who work in health and social services fields. The results provide further knowledge regarding the risk factors that make health and social service workers vulnerable at times of crisis and emphasize the need for novel interventions for preventing psychological distress and promoting well-being among populations whose ability to function is crucial at times of crisis.","Marlyn Khouri et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460FD-9CD-885","20201104","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Affect and Emotion Regulation","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-04","",6744,""
