"Introduction to the Second Special Issue: Acute, Intensive, and Residential Services","This second special issue of Evidence Based Practice in Child and Adolescent Mental Health will focus on Acute, Intensive, and Residential Services (AIRS) for youth. Despite recent increases in AIRS research, there remains a shortage of applying, evaluating, and developing evidence-based treatments (EBTs) in these settings. In addition, since the publication of our first special issue, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), Children's Hospital Alliance (CHA), and American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) have issued a joint statement declaring the state of youth mental illness to be a national crisis, worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic (American Academy of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital Association, & American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatrists [AAP, CHA, & AACAP], 2021).

"Social isolation and loneliness among individuals with spinal cord injuries overall and during COVID-19 pandemic","Background: Loneliness and social isolation are common in persons with spinal cord injuries (SCI) yet are poorly managed and/or treated. Objective(s): To understand social isolation and loneliness from the perspectives of individuals with SCI and to gather insight on the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Design(s): Descriptive qualitative design. Method(s): During a one-on-one telephone call, a brief survey was conducted to collect demographic and injury characteristics followed by in-depth semi-structured interview with nine individuals with SCI. Audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim transcripts were coded and analyzed using Braun and Clarke's (2006) six thematic analysis phases. Results Observed: The sample was mostly male (~80%), about half had a paraplegic injury and half a tetraplegic injury. Participants identified themes describing personal meanings of social isolation and loneliness and how it impacts life. Participants identified barriers preventing desired social interaction, and how having a SCI impacts the frequency and quality of their social interactions. Participants elucidated what constitutes a 'good' social connection. Finally, participants described the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their experiences of social isolation and loneliness. Conclusion(s): Individuals with SCI frequently experience social isolation and loneliness. Barriers to social interaction exist for people with SCI due to secondary conditions and challenges with participation. Individuals with SCI may be at increased risk for the many physical and mental health risks associated with loneliness and social isolation due to SCI-specific barriers. Findings suggest that efforts are needed to better identify and respond to social isolation and loneliness in community and healthcare settings.

"Virtual SOS Signs of Suicide: Student Perspectives and Acceptability","When the COVID-19 pandemic closed in-person schools in March 2020, SOS Signs of Suicide shifted to a virtual program. This paper describes an evaluation of the acceptability of the online program by middle and high school students (N = 1196). Students generally responded favorably to virtual SOS. Although some were unsure, of those with an opinion, 73.9% thought it was the same or better than in-person and 85.1% recommended virtual programming continue. At-risk students were more likely to prefer virtual SOS to in-person. Thematic analysis identified the following themes behind the continuation of virtual SOS: it helps people, it is more comfortable, better access to students, the medium of SOS does not matter, it is easier and more fun, and preferences depend on the individual person. Concerns about virtual SOS focused on a belief that in-person programming is better and that students are less likely to learn and engage virtually. The feedback clearly highlighted a diversity of opinions. Implications for schools are discussed, including opportunities to broaden the reach of SOS. Impact Statement The SOS Signs of Suicide program provides education on suicide that decreases self-reported suicide attempts and provides opportunities for help-seeking and identification of at-risk youth. SOS Signs of Suicide was adapted to an online format due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although some students did were not sure what they thought about virtual SOS, of those with an opinion, 73.9% thought it was as good or better than in-person and 85.1% said it should continue to be offered. Benefits of virtual SOS included broader access to students, more comfortable learning environment, and an easier experience.","Mirick, Rebecca G.; McCauley, James","https://doi.org/10.1080/2372966x.2022.2134975","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: School Psychology Review;JOUR: 1-8,","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41320,""
"Feeling exhausted and isolated? The connections between university studentsâ€™ remote teaching and learning experiences, motivation, and psychological well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic","We examined university studentsâ€™ experiences of remote teaching and learning, how the experiences are associated with well-being, and whether those associations differ according to motivation. Using latent variable modelling, we classified Finnish university students (N = 2686) based on their expectancy-value-cost profiles, compared latent means, and tested whether the predictions varied across profiles. Six expectancy-value-cost profiles were identified: moderately motivated, utility-oriented, disengaged, indifferent, positively ambitious, and struggling ambitious. Overall, positively ambitious students seemed most adaptive in terms of their study experiences and well-being. Similarly across the profiles, engagement was predicted positively by the evaluation of remote teaching and negatively by experienced strain, exhaustion positively by the evaluation of teaching and strain, and depressive symptoms positively by strain and sense of alienation. Findings suggest that subjective experiences of remote teaching and learning during the pandemic contribute to studentsâ€™ well-being in unique ways and that distinct motivational mindsets may buffer against the negative outcomes.

"Aerosol suppression from a handpiece using viscoelastic solution in confined dental office","Aerosolized droplets are produced en masse in dental practices;these aerosols disperse in the surrounding space, posing a health threat if the patient is infected with a transmittable disease, particularly COVID-19. Here, a viscoelastic polyacrylic acid (PAA) solution was used to minimize liquid aerosolization and limit the travel distance of aerosols. The PAA concentration was varied to evaluate its effect on aerosolization and droplet size resulting from procedures using dental handpieces, which include tooth cutting, grinding, and polishing. In addition, a thermocouple was inserted at the center of the model tooth to measure its temperature during a handpiece operation. The temperature data suggest that the cooling performance of the PAA solution is comparable to that of pure water in operations in the occlusal and facial directions. The PAA solution droplets splattered on the patient's facial area during the handpiece operation are markedly larger than those of pure water, which is evidence of the settling of the PAA droplets, preventing further transmission. Accordingly, the travel distance of the aerosolized PAA droplets was limited by viscoelastic resistance to droplet detachment. This comparison of the aerosol suppression capability between water and PAA solutions confirms the benefit of using viscoelastic solutions for various dental operations.

"Death Anxiety, Loss, and Grief in the Time of COVID-19","According to TMT, when thoughts of death are conscious we engage in â€˜proximal defencesâ€™, which include suppressing these thoughts (e.g. turning off a news report about COVID-19 death tolls), denying one's vulnerability (e.g. thinking ""I'm not in a high risk group, so I'll probably be fine""), or trying to prevent death (e.g. cleaning down all home surfaces with antibacterial wipes). [...]as fear of the virus increased, mental health declined. [...]death-related losses arising from COVID-19 are compounded by non-death losses, such as global financial strain, massive unemployment, and financial hardship, all of which are also associated with impoverished mental health (Paul & Moser, 2006). In this form of life-vitiating, protracted, and anguishing response to loss, mourners struggle with turbulent emotions of longing, guilt, loneliness, and desolation which tangibly impair their ability to function in the contexts of family, work, and the social world for many months beyond the death, and not uncommonly, years. [...]ongoing ruminative preoccupation with the lost relationship or the circumstances of the death carries real health risks for a variety of stress-related disorders, cardiac problems, addictions, immune system dysfunction, impaired quality of life, and even suicide (Maercker, Neimeyer, & Simiola, 2016).","Menzies, Rachel E.; Neimeyer, Robert A.; Menzies, Ross G.","https://doi.org/10.1017/bec.2020.10","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Behaviour Change; JOUR(3):111-115, 37.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41324,""
"â€œA lot of things stopped with COVIDâ€: Screening Pregnant Women for Opioid Use and Related Conditions During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Objective We explored the impact of COVID-19 on universal screening programs for opioid use and related conditions among practicing clinicians or staff who work with pregnant patients. Methods Semi-structured, in-depth qualitative interviews (n=15) were conducted with practicing clinicians or staff in West-Central Florida between May and October 2020, representing both a range of professions and clinical settings that serve pregnant patients. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and reviewed for accuracy. Independent coders conducted thematic content analysis iteratively in MaxQDA to identify emergent themes. Results Four main themes were identified: worsening health and life conditions of pregnant patients, impaired patient-provider interactions, lack of priority and resources, and conducting opioid screening remotely. Pregnant patients often faced worsening mental health, lack of connection with healthcare providers, and socioenvironmental factors that increased the risk of overdose and intimate partner violence. Healthcare providers and facilities faced an infectious disease pandemic that simultaneously increased mental burden and reduced resources. Telehealth improved access to healthcare for many, but also came with implementation challenges such as inadequate technology, the need to address barriers to developing rapport with patients, and difficulty with certain social screens. Conclusion These themes describe facilitators of and barriers to implementing opioid and related screening programs during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the increasing urgency of screening because of socioenvironmental factors. Patients, healthcare providers, and health practices may benefit from emergency plans that anticipate screening challenges given their increased importance during times of heightened risk, including disasters and epidemics.","Foti, Tara R.; Vereen, Shanda, Vamos, Cheryl, Sappenfield, William, Kirby, Russell S.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.whi.2022.11.001","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Women's Health Issues;JOUR","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41325,""
"PercepciÃ³n del duelo de adultos que han perdido a un familiar durante la situaciÃ³n de pandemia en Lima Metropolitana","Resumen Objetivo El presente estudio tiene por objetivo analizar las percepciones del duelo de los adultos que han perdido a un familiar durante la situaciÃ³n de pandemia en Lima Metropolitana. MÃ©todos Se realizÃ³ una investigaciÃ³n cualitativa con un diseÃ±o de anÃ¡lisis temÃ¡tico reflexivo. Participaron 10 adultos de ambos sexos, de 23 a 54 aÃ±os, que habÃ­an perdido a un familiar producto de la COVID-19 durante el periodo de pandemia, a quienes se aplicÃ³ una entrevista semiestructurada. Resultados Los resultados evidenciaron que los adultos en duelo a causa de la pÃ©rdida de un familiar en la pandemia perciben su duelo en distintos momentos. En primer lugar, perciben la imposibilidad de ver al ser querido debido a las medidas de bioseguridad que impiden acercarse a su familiar. Ello implica un momento de shock e incredulidad;luego se da la liberaciÃ³n de emociones reprimidas, en la que se dan los pensamientos y las emociones disfuncionales;mÃ¡s adelante se tiene la negociaciÃ³n de la carga emocional, periodo en el cual se da una reconciliaciÃ³n con las emociones desbocadas;a continuaciÃ³n, se encuentra el sentimiento de desesperanza, en el cual la persona experimenta tristeza profunda y falta de sentido de la vida;por Ãºltimo, se encuentra una adaptaciÃ³n ante la pÃ©rdida. Conclusiones Se concluye que la percepciÃ³n del duelo de los adultos que perdieron a un familiar en la pandemia conforma un ciclo de percepciÃ³n del duelo ajustado al contexto de pandemia. Objective The aim of this study was to analyse the perceptions of grief in adults who have lost a family member during the pandemic situation in Metropolitan Lima. Methods Qualitative research with a reflexive thematic analysis design was carried out. Ten adults of both sexes, between 23 and 54 years old, who had lost a family member as a result of COVID-19, during the pandemic period, participated in the study. A semi-structured interview was administered to them. Results The results showed that adults experiencing bereavement due to the loss of a family member in the pandemic scenario perceive their grief at different times. First, there is the impossibility of seeing their loved one due to the biosecurity measures that prevent them from being with their relative, which entails a moment of shock and disbelief;then there is the release of repressed emotions, where dysfunctional thoughts and emotions occur. Later, there is the negotiation of the emotional burden, a period in which there is a reconciliation with the unbridled emotions;followed by the feeling of hopelessness, in which the person experiences deep sadness and lack of meaning in life. Finally, there is an adaptation to the loss. Conclusions It is concluded that the perception of grief in adults who lost a family member in the pandemic forms a cycle of grief perception adjusted to the pandemic context.","Valenzuela Antezana, Pamela, Inglish Bravo, Annie Akiko, Malvaceda-Espinoza, Eli, Mamani-Benito, Oscar, Carranza Esteban, Renzo Felipe","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcp.2022.09.003","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Revista Colombiana de PsiquiatrÃ­a;JOUR","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41326,""
"Senior Americansâ€™ perceptions, attitudes, and safety concerns toward AVs","Introduction: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are considered a promising solution to improve seniorsâ€™ safety and mobility. However, to transition to fully automated transportation, especially among seniors, it is vital to assess their perception and attitude toward AVs. This paper investigates seniorsâ€™ perceptions and attitudes to a wide range of AV options from the perspective of pedestrians and users in general, as well as during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Underlying this objective is to examine older pedestriansâ€™ safety perceptions and behaviors at crosswalks in the presence of AVs. Method: A national survey collected data from a sample of 1,000 senior Americans. Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Cluster Analysis, three clusters of seniors were identified with different demographic characteristics, perceptions, and attitudes toward AVs. Results: PCA findings revealed that â€œrisky pedestrian crossing behavior,â€ â€œcautious pedestrian crossing behavior in the presence of AVs,â€ â€œpositive perception and attitude toward shared AVs,â€ and â€œdemographic characteristicsâ€ were the main components explaining most of the variation within the data, respectively. The PCA factor scores were used in the cluster analysis, which resulted in the identification of three distinctive groups of seniors. Cluster one included individuals with lower demographic scores and a negative perception and attitude toward AVs from the perspective of users and pedestrians. Clusters two and three included individuals with higher demographic scores. Cluster two included individuals with a positive perception toward shared AVs from the user perspective, but a negative attitude toward pedestrian-AV interaction. Cluster three included those with a negative perception toward shared AVs but a somewhat positive attitude toward pedestrian-AV interaction. Practical Applications: The findings of this study provide valuable insights to transportation authorities, AV manufacturers, and researchers regarding older Americanâ€™s perception and attitude toward AVs as well as their willingness to pay and use Advanced Vehicle Technologies.","Doulabi, Saba, Hassan, Hany M.; Li, Bin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsr.2022.10.022","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Safety Research;JOUR","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41327,""
"Risk Factors Associated with Driving After Marijuana Use among US College Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Purpose To assess the sociodemographic and behavioral risk factors associated with driving after marijuana use among US college students. Methods A secondary analysis used the Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 American College Health Association- National College Health Assessment III and the dataset was restricted to college students = 18 years of age who reported recent driving and marijuana use. Associations between risk factors and driving after marijuana use were estimated using multivariable logistic regression. Results A total of 29.9% (n=4,947) of the respondents reported driving after marijuana use. Males (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.64, 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.48-1.82), non-Hispanic Black (AOR: 1.32, 95% CI:1.02-1.71), sexual minorities (AOR:1.19, 95% CI: 1.07-1.31), individuals with an alcohol or substance use disorder (AOR: 1.44, 95% CI:1.08-1.91), anxiety (AOR: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.06-1.36), higher suicidality (AOR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.07-1.31), and those who also drank and drove (AOR: 3.18, 95% CI: 2.84-3.57) had a higher risk of driving after marijuana use. Conclusions Future research should focus on increasing awareness of driving after marijuana use and prevention programs and/or strategies on college campuses regarding driving after marijuana use for these groups to reduce this risky behavior.","Tang, Yuni, Abildso, Christiaan G.; Lilly, Christa L.; Winstanley, Erin L.; Rudisill, Toni Marie","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2022.10.027","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Adolescent Health;JOUR","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41328,""
"Service-level barriers to and facilitators of access to services for the treatment of alcohol use disorder and problematic alcohol use: protocol for a scoping review","Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, substance use health services for treatment of alcohol use disorder and problematic alcohol use (AUD/PAU) were fragmented and challenging to access. The pandemic magnified system weaknesses, often resulting in disruptions of treatment as alcohol use during the pandemic rose. When treatment services were available, utilisation was often low for various reasons. Virtual care was implemented to offset the drop in in-person care, however accessibility was not universal. Identification of the characteristics of treatment services for AUD/PAU that impact accessibility, as perceived by the individuals accessing or providing the services, will provide insights to enable improved access. We will perform a scoping review that will identify characteristics of services for treatment of AUD/PAU that have been identified as barriers to or facilitators of service access from the perspectives of these groups. We will follow scoping review methodological guidance from the Joanna Briggs Institute. Using the OVID platform, we will search Ovid MEDLINE including Epub Ahead of Print and In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Embase Classic+Embase, APA PsychInfo, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and CINAHL (Ebsco Platform). Multiple reviewers will screen citations. We will seek studies reporting data collected from individuals with AUD/PAU or providers of treatment for AUD/PAU on service-level factors affecting access to care. We will map barriers to and facilitators of access to AUD/PAU treatment services identified in the relevant studies, stratified by service type and key measures of inequity across service users. This research will enhance awareness of existing evidence regarding barriers to and facilitators of access to services for the treatment of alcohol use disorder and problematic alcohol use. Findings will be disseminated through publications, conference presentations and a stakeholder meeting. As this is a scoping review of published literature, no ethics approval was required.","Wolfe, Hutton, Corace, Chaiyakunapruk, Ngorsuraches, Nochaiwong, Presseau, Grant, Suschinsky, Skidmore, Bartram, Cohen, Garner, DiGioacchino, Pump, Peters, Konefal, Porath, Thavorn","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-064578","20221121","mental health treatment services; primary care; problematic alcohol use; protocols &amp; guidelines; substance misuse","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41329,""
"Quality improvement project to improve the standardisation and efficiency of occupational therapy initial contact and assessment within a mental health inpatient service","Timely contact and assessment between occupational therapists (OTs) and patients are vital to understanding their needs and creating person-centred interventions. Any delays in completing contact and assessment will likely impact patients' experience and outcomes. The aim of this study was to ensure that 90% of all patients in a male and female ward received OT initial contact within two working days of admission by the end of June 2020.With the teams working in collaboration, the first change idea of increasing the initial contact in two working days was introduced and the impact assessed on two of the five wards. The Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles used for this test of change included: Standardising the initial contact, informal training for the audit tool created to measure the admission process, increasing efficiency for documenting OT contact, updated exclusion/inclusion criteria for OT initial contact, refining documentation for contact and assessment, and the impact of COVID-19 on initial contact and admission processes.Our test of change resulted in an increase in the average initial contact from 12.5% to 71.24%. Following this success, we spread the project to the three remaining wards. Feedback from OTs using the tools we introduced ensured that we made tools as user-friendly as possible. Likewise, teams who achieved particularly high compliance noted the importance of dedicating time to conduct initial contact.Our team embarked on a quality improvement project that aimed to set a standard and increase compliance for achieving this standard. Alongside this, we developed an appropriate and pragmatic measure to track our progress. While we did not achieve 90%, we observed substantial improvements made across the participating service. Using the findings from the project, we have spread this approach to other wards and believe that it could easily be transferrable as a discreet package to other mental health settings.","Ige, Hunt","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjoq-2022-001932","20221121","Mental health; Occupational Therapy; Patient-centred care; Process mapping; Quality improvement","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41330,""

"Remote mental health care interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic: An umbrella review","Mitigating the COVID-19 related disruptions in mental health care services is crucial in a time of increased mental health disorders. Numerous reviews have been conducted on the process of implementing technology-based mental health care during the pandemic. The research question of this umbrella review was to examine what the impact of COVID-19 was on access and delivery of mental health services and how mental health services have changed during the pandemic. A systematic search for systematic reviews and meta-analyses was conducted up to August 12, 2022, and 38 systematic reviews were identified. Main disruptions during COVID-19 were reduced access to outpatient mental health care and reduced admissions and earlier discharge from inpatient care. In response, synchronous telemental health tools such as videoconferencing were used to provide remote care similar to pre-COVID care, and to a lesser extent asynchronous virtual mental health tools such as apps. Implementation of synchronous tools were facilitated by time-efficiency and flexibility during the pandemic but there was a lack of accessibility for specific vulnerable populations. Main barriers among practitioners and patients to use digital mental health tools were poor technological literacy, particularly when preexisting inequalities existed, and beliefs about reduced therapeutic alliance particularly in case of severe mental disorders. Absence of organizational support for technological implementation of digital mental health interventions due to inadequate IT infrastructure, lack of funding, as well as lack of privacy and safety, challenged implementation during COVID-19. Reviews were of low to moderate quality, covered heterogeneously designed primary studies and lacked findings of implementation in low- and middle-income countries. These gaps in the evidence were particularly prevalent in studies conducted early in the pandemic. This umbrella review shows that during the COVID-19 pandemic, practitioners and mental health care institutions mainly used synchronous telemental health tools, and to a lesser degree asynchronous tools to enable continued access to mental health care for patients. Numerous barriers to these tools were identified, and call for further improvements. In addition, more high quality research into comparative effectiveness and working mechanisms may improve scalability of mental health care in general and in future infectious disease outbreaks.","Witteveen, Young, Cuijpers, Ayuso-Mateos, Barbui, Bertolini, Cabello, Cadorin, Downes, Franzoi, Gasior, John, Melchior, McDaid, Palantza, Purgato, Van der Waerden, Wang, Sijbrandij","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brat.2022.104226","20221121","COVID-19; Continuity of care; Implementation; Mental health service delivery; Scalability; e-mental health psychological interventions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41332,""
"European public mental health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic increased multiple risk factors for mental health. Evidence-based, intersectoral public mental health responses are therefore critical. The primary aim of this study was to collate public mental health responses from across Europe. We conducted a cross-sectional survey in March 2021. Participants were public and mental health professionals from across Europe. We developed an online instrument exploring five domains: changes in mental health supports during the pandemic; mental health support for vulnerable groups; multi-sectoral and service-user involvement; published mental health response plans; and perceived quality of overall country response. Fifty-two individuals from 20 European nations responded. Reported changes in mental health supports included an increase in online mental health supports (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°18); but no change in long-term mental health funding (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°13); and a decrease in access to early interventions (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°9). Responses indicated mental health support for vulnerable groups was limited, as was multi-sectoral and service-user involvement. Few national mental health response plans existed (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°9) and 48% of respondents felt their countries mental health response had been 'poor' or 'very poor'. Our results give insights into the changes in mental health support at a country level across Europe during the COVID-19 pandemic. They indicate countries were not prepared to respond and people with existing vulnerabilities were often neglected in response planning. To be prepared for future pandemics and environmental disasters Public Mental Health preparedness plans are highly needed. These must be developed cross-departmentally, and through the meaningful inclusion of vulnerable groups.","Wilson, McDaid, Wieber, Lindert","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckac169","20221121","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41333,""
"On the Frontlines: The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Social Workers' Well-Being","The crisis created by the spread of COVID-19 brought increasing needs and referrals to social welfare services in many countries. However, at the same time, social services suffered from staff cutbacks and service closures, resulting in significant workload increases to address the hardships associated with the pandemic. This article investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Israeli social workers' well-being, using a mixed-methods design with a sample of 2,542 licensed social workers. Findings show that over 70 percent of social workers suffered from at least one health problem related to their work. Path analysis findings indicated that social workers who experienced greater service restrictions reported a greater decrease in job satisfaction and experienced higher levels of stress and work-related problems. Machine learning emotion-detection analysis revealed that the pandemic affected their lives, causing feelings of fear, frustration, and sadness. This article demonstrates how social workers whose work was characterized by greater service restrictions were less satisfied with their jobs, more stressed, and experienced greater job-related health problems, and concludes with a discussion of the implications for social work practice in times of crisis.","Schwartz Tayri","https://doi.org/10.1093/sw/swac050","20221121","COVID-19 pandemic; machine learning emotion detection; moral distress; moral injury; social work services","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41334,""
"A Smartphone-Based Intervention for Anxiety and Depression in Racially and Ethnically Diverse Adults (EASE): Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial","Clear health disparities have emerged in rates of COVID-19 exposure, hospitalization, and death among Black, Hispanic, and American Indian (BHAI) individuals, relative to Non-Hispanic White (NHW) individuals. BHAI populations have been disproportionately affected by lower behavioral health access and heightened negative mental health outcomes during the pandemic. The current project directly addresses health disparities in access to behavioral health care during the COVID-19 pandemic among BHAI populations via an adaptation of the established, initially validated, low-cost, mobile application (i.e., Easing Anxiety Sensitivity for Everyone; EASE) among individuals with elevated anxiety and/or depression symptoms. The EASE trial is a 2-arm, prospective, randomized, blinded-assessor study with intention-to-treat analysis. Participants (N = 800; 200 Black, 200 Hispanic, 200 American Indian, and 200 NHW) are randomized to receive either EASE or an active comparison condition for anxiety and depression. Participants compete an online pre-screener, an enrollment call to provide informed consent, a baseline survey, a 6-month intervention period, and 3- and 6-month post-baseline assessments. Select participants also complete a 3- and 6-month post-baseline qualitative interview via phone or online platform (e.g., Zoom). Participants complete two scheduled daily ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) during the 6-month study period. These twice daily EMAs guide a just-in-time approach to immediate, personalized behavioral health care. Outcomes include reductions in anxiety and depressive symptoms and functional impairment at 3- and 6-months post-randomization. We also will examine putative mechanisms (e.g., AS and COVID-19 specific stress and fear) of the intervention effects. Further, as treatment effects may differ across sociocultural factors, perceived discrimination, social support, and socioeconomic status will be evaluated as potential moderators of treatment effects on the primary outcomes. Process evaluation using data collected during the study, as well as individual interviews with participants will complement quantitative data. Data from the current efficacy trial will determine if EASE successfully improves symptoms of anxiety and depression, and if these improvements outperform an active comparison control app. If successful, findings from the present study have the potential to decrease anxiety and depression symptoms among vulnerable populations determined to be most at risk of exacerbated, long-lasting negative health sequelae. Data from the current study may be used to support an implementation and dissemination trial of EASE within ""real-world"" behavioral health and social service settings.

"Soap or alcohol-based products? The effect of hand hygiene on skin characteristics during the COVID-19 pandemic","Different strategies for hand skin hygiene have been used to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, frequent hand sanitization has been associated with skin damage. The present study aimed to evaluate hand hygiene habits during the COVID-19 pandemic and the effect of the repetitive use of soap or alcohol-based products on skin characteristics. We conducted a survey regards hand hygiene habits acquired during the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, we performed cutometry in a cohort of individuals who cleansed their volar forearms every 30Ã¢â‚¬â€°min, during 4Ã‚Â h, using soap or alcohol-based products. We received 138 responses from people with medium-high educational level who reported a 2.5-time increase in the frequency of hand cleansing (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001) that resulted in skin damage. An in vivo analysis of skin moisture and elasticity was also performed among 19 health workers and students. In general, skin moisture decreased with every cleansing, mainly after 2Ã‚Â h of washing with soap (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01), while skin elasticity only reduced after 4Ã‚Â h of treatment (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Alcohol-based solution or alcohol-based gel (70% ethanol, both) did not affect skin moisture or elasticity during testing. It is known that the excessive use of soap or alcohol-based products causes dermatological issues. The present study demonstrates that non-medicated soap significantly affects skin moisture and elasticity, probably because the soap removes the hydrolipidic protective barrier, favoring transepidermal water loss, where the lack of the appropriate stratum corneum hydration also affects skin elasticity, mainly associated with changes in epidermal structure.","Chopin-Doroteo, KrÃƒÂ¶tzsch","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocd.15523","20221121","hand sanitization; health workers; skin elasticity; skin irritation; skin moisture","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41336,""
"Burden of mental distress in the US associated with trust in media for COVID-19 information","During the COVID-19 pandemic, news and social media outlets have played a major role in dissemination of information. This analysis aimed to study the association between trust in social and traditional media and experiences of mental distress among a representative sample of US adults. Data for this study came from National Pandemic Pulse, a cross-sectional, nationally representative survey that sampled participants on the Dynata platform. Participants included 6435 adults surveyed between 15-23 December 2020. Ordinal logistic regression analyses examined the associations of trust in (i) social media, (ii) print media, (iii) broadcast TV and (iv) cable TV, for COVID-19-related information with self-reported mental distress (4-item Patient Health Questionnaire), controlling for sociodemographics and census region. Compared with those who distrusted social media, those who trusted social media had 2.09 times (95% CI = 1.84-2.37) greater adjusted odds of being in a more severe category of mental distress. In contrast, compared with those who distrusted print media, those who trusted print media had 0.80 times (95% CI = 0.69-0.93) lower adjusted odds of being in a more severe category of mental distress. No significant associations were found between mental distress and trust in broadcast or cable TV for accessing news about COVID-19. Trust in different news outlets may be associated with mental distress during public health emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic. Future studies should explore mechanisms behind these associations, including adherence to best practices for crisis reporting among different media sources and exposure of individuals to misinformation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, both, traditional channels like print, TV and cable news, as well as social media, have been major sources to obtain news about the pandemic. In this manuscript, we study the association between trust in social and traditional media and symptoms of mental distress among a nationally representative sample of 6435 US adults surveyed in December 2020. Our findings show that those who reported trusting traditional print media were less likely to report more severe mental distress. Conversely, those who reported trusting social media were more likely to report more severe levels of mental distress. This highlights the urgent need for understanding the diffusion patterns of misinformation and rumors that circulate on social media, and consumersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ reactions to them. It is important that during a public health emergency, we follow best practices for crisis communication to reduce panic, address uncertainty, promote protective behaviors and mental health.","Jalan, Riehm, Agarwal, Gibson, Labrique, Thrul","https://doi.org/10.1093/heapro/daac162","20221121","COVID-19; mental distress; trust in media; trust in social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41337,""
"Frontline experiences of delivering remote mental health supports during the COVID-19 pandemic in Scotland: innovations, insights and lessons learned from mental health workers","COVID-19 restrictions drove rapid adaptations to service delivery and new ways of working within Scotland's mental health sector. This study explores mental health workers' (MHWs') experiences of delivering their services remotely. Twenty participants, who had worked in mental health professions in the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, took part in online semi-structured interviews. Data was transcribed then analysed using an inductive thematic analysis. Two major themes are reported: (1) '<i>Improved Flexibility for both MHWs and Service Users</i>' and (2) '<i>Teletherapies Challenge Therapeutic Boundaries'</i>. In relation to (1) virtual platforms were seen as vital in maintaining patient care throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and a valuable resource for service users (SUs) who had previously struggled with mobility or social anxieties when accessing face-to-face services. Some MHWs' also noted benefits for their productivity and comfort. Regarding (2) MHWs highlighted that whilst conducting teletherapies from home, work-life boundaries became blurred and, in some instances, typically comforting spaces became associated with the traumatic content discussed by SUs. These stressors seemed to be compounded by MHWs' isolation, as they were less able to draw upon their colleagues for support. Further, confidentiality could not be assured, as MHWs and SUs alike had to accommodate their family members. These findings highlight important insights from MHWs in adapting to rapid changes in mental health working practices, particularly in relation to the challenges of delivering quality, safe and equitable services and the increased use of teletherapies. Such insights are vital in informing service developments and supporting future pandemic preparedness across a range of healthcare contexts and countries seeking to adopt hybrid models of mental health service delivery.","Griffith, Archbold, SÃƒÂ¡ez Berruga, Smith, Deakin, Cogan, Tanner, Flowers","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2022.2148698","20221121","COVID-19; digital mental health; mental health workers; psychological support; staff wellbeing; teletherapy; trauma informed practices","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41338,""
"[Did the COVID-19 pandemic change the care situation of older adults?]","The study examined changes in giving and receiving care by community-dwelling older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 compared to a period about two years before. Using data collected in two waves by the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (N = 1013), we study how many and which older adults report a change in care use and provision and how these changes impact on psychological well-being. The results show that only for a small part of the sample changes occurred. The large majority provides no care (73%) or uses no care (62%) in both waves. 7% stayed a care provider during the pandemic, where 15% quitted care provision and 5% started care provision. 17% remained a care user, where 15% did not receive care anymore and 6% started to use care. The informal carers mainly consisted of women and younger elderly in good health and the care recipients were mainly women and older elderly in poorer health. Using care had a negative impact on psychological well-being, but providing care was not related to wellbeing during the pandemic. The results imply that the pandemic and the measures taken affected the care situation of only a small part of the older adults. Dit onderzoek vergelijkt het geven en het ontvangen van zorg aan huis door ouderen ten tijde van de COVID-19 pandemie in 2020 met een periode ongeveer twee jaar daarvoor.

De resultaten tonen dat er weinig is veranderd in de zorgsituatie van ouderen. De overgrote meerderheid geeft op beide metingen geen zorg (73%) of krijgt geen zorg (62%). 7% is zorg aan anderen blijven geven, terwijl 15% daarmee is gestopt en 5% met zorgverlening is gestart. 17% bleef zorg ontvangen, terwijl 15% geen zorg meer kreeg, en 6% voor het eerst zorg ontving. De mantelzorgers bestaan voornamelijk uit vrouwen en jongere ouderen met een goede gezondheid en de zorgontvangers zijn voornamelijk vrouwen en oudere ouderen met een slechtere gezondheid. Het krijgen van zorg heeft een significant negatieve invloed op het psychisch welbevinden, maar het geven van zorg heeft geen effect op welbevinden.

"[Violent death in association with the COVID-19 pandemic]","Globally, there is talk of excess mortality due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study is to examine whether this excess mortality is not only caused by fatal disease progression, but also by violent deaths associated with the pandemic. In aÃ‚Â retrospective study, 825 autopsy reports from the Leipzig Institute for Forensic Medicine for the year 2020 were evaluated, including 72Ã‚Â suicides and 14Ã‚Â homicides, which were examined for aÃ‚Â connection to the COVID-19 pandemic.

"The COVID-19 Pandemic and Mental Health Concerns on Twitter in the United States","During the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health concerns (such as fear and loneliness) have been actively discussed on social media. We aim to examine mental health discussions on Twitter during the COVID-19 pandemic in the US and infer the demographic composition of Twitter users who had mental health concerns. COVID-19-related tweets from March 5<sup>th</sup>, 2020, to January 31<sup>st</sup>, 2021, were collected through Twitter streaming API using keywords (i.e., ""corona,"" ""covid19,"" and ""covid""). By further filtering using keywords (i.e., ""depress,"" ""failure,"" and ""hopeless""), we extracted mental health-related tweets from the US. Topic modeling using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model was conducted to monitor users' discussions surrounding mental health concerns. Deep learning algorithms were performed to infer the demographic composition of Twitter users who had mental health concerns during the pandemic. We observed a positive correlation between mental health concerns on Twitter and the COVID-19 pandemic in the US. Topic modeling showed that ""stay-at-home,"" ""death poll,"" and ""politics and policy"" were the most popular topics in COVID-19 mental health tweets. Among Twitter users who had mental health concerns during the pandemic, Males, White, and 30-49 age group people were more likely to express mental health concerns. In addition, Twitter users from the east and west coast had more mental health concerns. The COVID-19 pandemic has a significant impact on mental health concerns on Twitter in the US.

"Risk perception of COVID-19 among college students in China: Latent profile analysis","The outbreak of the new coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) has had a significant impact on people's mental and physical health. Meanwhile, people's perceptions of risk may influence their emotional states and preventative behavior during an epidemic. Previous research have revealed the diversity and uniqueness of risk perception, and college students may have a different perspective on risk perception. The objective of this study was to describe the subtypes of risk perception for COVID-19 among college students in China, identify the subtypes' traits, and investigate their affecting variables. College students from 10 Chinese provinces participated in a cross-sectional study (<i>n</i> = 2,000) that from January 16 to 30, 2022. The latent profiles and influencing factors for risk perception were investigated using latent profile analysis, one-way analysis of variance, and multinomial logistical regression. The sample group of this survey was 1,946 students, and the response rate was 97.3%. The best model was suggested to consist of three profiles: ""neutral risk perception"" (20.3%), ""perception seriously without susceptible"" (52.8%), and ""low risk perception"" (26.9%). Risk perception of COVID-19 was positively associated with attention to negation information (<i>r</i> = 0.372, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), anxiety (<i>r</i> = 0.232, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), and depression (<i>r</i> = 0.241, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), and negatively associated with perceived social support (<i>r</i> = -0.151, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Logistic-regressions analyses mainly revealed that the risk perception of three profiles related to having chronic diseases (<i>OR</i> = 2.704, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), medical major (<i>OR</i> = 0.595, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01; <i>OR</i> = 0.614, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), without having COVID-19 confirmed cases around (<i>OR</i> = 0.539, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), attention to negative information (<i>OR</i> = 1.073, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001; <i>OR</i> = 1.092, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and perceived social support (<i>OR</i> = 0.0.975, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). The level of risk perception for COVID-19 among Chinese college students was unsatisfactory, and the risk perception of COVID-19 had significant group characteristics and heterogeneity.

"Stress, anxiety, and depression in times of COVID-19: Gender, individual quarantine, pandemic duration and employment","This study explores the inter-relationship between emotional distress in adults and gender, quarantine experiences, pandemic duration, and employment. An online cross-sectional online survey comprised 943 Israelis. The link to the survey was distributed <i>via</i> different personal and academic social networking sites (e.g., Facebook, WhatsApp, and Twitter). The survey was administered using the online survey portal Google Forms. Participants addressed questions about their socio-demographic characteristics (e.g., gender, age, family status, employment, and quarantine experiences) and ranked their levels of stress, anxiety, and depression using the Hebrew version of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-DASS-21. The majority of the respondents (72%) were women, 39% experienced quarantine, and 55% were unemployed. About 42% experienced a short-term pandemic (one lockdown), and the rest experienced a continuous pandemic (two lockdowns). The MANCOVA results, controlling for family status, indicated that women and unemployed participants reported higher stress, anxiety, and depression levels than men and employed participants. Participants who experienced individual quarantine reported higher anxiety and depression. Furthermore, there was a significant interaction between gender, employment, and pandemic duration. The experience of individual quarantine intensified the stress, anxiety, and depression for both employed and unemployed women. Conversely, the quarantine intensified stress, anxiety, and depression only for unemployed men, whereas the quarantine did not affect stress, anxiety, and depression among employed men. Employment is a critical factor regarding men's emotional state during such stressful situations as the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, individual quarantine and long-term pandemics are associated with opposite outcomes regarding individual mental health. The individual quarantine is associated with increased anxiety and depression, while a long-term, continuous pandemic is associated with decreased stress.","Levy","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.999795","20221122","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; employment; gender; pandemic duration; stress; Humans; Adult; Female; Male; Pandemics; Quarantine; COVID-19; Depression; Cross-Sectional Studies; Stress, Psychological; Communicable Disease Control; Anxiety; Employment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41344,""
"Injury mortality and morbidity changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States","The COVID-19 pandemic significantly changed society. We aimed to examine the systematic impact of the COVID-19 on injury burden in the United States. We extracted mortality and morbidity data from CDC WONDER and WISQARS. We estimated age-standardized injury mortality rate ratio and morbidity rate ratio (MtRR and MbRR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for all injuries, all unintentional injuries, homicide/assault by all methods, suicide/self-harm by all methods, as well as other 11 specific unintentional or intentional injury categories. Injury rate ratios were compared for 2020 vs. 2019 to those of 2019 vs. 2018 to demonstrate the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on fatal and nonfatal injury burden. The ratio of MtRRs (RMtRR) and the ratio of MbRRs (RMbRR) with 95% CI between 2020 vs. 2019 and 2019 vs. 2018 were calculated separately. The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with an increase in injury mortality (RMtRR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.11, 1.13) but injury morbidity decreased (RMbRR = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.88, 0.89) when the changes of these rates from 2019 to 2020 were compared to those from 2018 to 2019. Mortality disparities between the two time periods were primarily driven by greater mortality during the COVID-influenced 2020 vs. 2019 from road traffic crashes (particularly motorcyclist mortality), drug poisoning, and homicide by firearm. Similar patterns were not present from 2019 vs. 2018. There were morbidity reductions from road traffic crashes (particularly occupant and pedestrian morbidity from motor vehicle crashes), unintentional falls, and self-harm by suffocation from 2019 to 2020 compared to the previous period. Change patterns in sexes and age groups were generally similar, but exceptions were observed for some injury types. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly changed specific injury burden in the United States. Some discrepancies also existed across sex and age groups, meriting attention of injury researchers and policymakers to tailor injury prevention strategies to particular populations and the environmental contexts citizens face.","He, Ning, Schwebel, Yang, Li, Cheng, Rao, Hu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.1001567","20221122","COVID-19 pandemic; United States; injury; morbidity; mortality; Humans; United States; COVID-19; Pandemics; Morbidity; Accidents, Traffic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41345,""
"A network analysis of anxiety and depression symptoms among Chinese nurses in the late stage of the COVID-19 pandemic","Nurses are at high risk for depression and anxiety symptoms after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to assess the network structure of anxiety and depression symptoms among Chinese nurses in the late stage of this pandemic. A total of 6,183 nurses were recruited across China from Oct 2020 to Apr 2021 through snowball sampling. We used Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale-7 (GAD-7) to assess depression and anxiety, respectively. We used the Ising model to estimate the network. The index ""expected influence"" and ""bridge expected influence"" were applied to determine the central symptoms and bridge symptoms of the anxiety-depression network. We tested the stability and accuracy of the network <i>via</i> the case-dropping procedure and non-parametric bootstrapping procedure. The network had excellent stability and accuracy. Central symptoms included ""restlessness"", ""trouble relaxing"", ""sad mood"", and ""uncontrollable worry"". ""Restlessness"", ""nervous"", and ""suicidal thoughts"" served as bridge symptoms. Restlessness emerged as the strongest central and bridge symptom in the anxiety-depression network of nurses. Intervention on depression and anxiety symptoms in nurses should prioritize this symptom.","Peng, Chen, Liang, Liu, Chen, Wang, Yang, Wang, Li, Wang, Hao, He, Wang, Zhang, Ma, He, Zhou, Li, Xu, Long, Qi, Tang, Liao, Tang, Wu, Liu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.996386","20221122","COVID-19 pandemic; anxiety; depression; network analysis; nurse; Humans; Depression; Pandemics; COVID-19; Anxiety Disorders; Anxiety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41346,""
"Psychological impact on healthcare workers, general population and affected individuals of SARS and COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Any infectious disease outbreak may lead to a negative detrimental psychological impact on individuals and the community at large, however; there was no systematic review nor meta-analysis that examined the relationship between the psychological/mental health impact of SARS and COVID-19 outbreak in Asia. A systematic search was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases from 1/1/2000 to 1/6/2020. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we analyzed the psychological impact on confirmed/suspected cases, healthcare workers and the general public during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak and Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemics. Primary outcomes included prevalence of depression, anxiety, stress, post-traumatic stress disorder, aggression, sleeping problems and psychological symptoms. Twenty-three eligible studies (<i>N</i> = 27,325) were included. Random effect model was used to analyze the data using STATA. Of these studies, 11 were related to the SARS outbreak and 12 related to COVID-19 outbreaks. The overall prevalence rate of anxiety during SARS and COVID-19 was 37.8% (95% CI: 21.1-54.5, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001, I2 = 96.9%) and 34.8% (95% CI: 29.1-40.4), respectively. For depression, the overall prevalence rate during SARS and COVID-19 was 30.9% (95% CI: 18.6-43.1, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001, I2 = 97.3%) and 32.4% (95% CI: 19.8-45.0, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001, I2 = 99.8%), respectively. The overall prevalence rate of stress was 9.4% (95% CI: -0.4 -19.2, <i>P</i> = 0.015, I2 = 83.3%) and 54.1% (95% CI: 35.7-72.6, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001, I2 = 98.8%) during SARS and COVID-19, respectively. The overall prevalence of PTSD was 15.1% (95% CI: 8.2-22.0, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) during SARS epidemic, calculated by random-effects model (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), with significant between-study heterogeneity (I2 = 93.5%). The SARS and COVID-19 epidemics have brought about high levels of psychological distress to individuals. Psychological interventions and contingent digital mental health platform should be promptly established nationwide for continuous surveillance of the increasing prevalence of negative psychological symptoms.

"Contesting views on mobility restrictions in urban green spaces amid COVID-19-Insights from Twitter in Latin America and Spain","Positive sentiments towards urban green spaces (UGS) unequivocally increased worldwide amid COVID-19. In contrast, this paper documents that views on mobility restrictions applicable to UGS are of a contested nature. That is, while residents unambiguously report positive sentiments towards UGS, they do not share views on how to administer access to UGS-which is a matter of public policy. These contesting views reflect opposite demands that managers of UGS had to balance during the pandemic as they faced the challenge of reducing risk of spread while providing services that support physical and mental health of residents. The empirical analysis in this paper relies on views inferred through a text classification algorithm implemented on Twitter messages posted from January to October 2020, by urban residents in three Latin American countries-Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico-and Spain. The focus on Latin America is motivated by the documented lack of compliance with mobility restrictions; Spain works as a comparison point to learn differences with respect to other regions. Understanding and following in real-time the evolution of contesting views amid a pandemic is useful for managers and city planners to inform adaptation measures-e.g. communication strategies can be tailored to residents with specific views.","Sainz-Santamaria, Moctezuma, Martinez-Cruz, TÃƒÂ©llez, Graff, Miranda-JimÃƒÂ©nez","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2022.104094","20221121","COVID-19; Latin America; Mobility restrictions; Twitter; Urban green spaces; Views","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41348,""
"UK Higher Education staff experiences of moral injury during the COVID-19 pandemic","Jonathan Shay argued that social, relational, and institutional contexts were central to understanding moral injury and conceptualised moral injury as a normative response to the betrayal of an individual's understanding of what is right by a more senior/authoritative ""other"". Using the conceptual lens of moral injury, this paper investigates academic staff experiences of HE during the COVID-19 pandemic and explores the rapid transition back to face-to-face teaching that took place in autumn 2020. To collect data, we used an online survey that opened in January 2021 and ran until the end of March 2021. A total of 663 complete questionnaires were received across the survey period. The questionnaire was comprised of ten topic-related questions, each of which included follow-up sub-questions and also invited participants to write in additional information. The majority of participants felt that during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, they had acted in ways that put their own health and wellbeing at risk. Of those who had acted in ways that put their health and wellbeing at risk, they believed that their senior management were the most responsible for them acting in such ways, followed by the UK government. Qualitative data showed a systemic absence of leadership in the sector during the time, a sense of betrayal of staff and students by senior management and the government, and feelings of compulsion to act in ways which put lives at risk. On the basis of these results, we argue that there could be synergies between the situation facing healthcare staff and academics during the pandemic. Many of the experiences of HE academic staff during the pandemic reported to us in this research are resonant with the concepts of betrayal and moral injury and resulted in affective responses which we understand here in relation to feelings of guilt, shame, and anger, leading ultimately to poor mental health and wellbeing. This paper discusses implications for the HE sector going forward.","Hanna, Erickson, Walker","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10734-022-00956-z","20221121","COVID-19; Higher education; Management; Moral injury; Staff experiences","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41349,""
"On the privacy of mental health apps: An empirical investigation and its implications for app development","An increasing number of mental health services are now offered through mobile health (mHealth) systems, such as in mobile applications (apps). Although there is an unprecedented growth in the adoption of mental health services, partly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns about data privacy risks due to security breaches are also increasing. Whilst some studies have analyzed mHealth apps from different angles, including security, there is relatively little evidence for data privacy issues that may exist in mHealth apps used for mental health services, whose recipients can be particularly vulnerable. This paper reports an empirical study aimed at systematically identifying and understanding data privacy incorporated in mental health apps. We analyzed 27 top-ranked mental health apps from Google Play Store. Our methodology enabled us to perform an in-depth privacy analysis of the apps, covering static and dynamic analysis, data sharing behaviour, server-side tests, privacy impact assessment requests, and privacy policy evaluation. Furthermore, we mapped the findings to the LINDDUN threat taxonomy, describing how threats manifest on the studied apps. The findings reveal important data privacy issues such as unnecessary permissions, insecure cryptography implementations, and leaks of personal data and credentials in logs and web requests. There is also a high risk of user profiling as the apps' development do not provide foolproof mechanisms against linkability, detectability and identifiability. Data sharing among 3rd-parties and advertisers in the current apps' ecosystem aggravates this situation. Based on the empirical findings of this study, we provide recommendations to be considered by different stakeholders of mHealth apps in general and apps developers in particular. We conclude that while developers ought to be more knowledgeable in considering and addressing privacy issues, users and health professionals can also play a role by demanding privacy-friendly apps.

"A global mental health opportunity: How can cultural concepts of distress broaden the construct of immobility?","(Im)mobility studies often focus on people on the move, neglecting those who stay, are immobile, or are trapped. The duality of the COVID-19 pandemic and the climate crisis creates a global mental health challenge, impacting the most structurally oppressed, including immobile populations. The construct of immobility is investigated in the context of socio-political variables but lacks examination of the clinical psychological factors that impact immobility. Research is beginning to identify self-reported emotions that immobile populations experience through describing metaphors like <i>feeling trapped</i>. This article identifies links in the literature between Cultural Concepts of Distress drawn from transcultural psychiatry and immobility studies. <i>Feeling trapped</i> is described in mental health research widely. Among (im)mobile people and non-mobility contexts, populations experience various mental health conditions from depression to the cultural syndrome, nervios. The connection of <i>feeling trapped</i> to CCD research lends itself to potential utility in immobility research. The conceptualisation can support broadening and deepening the comprehension of this global mental health challenge - how immobile populations' experience <i>feeling trapped</i>. To broaden the analytical framework of immobility and incorporate CCD, evidence is needed to fill the gaps on the psychological aspects of immobility research.","Harasym, Raju, Ayeb-Karlsson","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2022.102594","20221121","Climate change; Cultural concepts of distress; Global mental health; Immobility; Migration; Trapped populations","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41351,""
"Do sentiments of professors feedback change after migrating from in-person to online modalities? Pre- and during COVID-19 experience","The COVID-19 pandemic forced higher education institutions to alter how they offer classes at an unprecedented pace. Due to ambiguities and lockdown restrictions, the transition phase negatively impacted students' and professors emotions. As a result, lecturers had to cope with unfamiliar online class teaching responsibilities and develop new teaching dynamics. This work aims to analyze one of the most adversely affected procedures of teaching, the written feedback provided to students. This research strives to explore whether the professors' feedback style altered from face-to-face education to online education on digital platforms during the COVID-19 restrictions. This exploratory-design study uses a mixed methodology to explain the subject on hand based on data collected from 117 undergraduate students. Sentiment lexicographers are utilized to address and identify the emotions expressed in the texts. Trust was the most frequent emotion expressed in face-to-face and online courses. It is also observed that the sentiments of joy and sadness changed significantly among online and face-to-face groups based on the professors' feedback style and approach. Finally, the study reveals that the joy words and the sadness words associated with the learning process are the most commonly utilized sentiments. This study suggests that when the courses transitioned from face-to-face to online learning, the professors' feedback changed to a more positive feeling that expressed appreciation for the students' work, encouraging them to strive for their complete academic development, and usher them into a better learning environment.","RodrÃƒÂ­guez-GalvÃƒÂ¡n, Abbas, Ar, Garza-GonzÃƒÂ¡lez, Alonso-Galicia","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10209-022-00943-2","20221121","COVID-19; Educational innovation; Feedback; Higher education; Professors; Sentiment analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41352,""
"Food insecurity associated with self-reported mental health outcomes in Peruvian households during the COVID-19 pandemic","The global pandemic of COVID-19 and the social distancing efforts implemented worldwide to limit its spread have disrupted the economy, increased food insecurity, and mental health problems. The aim of this study was to determine the association between food insecurity and mental health outcomes (stress, depression, and anxiety) in Peruvian households during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional investigation was conducted with 525 participants of both sexes (68% women), over 18 years of age and from the three geographic regions of Peru: Coast (54.9%), Highlands (28.4%), and Jungle (16.8%). The data were collected during the year 2021, between July 6 and September 22 through a self-administered online survey designed to assess socio-demographic, socioeconomic, food insecurity, and mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety, and stress). The majority of households (71.4%) experienced some degree of food insecurity. Mild food insecurity was the most frequent, affecting 49.1%, followed by moderate 15.4%, and severe 6.9%. Regarding mental health outcomes, 24.8% manifested depression, 26.7% anxiety, and 15.3% stress. With respect to the association between the level of food insecurity and anxiety, this was highly significant (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Households with mild, moderate and severe food insecurity are 2.04, 4.5, and 10.44 times, respectively, more likely to have moderate-severe anxiety. On the other hand, the mild food insecurity was not associated with moderate-severe depression. In contrast, households with moderate and severe food insecurity are 2.8 and 5.7 times, respectively, more likely to have moderate-severe depression. Finally, households with moderate food insecurity are 5.9 times more likely to have moderate-severe stress, and households with severe food insecurity are 8.5 times more likely to have moderate-severe stress, both having a highly significant association (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). In conclusion, during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Peru, household food insecurity was independently associated with worse mental health outcomes. Monitoring of both food insecurity and mental health will be important as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.","Anampa-Canales, Huancahuire-Vega, Newball-Noriega, Morales-GarcÃƒÂ­a, Galvez","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2022.1005170","20221121","COVID-19; Peru; food insecurity; pandemic; perceived mental health; self-report","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41353,""
"Trauma-Informed Care in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit: Through the Lens of the COVID-19 Pandemic","Trauma is rooted in an individual's experience of an event that leads to physical or mental harm and can have a long-lasting, unfavorable effect on their well-being and functioning. Being aware of the effects of trauma, recognizing its signs, understanding how it informs individual responses, and actively trying to prevent re-traumatization are the tenets of trauma-informed care. Admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is widely considered to be an extremely stressful time for parents and infants alike. With the emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there were significant changes in healthcare delivery. Widespread closures, restrictions due to infection control measures, the spread of misinformation, increased psychosocial hardships, and amplification of cultural, gender, and racial biases intensified NICU-related stressors. Adoption of the principles of trauma-informed care, as defined by the Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration, to the NICU can help buffer some of these stressors. We present a review of these principles viewed through the lens of the COVID-19 pandemic. The lessons learned will help inform practices and policies and allow us to navigate similar challenges more effectively in the future.","Arya, Zutshi","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.30307","20221121","covid-19 retro; neonate; nicu; pandemic; trauma-informed care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41354,""

This single-center retrospective observational study was conducted at a university hospital. The subjects were patients who were transported to a ""tertiary emergency department"" receiving advanced medical care. With January 16, 2020, as the cutoff date, 4,197 patients who were transported to the hospital from January 16, 2019, to January 15, 2021, were recruited. The patients were classified into nine disease groups using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision. The emergency department (ED) visit count in 2020 was compared with that in 2019 using Poisson regression. The number of patients transported to the tertiary ED in 2020 decreased by 7.8% compared with that in 2019. The number of patients transported to the tertiary ED decreased compared with that in the previous year during the period when the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Japan increased and showed the opposite trend when the number of confirmed cases decreased. As per diagnostic classification, it decreased for all diagnoses except External causes, and significant decreases were observed in Infectious (47.5%), Non-COVID-19 respiratory (28.4%), and Trauma (25.2%). In External causes, the rate of change for suicide cases alone increased to 43.2%. While the number of confirmed cases increased, the number of tertiary ED patients associated with COVID-19 decreased temporarily. It is necessary to fully consider the burden on medical institutions 1-2 months after the number of infected people peaks.

"Cutting the Chain of Discrimination during COVID-19 Pandemic by Health Literacy","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic resulted in discrimination against patients and healthcare workers in the beginning. As more information about COVID-19 prevention became available, discrimination toward the patients and healthcare workers gradually reduced. Instead, people wearing masks in the general public were heavily discriminated when mask-wearing was recommended only for healthcare workers. After the universal use of masks was recommended, discrimination against those who were wearing masks decreased and increased among those who do not wear masks. However, due to the introduction of vaccine passports, the target for discrimination has shifted to people who have not received COVID-19 vaccines. Narrowing vaccine disparity could prevent discrimination toward unvaccinated people. However, some people are hesitating vaccination or cannot be vaccinated because of their health status. These people will remain targets for discrimination even if vaccines were equally distributed. To prevent discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic, improving health literacy of the population could be effective in two ways. First, health literacy could reduce vaccine hesitancy by enabling people to critically evaluate vaccine information. Second, health literacy enables people to respect decisions of others to avoid vaccination. Therefore, interventions improving health literacy have the potential to contribute to cutting the chain of discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Fujii, Fujimura, Ong, Jimba","https://doi.org/10.31662/jmaj.2022-0073","20221121","COVID-19; Discrimination; Health literacy; Infodemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41356,""

"Is indoor and outdoor greenery associated with fewer depressive symptoms during COVID-19 lockdowns? A mechanistic study in Shanghai, China","Increasing numbers of studies have observed that indoor and outdoor greenery are associated with fewer depressive symptoms during COVID-19 lockdowns. However, most of these studies examined direct associations without sufficient attention to underlying pathways. Furthermore, few studies have combined different types of indoor and outdoor greenery to examine their effects on the alleviation of depressive symptoms. The present study hypothesized that indoor and outdoor exposure to greenery increased the perceived restorativeness of home environments, which, in turn, reduced loneliness, COVID-related fears, and, ultimately, depressive symptoms. To test our hypotheses, we conducted an online survey with 386 respondents in Shanghai, China, from April to May 2022, which corresponded to strict citywide lockdowns that resulted from the outbreak of the Omicron variant. Indoor greenery measures included the number of house plants, gardening activities, and digital nature exposure as well as semantic image segmentation applied to photographs from the most viewed windows to quantify indoor exposure to outdoor trees and grass. Outdoor greenery measures included total vegetative cover (normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI]) within a 300Ã‚Â m radius from the home and perceived quality of the community's greenery. Associations between greenery and depressive symptoms/clinical levels of depression, as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), were examined using generalized linear and logistic regression models. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test pathways between greenery exposure, restorativeness, loneliness, fear of COVID-19, and depressive symptoms. The results showed that: 1) indoor and outdoor greenery were associated with fewer depressive symptoms; 2) greenery could increase the restorativeness of the home environment, which, in turn, was associated with fewer COVID-related mental stressors (i.e., loneliness and fear of COVID-19), and ultimately depressive symptoms; and 3) gender, education, and income did not modify associations between greenery and depressive symptoms. These findings are among the first to combine objective and subjective measures of greenery within and outside of the home and document their effects on mental health during lockdowns. Comprehensive enhancements of greenery in living environments could be nature-based solutions for mitigating COVID-19 related mental stressors.","Zhang, Browning, Liu, Cheng, Zhao, Dadvand","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2022.109799","20221121","Fear of COVID-19; Loneliness; Machine learning; Nature exposure; Visual access","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41358,""
"The Impact of School Education on Depressive Symptoms in Chinese Adolescents: a Prospective Longitudinal Study","There is a growing but limited literature on psychological distress among Chinese students, especially the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, using a longitudinal comparison between in school and at home. This study aimed to assess the psychological status of adolescents in school and related risk and protective factors. We surveyed 13,637 adolescents before the COVID-19 outbreak (T1) and 10,216 after two months of home confinement (T2). The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to assess depressive symptoms or the severity of depression among the adolescents. In addition, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scales were also used to screen for experiences of abuse and neglect and to measure resilience in adolescents. At baseline, 22.34% reported depressive symptoms. At T2, this rate decreased to 14.86%. When adolescents were in school, age (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.0001), gender (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.0001), and experience of abuse (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.0001) were risk factors, while parent-child relationship (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.0001), and resilience (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.0001) were protective factors for depressive symptoms.

"Bending not breaking: coping among Filipino University students experiencing psychological distress during the Global Health Crisis","The impact of the global health crisis on students' mental health has been well documented. While most of the studies looked into the psychological impact of the coronavirus disease, the process of coping with psychological distress as experienced by university students in the Philippines remains unexamined. Cognizant of the dearth in literature, this grounded theory study purports to investigate and understand the coping processes among 20 Filipino university students. A comprehensive model highlights Filipino university students' coping techniques with psychological distress through vertical and horizontal analysis of the field text, open, axial, and selective coding. To ensure the trustworthiness and truthfulness of the theory and for refinement and consistency, triangulation, peer debriefing, and member checking validation strategies were likewise employed. The novel and distinct B.E.N.D. Model of Coping with Psychological Distress illustrates a substantive four-phased process symbolic of the challenges that a bamboo tree underwent, namely: (1) <b>B</b>efuddling Phase, (2) <b>E</b>nduring Phase, (3) <b>N</b>avigating Phase, and (4) <b>D</b>eveloping Phase.

"The fear of COVID-19 and flourishing: the mediating role of search for meaning and presence of meaning","Past researches have found that sense of control and meaning in life can act as a protective factor against fear of COVID-19 pandemic. The current study examined whether the search for meaning and the presence of meaning could mediate the link between fear of COVID-19 and flourishing. A total of 312 Iranians who were identified by snowball sampling were recruited as the subjects of the cross-sectional study. The participants gave their consent to complete the Meaning in Life Scale, Flourishing Scale, and Fear of COVID-19 Scale. The findings demonstrated that fear of COVID-19 had a significant direct effect on flourishing. The presence meaning was positively and significantly connected with flourishing and the search for meaning. Both the search for - and the presence - of meaning were negatively and significantly linked with fear of COVID-19. Mediation analysis demonstrated that a presence of meaning is a protective factor for flourishing, but the search for meaning can be detrimental to flourishing. As a result, it may be worthwhile to conduct longitudinal research to track how the effects of the presence of meaning and the search for meaning vary over time. The study calls on mental health providers to take into account how the presence of meaning might lessen the negative impacts of fear in crisis situations and promote flourishing.","Elemo, Kara, Rostamzadeh","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-03872-8","20221121","Fear of COVID-19; Flourishing; Iran; Meaning in life; Presence of meaning; Search for meaning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41361,""
"The relationship between big five personality traits, coping strategies, and emotional problems through the COVID-19 pandemic","Considering the impact of pandemic condition on mental health and functioning in daily life, the main purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between Big Five personality traits, coping strategies and emotional problems such as symptoms of depression and anxiety, during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Specifically, the purpose of this study is to create a model of the impact of coping strategies as mediating factors in the relationship between Big Five personality traits personality traits and emotional problems. For the purposes of this study, a sample of 200 Kosovar respondents was used, where the age of the participants varies from 18 to 54 years. As a result of the pandemic situation created, the method of data collection for this study was done in the form of self-reporting, divided into physical questionnaires and online ones. The BFI Personality Inventory is used to classify Big Five personality traits, the Coping Control Checklist (WCCL) to classify coping strategies, and the Adult Self-Reporting Questionnaire (ASR) used to identify emotional problems. The analysis of the results in this study was done by means of the statistical package of SPSS and R program. After the analysis, it is seen that there is a significant correlation between Big Five personality traits (extraversion and neuroticism) and coping strategies (seeking social support and avoidance), as well as there is a correlation between Big Five personality traits (compliance and neuroticism) and emotional problems (symptoms of anxiety and depression). An association was also found between coping strategies (avoidance) and emotional problems (anxiety symptoms). As for gender differences in experiencing anxiety and depression symptoms and using desired thoughts as coping strategies, it was found that women are more predisposed to experience anxiety symptoms and use desired thoughts than men. The findings highlighted the part that coping strategies are significant mediator factors in the relationship between Big Five personality traits and emotional problems.","Gashi, Gallopeni, Imeri, Shahini, Bahtiri","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-03944-9","20221121","ASR; BFI; COVID-19; Coping strategies; Emotional problems; Mediating factors; Personality; WCCL","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41362,""
"Psychological-health correlates of physical activity and sedentary behaviour during the COVID pandemic","While physical inactivity is associated with adverse psychological outcomes, less is known about the psychological outcomes associated with sedentary behaviour, and specifically, its mentally active and passive forms. The COVID-19 pandemic represents a unique opportunity to study associations between these variables in light of widespread stay-at-home mandates and restrictions on outdoor exercise/social activities. Using a cross-sectional dataset acquired during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, we examined whether physical activity and sedentary behaviour were associated with subjective quality of life (sQoL) and subjective cognitive dysfunction, and whether these associations were mediated by depressive symptoms. 658 participants (malesÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 169, femalesÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 489) self-reported data on physical activity and sedentary behaviour in an online survey during May 2020-May 2021. Data on physical activity and sedentary behaviour (both mentally active and passive types) was compared according to whether it was collected during or out of a lockdown period. Regression models were used to test associations of physical activity and sedentary behaviour with sQoL and subjective cognitive dysfunction, and whether these associations were mediated by depression severity. Physical activity was beneficially associated with sQoL, whereas sedentary behaviour (both total hours and the reduction of mentally active/increase in mentally passive behaviour) was detrimentally associated with sQoL. These associations were mediated by depression severity. Physical activity and sedentary behaviour were also indirectly associated with subjective cognitive dysfunction by virtue of their associations with depression severity. There are important differences in the psychological correlates of mentally passive and active sedentary behaviours. Our findings suggest that health promotion strategies should focus on not only increasing physical activity but also reducing <i>passive</i> sedentary behaviours as a means of maintaining good psychological health.","Ringin, Meyer, Neill, Phillipou, Tan, Toh, Sumner, Owen, Hallgren, Dunstan, Rossell, Van Rheenen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mhpa.2022.100481","20221121","COVID-19; Depression; Mentally active sedentary behaviour; Mentally passive sedentary behaviour; Subjective cognitive dysfunction; Subjective quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41363,""

"Using Natural Language Processing to Explore Mental Health Insights From UK Tweets During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Infodemiology Study","There is need to consider the value of soft intelligence, leveraged using accessible natural language processing (NLP) tools, as a source of analyzed evidence to support public health research outputs and decision-making. The aim of this study was to explore the value of soft intelligence analyzed using NLP. As a case study, we selected and used a commercially available NLP platform to identify, collect, and interrogate a large collection of UK tweets relating to mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. A search strategy comprised of a list of terms related to mental health, COVID-19, and lockdown restrictions was developed to prospectively collate relevant tweets via Twitter's advanced search application programming interface over a 24-week period. We deployed a readily and commercially available NLP platform to explore tweet frequency and sentiment across the United Kingdom and identify key topics of discussion. A series of keyword filters were used to clean the initial data retrieved and also set up to track specific mental health problems. All collated tweets were anonymized. We identified and analyzed 286,902 tweets posted from UK user accounts from July 23, 2020 to January 6, 2021. The average sentiment score was 50%, suggesting overall neutral sentiment across all tweets over the study period. Major fluctuations in volume (between 12,622 and 51,340) and sentiment (between 25% and 49%) appeared to coincide with key changes to any local and/or national social distancing measures. Tweets around mental health were polarizing, discussed with both positive and negative sentiment. Key topics of consistent discussion over the study period included the impact of the pandemic on people's mental health (both positively and negatively), fear and anxiety over lockdowns, and anger and mistrust toward the government. Using an NLP platform, we were able to rapidly mine and analyze emerging health-related insights from UK tweets into how the pandemic may be impacting people's mental health and well-being. This type of real-time analyzed evidence could act as a useful intelligence source that agencies, local leaders, and health care decision makers can potentially draw from, particularly during a health crisis.","Marshall, Lanyi, Green, Wilkins, Pearson, Craig","https://doi.org/10.2196/32449","20221121","COVID-19; Twitter; artificial intelligence; lockdown; machine learning; mental health; natural language processing; sentiment; soft intelligence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41366,""

"Coping with Coronavirus Pandemic: Risk Perception Predicts Life Optimism","Given that the coronavirus pandemic has become a severe concern worldwide, how can optimism be maintained during an outbreak of a collective pandemic? We propose that perceived control and negative affect could be potential explanatory factors for optimism in the face of a pandemic. In Study 1 (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°599), through a large-scale cross-sectional design, we showed the indirect effect of risk perception on optimism through perceived control and negative affect with structural equation modeling. In Study 2 (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°191), we manipulated perceived risk of the pandemic and determined that experiencing a high-risk pandemic psychologically led to decreased optimism. Finally, through Study 3 (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°186) and Study 4 (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°217), we revealed that the effect of risk perception on optimism can be extended to overall subjective well-being and confirmed the indirect effects via perceived control and negative affect. These findings indicate that risk perception can make a difference in one's life optimism during a high-risk pandemic. Moreover, perceived control and negative affect are notable intermediary variables. Measures that strengthen publicity and transparency regarding recovery rates should be taken to help reduce public perceptions of risk and promote an optimistic life attitude.","Cheng, Liao","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10902-022-00583-6","20221121","COVID-19; Negative affect; Optimism; Perceived control; Risk perception","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41368,""

"Status of stigma on the health care workers related to COVID-19 at the first wave of the pandemic in Iran: A qualitative study","Stigma can be seen as a mark of disgrace that can lead to the separation of one person from another. In this qualitative study, we assess the status of stigma among in front-line health care workers (HCWs) during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran. The participants were selected from frontline HCWs related to COVID-19 in Imam Ali and Imam Hossein referral hospitals in Alborz province, Iran. Study was conducted between May and June 2020. The 32-item checklist Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) was used to report this qualitative study. Interview questions were prepared based on the grounded theory method. The thematic approach was used to analyze the data content. Data analysis was based on open and axial coding and after implementing the codes in MAXQDA software. The results of this study included 4 themes, 8 categories and 33 sub-categories. Themes included extrinsic and intrinsic elements of stigma, perplexity and stigma removal requirements. Extrinsic elements included ""creating blame and shame"" and ""discrimination"" categories. Intrinsic elements included ""the desire to be avoidance,"" ""feeling depressed and frustrated"" and ""feeling anxious and scared"" categories. Perplexity included ""feeling loss"" category. Stigma removal requirements included ""factors causing stigma"" and ""protective agents against stigma"" categories. Low public awareness on COVID-19 and inadequate public care, limited personal protective equipment and inadequate facilities for HCWs along with lack of appreciation for their efforts, lack of proper psychiatric/psychological counseling to identify and treat symptoms associated with mental health and the limitations of training to maintain mental health skills are considered to be factors in the formation of stigma among HCWs related to COVID-19.

A good example of this is the use of telemedicine following the breakdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous experiences with telemedicine (TM) have not been significantly explored in relation to the professionals' own perspectives. Identify and explore the perceptions and interests of mental health professionals who have performed TM during the period of pandemia. A questionnaire on mental health professionals' perceptions of and satisfaction of TM, the Font Roja Work Satisfaction Questionnaire, was adapted and used. Data collected included 112 Psychiatric Service professionals who conducted TM in March 2020, after the country had been under lockdown for 10 weeks. Over 12.000 medical consultations were carried out by the phone, showing an overwhelming response to this method. High levels of satisfaction were recorded amongst professionals. TM would function as a complement to the traditional system of face-to-face visits (n-112, f-109, 96.5%). Only 9.7% (f-11) believed that digital or virtual interventions would completely replace face-to-face visits. 60.8% did not consider this monotonous work. The older the health workers were, the more satisfied they felt during their follow-up telephone consultation. The greater the previous experience, the more satisfaction was shown. There were gender differences: female mental health workers reported a greater level of comfort. TM can be implemented with less effort, but it requires time, methods, and resources to be managed. Satisfaction among professionals is high, especially among those with more clinical experience.

"COVID-19-related financial strain and adolescent mental health","The COVID-19 pandemic and associated responses have induced a host of crises worldwide, including an economic recession and a global mental health crisis. The specific effects of recession on youth mental health are understudied. We aimed to examine the mechanisms by which pandemic-related financial strain may affect mental health in a diverse sample of American adolescents. We analyzed data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (ABCD StudyÃ‚Â®), a large, longitudinal study of diverse US adolescents which collected data before and during the pandemic (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 9,720, mean age 12.9 years, 18.2% Black). Linear mixed-effects models tested associations of financial strain (parent-reported household wage loss and youth-reported financial stress) with depressive symptomatology over time, covarying for multiple confounders including pre-pandemic socioeconomic status and psychopathology, and pandemic-related environmental factors. Longitudinal mediation analyses examined potential mechanisms leading from wage loss to youth mental health. Financial strain was highly prevalent, especially among low-income participants, with &gt;70% of the total sample reporting lost wages. Both wage loss and subjective financial stress were associated with depressive symptomatology over time (EstimateÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.04, PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.014; EstimateÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.17, PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001; respectively). The association between financial stress and depressive symptomatology was robust to the addition of multiple environmental confounders (EstimateÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.16, PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). Both family-level (family conflict) and individual-level (financial stress) factors mediated the relationship between wage loss and depressive symptomatology. The financial effects of COVID-19 (and worldwide responses to it) have taken a significant toll on youth mental health. In families that lost wages, youth-reported financial stress and familial factors mediated the relationship between wage loss and mental health over time. Findings highlight financial stress as a key driver of youth mental health burden and identify familial factors as critical targets for intervention to mitigate mental health risks in periods of economic crises.

"Children's excessive digital media use, mental health problems and the protective role of parenting during COVID-19","COVID-19's outbreak in March 2020 and the social distancing measures that followed it changed the lives of children worldwide. Studies assessing the pandemic's implications for children have reported an alarming increase in the use of digital media (DM) and warned of its adverse impacts on children's functioning and development. The current study aimed to assess the relationship between excessive and problematic DM use and emotional, behavioral, and academic functioning among Israeli adolescents during COVID-19 and to identify adolescents at elevated risk of developing problematic DM use. Three hundred forty-seven Israeli parent-child dyads (<i>M age</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 11.81, <i>SD</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.41) separately completed measures assessing children's DM use (time and addiction), functioning (academic, social, emotional, and behavioral), behavioral dysregulation, and the parents' parenting practices. The results showed that DM addiction, but not DM use, was related to children's emotional, behavioral, and academic difficulties. Moreover, the results indicated that negative parenting and behavioral dysregulation increased the risk of DM addiction, which in turn increased emotional, behavioral, and academic difficulties. The results underscored parents' role in preventing problematic DM use and highlighted the need to treat DM use and problematic DM use as distinct constructs.","Shutzman, Gershy","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2022.107559","20221121","COVID-19; Digital media; Emotional and behavioral difficulties; ParentÃ¢â‚¬â€œchild relationship; Screen addiction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41375,""
"Language and Acculturation: Neuropsychological Sequalae of COVID-19 in Indian Americans","Coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19) has significant mental health and neuropsychological consequences, but data are insufficient on these specific implications of COVID-19, especially for Indian American patients. Few studies have critically explored risk factors and neuropsychological assessment considerations from a cultural and linguistic perspective, including how they impact the evaluation process for Indian Americans. The present paper focuses on cultural and linguistic considerations for case conceptualization, ethical challenges for best practices, and a specific example with a middle-aged Indian American woman. The need for a greater contextual understanding is emphasized as a step forward in establishing methodological and procedural guidelines for working with patients of Indian descent in the United States.","Shamji, Hundal, Irani, Sunderaraman","https://doi.org/10.1007/s42843-022-00071-8","20221121","Cross-cultural neuropsychology; Culture; Indian Americans; Language proficiency","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41376,""

"Salivary mental stress biomarkers in COVID-19 patients","During the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health disorders and level of stress show a major increase compared to before the pandemic. Coronavirus-related stress is recently the leading cause of negative impacts on global mental health. Thus, maintaining positive mental health is as important as maintaining physical health during COVID-19. The aim of this study was to analyze salivary mental stress biomarkers as cortisol, alpha-amylase, and chromogranin A in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 to compare their potential relationship with stress symptoms. A total of 80 adult hospitalized patients with moderate COVID-19 disease and a control group (<i>n</i> = 80) randomly selected were conducted as participants. Saliva cortisol (sCort), saliva alpha-amylase (sAA), and saliva and chromogranin A (sCgA) were determined by the ELISA method (Bio Vendor, USA). Symptoms of stress were measured with a stress symptom checklist (SSCL). The patients group presented significantly higher levels of sCort, sAA, and sCgA compared with the control group. The correlation analysis showed a positive correlation with strong strength between sCort and sAA (<i>r</i> = 0.934, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), as well as sAA with sCgA (<i>r</i> = 0.714, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). A moderate positive correlation was found between sCort with sCgA (<i>r</i> = 0.618, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Based on their stress scores from the SSCL the patients were associated with high stress level (30.00%) and very high stress levels (67.5%). In terms of the controls, all the participants showed a low to moderate stress level. We found significant positive correlation between levels of stress and salivary biomarkers. Data from our study demonstrated that salivary biomarkers are promising tools of exploring COVID-19 related stress.","Deneva, Ianakiev, Boykinova","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2022.999215","20221121","COVID-19; mental stress; saliva alpha-amylase; saliva and chromogranin A; saliva cortisol; salivary biomarkers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41378,""
"Emojis and Emoticons in Health Care and Dermatology Communication: Narrative Review","Emoticons and emojis have become staple additions to modern-day communication. These graphical icons are now embedded in daily society through the various forms of popular social media and through users' personal electronic conversations. With ever-increasing use and inclusivity, exploration of the possible health care and dermatology applications of these tools is imperative. The goal of this narrative review was to provide and evaluate an up-to-date literature survey examining the utility of emoticons and emojis in medicine. Special attention was paid to their existing and potential uses in the field of dermatology, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. A PubMed search of peer-reviewed publications was performed in mid-2021 to collect articles with emoticon or emoji keywords in combination with other health care-relevant or dermatology-relevant keywords. Screening of publications and described studies was performed by the authors with education and research experience in health care, dermatology, social media, and electronic communication trends. Selected articles were grouped based on common subjects for qualitative analysis and presentation for in-depth discussion. From this extensive search, researchers were able to identify a wide variety of publications detailing the use of emoticons and emojis in general health care, pediatric health care, public health, and dermatology. Key subject areas that emerged from the investigation included the ability of emoticons and emojis to improve communication within pediatric health care, enhance mood and psychological assessment or mental health screening in adults, develop interventions to improve patient medication adherence, complement novel means of public health and COVID-19 surveillance, and bolster dermatology-specific applications. This review illuminated the repurposing of emojis and emoticons for a myriad of advantageous functions in health care and public health, with applications studied in many populations and situations. Dermatology-specific uses were relatively sparse in the literature, highlighting potential opportunities for growth in future studies and practices. The importance of diversity and inclusivity has extended to emojis, with the recent introduction of skin color customization and new emojis better representing the comprehensive spectrum of users' experiences. A continuously evolving and technology-driven population creates a unique niche for emoticons and emojis to ease worldwide communication and understanding, transcending the barriers of age, language, and background. We encourage future studies and innovations to better understand and expand their utility.","Szeto, Barber, Ranpariya, Anderson, Hatch, Ward, Aguilera, Hassan, Hamp, Coolman, Dellavalle","https://doi.org/10.2196/33851","20221121","COVID-19; Skin of Color; dermatology; emojis; emoticons; literature review; medicine; mobile phone; narrative review; public health; social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41379,""
"Factors affecting tobacco, nicotine, and cannabis product use among California young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative study","The effects of COVID-19 on tobacco and cannabis use have been variable, and it is unclear the extent to which factors affecting changes in tobacco and cannabis use differ. The purpose of this study was to identify the COVID-19-related factors that affect changes in tobacco and cannabis use during the pandemic. Focus groups with 114 young adults in California in April 2021 were held to discuss tobacco and cannabis use patterns, adverse events, and the effect of COVID-19 on tobacco and cannabis product use. Factors affecting changes in use were largely similar between tobacco products and cannabis products. Increases in product use were a result of changing social environment, coping with emotional and psychological distress, and product related factors. Decreases in product use were a result of social isolation, COVID-19-related health concerns, disruptions in daily patterns of living, and reduced access. Drivers of increased cannabis use distinct from tobacco or nicotine product use included feeling greater freedom to disengage and perceptions of less harm. Improved understanding of how the pandemic has affected tobacco and cannabis use can inform tailored interventions to both support those who have decreased or quit and assist those who have increased use during the pandemic to reduce or cease their consumption.","Yang, Pacheco, Mackey","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.abrep.2022.100470","20221121","COVID-19; Cannabis; Nicotine; Tobacco","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41380,""
"Psychological health, wellbeing and COVID-19: Comparing previously infected and non-infected South African employees","Most COVID-19 and work-related well-being research is centred around the adverse effects on employees' psychological well-being and is not focused on the work-related well-being of those infected by SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, COVID-19 and work-related well-being research is generally aimed at healthcare workers. The current study focused on investigating the difference in the level of burnout, anxiety, depression and stress between previously infected and uninfected participants. This study used a cross-sectional survey design and non-probability quota sampling to collect data. A retrospective pre-post design was used to determine the difference between the level of burnout of the participants before and after infection. Working adults in South Africa were targeted and divided into those previously infected (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°245) and those not yet infected with COVID-19 (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°221). Participants completed questionnaires relating to burnout, depression, anxiety, and stress. A comparison of means revealed a significant increase in burnout after being infected. Infected participants had significantly higher burnout, anxiety, depression, and stress levels than their non-infected counterparts. Emotional exhaustion, withdrawal, and stress were the most prevalent psychological ill-health problems. The results of this study indicated that a SARS-CoV-2 infection has a detrimental impact on participants' psychological well-being and mental health compared to their own initially reported levels of burnout before infection, as well as compared to the levels of burnout, depression, anxiety and depression of the non-infected participants. Based on the findings, specific recommendations to industrial psychologists were made to manage the psychological impact of COVID-19 on employees.","Hill","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1013377","20221121","DASS-21; SARS-CoV-2; burnout; infected employees; mental health; psychological well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41381,""
"Development and evaluation of psychoeducational resources for adult carers to emotionally support young people impacted by wars: A community case study","Wars and armed conflicts have a devastating impact at the economic, social, and individual level. Millions of children and adolescents are forced to bear their disastrous consequences, also in terms of mental health. Their effects are even more complicated when intertwined with those of other disasters such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. To help them face such adverse events, lay adults can be supported by psychoeducational interventions involving simple tools to assist children and adolescents emotionally. Hence, we planned and implemented two public communication campaigns concerning wars to support adult carers such as parents, teachers, educators, psychologists, first responders, and others interested in young people's wellbeing. We developed psychoeducational materials to help children and adolescents cope with negative emotions related to indirect and direct exposure to wars. This study had the objective to identify the content for two pamphlets, testing their comprehensibility, usability, and utility, and monitoring their dissemination. First, based on classifications of coping strategies and on a previous campaign about COVID-19 pandemic, we decided to include in the psychoeducational materials basic information on news about wars and common reactions to wars, respectively; on emotions that might be experienced; and on coping strategies for dealing with negative emotions. For the first pamphlet, we identified the strategies involving 141 adults. They completed an online survey with open-ended questions concerning ways to help children and adolescents cope with negative emotions associated with the Russia-Ukraine war. For the second pamphlet, we selected the contents based on Psychological First Aid manuals. Through content analyses, we chose 24 strategies. Second, data gathered with 108 adults who had consulted the psychoeducational materials supported their comprehensibility, usability, and utility. Third, we monitored the visibility of the campaigns after the release of the pamphlets, using Google AnalyticsÃ¢â€žÂ¢ data from the HEMOT<sup>Ã‚Â®</sup> website through which we disseminated them. To conclude, our findings supported the comprehensibility, the usability, and the utility of the two pamphlets, to be disseminated as psychoeducational materials in the early phase of a disaster.","Vicentini, Burro, Rocca, Lonardi, Hall, Raccanello","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.995232","20221121","adolescents; children; communication campaigns; coping strategies; emotions; psychoeducation; victims; wars","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41382,""
"Characteristics of the school adaptation of college freshmen during the COVID-19 epidemic","Few studies have actually explored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in college students, although many studies have suggested that the COVID-19 pandemic poses a great threat to people's mental health in many cohorts. Furthermore, college students may be a particularly vulnerable cohort that needs more attention and access to psychological services due to the psychological changes involved in the transition to college and the characteristics of college students' study habits and lifestyle. Therefore, investigating the basic characteristics of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on college freshmen is of great practical importance and has theoretical implications for the identification and provisioning of services to vulnerable cohorts. A total of 5,818 college freshmen completed the College Student Adaptability Inventory. The results suggest that the mean detection rate of the seven dimensions of undergraduate maladjustment to university is 27.13%. Specifically, livelihood self-management adaptability has the highest detection rate (48.93%), while environmental general evaluation has the lowest detection rate (9.81%). Moreover, the school adaptation of college freshmen is impacted by gender, number of siblings, and family socioeconomic status (SES). Specifically, students who are female, an only child, and have a lower SES have lower levels of school adaptation. However, the school adaptation of college freshmen is not influenced by minority status or left-behind status. The findings of the present study suggest that the maladaptation of college freshmen has been a common phenomenon in China during the COVID-19 epidemic. Prevention programs may be most helpful if they pay more attention to effective intervention efforts for students who are female, an only child, and have a lower SES.","Niu, Ren, Li","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.915403","20221121","COVID-19 epidemic; characteristics; college freshmen; detection rate; school adaptation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41383,""
"Teachers' demographic and occupational attributes predict feelings of hopelessness during the COVID-19 pandemic","The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in many emotional consequences for teachers, including feelings of isolation, loneliness, and hopelessness. However, evidence on the prevalence of hopelessness and the associated factors in teachers during the pandemic is limited. The purpose of this research was to examine the prevalence of hopelessness in public school teachers and identify risk factors associated with it. A sample of 168 teachers aged 25-49 years participated in the study by completing the Socio-Demographic Questionnaire, the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), and the Multi-Dimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). The results revealed a moderate level of experienced hopelessness in teachers. Hopelessness prevalence was also significantly different across teacher gender (malesÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°79%), age groups (&gt;40Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°77%), socioeconomic status (poor socioeconomic statusÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°70%), educational level (high school teachersÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°79%), professional experience (experienced teachersÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°82%), and perceived social support (low perceived social supportÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°79%). The results of a logistic regression analysis confirmed the effects of these demographic and occupational attributes on hopelessness by explaining ~71% of the variance in hopelessness feelings. Higher odds ratios were associated with age, socioeconomic status, and perceived social support, signifying the prominence of these factors in predicting hopelessness. The study contributes to identifying and screening teachers at risk of hopelessness in public schools and recommends promoting collegial/superior support as well as a positive school climate as the protective factors against hopelessness.","Ghasemi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.913894","20221121","COVID-19 pandemic; hopelessness; occupational attributes; perceived social support; public school teachers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41384,""
"Fear, depression, and well-being during COVID-19 in German and South African students: A cross-cultural comparison","Various studies have shown a decrease in well-being and an increase in mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, only a few studies have explored fear, depression, and well-being cross-culturally during this time. Accordingly, we present the results of a cross-cultural study that (1) compares these mental health scores for German and South African students, (2) compares the correlations among them, and (3) identifies COVID-19 fear, well-being, and depression predictors. German and South African societies differ from each other socio-culturally, politically, and economically. Their university systems also differ to a large extent. University students in both countries completed the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, the World Health Organization-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Welch's <i>t</i>-test, correlation, and multiple regression analyses were performed. (1) German students were found to have statistically lower levels of COVID-19 fear and depression, but lower levels of general well-being than South African students. (2) In both samples, fear of COVID-19 was negatively correlated with well-being and positively associated with female gender and depression. (3) Additionally, female gender, depression, and lower well-being were identified as predictors of COVID-19 fear in both samples. The findings indicate that the fear of COVID-19 is associated with and varies according to gender, depression, and well-being across cultures, and that the difference in the intensity of fear between German and South African students may be partly explained by cultural and contextual differences. These findings can create a deeper understanding of the pandemic's impact on student communities and may be used by mental health practitioners and researchers to develop and apply culture-specific interventions.","Holm-Hadulla, Mayer, Wendler, Kremer, Kotera, Herpertz","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.920125","20221121","COVID-19; Germany; South Africa; cross-culture; depression; fear; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41385,""
"Perceived stress and associated factors among university students in Ethiopia during the late stage of the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study","During extensive outbreaks of infectious diseases, people who are impacted, particularly the subgroups of the community who are at an increased risk of mental health problems, may experience increased stress and mental health difficulties. University students are one such susceptible population and are prone to experiencing high levels of stress as compared with the general population. Therefore, this study aimed at assessing perceived stress and identifying its associated factors among university students in Ethiopia during the late stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study was conducted among university students in Ethiopia from 30 May to 30 June 2021. Students were asked to fill out an online survey on Google Forms that included consent, sociodemographic information, the UCLA-8 Loneliness Scale, the standard validated stress scale (PSS-10) questionnaire, and the three-item Oslo Social Support Scale (OSSS-3) to assess social support. The collected data were exported to SPSS 26. Descriptive and analytical statistics were carried out. Binary and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to find associated factors, and variables with a <i>p</i>-value of 0.05 were considered statistically significant variables. A total of 426 university students were included in the survey, among whom 268 (62.9%) were male participants. The age of the participants ranged from 18 to 37 years. Health-related departments accounted for 37.1% of the participants, while non-health-related departments accounted for 62.9%. The prevalence of stress was 18.3% in the study population. In this study, extreme susceptibility to COVID-19, sleeping problems, poor self-efficacy to prevent COVID-19, and loneliness were significantly associated with perceived stress. Stress was prevalent among university students in Ethiopia during the late stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Extreme susceptibility to COVID-19, sleeping problems, poor self-efficacy, and loneliness were identified as factors for stress.

"The impact of COVID-19 perceived threat and restrictive measures on mental health in Italy, Spain, New York, and Hong Kong: An international multisite study","In the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, Italy, Spain, New York, and Hong Kong stood out for the ir high rates of infections. Given this scenario, a web-based international multisite and cross-sectional study was conducted between April and May 2020 to investigate the psychological impact of the pandemic and the restrictions imposed by the governments in these countries. We expected similar patterns in European countries, and no significant differences in terms of psychological impairment between Hong Kong (with a previous experience related to SARS, but subjected to restrictions for a longer time) and the other areas. Participants were 1955 adults from the above-mentioned areas. We assessed anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), COVID-19-related threats, and perceived burden of restrictive measures. Two-explorative factor analyses (EFAs) with Promax rotation identified COVID-19-related factors: personal physical threat, personal economic threat, global economic threat, and restriction-related burden. ANOVAs studied locations' differences and two-separate hierarchical multiple regression analyses by location determined whether and how COVID-19-related variables were associated with anxiety and depression, adjusting for age and sex. Italy and Hong Kong showed higher anxiety than Spain (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05); Hong Kong scored higher on depression than Italy and Spain (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), which highlighted the lowest mean-score.

"Social distancing and trouble sleeping during COVID-19 pandemic among older adults in Europe: Mediating and moderating effects","We examined the association between social distancing and trouble sleeping during the COVID-19 outbreak in adults 65+, and underlying potential mechanisms. We used data from the extensive Survey of Health, Aging, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). Logistic regression analysis tested the direct and indirect associations between social distancing and trouble sleeping during the pandemic, the mediation effect of depression, and the moderating-mediation effects of perceived economic status and employment status. Social distancing was associated with a higher probability of sleeping problems, partially mediated by depression and moderated by employment status and perceived economic status. Depression had a greater effect on trouble sleeping among those unemployed and those who perceived their economic status as difficult or partially difficult. COVID-19 policy of lockdowns and physical distancing has negative consequences on sleeping and the development of depressive symptoms among older adults. Clinicians should be aware of sleep problems in older adults during the pandemic and after, and try to reduce depressive symptoms. Policymakers should determine future policies and regulations that encourage employment among older adults and improve their economic resilience during pandemics.","Khalaila, Shiovitz-Ezra","https://doi.org/10.1111/jnu.12830","20221121","COVID-19; depression; economic resilience; sleep deficits","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41388,""
"Impact of the Care and Coercion Act on recorded involuntary care in intellectual disability care: a time-series analysis","On 1 January 2020, the Care and Coercion Act came into effect in the Netherlands, subjecting involuntary care to more strict regulations and monitoring. This study tested changes in recordings of involuntary care during the transitional year of 2020 and after full implementation in 2021, which coincided with the first severe test of the new regulations, when COVID-19 lockdown measures were taken on 16 March 2020. Data consisted of weekly counts of involuntary care from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2021, taken from the care data of more than 3000 clients with intellectual disabilities and challenging behaviour of 's Heeren Loo, a large long-term care organisation in the Netherlands. An interrupted time series design was used to compare the period under the former law with the period under the new law and to the period during and after implementation, taking into account the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown measures on recordings of involuntary care. Under the new act in Week 1 of 2020, a statistically significant drop occurred in involuntary care counts, after which these counts gradually decreased. The start of 2021, the year in which the act was fully implemented, showed an initial increase in counts of involuntary care, followed by a decrease (all PsÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001). The introduction of the COVID-19 lockdown measures did not statistically affect the weekly counts of involuntary care. The decrease in registered involuntary care after the Care and Coercion Act came into effect is a first indication of the efficacy of this new law that requires careful multidisciplinary consultations around the right of clients to respect their self-determination. Follow-up research should examine whether the impact of the new law aligns with clients' experiences of self-determination.","Bakkum, Bisschops, Lagerweij, Schuengel","https://doi.org/10.1111/jir.12991","20221121","COVID-19; Care and Coercion Act; intellectual disabilities; involuntary care; legislation; restrictive measures","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41389,""
"Coping with the COVID-19 pandemic by Paralympic athletes preparing for elite sport events: a longitudinal study","This study investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, coping styles and their relationship, and training opportunities in elite athletes with disabilities (AwD) preparing for national and international sport events during a ten-month observation period. The study covered four time points in 3-month intervals, one retrospective, and three times during the 10 months of the pandemic period with diversified numbers of average new infections per day: A - pre-pandemic, B - third wave of the pandemic (mean=15,681), C - decrease of the pandemic (mean=102), and D - fourth wave of the pandemic (mean=22,591). Main outcome measures included the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The models regarding changes in anxiety (F(<sub>3,72)</sub> =22.43; p&lt;.001; partial ÃŽÂ·2=.48) and depression (F<sub>(3,72)</sub> =23.82; p&lt;.001; partial ÃŽÂ·<sup>2</sup> =.50) over the four time points of examination were significant. The pattern of relationship between coping styles and mood changes during COVID-19 pandemic periods, i.e., a sudden increase in anxiety during dynamic growth of infections (waves of a pandemic) and a steady increase in depression over the course of the pandemic was not found. The difference in planned and actual training decreased significantly over time (p&lt;.001). During the transitionary times of the COVID-19 pandemic, both mental health and training opportunities of AwD were at increased risk. Individual coping styles used by AwD were insufficient resources to cope with the extreme stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Their mental health should be monitored in pandemics and similar situations to ensure appropriate and timely organizational and psychological intervention.","UrbaÃ…â€žski, Rogoza, Brewer, Tasiemski","https://doi.org/10.1111/sms.14270","20221120","COVID-19; anxiety; athletes with disabilities; coping; depression; mental health; training performance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41390,""
"Fibrotic-like abnormalities notably prevalent one year after hospitalization with COVID-19","We investigated whether COVID-19 leads to persistent impaired pulmonary function, fibrotic-like abnormalities or psychological symptoms 12 months after discharge and whether severely ill patients (ICU admission) recover differently than moderately ill patients. This single-centre cohort study followed adult COVID-19 survivors for a period of one year after discharge. Patients underwent pulmonary function tests 6 weeks, 3 months and 12 months after discharge and were psychologically evaluated at 6 weeks and 12 months. Computed tomography (CT) was performed after 3 months and 12 months. 66 patients were analysed, their median age was 60.5 (IQR: 54-69) years, 46 (70%) patients were male. 38 (58%) patients had moderate disease and 28 (42%) patients had severe disease. Most patients had spirometric values within normal range after 12 months of follow-up. 12 (23%) patients still had an impaired lung diffusion after 12 months. Impaired pulmonary diffusion capacity was associated with residual CT abnormalities (OR 5.1,CI-95: 1.2-22.2), shortness of breath (OR 7.0, CI-95: 1.6-29.7) and with functional limitations (OR 5.8, CI-95: 1.4-23.8). Ground-glass opacities resolved in most patients during follow-up. Resorption of reticulation, bronchiectasis and curvilinear bands was rare and independent of disease severity. 81% of severely ill patients and 37% of moderately ill patients showed residual abnormalities after 12 months (OR 8.1, CI-95: 2.5-26.4). A minority of patients had symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression and cognitive failure during follow-up. Some patients still had impaired lung diffusion 12 months after discharge and fibrotic-like residual abnormalities were notably prevalent, especially in severely ill patients.","van Raaij, StÃƒÂ¶ger, Hinnen, Penfornis, de Jong, Klok, Roukens, Veldhuijzen, Arbous, Noordam, Marges, Geelhoed","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resmer.2022.100973","20221120","COVID-19; Chest imaging; Pulmonary fibrosis; Pulmonary function; Respiratory infection","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41391,""
"D2/D3 Receptor Agonism: Paving the Way for a New Therapeutic Target for Taste Disorders in Parkinson's Disease and Other Conditions?","Chemosensory (i.e., olfaction and taste) dysfunction is common in neurodegenerative (e.g., Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and dementia), psychiatric (e.g., depression, bipolar disorders, other conditions), and postinfectious (i.e., long COVID) diseases and in the elderly. Despite its impact on patients' quality of life, no established treatment for taste disorders exists so far. A recent report on the effect of pramipexole, a D2/D3 agonist, on taste performance in healthy participants provides support for a new potential therapeutic target for taste dysfunction to be tested in future randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trials across several populations reporting gustatory symptoms.","Mantovani, Tamburin","https://doi.org/10.1093/ijnp/pyac042","20221121","D2/D3 receptor agonism; ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease; pramipexole; taste disorders; treatment; Humans; Aged; Pramipexole; Dopamine Agonists; Receptors, Dopamine D3; Parkinson Disease; Dopamine; Healthy Volunteers; COVID-19; Taste; Quality of Life; Benzothiazoles; Taste Disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","",41392,""
