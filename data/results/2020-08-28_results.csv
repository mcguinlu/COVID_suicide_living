In this study, we aim to evaluate mental health symptoms among head and neck surgeons in Brazil surrounding the time it was declared the epicenter of the virus. A cross-sectional, survey-based study evaluating burnout, anxiety, distress, and depression among head and neck surgeons in Brazil, assessed through the single-item Mini-Z burnout assessment, 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised, and 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire, respectively. 163 physicians completed the survey (74.2% males). Anxiety, distress, burnout, and depression symptoms were reported in 74 (45.5%), 43 (26.3%), 24 (14.7%), and 26 (16.0%) physicians, respectively. On multivariable analysis, female physicians were more likely to report a positive screening for burnout compared to males (OR 2.88, CI [1.07-7.74]). Physicians 45Ã‚Â years or older were less likely to experience anxiety symptoms than those younger than 45Ã‚Â years (OR 0.40, CI [0.20-0.81]). Physicians with no self-reported prior psychiatric conditions were less likely to have symptoms of distress compared to those with such history (OR 0.11, CI [0.33-0.38]).

"Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide: Biosynthesis, Consumption, and Therapeutic Role in Cardiac Diseases","Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is an abundant cofactor that plays crucial roles in several cellular processes. NAD can be synthesized de novo starting with tryptophan, or from salvage pathways starting with NAD precursors like nicotinic acid (NA), nicotinamide (NAM), or nicotinamide riboside (NR), referred to as niacin/B<sub>3</sub> vitamins, arising from dietary supply or from cellular NAD catabolism. Given the interconversion between its oxidized (NAD<sup>+</sup> ) and reduced form (NADH), NAD participates in a wide range of reactions: regulation of cellular redox status, energy metabolism, and mitochondrial biogenesis. Plus, NAD acts as a signaling molecule, being a co-substrate for several enzymes such as sirtuins, poly-ADP-ribose-polymerases (PARPs), and some ectoenzymes like CD38, regulating critical biological processes like gene expression, DNA repair, calcium signaling, and circadian rhythms. Given the large number of mitochondria present in cardiac tissue, the heart has the highest NAD levels and is one of the most metabolically demanding organs. In several models of heart failure, myocardial NAD levels are depressed and this depression is caused by mitochondrial dysfunction, metabolic remodeling, and inflammation. Emerging evidence suggests that regulating NAD homeostasis by NAD precursor supplementation has therapeutic efficiency in improving myocardial bioenergetics and function. This review provides an overview of the latest understanding of the different NAD biosynthesis pathways, as well as its role as a signaling molecule particularly in cardiac tissue. We highlight the significance of preserving NAD equilibrium in various models of heart disease and shed light on the potential pharmacological interventions aiming to use NAD boosters as therapeutic agents.","Tannous, Booz, Altara, Muhieddine, Mericksay, Refaat, Zouein","https://doi.org/10.1111/apha.13551","20200827","COVID-19; Cardiac diseases; Cardiac metabolism; Inflammation; Mitochondria; NAD; Redox potential; Transcription factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-28","",4156,""
"Psychological Distress and Coronavirus Fears During the Initial Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States","The COVID-19 pandemic is a significant health and economic crisis around the world. The U.S. saw a rapid escalation in laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 and related deaths in March, 2020. The financial consequences of a virtual economic shutdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus are widespread and debilitating, with over 30 million Americans (about 20% of the labor force) filing for unemployment benefits since mid-March. During these unprecedented times, it is important to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological distress and overall fear associated with the virus. To gain an understanding of the overall levels and predictors of psychological distress experienced in the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S., a survey was administered online to over 2,000 individuals residing in the country. The survey instrument was administered between March 22-26, 2020, during which time the country was suffering through a period of exponential growth in COVID-19 cases and fatalities. It was administered via MTurk, a popular crowdsourcing platform increasingly used by social scientists to procure large samples over a brief period of time. A short, valid screening instrument to measure psychological distress in individuals, the Kessler 10 scale was developed in the U.S. in the 1990s as an easy-to-administer symptom assessment. The first dependent variable is the respondents' summated Kessler 10 score. The second dependent variable is a 7-category measure of how afraid the subject is about the novel coronavirus. The final dependent variable is also a 7-category scale, this time measuring self-reported likelihood of contracting the coronavirus. A variety of socio-demographic variables and health status were collected to analyze factors associated with psychological distress and mental health. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) multiple regression was employed to analyze these data. We find that protective factors against psychological distress include age, gender (male), and physical health. Factors exacerbating psychological distress include Hispanic ethnicity and a previous mental illness diagnosis. Similar factors are significantly related to fear of the virus and self-assessed likelihood of contracting it. The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with high levels of psychological distress in the U.S. The Kessler 10 mean value in our sample is 21.12, which falls in the likely to experience mild mental illness category, yet is considerably higher compared to one of the largest and earliest benchmark studies validating the scale. Psychological distress is one element of overall mental health status that could be influenced by the COVID-10 pandemic.

We encourage researchers to examine these and other mental health disorders in future research on the COVID-19 pandemic.

"COVID-19: PTSD symptoms in Greek health care professionals","<b> <i>Objective:</i> </b> The objective of this study was to assess the emergence of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in Greek health care professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b> <i>Method:</i> </b> A cross-sectional study was conducted via an online survey from April 10 until April 13, 2020. The survey included sociodemographic questions and the following psychometric tools: the Peritraumatic Distress Inventory, the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder-8 questionnaire, the Brief Patient Health Questionnaire Depression scale, the Athens Insomnia Scale, and 3 questions about negative perceptions of COVID-19. The survey was distributed through social media and comprises part of a larger survey targeting the general population. Altogether, 270 health care professionals responded to the survey. <b> <i>Results:</i> </b> Health care professionals appeared to be moderately stressed from the COVID-19 crisis, with women scoring higher on all clinical scales and the difference between women and men being statistically significant. Criteria for a probable posttraumatic stress disorder diagnosis were met by a total of 16.7% (21.7% of women; 5.1% of men). Negative emotion and threatened or physical tension are positive significant predictors of PTSS. Those suffering with higher levels of PTSS scored positively for insomnia and exhibited significantly higher peritraumatic distress. <b> <i>Conclusion:</i> </b> Health care professionals could benefit by being screened for PTSS and insomnia.

"Getting back to the &quot;new normal&quot;: Autonomy restoration during a global pandemic","We investigate the psychological recovery process of full-time employees during the 2-week period at the onset of the Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). Past research suggests that recovery processes start <i>after</i> stressors abate and can take months or years to unfold. In contrast, we build on autonomy restoration theory to suggest that recovery of impaired autonomy starts immediately even as a stressor is ongoing. Using growth curve modeling, we examined the temporal trajectories of two manifestations of impaired autonomy-powerlessness and (lack of) authenticity-to test whether recovery began as the pandemic unfolded. We tested our predictions using a unique experience-sampling dataset collected over a 2-week period beginning on the Monday after COVID-19 was declared a &quot;global pandemic&quot; by the World Health Organization and a &quot;national emergency&quot; by the U.S. Government (March 16-27, 2020). Results suggest that autonomy restoration was activated even as the pandemic worsened. Employees reported decreasing powerlessness and increasing authenticity during this period, despite their subjective stress-levels not improving. Further, the trajectories of recovery for both powerlessness and authenticity were steeper for employees higher (vs. lower) in neuroticism, a personality characteristic central to stress reactions. Importantly, these patterns do not emerge in a second experience-sampling study collected prior to the COVID-19 crisis (September 9-20, 2019), highlighting how the pandemic initially threatened employee autonomy, but also how employees began to recover their sense of autonomy almost immediately. The present research provides novel insights into employee well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic and suggests that psychological recovery can begin during a stressful experience.

"Hemoglobin A1C is a Predictor of COVID-19 Severity in Patients with Diabetes","Poor outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been linked to diabetes but its relation to pre-infection glycemic control is still unclear. To address this question we report here the association between pre-infection HemoglobinA1c (A1C) levels and COVID-19 severity as assessed by need for hospitalization in a cohort of 2068 patients with diabetes tested for COVID-19 in Leumit Health Services, Israel, between February 1 and April 30, 2020. Using the LHS integrated electronic medical records system we were able to collect a large amount of clinical information including age, sex, socioeconomic status, weight, height, body mass index, A1C, prior diagnosis of ischemic heart disease, depression/anxiety, schizophrenia, dementia, hypertension, cerebrovascular accident, congestive heart failure , smoking and chronic lung disease. Of the patients included in the cohort, 183 (8.85 %) were diagnosed with COVID-19 and 46 were admitted to hospital. More hospitalized patients were female, came from higher socioeconomic background and had a higher baseline A1C. A prior diagnosis of cerebrovascular accident and chronic lung disease conferred an increased risk of hospitalization but not obesity or smoking status. In a multivariate analysis, controlling for multiple prior clinical conditions, the only parameter associated with a significantly increased risk for hospitalization was A1CÃ¢â€°Â¥9%. Using pre-infection glycemic control data we identify A1C as a clear predictor of COVID-19 severity. Pre-infection risk stratification is crucial to successfully manage this disease, efficiently allocate resources and minimize the economic and social burden associated with an undiscriminating approach.

"Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System Inhibitors and Risk of Death in Patients Hospitalised with COVID-19: A Retrospective Italian Cohort Study of 43,000 Patients","The epidemic due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been spreading globally, raising increasing concerns. There are several controversial hypotheses on the potentially harmful or beneficial effects of antihypertensive drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Furthermore, there is accumulating evidence, based on several observational studies, that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) do not increase the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection. On the other hand, conflicting findings regarding the role of ACEIs/ARBs as prognosis modifiers in COVID-19 hospitalised patients have been reported. The aim of this large-scale, retrospective cohort study was to investigate whether prior exposure to ACEIs and/or ARBs was associated with all-cause mortality among over 40,000 hospitalised COVID-19 patients compared with calcium channel blockers (CCBs), a potential therapeutic alternative. This study was conducted using COVID-19 registries linked to claims databases from Lombardy, Veneto and Reggio Emilia (overall, 25% of Italian population). Overall, 42,926 patients hospitalised between 21 February and 21 April 2020 with a diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction tests were included in this study. All-cause mortality occurring in or out of hospital, as reported in the COVID-19 registry, was estimated. Using Cox models, adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of all-cause mortality (along with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were estimated separately for ACEIs/ARBs and other antihypertensives versus CCBs and non-use. Overall, 11,205 in- and out-of-hospital deaths occurred over a median of 24Ã‚Â days of follow-up after hospital admission due to COVID-19. Compared with CCBs, adjusted analyses showed no difference in the risk of death among ACEI (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.89-1.06) or ARB (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.89-1.06) users. When non-use of antihypertensives was considered as a comparator, a modest statistically significant increase in mortality risk was observed for any antihypertensive use. However, when restricting to drugs with antihypertensive indications only, these marginal increases disappeared. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses confirmed our main findings. ACEI/ARB use is not associated with either an increased or decreased risk of all-cause mortality, compared with CCB use, in the largest cohort of hospitalised COVID-19 patients exposed to these drugs studied to date. The use of these drugs therefore does not affect the prognosis of COVID-19. This finding strengthens recommendations of international regulatory agencies about not withdrawing/switching ACEI/ARB treatments to modify COVID-19 prognosis.","TrifirÃƒÂ², Massari, Da Cas, Menniti Ippolito, Sultana, Crisafulli, Giorgi Rossi, Marino, Zorzi, Bovo, Leoni, Ludergnani, Spila Alegiani, Spila Alegiani, Menniti Ippolito, Da Cas, Massari, Traversa, Onder, TrifirÃƒÂ², Sultana, Ientile, Crisafulli, Giorgi Rossi, Grilli, Formoso, Marino, Vicentini, Leoni, Ludergnani, Cereda, Ferroni, Guzzinati, Bovo, Zorzi, Gion","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40264-020-00994-5","20200827","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-28","",4163,""
"Effectiveness and influencing factors of online education for caregivers of patients with eating disorders during COVID-19 pandemic in China","The goals were twofold: To estimate the depression and anxiety levels among caregivers of patients with eating disorders (ED) in China during the COVID-19 pandemic when compared with a control group, and to assess whether an online education program was effective in decreasing the anxiety and depression of the caregivers of patients with ED, and associated factors. Caregivers of patients with ED (n = 254) and a comparison group of non-ED caregivers (N = 254) were recruited at baseline. Additionally, caregivers of patients with ED were invited into a free 4-week online education program, with an additional online group as support. Depression and anxiety levels were assessed at baseline and after the intervention. Caregivers of patients with ED showed significantly higher levels of depression and anxiety than the comparison group of non-ED caregivers. The online education program showed no significant effect on decreasing depression and anxiety levels of caregivers of patients with ED overall. Caregivers who had older loved ones and not living with them were more likely to decrease their depression levels. Caregivers of patients with longer illness duration were less likely to decrease their anxiety levels. These results showed that caregivers of ED patients suffered more serious psychological distress during the pandemic.

"Combatting Social Isolation Among Older Adults in a Time of Physical Distancing: The COVID-19 Social Connectivity Paradox","Social isolation is an important public health issue that has gained recognition during the COVID-19 pandemic because of the risks posed to older adults based on physical distancing. The primary purposes of this article are to provide an overview of the complex interconnectedness between social isolation, loneliness, and depression while introducing the COVID-19 Connectivity Paradox, a new concept used to describe the conflicting risk/harm continuum resulting from recommended physical distancing. In this context, examples will be provided for practical and feasible community-based models to improve social connectivity during COVID-19 by adjusting the processes and modalities used to deliver programs and services to older adults through the aging social services network. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for clinical and community-based organizations to unite and form inter-sectorial partnerships to maintain the provision of services and programs for engaging and supporting older adults during this difficult time of physical distancing and shelter-in-place and stay-at-home orders. The aging social services network provides a vital infrastructure for reaching older underserved and/or marginalized persons across the U.S. to reduce social isolation. Capitalizing on existing practices in the field, older adults can achieve distanced connectivity to mitigate social isolation risk while remaining at safe physical distances from others.","Smith, Steinman, Casey","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00403","20200827","aging network; distanced connectivity; loneliness; paradox; screening; service provision; social connectivity; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-28","",4165,""
"Psychosocial Support for Healthcare Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The novel corona virus disease COVID-19 was first diagnosed in humans in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Since then it had become a global pandemic. Such a pandemic leads to short- and long-term mental health burden for healthcare workers. Recent surveys suggest that rates of psychological stress, depression, anxiety, and insomnia and will be high for this group. Numerous organizations have since released guidance on how both healthcare workers and the general public can manage the mental health burden. However, these recommendations focus on specific healthcare workers (e.g., nurses or psychologists), are often not evidence-based, and typically do not situate guidance within a phased model that recognizes countries are at different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this perspective paper we propose a phased model of mental health burden and responses. Building on work by the Intensive Care Society and the Royal College of Psychiatrists in the United Kingdom, we present a model that demonstrates how both staff and organizations might respond to the likely stressors that might occur at preparation-, pre-, initial and core-, and longer-term-phases of the pandemic. Staff within countries at different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic will be able to use this model. We suggest practical tips for both healthcare workers and organizations and embed this within up-to-date scientific literature. The phased model of mental health burden and responses can be a helpful guide for both staff and organizations operating at different stages of the pandemic.","Tomlin, Dalgleish-Warburton, Lamph","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01960","20200827","COVID-19; Corona virus; healthcare; interventions; psychosocial support; staff","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-28","",4166,""
"How and When Does Inclusive Leadership Curb Psychological Distress During a Crisis? Evidence From the COVID-19 Outbreak","Traumatic events such as a pandemic shatter the assumption of the workplace as a safe place. Nurses face risks of life-threatening infection, which can create psychological distress. Quality of care for infected patients depends on mental well-being of nurses which calls for research on predictors of stress among health care workers. Responding to a call for research on the effects of leadership styles on psychological distress during traumatic events, this paper uses the theoretical lens of social exchange theory and contributes to literature on relationships between inclusive leadership, psychological distress, work engagement, and self-sacrifice. Participants of this cross sectional study included 497 registered nurses from five hospitals in Wuhan. Data were collected with temporal separation through an online questionnaire. Partial least-squares structural equation modeling was used to analyze data. Results show inclusive leadership has a significant negative relationship with psychological distress. Work engagement mediates this relationship, and nurses' self-sacrificial behavior moderates it. Findings indicate inclusive leadership style serves as a sustainable mechanism to reduce psychological distress during pandemics. It can operationalize the delivery of mental health support in real-time in work settings. Results provide empirical support for social exchange theory through high work engagement to help control psychological distress among nurses.","Ahmed, Zhao, Faraz","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01898","20200827","health care workers; inclusive leadership; mental health; psychological distress; self-sacrifice; social exchange theory; the COVID-19; work engagement","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-28","",4167,""
"Don't Walk So Close to Me: Physical Distancing and Adult Physical Activity in Canada","<b>Background</b>: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, physical distancing measures have been implemented globally. Canadians have been instructed to stay at home, which has likely resulted in significant changes in their physical activity. Using data from a national physical activity tracking app (PAC app), we aimed to determine device-measured physical activity levels immediately prior to and following the implementation of physical distancing measures in Canada to provide evidence for the development of physical activity recommendations for future pandemics or second wave infections. <b>Methods</b>: Demographic and physical activity data were extracted from the ParticipACTION app (PAC app), using a 10-week (10 February to 19 April 2020) quasi-experimental design to determine changes in physical activity 4 weeks pre-pandemic and 6 weeks post-pandemic declaration. Weekly physical activity levels were monitored through wearable fitness trackers and health apps linked to the PAC app, to record moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), light physical activity (LPA), and steps. Repeated measure ANOVA was used to determine changes over time (mean Ã‚Â± SE). <b>Findings</b>: A total of 2,338 Canadians who were mostly 35-44 years old (26.6%) and female (90.2%) were included in the analysis. MVPA, LPA, and steps significantly declined immediately following the declaration of the pandemic (MVPA: pre-pandemic: 194.2 Ã‚Â± 5.2 min, post-pandemic: 176.7 Ã‚Â± 5.0 min, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001; LPA: pre-pandemic: 1,000.5 Ã‚Â± 17.0 min, post-pandemic: 874.1 Ã‚Â± 15.6 min, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001; steps: pre-pandemic: 48,625 Ã‚Â± 745 steps, post-pandemic: 43,395 Ã‚Â± 705 steps, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). However, 6 weeks following pandemic declaration, MVPA (week 6: 204.4 Ã‚Â± 5.4 min, <i>p</i> = 0.498) had returned to pre-pandemic levels. LPA (week 6: 732.0 Ã‚Â± 14.3 min, <i>p</i> = &lt; 0.001) and steps (week 6: 41,946 Ã‚Â± 763, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) remained significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels at week 6. <b>Interpretation</b>: Although MVPA returned to pre-pandemic levels, significant and sustained declines in incidental LPA and steps were observed. Attenuating the loss of incidental physical activity should be a public health priority in response to future pandemics or a second wave of a COVID-19 infection, as it may have significant long-term implications for the physical and mental health of Canadians.","Di Sebastiano, Chulak-Bozzer, Vanderloo, Faulkner","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01895","20200827","COVID-19; incidental physical activity; light physical activity; moderate to vigorous physical activity; pandemic; social distancing; steps","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-28","",4168,""

"Missouri's Fentanyl Problem: The China Connection","Recently, Missouri has followed an overall upward trend in opioid overdose deaths. In 2018, Missouri was the state with the largest absolute and percentage increase in opioid-related overdose fatality rates per capita over the previous year (18.3% and 3.1/100,000). This increase occurred despite an overall decrease in U.S. opioid-related death rates in the same period. This report identifies illicitly manufactured fentanyl (IMF) (and analogues) as the drug most responsible for this rise in opioid deaths in Missouri, with stimulant overdoses (primarily from methamphetamine) in second place. Within Missouri, we find the areas where opioid deaths are highest: St. Louis and the city's fringe areas, following the national trend for high rates in fringe areas. Based on reports from CDC Wonder data, county medical examiners, law enforcement agencies, and drug addiction prevention agencies, we conclude that IMF and related synthetic opioids arriving from China are primarily responsible for fatal narcotic overdoses in Missouri. Despite the COVID-19 disruption of fentanyl manufacturing and distribution centers in and around Wuhan, China early in the pandemic, preliminary 2020 data from medical examiners' offices show an upswing in opioid deaths, an indicator that Chinese fentanyl producers have restored the supply chain.","Stoecker, Bosworth, Rottnek","https://www.google.com/search?q=Missouri's+Fentanyl+Problem:+The+China+Connection.","20200827","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-28","",4171,""

While early days, we here illustrate a line of research explored by our group-intrusive imagery-based memories after trauma. We illustrate three possible approaches through which mental health science may stimulate thinking around psychological treatment innovation. First, focusing on single/specific target symptoms rather than full, multifaceted psychiatric diagnoses (e.g., intrusive trauma memories rather than all of posttraumatic stress disorder). Second, investigating mechanisms that can be <i>modified</i> in treatment (treatment mechanisms), rather than those which cannot (e.g., processes only linked to aetiology). Finally, exploring novel ways of delivering psychological treatment (peer-/self-administration), given the prevalence of mental health problems globally, and the corresponding need for effective interventions that can be delivered at scale and remotely for example at times of crisis (e.g., current COVID-19 pandemic).

"The Productivity Commission's Draft Report illustrates the benefits and risks of economic perspectives on mental healthcare","In 2018, the Australian Government instructed the Productivity Commission to examine the social and economic effects of poor mental health, as well as make recommendations on how they might be addressed. The resulting Draft Report demonstrates both the benefits and risks of an economic approach to these issues. Some of the broader systemic recommendations have merit such as the need for stepped care, coordinated crisis management and the important role of welfare, housing and the workplace in improving mental health. However, there are areas of concern, particularly for mental health services in the public sector. One is a disproportionate emphasis on prevention and intervention in the early years of life for strategies where evidence for effectiveness is limited. Another is the introduction of market-based approaches such as shadow billing or a commissioner/provider split to the funding of mental health services across Australia. Among the numerous problems of such market-driven approaches are the increased costs of additional bureaucracy and the lack of commissioner expertise in planning services or evidence-based practice. As a result, similar arrangements have been abandoned in other jurisdictions. The Commission's final recommendations and the Australian Government's response are awaited and the resulting changes to the mental health system, and beyond, may well be influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, reform should be based on evidence and achieved without increasing administrative complexity.","Kisely, Looi","https://doi.org/10.1177/0004867420951255","20200827","Public mental health services; commissioning; purchaser/provider split; youth mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-28","",4173,""

All of the patients with confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to the First Hospital of Changsha City, the designated hospital for COVID-19 assigned by the Changsha City Government. The clinical and epidemiological characteristics, data of laboratory, radiological picture, treatment, and outcomes records of 201 COVID-19 patients were collected using electronic medical records. This study population consisted of 201 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Changsha by April 28, 2020. The median age of the patients was 45 years (IQR 34-59). About half (50.7%) of the patients were male, and most of the infected patients were staff (96 [47.8%]). Concerning the epidemiologic history, the number of patients linked to Wuhan was 92 (45.8%). The most common symptoms were fever (125 [62.2%]), dry cough (118 [58.7%]), fatigue (65 [32.3%]), and pharyngalgia (31 [15.4%]).

Fifty-four (26.9%) patients showed unilateral involvement, and three (1.5%) patients showed no abnormal signs or symptoms. The laboratory findings differed significantly between the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and non-ICU groups. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had depressed white blood cell (WBC), neutrocytes, lymphocytes, and prolonged prothrombin time (PT). Moreover, higher plasma levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), alanine aminotransferase (ALA), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), creatinine (CREA), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were detected in the ICU group. In this single-center study of 201 COVID-19 patients in Changsha, China, 22.4% of patients were admitted to ICU. Based on our findings, we propose that the risk of cellular immune deficiency, hepatic injury, and kidney injury should be monitored. Previous reports focused on the clinical features of patients from Wuhan, China. With the global epidemic of COVID-19, we should pay more attention to the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of patients outside of Wuhan.","Zhou, Sun, Cao, Wang, Huang, Zheng, Xie, Jiang, Zhou","https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000021824","20200827","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-28","",4174,""
"Association of social-economic changes due to COVID 19 with health outcomes in patients with skin diseases","The outbreak of COVID-19 has profoundly influenced the lifestyle of the public, while the impacts varied across subgroups of people. The pandemic-related impacts on health outcomes of skin diseases are unknown. To study the association of the COVID-19 pandemic-related impacts with health-related quality of life in patients with skin diseases. This was a cross-sectional study among Chinese patients with skin diseases. A self-administered online questionnaire was distributed through social media. Demographic and clinical data, and pandemic-related impacts (isolation status, income change and employment status) were collected. The main outcomes included perceived stress (visual analog scale), symptoms of anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) and depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire), quality of life (Dermatology Life Quality Index), and health utility mapping from the EQ-5D-3L. Multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate the associations. A total of 506 patients with skin diseases accomplished the survey. The mean age of the patients was 33.5Ã‚Â±14.0 years, and 42.9% (217/506) were male. Among them, 25.3% were quarantined, 20.2% reported unemployment, and 62.7% reported decrease or loss of income since the pandemic. The pandemic-related impacts were significantly associated with impaired mental-wellbeing and quality of life with different effect. Unemployment and complete loss of income were associated with the highest risks of adverse outcomes, with 110% to 162% increase in the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and impaired quality of life. Isolation, income loss, and unemployment are associated with the impaired health-related quality of life in patients with skin diseases since the COVID-19 pandemic.","Guo, Shen, Zhang, Xiao, Zhao, Yin, Bu, Wang, Chen, Su","https://doi.org/10.2196/22288","20200826","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-28","",4175,""

"Report on sadness/depression, nervousness/anxiety and sleep problems in the Brazilian adult population during the COVID-19 pandemic","To analyze the frequency of sadness, nervousness, and sleep disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, identifying the most affected demographic segments. This was a cross-sectional study using an online questionnaire answered by adults and elderly people to collect information on living conditions, health and health-related behaviors. Prevalence rates and prevalence ratios adjusted for age and sex were estimated. The data on 45,161 Brazilian respondents showed that during the pandemic 40.4% (95%CI 39.0;41.8) frequently felt sad or depressed and 52.6% (95%CI 51.2;54.1) frequently felt anxious or nervous; 43.5% (95%CI 41.8;45.3) reported the onset of sleep problems and 48.0% (95%CI 45.6;50.5) had a prior sleep problem that had become worse. Frequent sadness and nervousness, as well as change in sleep patterns were higher in young adults, women and those with a history of depression. The high prevalence found indicates the need to guarantee the provision of services for mental health and quality of sleep that are adapted to the pandemic context.","Barros, Lima, Malta, Szwarcwald, Azevedo, Romero, Souza JÃƒÂºnior, Azevedo, Machado, Damacena, Gomes, Werneck, Silva, Pina, Gracie","https://doi.org/10.1590/s1679-49742020000400018","20200826","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-28","",4177,""

"Effect of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic on Pediatric Resident Well-Being","This study aims to identify factors specific to the COVID-19 pandemic that affect resident physicians' well-being, identify potential sources of anxiety, and assess for depression and stress among residents. A cross-sectional survey was performed in April 2020 that evaluated resident perceptions about COVID-19 pandemic, its impact on their personal lifestyle, and coping mechanisms adopted. The respondents also completed the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and Cohen Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10). Of 37 residents, 29 completed the survey for a response rate of 78%. We found that 50% of residents harbored increased anxiety due to the pandemic and reported fears of spreading disease. Factors that negatively impacted their well-being included social isolation from colleagues (78%), inability to engage in outdoor activities (82%), and social gatherings (86%). Residents expressed concern about the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on their didactic education and clinical rotations. The mean PSS-10 total score was 17 (SD = 4.96, range = 0-33) and the mean BDI-II total score was 6.79 (SD = 6.00). Our residents adopted a number of coping mechanisms in response to COVID-19. We identified factors specific to the COVID-19 pandemic that adversely affected resident physician well-being. Trainees were concerned about the risk of developing COVID-19 and spreading this to their family. Residents also harbored anxiety regarding the effect of COVID-19 on their education. Lifestyle changes including social isolation also resulted in a negative effect on resident well-being. Developing strategies and resources directed to addressing these concerns may help support well-being and alleviate stress and anxiety.","Sanghavi, Au Yeung, Sosa, Veesenmeyer, Limon, Vijayan","https://doi.org/10.1177/2382120520947062","20200827","Coronavirus; anxiety; health care provider; medical education; mental health; physician","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-28","",4179,""
"Psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on postgraduate trainees: a cross-sectional survey","The present study aimed to evaluate psychological impact of COVID-19 outbreak on postgraduate trainees in Pakistan by quantifying the symptoms of depression, anxiety and acute stress disorder and by analysing potential risk factors associated with these symptoms. Following Institutional Review Board approval, a cross-sectional study was conducted among 10,178 postgraduate trainees following COVID-19 outbreak through e-log system of College of Physicians and Surgeons of Pakistan. The nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire, seven-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder scale and Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire were used to collect data. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS.26. Descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U test, the Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> test and logistic regression analysis were performed. The significance level was set at ÃŽÂ±=0.05. The prevalence of depressive symptoms, generalised anxiety disorder and acute stress disorder were 26.4%, 22.6% and 4.4%, respectively. Female postgraduate trainees, senior trainees and front-line workers reported experiencing more anxiety, depression and acute stress symptoms (p value&lt;0.001). Logistic regression showed that being a front-line and senior staff member and female was associated with higher risk of experiencing symptoms of depression, anxiety and acute stress. Our study findings raise concerns about the psychological well-being of postgraduate trainees during the acute COVID-19 outbreak in Pakistan. It is necessary to employ strategies to minimise the psychological distress and provide adequate psychosocial support for postgraduate trainees during crisis situation such as COVID-19 pandemic.","Imran, Masood, Ayub, Gondal","https://doi.org/10.1136/postgradmedj-2020-138364","20200826","Psychiatry; adult psychiatry; depression &amp; mood disorders; education &amp; training (see medical education &amp; training); infectious diseases; medical education &amp; training","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-28","",4180,""

"Reverse takotsubo cardiomyopathy in fulminant COVID-19 associated with cytokine release syndrome and resolution following therapeutic plasma exchange: a case-report","Fulminant (life-threatening) COVID-19 can be associated with acute respiratory failure (ARF), multi-system organ failure and cytokine release syndrome (CRS). We present a rare case of fulminant COVID-19 associated with reverse-takotsubo-cardiomyopathy (RTCC) that improved with therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE). A 40 year old previous healthy male presented in the emergency room with 4 days of dry cough, chest pain, myalgias and fatigue. He progressed to ARF requiring high-flow-nasal-cannula (flow: 60Ã¢â‚¬â€°L/minute, fraction of inspired oxygen: 40%). Real-Time-Polymerase-Chain-Reaction (RT-PCR) assay confirmed COVID-19 and chest X-ray showed interstitial infiltrates. Biochemistry suggested CRS: increased C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin and interleukin-6. Renal function was normal but lactate levels were elevated. Electrocardiogram demonstrated non-specific changes and troponin-I levels were slightly elevated. Echocardiography revealed left ventricular (LV) basal and midventricular akinesia with apex sparing (LV ejection fraction: 30%) and depressed cardiac output (2.8Ã¢â‚¬â€°L/min) consistent with a rare variant of stress-related cardiomyopathy: RTCC. His ratio of partial arterial pressure of oxygen to fractional inspired concentration of oxygen was &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°120. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for mechanical ventilation and vasopressors, plus antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir), and prophylactic anticoagulation. Infusion of milrinone failed to improve his cardiogenic shock (day-1). Thus, rescue TPE was performed using the Spectra OptiaÃ¢â€žÂ¢ Apheresis System equipped with the Depuro D2000 Adsorption Cartridge (Terumo BCT Inc., USA) without protective antibodies. Over 5 days he received daily TPE (each lasting 4 hours). His lactate levels, oxygenation, and LV function normalized and he was weaned off vasopressors. His inflammation markers improved, and he was extubated on day-7. RT-PCR was negative on day-17. He was discharged to home isolation in good condition. Stress-cardiomyopathy may complicate the course of fulminant COVID-19 with associated CRS. If inotropic therapy fails, TPE without protective antibodies may help rescue the critically ill patient.","Faqihi, Alharthy, Alshaya, Papanikolaou, Kutsogiannis, Brindley, Karakitsos","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12872-020-01665-0","20200826","COVID-19; Cardiogenic shock; Case-report; Cytokine release syndrome; Echocardiography; Reverse takotsubo cardiomyopathy; Therapeutic plasma exchange","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-28","",4182,""
"Physical activity and nutrition guidelines to help with the fight against COVID-19","As the world is witnessing the epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019, emerging genetics and clinical pieces of evidence suggest a similar immunopathology to those of severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome. Staying at home to prevent the spread of the virus and consequently being largely inactive is associated with unintended consequences. These can actually enhance the infection risk and exacerbate poor health conditions including impaired immune function. Physical activity is a feasible way of improving health, particularly physical and mental health in a time of social isolation. However, people with certain health conditions in these circumstances may need a special physical activity programme in addition to any exercise they may already be performing via online programmes. This review aims to provide practical guidelines during the COVID-19 quarantine period. We suggest performing aerobic, resistance training, respiratory muscle training and yoga in the healthy, and in those with upper respiratory tract illness, patients with lower respiratory tract illness should be restricted to respiratory muscle training and yoga. In addition, vitamins D and C, omega-3 fatty acids, and regular consumption of fruit and vegetables might be considered as nutritional aids to support the immune system in those affected by COVID-19.","Khoramipour, Basereh, Hekmatikar, Castell, Ruhee, Suzuki","https://doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2020.1807089","20200826","Coronavirus; exercise; immune response; nutrition; respiratory muscle training","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-28","",4183,""
"2020 COVID-19 American Academy of Clinical Neuropsychology (AACN) Student Affairs Committee survey of neuropsychology trainees","To conduct an online survey in order to understand neuropsychology trainees' perspectives during the COVID-19 pandemic and identify pertinent concerns, training gaps, and recommendations. A total of 874 neuropsychology trainees (81% female) completed the 69-item survey. Of the included trainees, 48% were doctoral students, 17% were interns, and 35% were postdoctoral residents (50% of resident respondents were in their first year). The majority of neuropsychology trainees reported some impact of the pandemic on their professional and/or personal life. Overall, the impact did not differ by training level, geographic location, or demographic factors. Trainees' primary professional concerns included uncertainty about the impact of the pandemic on their professional future, loss of clinical hours, and desire for increased and ongoing communication from their leadership. A notable percentage of trainees reported increased personal mental health symptoms (i.e. anxiety/depression; 74%/54%), as well as a number of other personal stressors. Despite the transition to telehealth (mostly interviews/feedback sessions), few trainees have prior training or experience in providing neuropsychological services via phone or video platform. A limited proportion of trainees (approximately 10%) were still seeing patients face-to-face for neuropsychological evaluations during the COVID-19 pandemic as of 14 April 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting neuropsychological training and the well-being of trainees. This survey highlights the importance of communication with trainees during uncertain times. Based on the survey results, recommendations were developed to assist neuropsychology organizations in developing initiatives to support trainees during the current pandemic and in the future.","Guidotti Breting, Towns, Butts, Brett, Leaffer, Whiteside","https://doi.org/10.1080/13854046.2020.1809712","20200826","COVID-19; education; neuropsychology trainees; pandemic; survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-28","",4184,""

"Mental health difficulties of adults with COVID-19-like symptoms in Bangladesh: a case control-study","Introduction The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 coupled with inefficient testing capacities in Bangladesh has resulted in a number of deaths from COVID-19-like symptoms that have no official test results. Insufficient test sites and healthcare facilities catered to COVID-19 has led to feelings of fear and frustration in those who are sick. This study was the first study which explored the mental health of adults with the most common COVID-19-like symptoms in Bangladesh. Methods This retrospective case control study gathered data via an online survey to explore the mental health of Bangladeshi adults with symptoms akin to COVID-19. Level of stress, anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms were measured with the DASS-21. Chi-square tests and multivariate logistic regression was performed to examine the association of variables. Results The prevalence rates of anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms of overall population were 26.9% and 52.0% respectively and 55.6% reported mild to extremely severe levels of stress. Multivariate logistic regression determined that respondents with COVID-19-like symptoms (case) reported higher odds for stress level (AOR: 2.043; CI: 1.51-2.76), anxiety symptoms (AOR: 2.770; CI: 2.04-3.77) and depressive symptoms (AOR: 1.482; CI: 1.12-1.96) than asymptomatic respondents (control). Conclusion Patients with symptoms like those of COVID-19 should be prioritized in the healthcare setting in order to reduce mental health difficulties throughout the pandemic.","Musammet Rasheda Begum et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46231-822-F17","20200827","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; covid-19 like sympttoms; mental health; case-control; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-28","",4186,""
"Knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards measures for prevention of the spread of COVID-19: An online cross-sectional survey among Bangladeshi residents","The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2/ COVID-19) rapidly infects people across the world, leading to a massive public reaction. Peoplesâ€™ knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards measures for prevention of the spread of COVID-19 are the most important for the control and prevention of the pandemic infectious disease. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude & practices (KAP) towards measures for prevention of the spread of COVID-19 among Bangladeshi residents during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey of 1765 respondents was conducted through the social media networks of authors. The respondents were older than 18 years, with an average age of 24.88 years (SD: 6.30). Approximately 15% of our participants received online training. The mean knowledge score was 14.49 (SD: 1.8, ranging: 0-17), and the overall correct response rate on this knowledge test was 85%. About 67.2 % scored well (above the mean: 4.5, range: 1-5) regarding the practices. To avoid the infection, 96.6% wear mask outside the home, and 98.7% washed hand with soap when came back. COVID-19 knowledge score was significantly associated with a lower risk of (OR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.79-0.92) of negative attitudes. Again, the awareness score was associated with a lower likelihood of (OR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.87-0.98) of poor practices. Online health education programs focusing on young people, housewife and people with less education may potentially improve the attitudes and practices to control the COVID-19 pandemic in long term in such a low resource setting.","Satyajit Kundu et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AE-F2E-68D","20200827","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; practise; knowledge; cocid-19; attitude","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-28","",4187,""
