"Daily Dynamics of Parental Mental Health: Investigating Depressive Symptoms and Negative Parental Experiences (preprint)","Background: Investigating psychopathological processes and how these are connected to psychiatric symptoms is important to understand how disorder states emerge and are maintained over time. Focusing on within-person relationships between variables further allows investigation of how these relations on average unfold within individuals. Methods: This preregistered intensive longitudinal study investigates connections between depressive symptoms, psychopathological processes, and negative parental experiences. Daily observations from 1036 parents were retrieved from two 40-day periods during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data was modelled using multilevel dynamic network analysis, unveiling across-day associations and contemporaneous interactions within the same time window. Results: On an across-day basis, helplessness was strongly interwoven with and predictive of the cognitive-affective features of depression and the other psychopathological processes. Being overwhelmed by the parental role (parenting stress) and emotionally drained as a parent (parental burnout) reciprocally reinforced each other from one day to the next, indicating how these components can manifest as a vicious loop over time. Finally, depressive symptomatology and negative parental experiences displayed within-day connections, with emotion regulation difficulties being connected to all parental components. Conclusions: The findings suggest that vicious cycles between helplessness and worthlessness predict the prolonged experience of depressed states in parents and that elevations in parenting stress and parental burnout reinforce each other over time.","","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/rvawg","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39673,""
"Resilience of primal world beliefs to the initial shock of the COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)","INTRODUCTION: People hold general beliefs about the world called primals (e.g., the world is Safe, Intentional), which are strongly linked to individual differences in personality, behavior and mental health. How such beliefs form or change across the lifespan is largely unknown, although theory suggests that beliefs become more negative after disruptive events. The COVID-19 pandemic provided an opportunity to test whether dramatic world changes and personal adversity affect beliefs. METHOD: In a longitudinal, quasi-experimental, pre-registered design, 529 US participants (51% female, 76% White) provided ratings of primals before and several months after pandemic onset, and information about personal adversity (e.g., losing family, financial hardship). Data was compared to 398 participants without experience of the pandemic. RESULTS: The average person in our sample showed no change in 23 of the 26 primals, including Safe, in response to the early pandemic, and only saw the world as slightly less Alive, Interactive, and Acceptable. Higher adversity, however, was associated with slight declines in some beliefs. One limitation is that participants were exclusively American. CONCLUSION: Primals were remarkably stable during the initial shock wrought by a once-in-a-century pandemic, supporting a view of primals as stable lenses through which people interpret the world.","","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/kfgd9","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39674,""
"The Role of Emotion Regulatory Processes in Mental Health Across the Lifespan During a Year of the COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)","Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic there has been a rise in common mental health problems compared to pre-pandemic levels, especially in young people. Understanding the factors that place young people at risk is critical to guide the response to increased mental health problems. Here we examine whether age-related differences in emotion regulatory processes account for the higher levels of mental health problems reported by young people during the pandemic. Method: Participants (N=2367;89.95% female, 11-100 years) from Australia, UK, and USA were surveyed thrice at three-month intervals during the first year of the pandemic (May 2020â€“April 2021). Participants completed measures of emotion regulatory processes (adaptive and maladaptive strategy use and mental flexibility), negative and positive affect, and mental health problems. Results: Younger age was associated with lower positive (p&lt;0.001) and greater negative (p&lt;0.001) affect across the first year of the pandemic. Maladaptive emotion regulation partially accounted for age-related variance in affect (positive affect: p=0.004;negative affect: p&lt;0.001);whereby younger age was associated with greater maladaptive emotion regulation which, in turn, was associated with poorer affect. Maladaptive emotion regulation and its effect on changes in affect, in turn, partially accounted for age-related variance in mental health problems (positive affect: p=0.003;negative affect: p=0.013). Conclusion: Our findings add to the growing literature demonstrating adolescent vulnerability during the COVID-19 pandemic, and suggest that maladaptive emotion regulation may be a promising target for intervention. Targeting such processes, especially in young people, may lead to improvements in affect, and in turn, mental health.","","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/jtsw4","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39675,""
"Seeing One Another: The Creation of The Sawubona Healing Circles (preprint)","In 2020, The Association of Black Psychologists (ABPsi) drew attention to how the history of racism in the U.S. had created and exacerbated extant medical racial inequities to the detriment of Black people. In recognition that solutions based solely in Western frameworks cannot fully address the mental health needs of Black people, ABPsi began devoting collaborative efforts to develop culturally-grounded healing responses for the unique experiences of race-based invisibility and trauma. Amid the pandemic, people of African-descent also experienced a number of other mass racial traumas, including a wave of widely publicized police violence. Beginning with COVID-19, these intersecting pandemics of racism elucidated the need for healing, particularly culturally-grounding healing. In consultation with the Black Family Summit, ABPsi developed a pilot investigation, the Sawubona Healing Circle (SHC) initiative, which are culturally-grounding healing circles to support Black first-responders. Using an African-centered worldview, the circles recognize and validate the specific constellation of anti- Black traumas and stressors, and equip them with African-centered healing methods. This paper outlines the theory, development, implementation, and initial evaluation of the SHC intervention.","","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/hwn6x","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39676,""
"Flexibility predicts chronic anxiety and depression during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic â€“ A longitudinal investigation of mental health trajectories (preprint)","The COVID-19 pandemic is a significant stressor potentially putting the well-being of the general population at risk. However, a significant proportion of the population exhibits resilience, raising questions regarding psychological constructs that could contribute to resilient coping. Studies indicate that flexibility, defined as the ability to adapt to changing contextual demands by employing a variety of emotional, cognitive, and behavioral strategies, may significantly contribute to coping with long-term stressors such as COVID-19. Cognitive and coping flexibility domains and longitudinal trajectories of anxiety and depression were assessed at three time points across a 13-months period in 571 Israelis. Analyses revealed four different trajectories for anxiety: resilient (66%), chronic (22%), emerging (7%) and improving (6%), and two trajectories for depression: resilient (87%) and chronic (13%). Individuals in the chronic trajectory group (for both anxiety and depression) exhibited lower levels of cognitive flexibility and coping flexibility as compared to individuals in the resilient trajectory group. Across time, anxiety and depression were linked to clinically significant PTSD-like symptoms. Cognitive and coping flexibility were linked to the probability of experiencing chronic mental health problems, making them a potential target for prevention and treatment.","","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/3m9y6","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39677,""

"Effectiveness of native language for conversational bots (preprint)","The global increase in mental health illness is rising at an alarming rate which has contributed to an increase in suicide cases. Also, a pandemic like COVID-19 has prompted the utilization of advanced technology, such as chatbots. Chatbots are artificial intelligence (AI) based systems or programs that are able to interact with human users via a textual or visual medium.Many therapeutic and economic benefits are associated with technology-enabled treatments for a range of mental health disorders. Over the past 10 years, the use of chatbots to prevent some level of mental health-related problems has increased dramatically. Industry Experts say that chatbots will help to battle mental health-related issues. However, the problem still lies due to the use of industry-standard language i.e, English. Since not every person can understand the English language and prefers to speak in their own native language, which could put a linguistic barrier between human and computer interaction. As a solution, we developed Jelly, a native conversational bot that can interact with users in their native language i.e, Nepali. We surveyed them to find out how they perceived the differences between the two. Jelly, which is powered by Facebookâ€™s blender;one of the most powerful text generation models, Jelly also can also understand romanized Nepali with English Alphabet. The main purpose of Jelly is to transcend language barriers and become a gossipy partner to those who find it difficult to communicate in the standard language i.e, English.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2183870/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39680,""
"Psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among health care workers in Tunisia (preprint)","Background:  The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a worldwide health crisis. In Tunisia, this large-scale health crisis urgently triggered the restructuring and reorganization of health services to support Emergency Departments, intensive care units, and continuing medical care units. Concerns about the mental health, psychological adjustment, and recovery of health care workers treating and caring for are now emerging. The objective was to assess the psychological impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on health care workers' work, psychological outcomes, and return to work. Methods Our study is a retrospective monocentric clinical trial. It is performed between June and July 2022 using a self-administered questionnaire to assess: (i) the impact on their work;(ii) the psychological consequences of the Covid-19 epidemic for health care workers. Results We collected 140 responses from 73 nurses (34.76%), 23 public health physicians (10.95%), 15 health technicians (7.14%), 13 residents (6.19%), 7 interns (3.33%), 5 workers (2.38%), and 4 medical specialists (1.90%). The HAD score for depression favoured certain symptomatology in most cases (n = 72, 51.43%) and certain symptomatology in most cases (n = 73, 52.14%) for anxiety.

"â€œWe must be strong in our heart, in our mind and in our soulâ€: An exploratory qualitative study on nursesâ€™ psychological self-care in strengthening their mental health while providing COVID-19 care (preprint)","Background:  It is two years since the unprecedented and massive COVID-19 pandemic affected the world. Since its emergence, nurse frontliners across the globe faced various challenges that lead them to experience adverse mental health. An important yet often overlooked or underappreciated initial coping strategy is psychological self-care. Research has shown that nursesâ€™ psychological self-care practices strengthened their mental well-being when facing the unpredicted nature and chaos of COVID-19. This study examined the specific positive psychological self-care practices used by nurses who provided care for COVID-19 patients. Methods An exploratory qualitative study was conducted on 40 nurses who worked in providing care for confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients across Brunei. Data was collected using focus groups aided by semi-structured open-ended questions and analysed thematically using the principles underpinning Constructivist Grounded Theory (Charmaz, 2021). Results Four themes emerged: 1) â€˜Care of the mind, heart and soulâ€™ â€“ explained the meaning and importance of psychological self-care practices to the nurses;2) â€˜Physical care for the psychological well-beingâ€™- illuminated efforts undertaken to strengthen knowledge and practices for preparedness in caring for suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients;3) â€˜Venting out and distractionâ€™ â€“ demonstrated the measures undertaken to release and relieve stress;4) â€˜Have faith, think and stay positiveâ€™ â€“ described the importance of having faith in the higher being or supreme entity such as God for protection, and enduring the daily challenges positively Conclusions Due to the challenges of dealing with a worldwide pandemic, nursesâ€™ mental well-being was unintentionally placed at risk while the government strategized and prioritised containing and preventing the spread of and death from COVID-19. This study describes specific psychological self-care practices undertaken by nurses to strengthen their mental health and develop resilience in their professional care role while addressing the challenges of the COVID-19 era. Health administrators, as well as nursing educators, need to promote and developing resources to strengthen nursesâ€™ positive psychological self-care practices. This will not only benefit individual nurses but will help promote the wellbeing of patients and employees, improve the health of all, and counteract any unintended stressful situations, even beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2160729/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39683,""

"Efficacy of a Single Session Mindfulness Based Intervention (preprint)","Objectives:  Loneliness, perceived stress, depression, and anxiety have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of existing mindfulness and compassion-based intervention are effective, but are time-intensive, decreasing overall accessibility and scalability. Single-session interventions (SSIs) serve as a promising alternative. The current pre-registered clinical trial evaluated a newly developed, manualized, mindfulness-based SSI. Methods 91 adults were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) one-hour mindfulness only telehealth intervention;(b) one-hour mindfulness and compassion telehealth intervention;or (c) one-week waitlist control (before randomization to an active intervention). Intervention sessions were conducted by graduate students in clinical psychology. The primary outcome was self-reported loneliness;secondary outcomes were self-reported perceived stress, depression, and anxiety. Bayesian multi-level models were conducted to test differences between active interventions and waitlist at the 1-week follow-up and between active interventions at the 2-week follow-up. Results We found overall reductions in self-reported loneliness at the 2-week follow-up b = -2.36, 95% Highest Density Interval (HDI) [-3.36, -1.36], however there was no difference between the active interventions and waitlist at the 1-week follow-up. Compared to the waitlist-control, the inclusion of a compassion component led to meaningful reductions in perceived stress b = -3.75, 95% HDI [-6.95, -0.59], anxiety b = -3.79, 95% HDI [-6.99, -0.53], and depression b = -3.01, 95% HDI [-5.22, -0.78] at the 1-week follow-up. Conclusions Results suggest that a single-session mindfulness and compassion intervention may lead to meaningful reductions in perceived stress, symptoms of anxiety, and symptoms of depression, but not loneliness.

"The negative consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on the health of mother and child considering maternal childhood maltreatment (preprint)","Background:  Preventive isolation and social distancing strategies during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have confronted families with a variety of different limitations and pressures like preventive isolation and school closures. Especially in this stressful time, children need a stable parental home to prevent developmental consequences. Additional risk factors such as maternal childhood maltreatment (CM) may affect motherâ€™s psychosomatic health and childrenâ€™s physical well-being in times of increased stress such as during the ongoing pandemic. Objective We aimed to analyze the interplay between maternal CM, motherâ€™s mental health, and childrenâ€™s physical complaints during the SARS-CoV-2-pandemic. Method Mothers of a well-documented birth cohort for investigating the pathways leading to resilience or vulnerability in the transgenerational transmission of CM were imbedded in an online â€œSARS-CoV-2 pandemic surveyâ€ assessing motherâ€™s psychosomatic health and childrenâ€™s physical health during the pandemic. 159 mothers completed the online survey. To describe the maternal CM, data from a longitudinal survey were used. Results Our mediation analysis demonstrates a significant positive association between the sum of maternal CM experiences, maternal psychosomatic symptoms, and their childrenâ€™s physical health complaints. The maternal psychosomatic symptoms significantly mediate the interplay between CM and childrenâ€™s physical health complaints, the direct effect does not remain significant when the maternal psychosomatic symptoms were included as mediator. Conclusions Maternal CM seems to be one relevant risk factor for motherâ€™s psychosomatic health and childrenâ€™s physical well-being during a stressful time like a pandemic. Maternal CM experiences seem to influence the way how parents deal with stressful situations and increase the risk to suffer depressive symptoms. The latter impact also their childrenâ€™s physical well-being. Our results highlight the importance to carefully assess the specific situation of families with children and to provide individually adjusted assistance to help the families to get through the pandemic.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2146946/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39686,""
"A qualitative exploration of the reasons and influencing factors for pregnancy termination amony young women in Soweto, South Africa: a Socio-ecological perspective (preprint)","Background:  In Southern Africa, an estimated 24% of all pregnancies end in termination of pregnancy, against a backdrop of high rates of unintended pregnancies and unsafe pregnancy terminations. Understanding of the reasons for termination may remain incomplete if seen in isolation of interpersonal (including family, peer, and partner), community, institutional, and public policy factors. This study therefore aimed to qualitatively explore young womenâ€™s reasons for terminating their pregnancy, in Soweto, South Africa, with a focus on the impact of socio-ecological factors on their experience. Methods: : In-depth interviews were conducted with ten (10) participants who underwent a termination of pregnancy since being enrolled in the Bukhali trial, set in Soweto, South Africa. A semi-structured interview guide, based on the socioecological domains, was used. The data was analysed using reflexive thematic analysis, and a deductive approach. Results: : The majority of the direct reasons to terminate a pregnancy fell into the individual and interpersonal domains of the socioecological framework. Key reasons included financial dependence and insecurity, feeling unready to have a child (again), and a lack of support from family and partners. However, factors that influenced the participantsâ€™ decision and experience, such as the available of social support and (lack of) accessibility to termination services, were identified across all domains. The COVID-19 pandemic and resultant lockdown policies also indirectly impacted participantsâ€™ decisions through detrimental changes in interpersonal support and financial situation. Conclusions:  Amongst the South African women included in this study, the decision to terminate a pregnancy was made within a complex structural and social context. Insight into the reasons why women choose to terminate helps to better align legal termination services with womenâ€™s needs across multiple sectors, for example by reducing judgement within healthcare settings and improving access to social and mental health support.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2142457/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39687,""

Aims: /Objectives: We investigated the impacts of COVID-19 on mental health, lifestyle habits, and access to healthcare among Canadians with NCDs compared to those without, and the extent to which women with NCDs were disproportionately affected. Methods: : As part of the iCARE study (www.icarestudy.com) , data from seven Canadian representative samples (total n=24,028) was collected via online surveys between June 4, 2020 to February 2, 2022 and analyzed using general linear models. Results: : A total of 45.6% (n=10,570) of survey respondents indicated having at least one physician-diagnosed NCD, the most common of which were hypertension (24.3%), chronic lung disease (13.3%) and diabetes (12.0%). In fully adjusted models, those with NCDs were 1.18-1.24 times more likely to reporting feeling lonely, irritable/frustrated, and angry â€˜to a great extentâ€™ compared to those without (pâ€™s &lt;.001). Similarly, those with NCDs were 1.22-1.24 times more likely to report worse eating and drinking habits and cancelling medical appointments/avoiding the emergency department compared to those without (pâ€™s &lt;.001). Moreover, although there were no sex differences in access to medical care, women with NCDs were more likely to report feeling anxious and depressed, and report drinking less alcohol, compared to men with NCDs (pâ€™s &lt;.01). Conclusion:  Results suggest that people with NCDs and women have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, and that women with NCDs have suffered greater psychological distress compared to men, and men with NCDs have increased their alcohol consumption compared to women. Findings point to potential intervention targets among patients with NCDs.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2139921/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39688,""
"Social distancing and mental health among pregnant women during the coronavirus pandemic (preprint)","Background:  The effect of social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of pregnant women is of particular concern, given potential effects on physical health, family functioning, and child development. Methods Pregnant women were recruited for the â€œImplications of and Experiences Surrounding being Pregnant during the COVID-19 Pandemicâ€ study at Womanâ€™s Hospital in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Participants enrolled at any point during their pregnancy and surveys were delivered weekly until the participant indicated that she had delivered her baby;a postpartum survey followed four weeks after delivery. This analysis includes 1037 participants with baseline, 596 with follow-up, and 302 with postpartum surveys. Questions on social distancing behaviors were asked at baseline and grouped based on whether they involved social distancing from work, friends and family, or public places. Symptoms of anxiety, stress, depression, and pregnancy-related anxiety were measured. Each type of social distancing was examined as a predictor of mental health using linear model with control for confounders. Results The study population was largely white, married, and educated. Women who were younger, Black, single, or had less education or income reported fewer social distancing behaviors. After controlling for covariates, anxiety was associated with social distancing from friends and family and public events, while perceived stress postpartum and pregnancy-related stress were not associated with social distancing. Associations were substantially diminished when controlled for baseline levels of anxiety symptoms. Conclusions Greater social distancing was associated with more mental health symptoms, but worse mental health, particularly anxiety, may also have contributed to greater social distancing behaviors.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2136466/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39689,""
"Perceived Stigma among Discharged Patients of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a Latent Profile Analysis (preprint)","Background:  Perceived stigma has greatly influenced the life quality of the COVID-19 patients who recovered and were discharged (RD hereafter). It is essential to understand COVID-19 stigma of RD and its related risk factors. The current study aims to identify the characteristics of perceived COVID-19 stigma in RD using latent profile analysis (LPA), to explore its psycho-social influencing factors, and to determine the cut-off point of the stigma scale using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Methods:  A cross-sectional study was conducted among COVID-19 RD in 13 communities in Jianghan District, Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China from June 10 to July 25, 2021, enrolling total 1297 participants. Data were collected on demographic characteristics, COVID-19 perceived stigma, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, sleep disorder, fatigue, resilience, social support, and peace of mind. LPA was performed to identify different profiles of perceived COVID-19 stigma level. Univariate analysis and multinominal logistic regression analysis were conducted to explore the influencing factors in different profiles. ROC analyses was carried out to identify the cut-off value of perceived stigma. Results:  Among the participants, three profiles of perceived stigma were identified: â€œlow perceived COVID-19 stigmaâ€ (12.8%), â€œmoderate perceived COVID-19 stigmaâ€ (51.1%), and â€œsevere perceived COVID-19 stigmaâ€ (36.1%). Multinominal logistic regression analysis revealed that older age, living with other people, anxiety, and sleep disorder were positively associated with moderate perceived COVID-19 stigma, while higher educational level was negatively associated with moderate perceived COVID-19 stigma. Female, older age, living with other people, anxiety, and sleep disorder were positively associated with severe perceived COVID-19 stigma, while higher educational level, social support, and peace of mind were negatively associated with severe perceived COVID-19 stigma. ROC curve of the Short Version of COVID-19 Stigma Scale(CSS-S) for screening perceived COVID-19 stigma showed that the optimal cut-off value was =20. Conclusion:  The study focuses on the issue of perceived COVID-19 stigma and its psycho-socio influencing factors. It provides evidence for implementing relevant psychological interventions to COVID-19 RD.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2135654/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39690,""
"Mental health outcomes following COVID-19 infection:Â impacts of post-COVID impairments and fatigue on depression, anxiety, and insomnia (preprint)","Background:  The negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health is now clearly established. However, information on the levels of mental ill health of people infected with COVID-19 and potential correlates of poor mental health is still limited. Therefore, the current study aimed to study indicative of potential mental health problems in individuals with a history of probable or confirmed SARS CoV-2 infection/infections and address the impacts of post-COVID impairments and fatigue following COVID-19 infection/infections on depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Methods A web-survey including demographics, questions related to COVID-19 status and post-COVID impairments, and standardized measures of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and fatigue was completed by 507 individuals with a history of probable or confirmed SARS CoV-2 infection/infections. Results We found significant rates of significant depression, anxiety, and insomnia in our sample, with more than 70% experiencing levels above the clinical cut offs for at least one psychological health problems. Higher levels of depression, anxiety, and insomnia were associated with the severity of COVID-19 infection in the acute phase, hospitalization because of COVID-19, and higher levels of post-COVID impairments and fatigue. Reduced motivation emerged as the strongest predictor for mental ill health. Conclusions These findings highlight that individuals infected with COVID-19, especially those who still have experienced post-COVID impairments, are more likely to suffer from mental ill-health and may be more vulnerable for poor mental health outcomes. Therefore, more effective actions are needed to take in order to promote and protect mental health of individuals with a history of COVID-19 infection.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2130795/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39691,""
"Perceived social support and professional identity in nursing students during the COVID-19 pandemic era: The mediating effects of self-efficacy and the moderating role of anxiety (preprint)","Background:  Health professionals, including nurses, experienced heavy workloads and significant physical and mental health challenges during the coronavirus disease (COVID) 19 pandemic, which may affect career choices for those considering nursing and for nursing students. The COVID-19 pandemic is not only a period of risk, but also an occasion to redeploy the PI of nursing students. However, the relationship between PSS, SE, PI and anxiety remains unclear. This study aims to explore whether perceived social support (PSS) has an indirect effect on professional identity (PI) through mediation of self-efficacy (SE) and whether the anxiety can moderate the relationship between perceived social support and self-efficacy in nursing students during their internship period. Methods An observational, national cross-sectional study was conducted following the STROBE guidelines. An online questionnaire was completed by 2,457 nursing students from 24 provinces in China during their internship during September to October 2021. Measures included Chinese translations of the Professional Identity Questionnaire for Nursing Students, the Perceived Social Support Scale, the General Self-Efficacy Scale, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety disorder scale. Results Both PSS ( r  = 0.46, p &lt; 0.001) and SE ( r  = 0.51, p &lt; 0.001) were positively correlated with PI. The indirect effect of PSS on PI through SE was positive ( ÃŸ  = 0.348, p  &lt; 0.001), with an effect of 72.7%. The results of the moderating effect analysis showed that anxiety attenuated the effect of PSS on SE. Moderation models indicated that anxiety has a weak negative moderating effect on the effect of PSS on SE ( ÃŸ  = - 0.0308, p  &lt; 0.05). Conclusions A better PSS and higher scores in SE were associated with PI in nursing students, and a better PSS had an indirect effect on the PI of nursing students through SE. Anxiety played a negative moderating role in the relationship between PSS and SE.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2125232/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39692,""
"The mediating effects of positive coping for the relationship between anxiety, depression and job involvement among medical staff for emergency assistance in Shanghai, China (preprint)","Objective:  We aim to investigate the mediating effects of positive coping for the relationship between anxiety, depression and job involvement among medical staff for emergency assistance in Shanghai, China. Methods: : A total of 69 medical staff for emergency assistance were studied in April 2022.We analyzed the data using the multivariate regression model and mediation analysis method. Results: : Anxiety (r=-0.54, p&lt;0.001) and depression (r=-0.63, p&lt;0.001) are negatively correlated with job involvement. It was found that positive coping was significantly correlated with job involvement (r=0.46, p&lt;0.001). The mediation effect of positive coping on the relationship between anxiety and job involvement (=0.87, 95% CI: 0.39~1.34), as well as between depression and job involvement (=0.63, 95% CI: 0.16 ~1.11). Conclusion:  Our results revealed that anxiety/depression could directly affect job involvement. Positive coping played a mediating role between anxiety/depression and job involvement among medical staff. Public health implications: Hospital administrators should provide professional mental health interventions to relieve the anxiety/depression of medical staff , increase their self-confidence and coping ability in handling COVID- 19 practice, enhance positive coping and motivate job involvement.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2124502/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39693,""
"Longitudinal trajectories of suicidal ideation among Chinese medical students: the role of childhood trauma (preprint)","Background:  The aim of this study was to understand the longitudinal trajectory of suicidal ideation among Chinese medical students and the role of childhood trauma. Methods: : Using a whole-group sampling method, we assessed suicidal ideation in 2192 (male = 834, female = 1358) medical students on three occasions over a period of one year. The Self-rating Idea of Suicide Scale (SIOSS) and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form (CTQ-SF) were used to assess suicidal ideation and childhood trauma. The regression of mixed models was used to analyze the developmental trajectory of suicidal ideation. Results: : Chinese medical students scored higher on suicidal ideation than the general population, and the prevalence of suicidal ideation increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The trajectory of suicidal ideation among Chinese medical students was divided into two groups: a low-level, slowly rising group and a high-level, continuous group. The low-level, slowly rising group had a significant time effect (B=1.57, p&lt;0.001) and showed a slowly increasing trend. Emotional neglect, somatic neglect, emotional abuse and somatic abuse all had significant positive predictive effects for the low-risk, slowly rising group (B=0.18-0.65, P&lt;0.01). Conclusion:  The trajectory of suicidal ideation among medical students can be divided into a low-risk, slow-rising group and a high-risk, continuous group;the more emotional neglect, somatic neglect, emotional abuse and physical abuse experienced during childhood, the more likely medical students are to develop a high-risk, continuous state of suicidal ideation.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2120375/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39694,""
"A realist evaluation of the feasibility of a digital music and movement intervention for older people living in care homes (preprint)","Background:  Low physical activity in care home residents brings about negative mental health consequences, such as higher levels of depression and loneliness. With advancements in communication technology, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, the feasibility and effectiveness of digital Physical Activity (PA) resources in care homes deserve more research attention. A realist evaluation was used to uncover influencing factors of a feasibility study implementation to inform how a digital music and movement programme would work and under what circumstances this would be most effective. Methods Participants were 49 older adults (aged 65 years+) recruited across ten care homes in Scotland. Surveys were administered at baseline and post-intervention comprising psychometric questionnaires on multidimensional health markers validated in older adults with possible cognitive impairment. The intervention comprised 12 weeks of four prescribed digitally delivered movement (n = 3) and music-only (n = 1) sessions per week. An activity coordinator delivered these online resources in the care home. Post-intervention focus groups with staff and interviews with a sub-sample of participants were conducted to gain qualitative data on the acceptability of the intervention. Results 33 care home residents started the intervention, but only 18 residents (84% female) completed both pre- and post-intervention assessments. Activity coordinators (AC) offered 57% of the prescribed sessions, with an average residentsâ€™ adherence of 60%. ACs and residents mentioned improved mood, physical health, job satisfaction and social support. Improvements with large effect sizes were found for anxiety, depression, loneliness, perceived stress and sleep satisfaction, but no changes in fear of falling, domains of general health or appetite. Delivery challenges were (1) motivation and engagement, (2) changes in cognitive impairment and disabilities of the participants, (3) death or hospitalisation of the participants and (4) limited staffing and technology resources to deliver the programme as intended. Conclusion This realist evaluation suggested that this digitally delivered movement and music intervention is feasible. From the findings, the initial programme theory was refined for future implementation of an RCT in other care homes.

"Prevalence of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms and resilience in adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic in a post-armed conflict area in Colombia (preprint)","The consequences that the COVID-19 pandemic had on the mental health of adolescents are emerging and require particular attention in settings where challenges like armed conflict, poverty and internal displacement have previously burdened their mental wellbeing. We conducted a cross-sectional study with 657 school attending adolescents in a post-armed conflict area in Colombia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health information was obtained though screening scales. The prevalence observed for moderate to severe depression symptoms was 30.0% (CI95%=26.5-33.7) and for moderate to severe anxiety symptoms was 18.9% (CI95%=16.0-22.1). A prevalence of probable Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder of 22.3% (CI95%=18.1-27.2) was found. The CD-RISC-25 results for resilience had a median score of 54 [IQR:30].

"Relationship between cognition and emotions caused by the COVID-19 infection, and depression and anxiety (preprint)","Background:  Although negative cognition and emotions are known to develop with experiences of COVID-19 infection, it remains unclear whether such cognitions and emotions contribute to depression and anxiety as post-acute symptoms of COVID-19. We aimed to investigate the relationships between cognition and emotions caused by COVID-19 infection and depression and anxiety. Methods A cross-sectional survey of COVID-19 recovered patients was conducted from July to September 2021 in Japan. Outcome variables, depression and anxiety were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7);scores of 10 and above were identified as having symptoms of depression and anxiety, respectively. Exposure variables were whether participants were experiencing the following cognition and emotions strongly: threat to life due to COVID-19 infection, helplessness regarding COVID-19 infection, blaming a third party who did not restrain from going outside, blaming themselves for their COVID-19 infection, worry about spreading the infection to others, and self-stigma (Self-Stigma Scale-Short). Modified Poisson regression analyses were performed to analyze the findings. Results A total of 6016 responses were included in the analyses. The proportion of depression was 19.88%, and anxiety was 11.47%. The threat of life due to COVID-19 infection, helplessness regarding COVID-19 infection, blaming oneself for their COVID-19 infection, and self-stigma were significantly associated with depression and anxiety after adjusting covariates. Blaming the third party who did not restrain from going outside was associated with anxiety. There was no association between the worry about spreading to others and depression or anxiety. Conclusion Negative cognition and emotions, including self-stigma with the experience of COVID-19 infection, were related to depression and anxiety. Countermeasures for preventing or decreasing the cognition and emotions may be needed to mitigate these symptoms.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2110868/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39697,""
"Maintaining social and emotional wellbeing among older adults during periods of increased social isolation: Lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)","Objective:  Older adults are vulnerable to isolation and poor mental health during COVID-19, however, their access to appropriate supports is unknown. The aim of this study was to explore older adultsâ€™ experiences accessing mental health and social support during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. Method: Ten older adults aged 68 to 78 years participated in individual semi-structured interviews between December 2020 and January 2021. Responses were investigated using thematic analysis. Results: Three key themes emerged: adaptability and self-sufficiency;informal support-seeking;and digital and online technologies. Older adults were adaptable to COVID-19 restrictions;however, some were anxious about reconnecting with their social networks once restrictions had eased. Older adults relied on their informal support networks to maintain their social and emotional wellbeing during lockdown. Digital platforms (e.g., Zoom, social media) enabled older adults to stay connected with others, yet some older people were unable or reluctant to use technology, leaving them vulnerable to social isolation. Conclusions: Older adults are resilient to the challenges of COVID-19. Informal supports and digital technologies are important to maintaining social and emotional wellbeing during lockdown. Local governments and community groups may benefit from increased funding to deliver services that promote social connectedness during times of crisis.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2109779/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39698,""

Qualitative data were assessed using thematic analyses. Results: 62.7% of participants reported being not at all/slightly affected by COVID-19;40.7% reported having three/four people to chat with. 76.3% of participants did not access mental health or social services during the 2020 COVID-19 restrictions. The remaining 23.7% mostly accessed mental health-related services, with GPs the most common source of support. 18.0% of the total sample reported choosing not to access services even though they would have liked to. Conclusions: Most older adults in this sample did not access mental health or social care services. 18.0% of all participants felt they needed services but did not access them.

"Stigma Experienced by Patients Who Recovered from COVID-19 in the Post- Vaccination Period: Prevalence, Severity and Associated Factors (preprint)","Purpose:  This study aimed to estimate the prevalence and severity level of stigma experienced by patients who recovered from COVID-19 in the post-vaccination period and to explore associated factors. Methods: : This study consisted of two phases. The first phase involved the translation and validation of the COVID-19-related stigma questionnaire (15 items). The second phase was a questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey conducted between January and February 2022. Questionnaires regarding stigma, negative emotions (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21), and personal and admission information were given to patients who recovered from COVID-19 in Thailand (N = 354). Results: : The prevalence of stigma among patients who recovered from COVID-19 was 50.8%. Slight, moderate, and high stigma levels were reported by 40.7%, 9.3%, and 0.8% of the total participants, respectively. Our study found that admission duration and recovery duration were inversely related to stigma. Whereas depression, anxiety and stress were directly correlated with stigma. Other associated factors included age, income and education level. Conclusion:  Social stigma related to COVID-19 existed even after vaccination and still took a toll on mental health. Stigma might decrease through time in patients who recovered from COVID-19, but not completely disappear. Our findings suggested providing appropriate assessment and help to patients who recovered from COVID-19, especially during the initial stage of their return to the community.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2107302/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39700,""
"Prevalence and factors associated with insomnia among medical students in China during the COVID-19 pandemic: characterization and associated factors (preprint)","Background:  Insomnia has become an important issue in recent years. Insomnia is affected by many factors. Previous research has shown that during the COVID-19 epidemic, there would be a long-term negative effect on the mental health of medical college students. The state of medical college studentsâ€™ insomnia directly determines the results of medical education and the career development prospects of the medical students themselves. Therefore, it is very important to understand the insomnia situation of medical students in the post-epidemic era. Methods:  This study was conducted 2 years after the global COVID-19 pandemic (April 1-April 23, 2022). The study used an online questionnaire, administered through a web-based survey platform. The Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), GAD-2, PHQ-2, and socio-demographic information were surveyed by the Questionnaire Star platform. Results:  The prevalence of insomnia was 27.8.0% (636/2289). Chi-squared tests revealed that, loneliness(P&lt;0.001), depression and anxiety co-morbidities(P&lt;0.001), age(P&lt;0.001), and grade(P&lt;0.001) strong associations of insomnia. Fear of COVID-19 was highly correlated with insomnia (P&lt;0.001). adapting to online classes(P&lt;0.001) was a protective factor of smartphone addiction. Conclusions:  The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of insomnia and identify associated influencing factors among college students in Anhui Province, China. This survey shows that Insomnia was highly prevalent among the Chinese medical college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. These negative insomnia issues could decline learning enthusiasm, productivity, and eventually, affecting the medical college student academic performance. Therefore, the government and schools should formulate targeted programs and strategies to reduce insomnia among medical college students.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2101062/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39701,""
"Construct validity of the COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) in a Peruvian sample during COVID-19 lockdown and its relationship with anxiety and depression using structural equation modeling (preprint)","Background:  The main aims of this study were to adapt the COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) to the Peruvian population and to establish a model explaining depression using CPDI values and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown. Finally, we sought predictive values of the obtained CPDI factors for depression and anxiety as a secondary aim . Materials:  and Methods: An exploratory factor analysis (n = 300) was performed, followed by confirmatory factor analysis in a second phase (n = 1135). To explain depression scores during the COVID-19 pandemic, we performed structural equation modeling (SEM). Finally, we performed a hierarchical regression model (HRM) to evaluate the amount of explained variance of the CPDI factors above depression, anxiety, and sociodemographic variables . Results: : A 2-factor solution ( rumination and stress ) for the CPDI (p &lt; 0.001;CFI = 0.99) was found. Concerning the SEM, our model was able to explain 81% of the depression scores (p &lt; 0.001;CFI = 0.98). Finally, in the HRM, rumination could explain 17% additional variance in depression (p &lt; 0.001) and 28% in anxiety (p &lt; 0.001). However, stress showed collinearity with depression and anxiety, not continuing for further HRM analysis. Conclusions: : Our results showed a 2-factor solution for the CPDI. Moreover, our SEM model showed that female sex, younger age, and incomplete education (with high COVID-related stress and anxiety) lead to more depression symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown. Finally, our HRM showed that people who frequently ruminate during the COVID-19 lockdown are more afraid and negatively affected.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2101028/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39702,""
"Family Caregivers as Essential Partners in Care: Examining the Impacts of Restrictive Acute Care Visiting Policies During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Canada (preprint)","Introduction:  During the pandemic many Canadian hospitals made significant changes to their â€˜open family presenceâ€™ and â€˜visitor policiesâ€™ to reduce the spread of COVID-19 by instituting restrictive or â€˜zero visitingâ€™ policies in healthcare facilities. These policies have the potential to create great hardship, anxiety and stress for patients, families, caregivers and frontline healthcare providers (HCPs);along with concerns about the quality and safety of patient care. The presence of family members and other caregivers as essential partners in care is an explicit expression of the philosophy of patient- and family-centred care (PFCC) in action. The purpose of this study is to increase our understanding of how changes to family presence and visiting policies and practices during the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted patients, family caregivers and frontline healthcare providers (HCPs) in acute care hospitals. Methods A total of 38 in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with patients, family caregivers and HCPs across Canada who had experience with visiting policies in acute care settings during the pandemic. COVID patients, and the caregivers of COVID patients, were excluded from this study. A maximum variation sampling strategy was used to guide the selection and recruitment of patients, family caregivers and HCPs, based on our interest in gaining a diversity of perspectives and experiences. Results Many patients, family caregivers, and HCPs view family caregiver presence as integral to PFCC, describing the essential roles played by family caregivers prior to the pandemic. There were commonalities across all three groups with respect to their perspectives on the impacts of restrictive visiting policies on patients, family caregivers and HCPs. They fell into four broad integrated categories: (1) emotional and mental health;(2) communication and advocacy;(3) safety and quality of care;and (4) PFCC, trust in the health care system, and future decisions regarding accessing needed healthcare. Recommendations for pandemic visiting policies were also identified. Conclusions The findings from this study highlighted several impacts of restrictive family caregiver presence or visiting policies implemented during COVID-19 on patients, family caregivers and HCPs in acute healthcare settings across Canada. Participants emphasized that there is no â€œone-size-fits-allâ€ caregiver presence policy that will address all patient needs.

Herein, we report a case of a first episode of acute mania with psychotic features receival of the third mRNA-1273 vaccine. Case presentation A 37-year-old man developed talkativeness, grandiose delusions, emotional instability, sleeplessness, excitement, hyperactivity and suicidal behavior 4 days after receiving the third mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine. On the 9thdays after vaccination, he was diagnosed with first-episode acute mania with psychotic features and admitted to the psychiatric institute for the first time. After olanzapine administration, the psychiatric symptoms improved within 4 weeks. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first report of a first episode of acute mania with psychiatric features associated with the mRNA-1273 vaccine booster. Psychiatrists should be aware of this possibility and be attentive to such a rare and severe adverse effect that could occur within 10 days of vaccination.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2086934/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39704,""
"COVID-19 monoclonal antibody treatment impact on symptoms and post-COVID conditions among high-risk patients at a Federally Qualified Health Center (preprint)","Background:  Monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment for COVID-19 is associated with improved clinical outcomes. However, there is limited information regarding the impact of treatment on symptoms and the prevalence of post-COVID Conditions (PCC). Understanding of the association between time to mAb infusion and the development of PCC is also limited. Methods: : This longitudinal study was conducted among patients with COVID-19 who received mAb infusions at a Federally Qualified Health Center in San Diego, CA. A series of telephone interviews were conducted at baseline and follow-up (14 days and 28+ days). A comprehensive symptom inventory was completed, and physical and mental health status were measures using PROMIS-29 and PHQ-2. Pearsonâ€™s Chi-squared tests and independent two-sample t-tests were performed to test for association between time to mAb infusion and outcomes at follow-up. A Poisson regression model was used to analyze whether time to mAb infusion predicts risk of developing PCC. Results: : Participants (N=411) were 53% female, ranged in age from 16 to 92 years (mean 50), and a majority (56%) were Latino/Hispanic. Cross-sectional findings revealed a high symptom burden at baseline (70% of patients had cough, 50% had fever, and 44% had headache). The prevalence of many symptoms decreased substantially by the final follow-up survey (29% of patients had cough, 3% had fever, and 28% had headache). Longitudinal findings indicated that 10 symptoms decreased in prevalence from baseline to final follow-up, 2 remained the same, and 14 increased. The severity of symptoms and most patient-reported physical and mental health measure scores decreased over time. The prevalence of PCC was 69% when PCC was defined as =1 symptom at final follow-up. Time to mAb infusion was not significantly associated with any outcome at follow-up. Time to infusion was not associated with PCC status at final follow-up in the crude or adjusted Poisson regression models. Conclusions: : The prevalence of PCC was high among this patient population following COVID-19 mAb treatment. Time to mAb infusion did not predict the development of PCC. Further research in these areas is essential to answer urgent clinical questions about effective treatments of COVID-19.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2086199/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39705,""
"Level of Patientâ€™s satisfaction with Online Psychiatric Outdoor services (preprint)","Purpose:  During the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic, there have been treatment gaps for common physical and mental disorders due to vast reasons like lockdowns, poor convenience, fear of getting COVID infection, and economic restraints. Hence, to reduce the treatment gap and, also to limit exposure to COVID-19 infections, telemedicine in the form of telephonic and internet consultations has been increasingly adopted worldwide. Our centre also started telepsychiatry to cater for the needs of patients with pre-existing mental health disorders to ensure regular follow-up and compliance with prescriptions. The study aimed to assess the level of patient satisfaction through online psychiatric services (Telepsychiatry). Methods: Ethical clearance for the present study was granted by the research cell of the study centre. The sample consisted of 100 patients with pre-existing mental health disorders. This was a single-point cross-sectional study for 6 months. Hospital Information system (HIS) software, which is used to manage the patient's appointment schedule, relevant clinical and lab details along with follow-up prescriptions was used to follow the selected patients for study purposes. This software also provides a digital platform for video calls for online consultation. Client Satisfaction Questionnaires-8 (CSQ-8) were applied to collect patient data for analysis. Result: The mean total CSQ-8 score of the study sample was 21.01Â±5.80 (8-32), which indicates a low to moderate level of satisfaction with online psychiatric services. Most patients (45%) reported low satisfaction levels followed by 37% of the patients who reported moderate levels of satisfaction. Only 18% of the patients reported higher satisfaction with online psychiatric services. Conclusion: Despite the psychiatrist's ability to deliver adequate professional advice and psychoeducation through online psychiatric services, the patientâ€™s level of satisfaction was moderate to low. This suggests a need to design standard protocols and guidelines for consultation through online psychiatric services to enhance the patientâ€™s level of satisfaction.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2086007/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39706,""
"Physical or Virtual? - A Qualitative Inquiry Into Youth Perception and Preference for Safe Spaces (preprint)","Background:  Control measures from the COVID-19 pandemic had far-reaching and multifaceted consequences on the physical and mental health of youths. In particular, youths experienced a lack of safe space to turn to in times of need. Safe spaces, be it physical or virtual, provide social support and connection for youths, which are important for oneâ€™s mental health. Methods We conducted a qualitative study in Singapore to investigate how youths interpreted what safe spaces meant to them and how these spaces positively impacted their wellbeing. 48 youths were purposively recruited and took part in a one-on-one interview over Zoom that lasted between 45 minutes to 60 minutes each. Audio recordings of the interviews were transcribed, and data were thematically analysed. Results Findings from our study indicated that participants found three different interpretations for what made a space safe for them - namely as an absence of a negative experience, a neutral space where they could just be themselves, or an affirmative place to receive what they need. Youths preferred safe spaces that were physical in nature due to the relational aspects of the space which provided comfort and preferred safe spaces that were virtual in nature due to the logistical benefits of the space which allowed them to expand their social network. Conclusions Based on our findings, we propose to address youth mental health not only through schools and families, but adopting multi-sectoral public health approach, using physical and virtual safe spaces as both preventive and therapeutic strategies to address often hidden mental health challenges youth face in Singapore. When designing safe spaces for youths, it is important to consider the medium, content and audience involved to maximise youth engagement and in turn, improve the state of mental wellness for youths.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2083793/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39707,""

"A structure-based drug repurposing approach by considering the twenty four SARS-CoV2 Targets: A consensus scoring approach (preprint)","Drug repurposing is emerging as a vital approach for identifying known drugs with potential therapeutic indications for COVID-19 disease. This aims to categorize and develop therapeutics by identifying existing approved drugs from drug libraries that can effectively reduce drug development time, cost and safety risk. In the current study, virtual screening of known drugs has been carried out against 24 proteins of SARS-CoV2 (NSP1-NSP16, envelope, membrane, nucleoprotein, spike, ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF8, and ORF9b). A total of 4193 approved drugs were screened against these targets using AutoDock Vina. The drugs were classified into active and inactive molecules based on the threshold value of the docking score and the therapeutic indications of top 10 and bottom 10 drugs were analyzed in detail. From the study, it was observed that most of the active drugs have antiviral, antibacterial, anticancer, pain and central nervous system based therapeutic properties. The inactive compounds mainly fall in the categories of anti-depressive, vitamin deficiency molecules, and also antiseptics properties. Overall, the outcome of this study will help in identifying the groups of drugs or scaffold that may have activity against COVID-19 targets.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2083023/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39709,""
"Prevalence and factors associated with suicidal ideation, cannabis, and alcohol misuse during the COVID-19 pandemic in Saskatchewan: findings from a joint-effect modeling (preprint)","Background:  Generally, pandemics such as COVID-19 take an enormous toll on peopleâ€™s lives. As the pandemic extends into the second year, growing attention has been paid to the multiple adverse mental health and behavioral issues, such as suicidal ideation and substance misuse. However, the interplay of suicidality and substance misuse during the pandemic has been limited. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of co-occurrence of suicide ideation, alcohol and cannabis misuse, and the factors that are associated with these co-occurrences in the province of Saskatchewan during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We performed a multivariable trivariate probit regression on a sample of 666 Saskatchewan adolescents and adults (16 years or older), drawn from the cycle 10 data collection (March 2022) of the Mental Health Commission of Canada, and Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction (MHCC-CCSA) dataset. Results The prevalence of suicidal ideation was higher among respondents who reported both problematic cannabis and alcohol use (25.8%) than single users of alcohol (23.2%) and cannabis (18.7%). Younger respondents (16â€“34 years) and those who reported other coping behaviors that were not particularly adaptive or helpful were independent factors that were associated with the common experience of suicide ideation, problematic cannabis, and alcohol use. Having a diagnosis of mental health disorders either before or during the pandemic, and the perceived inability to bounce back after the pandemic (low resilience) are strong correlates of suicidal ideation. Those who lived alone, between 35 and 55 years of age were more likely to report problematic alcohol use. Those who reported coping strategies that were deemed more adaptive, who reported pandemic stress, and declared a LGBTQIA2S + identity had higher probability of problematic cannabis use. Conclusions As the pandemic persists, improving access to suicide and substance use interventions for the vulnerable groups identified in this study may be impactful.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2082420/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39710,""
"Married womenâ€™s decision to delay childbearing, and loneliness, severe psychological distress, and suicidal ideation under crisis: Online survey data analysis from 2020 and 2021 (preprint)","Background:  The COVID-19 pandemic has affected every aspect of our lives, including the decision to become pregnant. Existing literature suggests that infertility and the decision to delay childbearing at a younger age are associated with a lower level of well-being and regrets when women start to desire a baby. Thus, the decision to delay childbearing due to the pandemic could negatively affect the well-being of women. This study focuses on how pregnancy decisions affect the well-being of women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods From the Japan COVID-19 and Society Internet Survey, a nationally representative web-based survey, 768 observations of married women aged 18 to 50 years who had the intention of getting pregnant during the pre-pandemic period (conducted in 2020 and 2021) were used. Loneliness, severe psychological distress, and suicidal ideation were used as well-being indicators. For pooled data, a generalised estimated equation (GEE) model was used to estimate how pregnancy decision related to well-being indicators. For a sub-analysis, the sample was divided by the survey year and a Poisson regression model was used. Results Approximately 20% of married women reported that their decision to postpone childbearing was due to the pandemic. The GEE analysis showed an association between delaying childbearing and severe psychological distress, with the prevalence ratio (PR) being 2.06 [95% CI (1.40â€“3.03)]. Furthermore, loneliness and suicidal ideation that occurred after the beginning of the pandemic were significantly related to the decision to delay childbearingâ€”1.55 [95% CI (1.03,2.34)] and 2.55 [95% CI (1.45â€“4.51)], respectively. Moreover, these PRs were larger for 2021 compared to 2020. Conclusion During the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately one-fifth of married women who had childbearing intentions before the pandemic decided to postpone pregnancy. They exhibited a deteriorated mental health state. Furthermore, the negative associations were larger in 2021 compared to 2020. Loneliness has negative consequences for both mental and physical health, as well as elevated severe psychological distress and suicidal ideation among those who decided to postpone pregnancy. Therefore, the current results should not be overlooked by society.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2073501/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39711,""
"Machine Learning Approaches for Predicting Suicidal Behaviors among University Students in Bangladesh during the COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)","Background:  Psychological and behavioral stresses increased enormously during the global COVID-19 pandemic. This study intends to identify the best machine learning model to forecast suicide risk among university students in Bangladesh. Methodology: An anonymous online survey utilizing DASS-21 and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) to assess depression, anxiety, and stress levels;Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R) to identify suicidal risk was conducted from 1 to 30 June 2022. We compared six popular machine learning models (MLM), including Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), NaÃ¯ve Bayes (NB), Classification Tree (CT), and Random Forest (RF), to identify the most efficient predictive model for suicidal behavior through several metrics such as accuracy, Kappa, and receiver operating characteristic curve ( ROC). Result Determinants predicting suicidal behavior include depression, insomnia, anxiety, and stress. Besides, sex, relationship status, family income, loss of jobs, and death within the family from COVID-19 are crucial suicidal risk predictors. The performance evaluation and comparison of MLM show that all models behaved consistently and were comparable in predicting suicidal risk determinants since the ranges were for accuracy (0.76 to 0.79);Kappa (0.52 to 0.59);ROC (0.76 to 0.89);sensitivity (0.76 to 0.81), and specificity (0.72 to 0.82). SVM was the best and most consistent performing model among all MLM in terms of accuracy (79%), Kappa (0.59), ROC (0.89), sensitivity (0.81), and specificity (0.81). Conclusion SVM is the best MLM in identifying predictors of suicidal risk among university students to develop a screening tool that can guide policymakers and universities in designing appropriate, timely suicide prevention interventions.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2069873/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39712,""
"The Mental Health of Medical Students in Daegu during the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)","Background:  In February 2020, a local outbreak of COVID-19 occurred in Daegu, South Korea. It was the first outbreak of COVID-19 in South Korea and confirmed cases increased sharply, sparking intense anxiety among residents. In circumstances like this, it is important to assess the effect of an infectious disease pandemic on medical studentsâ€™ mental health, develop mental health intervention materials at schools, and set the direction for future medical education. This study analyzed the data of a mental health survey on students enrolled at a medical school located in Daegu in 2020. Methods: : An online survey was administered to 654 medical school students (pre-medical course: 220 students, medical course: 434 students) from August to October 2020, with 61.16% (n = 400) valid responses. The questionnaire included items about COVID-19 related experiences, stress, stress resilience, anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)), and depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)) Results: : Of the survey participants, 15.5% had experienced unbearable stress, with the most significant stress factors (in descending order) being limited leisure activities, unusual experiences related to COVID-19, and limited social activities. Approximately 28.8% reported psychological distress, and their most experienced negative emotions were helplessness, depression, and anxiety (in descending order). The mean BAI and BDI-II scores were 2.44 and 6.08, respectively, both within normal ranges. Approximately 8.3% had mild or greater anxiety, and 15% had mild or greater depression. For students under psychological distress, the experience of unbearable stress before COVID-19 affected anxiety (OR 0.198, p&lt;0.05), and having an underlying condition affected depression (OR 0.190, p&lt;0.05). With respect to their psychological distress during Augustâ€“October 2020 compared with that during Februaryâ€“March 2020 (two months from the initial outbreak), anxiety stayed the same while depression increased and resilience decreased at a statistically significant level. Conclusions: : It was found that some medical students were suffering from psychological difficulties related to COVID-19, and there were several risk factors for them. This finding suggests that medical schools need to not only develop academic management systems but also provide programs that can help students manage their mental health and emotions in preparation for an infectious disease pandemic.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2066788/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39713,""
"The association of severe COVID anxiety with poor social functioning, quality of life, and protective behaviours among adults in United Kingdom: A cross-sectional study (preprint)","Background:  Anxiety about COVID-19 is common. For most people this is an appropriate response to the loss of livelihoods and loved-ones, disruptions to social networks, and uncertainty about the future. However, for others these anxieties relate to contracting the virus itself. Little is known about the characteristics of people with severe COVID anxiety or the impact it has on their daily lives. Methods:  We conducted a two-phase cross-sectional survey of people aged 18 or over who were living in United Kingdom, self-identified as anxious about COVID-19, and had a score of =9 on the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale. We recruited participants nationally through online adverts and locally via primary care services in London. Data on demographic and clinical factors were used in multiple regression modelling to examine the greatest contributors to functional impairment, poor health-related quality of life and protective behaviours in this sample of individuals with severe COVID anxiety. Results:  We recruited 306 people with severe COVID anxiety between January and September 2021. Most were female (n = 246, 81.2%);they had a median age of 40 (range = 18-83). The majority of participants also had generalised anxiety (n = 270, 91.5%), depression (n = 247, 85.5%), and a quarter (n = 79, 26.3%) reported a physical health condition which put them at increased risk of hospitalisation with COVID-19. Half had severe social dysfunction (n = 151, 52.4%). One in ten reported never leaving their home, one in three washed all items brought into their house, one in five washed their hands constantly, and one in five of those with children reported not sending them to school because of fears of COVID-19. Increasing co-morbid depressive symptoms best explained functional impairment and poor quality of life after controlling for other factors. Conclusions:  This study highlights the high degree of co-occuring mental health problems, and the extent of functional impairment and poor health-related quality of life among people with severe COVID anxiety. Further research is needed to establish the course of severe COVID anxiety as the pandemic progresses, and steps that can be taken to support people who experience this distress.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2064928/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39714,""
"Gut microbial GABAergic signaling imprints alveolar macrophages and pulmonary response to viral infection associated with psychological stress (preprint)","Background:  Epidemiological evidences reveal that populations with psychological stress have an increased likelihood of respiratory viral infection involving influenza A virus (IAV) and SARS-CoV-2, but the mechanism remains elusive. Results By exploiting a chronic restraint stress (CRS) mouse model, we demonstrated that psychiatric stress substantially increased hostsâ€™ vulnerability to viral pneumonia, concurrent with deregulated alveolar macrophages (AMs) and disturbed gut microbiome. The central importance of gut microbiome in stress-exacerbated viral pneumonia was confirmed by microbiome depletion and gut microbiome transplantation. In particular, stress exposure induced a decline in Lactobacillaceae abundance and hence <U+03B3>-aminobutyric acid (GABA) level in mice. Microbial-derived GABA proved to be released in the peripheral and sensed by AMs via GABA A R, leading to enhanced mitochondrial metabolism and a-ketoglutarate (aKG) generation. The metabolic intermediator in turn served as the cofactor for the epigenetic regulator Tet2 to catalyze DNA hydroxymethylation, and promoted PPAR<U+03B3>-centered gene program underpinning survival, self-renewing, and immunoregulation of AMs. We thus uncover an unappreciated GABA/Tet2/PPAR<U+03B3> regulatory circuitry that was initiated by gut microbiome to instruct distant immune cells through a metabolic-epigenetic program. Accordingly, reconstitution with GABA-producing probiotics, or adoptive transferring of GABA-conditioned AMs, or resumption of pulmonary aKG level remarkably improved AMs homeostasis and alleviated severe pneumonia in stressed mice. Conclusions Together, our study identifies a microbiome-derived tonic signaling that is tuned by mental health status to imprint resident immune cells and defensive response in lungs. The findings are particularly significant for the subpopulation with psychiatric stress to combat critical respiratory viral infection.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2064240/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39715,""
"Anxiety and Depression in Psychiatry Residents of Universitas Gadjah Mada During Early COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)","Health workers at the forefront in handling COVID-19 cases are particularly vulnerable to contracting COVID-19 infections and mental health problems. Psychiatry residents who studied and worked in hospitals were expected to provide mental health and psychosocial treatments to health workers and COVID-19 patients. However, it was necessary to know the mental status of psychiatric residents in uncertain situations during the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to observe anxiety and depression in psychiatric residents of Faculty of Medicine, Public Health and Nursing, Universitas Gadjah Mada who worked in Sardjito Hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic. This quantitative non-experimental study was conducted using cross sectional and descriptive analytic design. All 45 psychiatry residents of Universitas Gadjah Mada participated in the study and completed the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale (TMAS) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). We used Chi-squared test, Student T-test and Pearson Correlation to understand correlations between demographic characteristics with depression and anxiety level. We found that only age was negatively correlated with the degree of anxiety (r =-0.364, p  = 0.014). However, some other variables might be correlated with several behaviors related to anxiety and depression. More study is needed to find the reasons for these correlations and to prevent mental health problems in residents.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2060388/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39716,""
"Patient-reported distress at a cancer center during the COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)","Background:  Assessments of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) are conducted by health systems to improve patient-centered care. Studies have shown that the COVID-19 pandemic poses unique stressors for patients with cancer. This study investigates change in self-eported global health scores in patients with cancer before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods and Materials: In this single-institution retrospective cohort study, patients who completed the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) at a comprehensive cancer center before and during the COVID-19 pandemic were identified. Surveys were analyzed to assess change in the global mental health (GMH) and global physical health (GPH) scores at different time periods (pre-COVID: 3/1/5/2019-3/15/2020, surge1: 6/17/2020-9/7/2020, valley1: 9/8/2020-11/16/2020, surge2: 11/17/2020-3/2/2021, and valley2: 3/3/2021-6/15/2021). Results: A total of 25,192 surveys among 7,209 patients were included in the study. Mean GMH score for patients before the COVID-19 pandemic (50.57) was similar to those during various periods during the pandemic: surge1 (48.82), valley1 (48.93), surge2 (48.68), valley2 (49.19). Mean GPH score was significantly higher pre-COVID (42.46) than during surge1 (36.88), valley1 (36.90), surge2 (37.33) and valley2 (37.14). During the pandemic, mean GMH (49.00) and GPH (37.37) scores obtained through in-person were similar to mean GMH (48.53) and GPH (36.94) scores obtained through telehealth. Conclusion: At this comprehensive cancer center, patients with cancer reported stable mental health and deteriorating physical health during the COVID-19 pandemic as indicated by the PROMIS survey. Modality of the survey (in-person versus telehealth) did not affect scores.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2058374/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39717,""
"The Effects of Online Pilates and Face-To-Face Pilates in Healthy Individuals During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Randomized Controlled Study (preprint)","Background:  Along with the covid-19 process, people started to turn to online exercise methods. One of these methods is the pilates method, which increases the endurance of the core muscles. This study aims to analyze and compare the effects of online and face-to-face pilates methods. Methods: : Fifty-eight healthy individuals aged 25-40 years were included in the study. Individuals were randomly divided into three groups;online pilates group (OPG), face-to-face pilates group (FPG), and control group (CG). Pilates groups were given pilates exercises in groups of three or four for eight weeks, three days a week, for 1 hour a day, by the physiotherapist. The control group did breathing and relaxation exercises at home. Core muscular endurance, depression, and quality of life were assessed before and after eight weeks of training. Results: : Core muscle endurance, depression, and quality of life improved after pilates in online and face-to-face pilates groups (p&lt;0.05). No change was found in the control group (p &gt; 0.05). When the gains obtained in the pilates groups were compared, it was observed that the improvement in trunk extensor muscle strength was higher in the face-to-face pilates group (p&lt;0.05), and the gains in other parameters were similar (p&gt;0.05). Conclusions: : As a result, healthy individuals have seen similar benefits in online and face-to-face pilates. Both methods are significant for gaining healthy habits and increasing physical activity in healthy individuals. Trial registration: Retrospectively registered.

"The Impact of Psychological Resilience on Chronic Patientsâ€™ Depression During the dynamic Zero-COVID policy: The Mediating Effect of Stigma and the Moderating Role of SleepÂ  (preprint)","Objective:  Chronic patients are experiencing depression caused by themselves or the surrounding environment, how to cope with the change of mentality and adjust the psychological stress response, especially under the background of the current dynamic Zero-COVID policy in China, is a problem worth further discussion. The researchers constructed a mediating regulation model to test the influence of psychological resilience on depression of chronic patients during dynamic Zero-COVID, as well as the mediating role of stigma and the regulating role of and the moderating role sleep. Method From October 2021 to February 2022, a multi-stage stratified sampling method was used to collect data in Shangcheng District of Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province. We used the random number table method. Firstly, a third-class hospital was randomly selected from Shangcheng District. Secondly, departments were randomly selected from the hospital. Thirdly, survey points were set up in each department, and chronic patients were randomly selected from each survey point. In addition, chronic medical illness burden was assessed using the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale-Geriatrics (CIRS-G), psychological resilience was measured by the Conner-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), stigma was measured by the Stigma Scale for Chronic Illness (SSCI), sleep was measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index(PSQI) and depressive symptoms were estimated by the Patient Health Questionaire-9(PHQ-9). SPSS (version 21) and PROCESS (version 4.0) were used for correlation analysis, mediation analysis, and mediated moderation analysis. Results Psychological resilience was negatively correlated with depression, stigma and sleep. Depression was positively correlated with stigma and sleep. Stigma and sleep were positively correlated;Stigma played a mediating role in the relationship between psychological resilience and depression;Sleep moderated the first half of the pathway "" psychological resilience <U+2192> stigma <U+2192> depression"" . Conclusion Psychological resilience affected depression directly and also indirectly through stigma. At the same time, sleep played a moderating role between psychological resilience and depression. The correlation between psychological resilience and stigma was stronger when levels of sleep levels were higher.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2051065/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39719,""
"Mental health and cognitive outcomes in patients six months after testing positive compared with matched patients testing negative for COVID-19 in a non-hospitalized sample: A prospective cohort study (preprint)","Background:  Most research on the psychiatric and cognitive outcomes of COVID-19 infection have been in patients who have been hospitalised, despite more than 95% of cases never being admitted to hospital. We aimed to determine the mental health and cognitive outcomes at six months of people who had not been hospitalized with COVID-19 and who had tested positive and negative for COVID-19 in Eastern Ontario. Methods: Participants were matched 1:1 at the 6-month time point. Primary analyses compared COVID-positive with matched COVID-negative participants. In addition, within the COVID-19 positive population, we used an age and sex-adjusted logistic regression analysis to explore risk factors associated with depression, anxiety, and cognitive impairment. Results: 324 participants were enrolled (n=162 per arm). 40.7% of those in the COVID-positive group were men, with an average age of 37.9 (SD 13.2) years of age. In the COVID-negative group 41.4% were men, with an average of 36.7 (SD 12.8) years of age. There were no statistically significant differences in mental health outcomes between the two groups. On cognitive testing, 21% of the COVID-positive participants and 14% of the COVID-negative participants scored below the cut off for significant cognitive impairment. Risk factors for poor mental and cognitive outcomes differed between the two groups. Conclusion: In non-hospitalised patients who have tested positive for COVID-19 there is no evidence of an increase in mental health disorders compared to people who tested negative. Any increases in mental health disorders during the pandemic are probably the effect of social changes rather than an effect of the virus itself. The exception may be the cognitive changes in those who tested positive.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2046720/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39720,""
"Postpartum Depressive Symptoms, Perceived Social Support and Their Associations of Women Under Different COVID-19 Pandemic Severities: Analysis of A Chinese Nationwide Multicenter Study (preprint)","Background:  The evidence for associations of mental health with COVID-19 pandemic severity is scarce in postpartum women. We aimed to investigate the associations of postpartum depressive symptoms (PDS), perceived social support (PSS) with COVID-19 pandemic severity, respectively, and to explore the associations between PSS and PDS under different pandemic severities. Methods This was a nationwide multicenter study. An online survey was launched from January 23 through February 29, 2020 in mainland China. Participantsâ€™ PDS and PSS were measured by Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, respectively. Results The final sample consisted of 452 participants from 19 hospitals in 19 provinces/municipalities of mainland China. After covariate adjustment, women in Hubei Province experienced higher PDS levels than those in moderate (ÃŸ coefficient = - 3.883, p  = 0.001) and high (ÃŸ coefficient = - 3.760, p  = 0.005) pandemic severity;women in moderate pandemic severity reported higher PSS levels not only than those in high (ÃŸ coefficient = - 4.947, p  = 0.008) pandemic severity and Hubei Province (ÃŸ coefficient = - 6.480, p  = 0.049), but also than low (ÃŸ coefficient = - 7.428, p  = 0.005) pandemic severity. Also, no significant associations were found between PSS and pandemic severity for women with moderate-to-severe PDS ( p  &gt; 0.05). There were significantly negative associations between PSS and PDS for women under low (OR = 0.837, p  = 0.039), moderate (OR = 0.919, p  &lt; 0.001), and high (OR = 0.951, p  = 0.012) pandemic severity, and no significant association between PSS and PDS was observed in Hubei Province after covariate adjustment ( p  &gt; 0.05). Conclusion Women in Hubei Province experienced higher PDS levels than those in moderate and high pandemic severity. Women in moderate pandemic severity reported higher PSS levels not only than those in high pandemic severity and Hubei Province, but also than low pandemic severity, and no associations were found between PSS and pandemic severity for women with moderate-to-severe PDS. There were negative associations between PSS and PDS for women in low, moderate and high pandemic severity, but no association between PSS and PDS of women in Hubei Province.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2042543/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39721,""
"Effect of psychological factors on COVID-19 vaccination side-effects : A survey study among the Korean population (preprint)","Introduction:  Side effects from the COVID-19 vaccine, such as pain, chills, headache, nausea, and fatigue, have caused vaccine hesitancy. Research on the effects of psychological factors on COVID-19 vaccine side effects is insufficient. This study aims to investigate the effects of psychological factors on COVID-19 vaccination side effects. Materials:  and Methods: A total of 227 individuals registered for the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine were recruited for this study. Participants were asked to complete a pre-vaccination questionnaire, including socio-demographic factors, the 5C antecedents of vaccination, and psychological factors (Patient Health Questionnaire: PHQ-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7: GAD-7, Somatic symptom amplification scale: SSAS, and Illness Attitude Scale: IAS). After the first vaccination, participants were asked to complete an online questionnaire regarding vaccine side effects at 20 minutes, three days, and seven days after vaccination. For statistical analysis, an independent t-test, chi-square test, and hierarchical logistic regression analysis were used. In a hierarchical regression analysis, a discrete set of hierarchical variables with vaccine side effects as the dependent variable was added: demographics for Model 1, 5C antecedents of vaccination for Model 2, and psychological factors for Model 3. Results: : Our results indicated that many factors predicted the occurrence of physical side-effects at 20 minutes, three days, and seven days after vaccination. The risk factors for side effects 20 minutes after vaccination were young age, high PHQ, and SSAS scores. Risk factors for side effects three days after vaccination were young age, high constraints, and calculation, and the risk factor seven days after vaccination was a high IAS score. Conclusion:  Our study confirmed that there is a significant relationship between psychological factors and COVID-19 vaccine side-effects occurring 20 minutes, three days, and seven days after vaccination. Depression and somatization were risk factors 20 minutes post-vaccination, constraints and calculation were risk factors three days post-vaccination, and illness anxiety was a risk factor seven days post-vaccination. To reduce vaccine side effects of the general population, screening processes must be considered to provide psychological education to those with these risk factors.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2040782/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39722,""
"Prevailing emotions in womenâ€™s suggestions on how to improve the quality of care around the time of childbirth during the COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)","Background:  Recent evidence showed major gaps in the quality of maternal and newborn care (QMNC) even across high-income countries of the WHO European Region. Collecting womenâ€™s views and emotions is crucial for quality of care improvement actions and requires innovative strategies and methods to enable quick and effective data analyses. Aims This study from the IMAgiNE EURO dataset aimed at identifying prevailing emotions in suggestions provided by women, after hospital birth in Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Data were collected from mothers who gave birth in Italy, using a validated online anonymous questionnaire. This guided women across 40 WHO Standard-based Quality Measures and gathered womenâ€™s views via a final open-ended question. We explored answers provided in Italian between March 2020 and March 2022, using sentiment analysis, a text mining technique. It allows for identifying how single emotive words in the text shape the overall emotional content. Based on sentiment analysis, we developed word clouds illustrating graphically the emotional content of the 100 most frequent emotive words. Results Responses from 2,143 women were analysed. The dataset included a total of 79,204 words. The prevailing emotion in the text was trust (3,384 words) followed by anticipation (2,053 words), fear (1,409 words) and sadness (1,291 words). Many of most common words were verbs concerning actions, such as: â€œallowâ€ (n = 201), â€œsupportâ€ (n = 170), â€œassistâ€ (n = 161), and â€œ improve â€ (n = 144). Conclusions Sentiment analysis was useful in providing a set of preliminary findings on womenâ€™s emotions related to the quality of maternal and newborn care. It may be used to improve the documentation of service usersâ€™ emotions and attitudes toward quality of care, providing information useful for researchers and health-care providers. This approach may be considered a valuable and time-saving opportunity for the extraction of important information from large datasets of free-text patient feedback data.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2036833/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39723,""
"Distress Tolerance and Family Accommodation: Associations in Parents of Young People with Eating Disorder Behaviours (preprint)","Purpose:  Family accommodation has been identified as a maintaining factor for eating disorders, with families often caught up in behaviours that characterise the illness. Given that parents often accommodate symptoms of their childâ€™s eating disorder to reduce family conflict and the young personâ€™s distress, levels of parentsâ€™ distress tolerance may help explain the variability seen in accommodation. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between parental distress tolerance (specifically tolerance of negative emotions [TNE] and intolerance of uncertainty [IU]) and family accommodation, assess the role of illness severity, caregiver burden, and parentsâ€™ mental health on this association, and understand the findings in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods. Parents or carers (N = 84) of young people (aged &lt; 18) with a suspected or diagnosed eating disorder completed an online survey comprising of screening questions, demographic and clinical information, validated questionnaires, and questions about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results. TNE but not IU, was significantly associated with family accommodation. Multiple regression analyses revealed when other significant correlates of accommodating behaviour were entered into the model (caregiver mental health and caregiver burden), only caregiver burden remained significantly associated with family accommodation. Bootstrapped mediation analysis indicated the association between TNE and family accommodation is fully mediated by caregiver burden. Conclusion. There is an association between parentsâ€™ TNE and accommodation behaviours, however this association was fully mediated by caregiver burden. Clinical implications include additional psychoeducation and therapeutic support for parents to reduce burden. Level of Evidence. Level V: Cross-sectional descriptive study.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2033435/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39724,""
"Depression symptoms among New Zealandâ€™s Asian community in the first 10 months of the COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)","Background:  The COVID-19 pandemic has elevated levels of distress and resulted in anti-Asian discrimination in many countries. We aimed to determine the 10-month prevalence of depression symptoms in Asian adults in New Zealand during the pandemic and to see if this was related to experience of racism. Methods Online survey of 1,101 Asians with a 36.5% response rate. A stratified sample of 402 respondents completed the brief Centre for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale. Analyses included: descriptive statistics, depression scores by age/gender, factor analysis of the 10 item CES-D and partial correlation network analysis of CES-D items together with questions about experience of racism. Results Half the sample reported clinically significant symptoms of depression over the past 10 months. Depression was higher among younger participants but there was no gender difference. Internal consistency was high (a = 0.85) for the CES-D which revealed a clear two factor structure. Network analysis suggested that sleeping problems might be the bridge between experiences of racism and depression. However, this study was cross-sectional which prevents any definitive inferences about causality. Conclusions The prevalence of low mood was high with half the sample scoring above the cut-off point for clinically significant levels of depressive symptoms. Depression was higher in younger people and had a modest positive correlation with personal experience of racism - possibly due to its effect on sleep. Longitudinal studies that examine a broader range of dimensions of distress are needed.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2020091/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39725,""
"A community informed cross-sectional analysis of the sexual and reproductive health barriers and recommendations of MSM and TGW in Rwanda (preprint)","Background:  Men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) in Rwanda are at higher risk than the general population of being subject to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) disparities pertaining to discrimination and marginalization. There is a significant gap in the literature concerning the experiences of MSM and TGW seeking SRH care, and the challenges that ensue. This study uses an MSM and TGW community-informed survey to analyze the barriers and recommendations to accessing SRH care. Methods:  A quantitative survey was administered to 134 MSM and TGW members of Hope and Care Organization (local non-government organization) in Rwanda to ascertain the magnitude of barriers and assign weight to the recommendations. Results:  COVID-19 induced restrictions, societal stigma, perceptions of community/local leaders, fear of disclosure/outing, and violence were found as barriers for both MSM and TGW (p= 0.05). Unsupportive policy/legal environment and long waiting times/delays were barriers specifically for the MSM whereas healthcare provider lack of knowledge was specifically for TGW (p= 0.05). More than 90% of respondents across both groups recommended unrestricted operation and capacity building of LGBTQI+ organizations, strengthening legal support, peer education & mentorship, mental health support/counsellors, increased community outreach, expansion of care to rural areas, sensitization of local, religious leaders and employers. Further specialized training for healthcare providers and more inclusive and accepting insurance were specific to MSM whereas increased media awareness and sensitization of the general population were specific to TGW. Conclusion:  This study highlights the unmet SRH needs of TGW and MSM while eliciting community informed recommendations that must drive policy change in Rwanda. The most emphasized recommendations include capacity building, economic support, accessible insurance, sensitization of healthcare providers and increased community outreach. The populations reiterated the need for SRH care to be holistic, highlighting the integral role of mental health care inclusion. Overall, psychosocial safety has been a pervasive theme that needs to be addressed to ensure SRH care delivery.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2019264/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39726,""
"The impact of working in COVID-19 hospital on mental health and wellbeing: A qualitative study with nurses in a hospital in East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia (preprint)","Background:  The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has impacted the lives of more than 580 million people worldwide and killed more than six million people globally. Nurses are one of the most impacted groups as they are at the frontline to fight against the virus and to save the life of everyone affected. The present study aimed to explore the impact of working in COVID-19 wards on mental health and wellbeing of nurses in the early stage of the pandemic in a hospital, in East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia. Methods A qualitative study was conducted with 22 nurses. They were recruited using the purposive sampling technique. Data collection was conducted from April to May 2022 and data analysis was guided by a qualitative framework analysis. Results The findings show that nurses experienced a range of mental health impacts including fear of being infected and infecting loved ones;fear of early death;psychological distress related to the conflict between the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and professionality and moral responsibility for patients;stress and worry due to public indifference and lack of role models;the negative impact of community doubt and distrust around COVID-19;and distress due to stigma and discrimination towards nurses caring for COVID-19 patients and their families.

"Evolution of patients with chronic diseases who Â did not contract COVID-19 during the first year of the pandemic;new comorbidities, mortality, drug use and use of health and social services: retrospective study and comparison by sex Â  (preprint)","Background:  The restrictions introduced to stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus have also had a direct impact on people with chronic diseases and especially on diseases to which lifestyles are relevant in their control and management, such as diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), etc. The lockdown measures implemented hindered patientsâ€™ ability to lead a healthy lifestyle (balanced diet, physical activity, etc.), which plays a crucial role in the proper management and control of chronic diseases. Method:  An observational real world data pre-post study of 668,974 people was undertaken. The patients studied were over 16 years of age, had been receiving care from the Aragon Health Service (Northeastern Spain), been diagnosed with one or more chronic diseases and had not contracted COVID-19. Sociodemographic, comorbidity, pharmacological and health resource use variables were collected during the six months prior to the onset of the lockdown and during the six and 12 months following the end of the lockdown. The comparisons by sex were carried out using a Student T-test or chi squared test to analyse differences. Results:  Dyslipidaemia (42.1%) followed by hypertension (35.1%) and anxiety and depression (34.6%) were the most prevalent chronic diseases among the study popualtion. 79.2% patients had between zero and four illness comorbidities. There was a decrease in new diagnoses of other chronic comorbidities in this population as well as a decrease in drugs prescribed and the use of health services. Although women received a higher number of diagnoses of chronic diseases, the number of drugs dispensed was lower, but the use of health services was higher. These figures were maintained throughout the pandemic. Conclusion:  Our results suggest that there was a decrease in new diagnoses of comorbidities and in the mortality rate from causes unrelated to COVID-19 due to the closure of health centres during the pandemic. This trend was exacerbated in women.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1987864/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39728,""
"Validation of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale and its relationship with preventive behavior and anxiety disorders in Pakistan (preprint)","Background:  COVID-19 has caused a huge wave of fear across many nations around the globe. From a theoretical point of view, it is argued that fear induced by an imminent threat leads people to take defensive measures and at the same time creates psychiatric disorders. We conducted this study to validate the Urdu (national language in Pakistan) version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale in the Pakistani context. We also examined the relationship between fear and 1) preventive behavior and 2) anxiety disorders among the general population. Methods: : We collected data from 2005 respondents across the country and confirmed the validity of the Urdu version of this scale. Structural analysis uncovered that fear of COVID-19 significantly predicts preventive behavior and anxiety disorder among respondents. Results: : This study confirms that fear of COVID-19 has aroused mixed feelings among the population in Pakistan. Fear of contracting COVID-19 has induced the masses to take preventive measures, while at the same time, it has also produced feelings of anxiety. Conclusions: : Previous research in this field also reported that fear of COVID-19 contributed significantly to mental health problems. Therefore, health authorities and governments must take measures to ensure mental health through psychosocial interventions.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1987704/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39729,""

"Physician Perspectives on Chronic Pain Management: Barriers, Needs, and the Use of eHealth in the COVID-19 Era (preprint)","Background:  Chronic pain is a highly prevalent and disabling condition which is often undertreated and poorly managed in the community. The emergence of COVID-19 has further complicated pain care, with an increased prevalence of chronic pain and mental health comorbidities, and burnout among physicians. While the pandemic has led to a dramatic increase in virtual health care visits, the uptake of a broader range of eHealth technologies remains unclear. The present study sought to better understand physiciansâ€™ current needs and barriers in providing effective pain care within the context of COVID-19, as well as gauge current use, interest, and ongoing barriers to eHealth implementation. Methods A total of 100 practicing physicians in British Columbia, Canada, completed a brief online survey. Results The sample was comprised of physicians practicing in rural and urban areas (rural = 48%, urban = 42%;both = 10%), with the majority (72%) working in family practice. The most prominent perceived barriers to providing chronic pain care were a lack of interdisciplinary treatment and allied health care for patients, challenges related to opioid prescribing and management, and a lack of time to manage the complexities of chronic pain. Moreover, despite expressing considerable interest in eHealth for chronic pain management (82%), low adoption rates were observed for several technologies. Specifically, only a small percentage of the sample reported using eHealth for the collection of intake data (21%), patient-reported outcomes (14%), and remote patient monitoring (26%). The most common perceived barriers to implementation were cost, complexity, and unfamiliarity with available options. Conclusions Findings provide insight into physiciansâ€™ ongoing needs and barriers in providing effective pain management during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the potential for eHealth technologies to help address barriers in pain care, and strong interest from physicians, enhanced useability, education and training, and funding are likely required to achieve successful implementation of a broader range of eHealth technologies in the future.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1965710/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39731,""
"The emotional well-being of Long COVID patients, widening social support and stigmatization in health and social services: a qualitative study (preprint)","Introduction:  Long COVID patients have experienced a decline in their quality of life caused, in part but not wholly, by its negative emotional impact. Some of the most prevalent mental symptoms presented by Long COVID patients are anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders. Therefore, the need has arisen to establish the personal experiences of these patients to understand how they are managing in their daily lives while dealing with the condition. Objective: To increase understanding of the emotional well-being of people diagnosed with Long COVID. Methodology: A qualitative design was created and carried out using 35 patients, with 17 subjects being interviewed individually and 18 of them taking part in two focus groups. The participating patients were recruited in November and December 2021 from Primary Health Care (PHC) centers in the city of Zaragoza (Northern Spain) and from the Association of Long COVID Patients in Aragon. The study themes were emotional well-being, social support networks and experience of discrimination. All analyzes were performed iteratively using NVivo software. Results: The Long COVID patients demonstrated a very low state of mind due to their symptoms and limitations that had been persistent for many months in their daily life. Suicidal thoughts were also mentioned by several patients. They referred to anguish and anxiety about the future as well as fear of reinfection or relapse and returning to work. Many of the participants reported that they have sought the help of a mental health professional. Most identified discriminatory situations in health care. Conclusion: It is necessary to continue delving into the impact that Long COVID has had on mental health, and to provide entities with the necessary resources to solve these problems.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1927184/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39732,""
"Dimensional Structure of one-year Post-COVID-19 Neuropsychiatric and Somatic Sequelae and Association with Role Impairment (preprint)","This study examined the latent structure of the broad range of complex neuropsychiatric morbidities occurring one year after COVID-19 infection. As part of the CU-COVID19 study, 248 (response rate = 39Â·3%) of 631 adults hospitalized for COVID-19 infection in Hong Kong completed an online survey between 3-2021 and 1-2022. Disorder prevalence was compared against a random non-infected household sample (n = 1837). 248 surveys were received on average 321 days post-infection (Mean age: 48Â·9, 54% female, moderate/severe/critical infection: 58Â·2%). 32Â·4% were screened to have &gt; = one mental disorder, 78Â·7% of whom had concurrent fatigue/subjective cognitive impairment (SCI). Only PTSD (19Â·1%) was significantly more common than control (14%, p = 0Â·047). Latent profile analysis classified individuals into P1(12Â·4%)-no current neuropsychiatric morbidities, P2 (23Â·1%)-SCI/fatigue, P3 (45Â·2%)-anxiety/PTSD, P4 (19Â·3%)-depression. SCI and fatigue pervaded in all profiles (P2-4) with neuropsychiatric morbidities one-year post-infection. SHAP: PTSD, anxiety and depressive symptoms were most important in differentiating P2-4. Past mental health and P4 independently predicted functional impairment. Neuropsychiatric morbidity was associated with past mental health, reduced resilience, financial problems, but not COVID-19 severity. Their confluence with depressive and anxiety symptoms predicted impairment and are associated with psychological and environmental factors.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1923784/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39733,""
"Expansion of Vulnerability in Medical Interns During Covid-19 Outbreak (preprint)","Objectives:  This work aimed to explore and describe undergraduate medical interns' perception of their training during the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods A qualitative study based on grounded theory was carried out, and the data was obtained from the focus group technique. Five sessions were held with the participation of eight internal physicians in each one. Results The main concerns expressed by Medical Interns were academic, social, and emotional. They noted their concerns about the lack of clinical practice and the increase in the severity of symptoms of anxiety and depression that they presented during the outbreak. Conclusions The medical interns' perception was that the pandemic revealed the increased vulnerability due to the evident increase in the number of students with anxiety and depression.

A profound and wide range of psychological health issues (anxiety, stress, and depression) at the individual, community, and international levels has been reported during the COVID-19 outbreaks. Methods:  An analytical cross-sectional study design was used to assess the anxiety, depression, and stress level among rural and urban FCHVs during the COVID-19 in Province 1. A multistage random sampling technique was be used the select the sample. The totalsample size was 384. Semi-structured structured valid Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) was used for measuring the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress level of FCHVs. Descriptive analysis i.e. frequency, percentage, mean, median, and standard deviation was used to assess the level of anxiety, depression, and stress among adults. Inferential analysis i.e. logistic regression was used to find the association between dependent and selected demographic variables. Findings:  The study revealed that the prevalence of extremely severe levels of anxiety was 35.5 % of the Female Community Health Volunteers (FCHVs) 23.4% of moderate level of stress and 21.6% of respondents were a severe level of depression respectively. There is significant association between level anxiety and ethnicity (p=0.040;OR=1.562;CI=1.021-2.390), occupation (p=0.013;OR=3.861;CI=1.325-11.249) and place of residence (p= 0.001;OR=1.959;CI=1.470-3.413).

"Relationship Between Perceived Social Support and Mental Health among Chinese College Football Athletes During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Moderated Mediation Model (preprint)","Previous researches have confirmed that perceived social support has a profound effect on individuals' mental health. However, the effects and potential mechanisms of perceived social support on mental health of college athletes are still largely unknown, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate and understand the relationship between perceived social support and mental health of college football athletes, and tested whether hopelessness mediated, and psychological pressure moderated the link between them. A sample of 672 Chinese college football athletes (37.9% girls;Mage = 20.43 years;SDage = 1.68) were investigated with the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS), the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Surveys were voluntary and anonymous. The results showed that after controlling for demographic variables, hopelessness mediated the association between perceived social support and mental health among Chinese college football athletes. Further, psychological pressure moderated the association between perceived social support and mental health, and the negative association was stronger for athletes with high-level mental pressure. These findings highlight those targeted approaches are necessary for the prevention and intervention of mental health among Chinese college football athletes.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1799850/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39736,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals affected by depression: Results of a CHAID-analysis (preprint)","Background:  Surveys show that the measures taken to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on individuals suffering from depression. The objective of the present work was to identify the socio-demographic and clinical groups within individuals affected by depression that were particularly affected by a worsening of their depression because of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health measures. Methods:  The analysis was based on a population-representative survey of the German resident population aged 18-69 years. The survey was conducted online from the 17 to the 28 February 2021. A CHAID analysis (Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detectors) was carried out to identify particularly affected risk groups. Results:  With the CHAID analysis conducted, the findings on psychological distress from the COVID-19 pandemic response measures can be differentiated by identifying three groups among depressed individuals who are particularly affected by the COVID-19 measures: younger and middle-aged individuals (18-59 years) with recurrent or chronic depression, older individuals (60-69 years) with recurrent or chronic depression, younger respondents (18-29 years) with two to three depressive phases. For these groups of people, the measures taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic led to a particularly severe deterioration in medical care. However, home isolation was also associated with significant impairment for this group of individuals. Conclusion:  The results confirm studies showing negative effects of COVID-19 pandemic on younger people and studies showing negative effects among chronically ill patients. However, the results presented extend the findings because they indicate which combinations of these two characteristics are particularly important in people suffering from depression.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1783571/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39737,""
"They Learn from Home: The Effectiveness of Deschooled Learning on Mental Health and Behavior of Students during COVID-19 in Bangladesh (preprint)","Background:  In the age of extreme importance of schooling education, deschooled learning has received less importance. The purpose of this study is to explore deschooled learning and its effectiveness on preventive behaviors and mental health conditions of students in Bangladesh. Methods: : This study was designed following the quantitative method, and 1,085 responses were collected from social media platforms, using the snowball sampling technique. Binary logistic regression was used to measure and infer the proposed association. Results: : As per fully-adjusted regression models, the individuals who had more deschooled learning were 1.667 times (95% CI= 1.191, 2.332;P= 0.01) and 1.426 times (95% CI= 1.038, 1.958;P= 0.05) more likely to prevent contact from symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers, respectively. Moreover, the persons with higher deschooled learning were more likely to have better mental health conditions including less fear (B= -0.462;95% CI= -0.955, 0.030;P= 0.1), lower anxiety (B= -0.482;95% CI= -0.844, -0.119;P= 0.01), and more perceived vulnerability (B= 1.292;95% CI= 0.497, 2.087;P= 0.01). Conclusion:  This study adds that policymakers may formulate health plans and policies for initiating informal health literacy (IHL) that may help increase deschooled learning and informal knowledge among individuals especially during a pandemic situation (like COVID-19) and help them to be safe by adopting preventive behaviors and maintaining better mental health conditions in low-income settings like Bangladesh.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1228683/v2","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39738,""
"Exposure to Misinformation, Risk Perception and Confidence towards the Government as Factors Influencing Negative Attitudes on COVID-19 Vaccination in Malaysia (preprint)","Introduction:  This study explores exposure to misinformation, COVID-19 risk perception, and confidence towards the government as predictors to negative attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was carried out from 30 June to 30 August 2021 involving 775 respondents. The survey instrument for the questionnaire is an adaptation from various different studies consisting of five main variables: 1) misinformation about vaccination;2) risk perception toward COVID-19;3) attitudes toward the vaccination programme;4) intention to get vaccinated;and 5) public confidence in the government in executing the vaccination programme. Results: The results of this study indicate that higher exposure to misinformation led to higher levels of negative attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine. When the perceived risk of COVID-19 infection was high, mistrust of vaccine benefits was low but there were also higher worries about the future effects of the vaccine. Confidence in government was associated with lower negative attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusion: The results of this study may help develop an understanding of negative attitudes toward vaccinations in Malaysia and its contributing factors.","","https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202210.0138.v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39739,""
"Emotional Intelligence Based Intervention Program for Children in Residential Care During Pandemic Lockdown (preprint)","Children living in residential care homes (RCH) often present conditions of abandonment due to separation, abuse and mistreatment;circumstances that are detrimental to proper emotional development, resulting in poor self-confidence, aggressive behaviors, low self-esteem, anxiety, among other developmental problems. Additionally, pandemic lockdown hinders access to mental health services for RCH service providers, and limits children to external mental health support and resources. The objective of this study was to design and evaluate the effectiveness of a remote-applied Emotional-Intelligence-based intervention program (RA-EIBI) for children living in RCH during pandemic lockdown. A non-parametric pre-test, treatment, post-test comparative design was used to evaluate effectiveness of the intervention program. Seven children living in RCH during pandemic lockdown were initially assessed using Evaluation of Neurological Soft Signs, and Empathy Quotient (EQ-I) to estimate emotional intelligence quotient. A 10 session RA-EIBI program was designed and applied to the children after initial assessment, and a final evaluation was conducted to perform related samples comparisons. Results shown a non-significant mean increase of intrapersonal, interpersonal, stress management, adaptability, and emotional state, all emotional intelligence-related skills. A RA-EIBI program is an accessible resource for RCH, and children living under this condition. EI skills were maintained along the social isolation period due to COVID-19.

We performed the first cross-sectional study of ME/CFS in community population in Russia and then described and compared some clinical and pathophysiological characteristics of ME/CFS and post-COVID syndrome as neuroimmune disorders. Of the cohort of 76 individuals who suggested themselves suffering from ME/CFS 56 subsequently were confirmed as having CFS/ME according to =1 of the 4 most commonly used case definition. Of the cohort of 14 individuals with post-COVID-19 syndrome 14 met diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS. The prevalence of clinically expressed and subclinical anxiety and depression in ME / CFS and post-COVID ME/CFS did not differ significantly from that in healthy individuals. Severity of anxiety / depressive symptoms did not correlate with the severity of fatigue neigther in ME / CFS nor in post-COVID ME/CFS, but the positive correlation was found between the severity of fatigue and 20 other symptoms of ME / CFS related to the domains of â€œpost-exertional exhaustionâ€, â€œimmune dysfunctionâ€, â€œsleep disturbancesâ€, &quot;dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system&quot;, &quot;neurological sensory / motor disorders&quot;and &quot;pain syndromes&quot;. Immunological abnormalities were identified in 12/12 patients with ME / CFS according to the results of laboratory testing. The prevalence of postural orthostatic tachycardia assessed by the active standing test was 37.5% in ME / CFS and 75.0% in post-COVID ME/CFS (the latter was higher than in healthy controls, p = 0.02) There was a more pronounced increase in heart rate starting from the 6th minute of the test in post-COVID ME/CFS compared with the control group. Assessment of the functional characteristics of microcirculation by laser doppler flowmetry revealed obvious and very similar changes in ME/CFS and post-COVID ME/CFS compared to the healthy controls. The identified pattern corresponded to the hyperemic form of microcirculation disorders, usually observed in acute inflammatory processes or in deficiency of systemic vasoconstriction influences.","","https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202209.0289.v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39742,""

This study aimed to explore the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic&rsquo;s mandatory lockdown protocols on activities and mental health conditions of community-dwelling older people in Jakarta, Indonesia. A qualitative design using one-on-one in-depth interviews was employed to collect data from the participants (n=24) who were recruited using the snowball sampling technique. Data analysis was guided by a qualitative data analysis framework. The findings showed that before the COVID-19 outbreak participants engaged in different kinds of regular individual and social activities. However, the COVID-19 outbreak and its mandatory lockdown protocols significantly influenced both their activities and social life, which led to social disconnection and financial difficulties for them. COVID-19 outbreak, mandatory lockdown protocols, and disruption of individual and social activities of the participants also caused mental health challenges to them, including feelings of loneliness, loss, sadness, stress, and anger. The findings suggest that there is a need for intervention programs addressing the socio-economic and mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on older populations to help them cope with these challenges. Future studies involving large-scale older populations to comprehensively understand COVID-19 impacts on them are recommended.","","https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202209.0268.v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39743,""
"â€˜I doubt myself and am losing everything I have since COVID cameâ€™- The Case Study of Mental Health and Coping Strategies among Undocumented Myanmar Migrant Workers in Thailand (preprint)","Migrant population have always been vulnerable for high burden of social exclusion, mental disorders, physical illness and economic crisis. The current COVID-19 pandemic has further created the frantic plight among them, particularly for the undocumented migrant workers in global south. We have conducted a mixed method study among the undocumented Myanmar migrant workers (UMMWs) in Thailand to explore how the COVID-19 disruption has impacted on their mental health and what are the coping strategies adopted by them. Following the onset of COVID-19 and the recent coup d'etat in Myanmar, our current study is the first attempt to understand the mental health status and predicament of this neglected migrant group. A total of 398 UMMWs were included in the online survey among whom 23 participated in qualitative interviews. The major mental health issues reported by the study participants were depression, generalised anxiety disorder, frustration, stress and panic disorder while loss of employment, worries about the pandemic, social stigma, refused access to healthcare, lockdown and fear of detention were the predominant contributing factors. In response, we identified two key coping mechanisms- coping at personal layer (listening to music, playing online game, praying, self-motivation) and social layer (chatting with family and friends, visiting religious institutions). These findings point to the importance of policy and intervention programs aimed to uphold mental health at such humanitarian conditions. Sustainable institutional mental health care support and social integration for the migrant workers irrespective of their legal status should be ensured.","","https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202209.0265.v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39744,""

One way to lower infection rates is the use of face masks. However, people's adherence to its usage when in public is still low. This necessitates the exploration of predictors of the use of masks to increase community compliance. This study further aims to investigate the predictors of face mask use by applying the Health Belief Model, anxiety, stress, depression, and health motivation. Methods:  A total of 255 respondents from Jakarta, Bandung, Tangerang, and Banten filled out an online questionnaire. Furthermore, hierarchical multiple regression was used to detect predictors associated with face mask use. Results: The results showed that the high perceived benefits and health motivation were higher in individuals who used a face mask when in public, while those who have high perceived barriers likely do not use masks. The respondent's level of psychological distress, including depression, anxiety, and stress were not associated with face mask use. Conclusions: : Therefore, these findings highlight the importance of personal appraisal regarding COVID-19 and its prevention behaviors. Comfortable mask design, and emphasizing the benefits of using masks in the community improve compliance.","","https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.123583.1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39747,""
"Self-medication for anxiety symptoms in the context of COVID-19, in users who go to a drugstore in Los Olivos, Lima in 2021 (preprint)","Background:  Self-medication is a non-responsible act and leads to the inappropriate use of medications, causing low effectiveness and insecurity in treatments. The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between self-medication and anxiety symptoms in the context of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in users attending a pharmacy in Los Olivos, Lima in 2021. Methods: : The research method was deductive, basic and with a quantitative approach;the design used was non-experimental, descriptive, correlational, cross-sectional, and prospective. Spearman's Rho analysis was performed to validate the hypothesis. Results: : 384 users were evaluated, finding 93.5% aged 18-59 years, of whom 53.4% were female, 42.7% had completed high school, 57.8% were single and 51.6% presented physical symptoms, predominantly muscular tension accompanied by pain, 60.7% presented behavioral symptoms, highlighting unusual sadness in the face of COVID-19 and 70.1% presented cognitive symptoms with greater frequency of concern about contracting COVID-19. In addition, the greater the symptoms of anxiety, the higher the self-medication increased from 9.0% to 21.1%. A similar case was evidenced in self-medication on their own initiative where the increase was from 7.5% to 33.3%;likewise, self-medication without medical prescription increased from 15.8% to 47.7%, and the consumption of anxiolytics or antidepressants increased from 0.8% to 26.3% caused by the symptoms of anxiety. Conclusion:  It was determined that there is a moderate relationship between self-medication and anxiety symptoms in the context of COVID-19, in users who go to a drugstore in Los Olivos, Lima in 2021.","","https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.123308.1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39748,""

"Understanding mental health trends during COVID-19 pandemic in the United States using network analysis (preprint)","The emergence of COVID-19 in the United States resulted in a series of federal and state-level lock-downs and COVID-19 related health mandates to manage the spread of the virus. These policies may negatively impact the mental health state of the population. This study focused on the trends in mental health indicators following the COVID-19 pandemic amongst four United States geographical regions, and political party preferences. Indicators of interest included feeling anxious, feeling depressed, and worried about finances. Survey data from Delphi Group in Carnegie Mellon University were analyzed using clustering algorithms and dynamic connectome obtained from sliding window analysis. United States maps were generated to observe spatial trends and identify communities with similar mental health and COVID-19 trends. Between March 3rd, 2021 and January 10th, 2022, states in the south geographic region showed similar trends for reported values of feeling anxious and worried about finances. There were no identifiable communities resembling geographical regions or political party affiliation for the feeling depressed indicator. We observed a high degree of correlation among southern states as well as within republican states, where the highest correlation values from the dynamic connectome analysis for feeling anxious and feeling depressed variables seemingly overlapped with an increase in COVID-19 related cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and rapid spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant.","","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.10.10.22280933","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39750,""
"Rehabilitation in Survivors of COVID-19 (RE2SCUE): a non-randomized, controlled and open study (preprint)","The sequelae of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) are another socio-economic problem of the pandemic. Fatigue and dyspnea are the most prevalent symptoms. It is not known whether exercise can be used to treat long COVID-19. This study aimed to investigate the effects of an 8-week face-to-face rehabilitation program on COVID-19 compared to a remote monitoring group. A total of 37 participants (24.3% hospitalized) were assessed before and after rehabilitation (n=22;40.8 sd 10.0 years) or remote monitoring (n=15;45.4 sd 10.5 years). The participants were allocated according to their preferences. Both groups showed improved fatigue and exercise capacity (Incremental Shuttle Walk Test). Participants in the face-to-face rehabilitation group showed improved dyspnea (Pulmonary Functional Status and Dyspnea Questionnaire), anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), attention, and short-term memory (d2-R and Rey's Auditory-Verbal Learning Test). Of the main sequelae, fatigue improves naturally, whereas dyspnea requires rehabilitation.

"Time trends of mental health indicators in Germany's adult population before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)","Background:  Times of crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic are expected to compromise mental health. Despite a large number of studies, evidence on the development of mental health in general populations during the pandemic is inconclusive. One reason may be that representative data spanning the whole pandemic and allowing for comparisons to pre-pandemic data are scarce. Methods We analyzed representative data from telephone surveys of Germanys adults: German Health Update (GEDA) and COVID-19 vaccination rate monitoring in Germany (COVIMO). Three indicators of mental health were observed in approximately 1,000 and later 3,000 randomly sampled participants monthly until June 2022: symptoms of depression (observed since April 2019 using the PHQ-2), symptoms of anxiety (observed since March 2021 using the GAD-2) and self-rated mental health (observed since March 2021 using a single item). We produced time series graphs including estimated three-month moving means and proportions of individuals with a positive screen (PHQ/GAD-2 score = 3) and of those reporting very good/excellent mental health, as well as smoothing curves. We also compared time periods between years. Analyses were stratified by sex, age, and level of education. Results While mean depressive symptom scores declined from the first wave of the pandemic to summer 2020, they increased from October 2020 and remained consistently elevated throughout 2021 with another increase between 2021 and 2022. Correspondingly, the proportion of positive screens first decreased from 11.1 % in spring/summer 2019 to 9.3 % in the same period in 2020 and then rose to 13.1 % in 2021 and to 16.9 % in 2022. While depressive symptoms increased in all subgroups at different times, developments among women, the youngest and eldest adults, and the high level of education group stand out. Furthermore, symptoms of anxiety increased while self-rated mental health decreased between 2021 and 2022. Conclusion Elevated symptom levels and reduced self-rated mental health at the end of our observation period in June 2022 call for further continuous mental health surveillance. Mental healthcare needs of the population should be monitored closely. Findings should serve to inform policymakers and clinicians of ongoing dynamics to guide health promotion, prevention, and care.","","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.10.09.22280826","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39752,""
"Trends in opioid seizure data and their association with opioid mortality (preprint)","Background:  The opioid epidemic remains an emergent health issue in the United States, as opioid-related deaths continue to rise in the second year of COVID-19. The introduction of synthetic opioids into the illicit supply began causing deaths in 2015, however, data describing the illicit opioid supply is scarce. Methods: We used a newly available national dataset of drug seizure reports, aggregated from law enforcement agencies across the United States, to describe changes in fentanyl, heroin, and other opioid presence in the national illicit supply from 2011-2017, by state and geographic region. We assessed the relationship between drug seizures and opioid-related deaths at the state level using linear regression. Results: National and state increases in opioid seizure rates from 2011-2017 were entirely due to increased fentanyl and heroin seizures, as other opioid seizure rates remained constant. Most increases in seizures occurred in the Northeast, Midwest, and Appalachia, where fentanyl seizures and heroin seizures were highest and increased most sharply along with opioid deaths. The composition of drugs seized was similar within geographic regions, but did vary across regions. State opioid seizures of all types were strongly associated with state opioid deaths. The strongest relationship was between fentanyl seizures and fentanyl deaths. Conclusions: The association between opioid seizures and deaths means seizure data has potential as an early-warning system to predict overdose, although national level data requires quality improvement. Regional variation in seizure rates supports existing evidence that illicit fentanyl and heroin supplies differ between regions, producing distinct regional risk environments, causing varying mortality rates.","","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.10.08.22280845","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39753,""
"Treating intrusive memories after trauma in healthcare workers: a Bayesian adaptive randomised trial developing an imagery-competing task intervention (preprint)","Intensive care unit (ICU) staff continue to face recurrent work-related traumatic events throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Intrusive memories (IMs) of such traumatic events comprise sensory image-based memories. Harnessing research on preventing IMs with a novel behavioural intervention on the day of trauma, here we take critical next steps in developing this approach as a treatment for ICU staff who are already experiencing IMs days, weeks, or months post-trauma. To address the urgent need to develop novel mental health interventions, we used Bayesian statistical approaches to optimise a brief imagery-competing task intervention to reduce the number of IMs. We evaluated a digitised version of the intervention for remote, scalable delivery. We conducted a two-arm, parallel-group, randomised, adaptive Bayesian optimisation trial. Eligible participants worked clinically in a UK NHS ICU during the pandemic, experienced at least one work-related traumatic event, and at least three IMs in the week prior to recruitment. Participants were randomised to receive immediate or delayed (after four weeks) access to the intervention. Primary outcome was the number of IMs of trauma during week 4, controlling for baseline week. Analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis as a between-group comparison. Prior to final analysis, sequential Bayesian analyses were conducted (n=20,23,29,37,41,45) to inform early stopping of the trial prior to the planned maximum recruitment (n=150). Final analysis (n=75) showed strong evidence for a positive treatment effect (Bayes factor, BF=1.25 Ã— 10 6 ): the immediate arm reported fewer IMs (median=1, IQR=0-3) than the delayed arm (median=10, IQR=6-16.5). With further digital enhancements, the intervention (n=28) also showed a positive treatment effect (BF=7.31). Sequential Bayesian analyses provided evidence for reducing IMs of work-related trauma for healthcare workers. This methodology also allowed us to rule out negative effects early, reduced the planned maximum sample size, and allowed evaluation of enhancements.

"Disparities in Naltrexone Prescriptions to Medicaid Enrollees During the COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)","Background:  The COVID-19 pandemic strained healthcare facilities and the isolation and uncertainty associated with the pandemic compromised mental health around the world. The pandemic has also been associated with an exacerbation of the opioid crisis in the United States (US), and previous studies have reported changing trends in opioid misuse during the pandemic. Our study investigated naltrexone, a prescription drug used to treat alcohol and opioid use disorders by blocking opioid receptors to reduce cravings. We sought to investigate the changes in naltrexone prescriptions issued to Medicaid enrollees in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The total number of naltrexone, generic and brand name, prescriptions across the US were obtained from the Medicaid.gov database, expressed as prescriptions per state corrected for the number of enrollees, and organized into two time periods - the pre-pandemic period from January 2019 to December 2019 and the pandemic period from January 2020 to March 2021. Statistical analyses included a paired t-test, a heat map to depict state level variation, and waterfall figures. Procedures were approved by the IRB of Geisinger. Results: There were increases in total naltrexone prescriptions throughout the time frame studied, but a decrease in prescriptions per 100,000 Medicaid enrollees. A paired t-test revealed a significant decrease in naltrexone prescriptions during the pandemic period. There was a 398-fold difference between the highest and lowest states in 2019 Quarter 1 and 424-fold in 2021 Quarter 1. Percent change calculations indicated South Dakota (+141%) and Oregon (+172%) showed a significant increase in total naltrexone 3 prescriptions from pre-pandemic to post-pandemic from the national mean (- 23.57%+5.60%). Conclusions: The results of this study were significant and indicated a relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and declining naltrexone prescription rates. Naltrexone prescriptions per 100,000 enrollees decreased in most states during the pandemic and fell by over 32% nationally from 2019 to 2021 despite a slight increase in total prescription numbers and an increase in Medicaid enrollees. These data suggest wide variation in access to substance use disorder treatment during the pandemic. Further research with privately insured patients may be beneficial.","","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.10.05.22280706","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39755,""
"Presentation of long COVID and associated risk factors in a mobile health study (preprint)","Background:  The Covid Collab study was a citizen science mobile health research project set up in June 2020 to monitor COVID-19 symptoms and mental health through questionnaire self-reports and passive wearable device data. Methods Using mobile health data, we consider whether a participant is suffering from long COVID in two ways. Firstly, by whether the participant has a persistent change in a physiological signal commencing at a diagnosis of COVID-19 that last for at least twelve weeks. Secondly, by whether a participant has self-reported persistent symptoms for at least twelve weeks. We assess sociodemographic and wearable-based risk factors for the development of long COVID according to the above two categorisations. Findings Persistent changes to physiological signals measured by com- mercial fitness wearables, including heart rate, sleep, and activity, are visible following a COVID-19 infection and may help differentiate people who develop long COVID. Anxiety and depression are significantly and persistently affected at a group level following a COVID-19 infection. We found the level of activity undertaken in the year prior to illness was protective against long COVID and that symptoms of depression before and during the acute illness may be a risk factor. Interpretation Mobile health and wearable devices may prove to be a useful resource for tracking recovery and presence of long-term sequelae to COVID-19. Mental wellbeing is significantly negatively effected on average for an extended period of time following a COVID-19 infection.","","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.09.27.22280404","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39756,""
"Long-term mental health outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection: prospective cohort study (preprint)","Background:  Despite previous evidence from retrospective cohorts suggest that survivors of COVID-19 may be at increased risk of psychiatric sequelae, questions remain on the incidence and absolute risk of psychiatric outcomes, and on the potential protective effect of vaccination. Addressing these knowledge gaps will help public health and clinical service planning during the ongoing pandemic. Methods Based on UK Biobank prospective data, we constructed a SARS-CoV-2 infection cohort including participants with a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 between March 1, 2020 and September 30, 2021;a contemporary control cohort with no evidence of SARS-CoV-2, and a historical control cohort predating the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional control cohorts were constructed for benchmarking, including participants diagnosed with other respiratory tract infection, or with a negative SARS-CoV-2 test. We used propensity score weighting using predefined (clinically informed) and data-driven covariates to minimize confounding. We then estimated incidence rates and risk of first psychiatric disorders diagnosed by ICD-10 codes and psychotropic prescriptions after SARS-CoV-2 infection using cause-specific Cox models. Results In this prospective cohort including 406,579 adults (224,681 women, 181,898 men;mean [SD] age 66.1 [8.4] years), 26,181 had a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Compared with contemporary controls (n=380,398), COVID-19 survivors had increased risks of subsequent psychiatric diagnoses (HR: 2.02, 95% CI 1.85-2.21;difference in incidence rate: 24.85, 95 CI 20.69-29.39 per 1000 person-years) and psychotropic prescriptions (HR: 1.61, 95% CI 1.48-1.75;difference in incidence rate: 21.77, 95% CI 16.59-27.54 per 1000 person-years). Regarding individual mental health related outcomes, the SARS-CoV-2 infection cohort showed an increased risk of psychotic disorders (2.26, 1.28-3.98), mood disorders (2.19, 1.92-2.50), anxiety disorders (2.08, 1.82-2.38), substance use disorders (1.59, 1.34-1.90), sleep disorders (1.95, 1.60-2.39);and prescriptions for antipsychotics (3.78, 2.74-5.21), antidepressants (1.55, 1.29-1.87), benzodiazepines (1.82, 1.58-2.11), and opioids (1.40, 1.26-1.55). Overall, the risk of any mental health outcome was increased with a HR of 1.58, 95% CI 1.47-1.70;and difference in incidence rate of 32.04, 25.76-38.81 per 1000 person-years. These results were consistent when comparing to a historical control cohort. Additionally, mental health risks were increased even further in participants who tested positive in hospital settings. Finally, participants who were fully vaccinated had a lower risk of mental health outcomes compared to those infected when unvaccinated or partially vaccinated. All observed risks of mental health outcomes were attenuated or even lower after SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with those with other respiratory infections, or with participants in the test-negative control cohort. Conclusions In this prospective cohort study, people who survived COVID-19 were at increased risk of psychiatric outcomes and related psychotropic medications. These risks were higher in those with more severe disease, treated in hospital settings, and were significantly reduced in fully vaccinated people. Of note, compared to participants with other respiratory infections or with only negative testing results, those infected with SARS-CoV-2 had an even lower risk of mental health outcomes, warranting further research into causation. The early identification and treatment of psychiatric disorders among survivors of COVID-19 should be a priority in the long-term management of COVID-19. Particular attention might be needed for those with severe (hospitalized) disease and those who were not fully vaccinated at the time of infection.","","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.09.26.22280293","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39757,""

Our findings suggest that people who live in the neighborhood with a higher number of confirmed cases became more risk-averse, less likely to trust others, and more depressed. Interestingly, the effects on risk preferences and trust attitudes are statistically significant only for men, and the effects on depression are statistically significant only for women. Furthermore, the impact of COVID-19 on financial decisions, such as buying new commercial insurance and making a risky investment, is also statistically significant only for men, which is consistent with our findings on risk preferences. Attitudes towards cadres and doctors mainly drive the results on trust attitudes. The change in employment status does not drive these effects.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Impact+of+COVID-19+on+Risk+Preferences,+Trust,+and+Mental+Health+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39758,""

However, living abroad can be stressful and adversely affect international studentsâ€™ mental and physical health. This study, conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, investigated stress-related factors affecting the socio-psychological health of Chinese students, the greatest proportion of international students in Korea. The path coefficients and mediating effects of COVID-19-related stress factors were analyzed via a transaction-based stress model for 307 students using partial least squares structural equation modeling. Cultural adaptive stress had the greatest impact on mental health. Perceived financial stress was not statistically significant. Additionally, because the COVID-19 situation in Korea is relatively mild, anxiety regarding the pandemic did not lead to stress. However, excessive COVID-19-related information on social networking services negatively impacted mental health. Understanding the causes of stress and taking preemptive measures to prevent it will result in positive educational and social consequences for both international students and host countries.

Sociodemographic and clinical data was collected. Vaccine hesitancy and explanatory factors were assessed using validated scales: the Oxford COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Scale, the Oxford COVID-19 Vaccine Confidence and Complacency Scale, and the Disease Influenced Vaccine Acceptance Scale-Six (DIVAS-6). Regression analyses controlling for time were used. Results: Of the 842 participants (median age 58 [IQR 19] years;378 [44.9%] females), 696 (82.7%) had at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose. Compared to the 252 participants with type 1 diabetes (29.9%), the 557 participants with type 2 diabetes (66.2%) were more likely to be vaccinated (OR 2.39, 95% CI 1.61-3.53), have a lower level of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (B[SE] -1.44 [0.47]), a lesser degree of negative attitudes around vaccine complacency and confidence (B[SE] -1.64[0.79]), but a higher level of DIVAS-6 diabetes-related complacency about COVID-19 infection (B[SE] 0.68[0.26]), all p&lt;0.05. After controlling for age, associations remained significant for vaccinated status and DIVAS-6 diabetes-related COVID-19 infection complacency. Conclusions: Despite an overall high COVID-19 vaccination rate, patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes exhibited differences in uptake, hesitancy, complacency, and the impact of having diabetes on their decision for vaccination. This knowledge should drive differences in targeting education, particularly with the need for booster doses.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Covid-19+Vaccine+Hesitancy+and+Status+in+People+with+Diabetes+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39760,""
"Association between Demographic Characteristics, Pre-Existing Comorbidities and Post-Covid-19 Symptoms Developed 12 Months after the Onset: A Network Analysis (preprint)","Background: Although acute manifestations COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 heterogeneously affect the pulmonary, cardiovascular, neurologic, hematologic and gastrointestinal systems, the current health-care challenge is to focus on post-acute and long-COVID stages due to the high number of COVID-19 survivors presenting post-COVID-19 sequelae. Objective: Since network analyses provide allow the understanding of interaction between demographic, pre-existing comorbidities and post-COVID symptoms after 12 months, we aimed to illustrate the potential of a network analysis for this purpose. Methods: A longitudinal observational study was conducted assessing demographic characteristics (age, weight, height and gender), multiple pre-existing comorbidities (i.e., obesity, hypertension, diabetes, asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease -COPD-, pre-existing pain and cardiac and rheumatological diseases) and up to 25 post-COVID symptoms (i.e., dyspnea, musculoskeletal pain, memory loss, brain fog, hair loss, tachycardia, skin rashes, gastrointestinal problems, diarrhea, voice problems, ageusia, anosmia, ocular problems, throat pain, daily life limitations, anxiety, depression and sleep quality). Results: Data from 1571 COVID-19 survivors with post-COVID-10 symptoms (54.1% males;61.0Â±16.2 years old;74.4Â±14.1 kg) were analyzed. The most prevalent comorbidities were pre-existing pain (39.8%), arterial hypertension (25.6%) and type-2 diabetes mellitus (12.8%). Although a previous review reported whether pre-existing conditions may predispose patients to a higher rate of severe acute course of COVID-19, our network demonstrated limited associations between pre-existing comorbidities with an increased risk of developing post-COVID symptoms 12 months after the disease onset. Only pain as pre-existing comorbidity showed to be associated with post-COVID dyspnea, musculoskeletal pain and sleep quality. However, we found multiple internal correlations among pre-existing comorbidities and post-COVID symptoms. Conclusion: Although pre-existing comorbidities are associated with acute COVID-19 severity, we found limited associations with post-COVID symptoms 12 months after the onset. However, due to the internal associations between symptoms, rehabilitative strategies should target those outcomes with greater centrality for better efficacy of the treatments.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Association+between+Demographic+Characteristics,+Pre-Existing+Comorbidities+and+Post-Covid-19+Symptoms+Developed+12+Months+after+the+Onset:+A+Network+Analysis+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39761,""
"Deaths in Four Opioid Categories Among the Older Population During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Florida (preprint)","Background: Opioid overdose deaths remain a global health problem. More than half a million people died from drug use, and 70% of these deaths were attributable to opioids. The problem is more severe in the United States where opioid overdose deaths had a 44.18% increase from 47, 600 deaths in 2017 to 68,630 deaths in 2020 alone. While public attention is focused on younger adults, the consistent increase in opioid overdose deaths in the older population warrants careful attention. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of older decedents or people &gt; 65 years who died from opioids during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Findings: Three hundred forty-eight older decedents died from opioids as a cause of death in Florida in 2020. Eighty percent of these deaths resulted from accidents, and suicides accounted for 18.15%. Among those who died from accidents, one hundred percent were due to opioid intoxication. More older men died from accidents, while more older women with opioid deaths died from suicides. Over 160 cases of opioid deaths involved benzodiazepines, followed by cocaine with 104 cases, ethanol-81 cases, and psychostimulants with 47 cases. Interpretation: Our study results provide critical evidence of the adverse outcome of opioid use and overdoses among older adults. The co-presence of other substances in OOD suggests unsafe illicit drug use even in old age. Opioid deaths resulting from accidents and suicides underscore the need for sustainable harm reduction strategies tailored to the needs of this vulnerable age group.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Deaths+in+Four+Opioid+Categories+Among+the+Older+Population+During+the+COVID-19+Pandemic+in+Florida+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39762,""
"Mental Health, Resilience, and Well-Being During COVID-19 Outbreak: Learning from Balinese Culture and Public Policy (preprint)","Various policies and efforts have been made by the Indonesian government to help the community recover from the various impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the recovery of psychological health disorders. It is necessary to study the condition of the community to formulate more appropriate policies. This study describes the mental health condition of the community during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Analysis of factors related to threats and obtaining psychological well-being is used to formulate future disaster mitigation policies. A cross-sectional survey was conducted on communities in Bali, Indonesia. A total of 311 respondents (aged between 15 and 72 years) were involved in the survey through DASS-21, PGWBI-22, and CD RISC-25, from July to September 2021. The results of this study indicate that the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress is higher than previous research. The psychological well-being index is also high. Cultural and religious values <U+200B><U+200B>are the key to people's resilience, which makes them grateful and prosperous despite high levels of anxiety, stress, and depression. Regression analysis confirms that resilience is an important factor in maintaining psychological happiness. The findings also noted that the Covid-19 vaccine was associated with less depression, anxiety, and stress. The results of this study contribute to disaster mitigation policies and mental health support interventions for the community during and after the Covid-19 pandemic.

"Failure of neuron network coherence induced by SARS-CoV-2-infected astrocytes (preprint)","Coherent activations of brain neuron networks underlay many physiological functions associated with various behavioral states. These synchronous fluctuations in the electrical activity of the brain are also referred to as brain rhythms. At the cellular level, the rhythmicity can be induced by various mechanisms of intrinsic oscillations in neurons or network circulation of excitation between synaptically coupled neurons. One of the specific mechanisms concerns the activity of brain astrocytes that accompany neurons and can coherently modulate synaptic contacts of neighboring neurons, synchronizing their activity. Recent studies have shown that coronavirus infection (Covid-19), entering the central nervous system and infecting astrocytes, causes various metabolic disorders. Specifically, Covid-19 can depress the synthesis of astrocytic glutamate and GABA. It is also known that in the postcovid state, patients may suffer from symptoms of anxiety and impaired cognitive functions, which may be a consequence of disturbed brain rhythms. We propose a mathematical model of a spiking neural network accompanied by astrocytes capable to generate quasi-synchronous rhythmic bursting discharges. The model predicts that if the astrocytes are infected, and the release of glutamate is depressed, then normal burst rhythmicity suffers dramatically. Interestingly, in some cases, the failure of network coherence may be intermittent with intervals of normal rhythmicity, or the synchronization can completely disappears.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Failure+of+neuron+network+coherence+induced+by+SARS-CoV-2-infected+astrocytes+(preprint)","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39764,""

"The social prescribing of psychosocial interventions in the treatment of addictions and substance use disorders with military veterans: a reclamation of identity and belonging [version 2;peer review: 2 approved] (preprint)","Social prescribing is a way of connecting individuals to a source of support within the community to help improve their health and well-being. Social prescribing programmes are being widely promoted within the United Kingdom (UK) and United States as non-pharmaceutical interventions for those living with addiction and substance misuse needs. These needs have been exasperated by the recent COVID-19 pandemic and global economic crisis, with emerging research indicating short-term and long-term detrimental effects on physical and mental health due to substance misuse and addictions. Psychosocial interventions utilize psychological or social factors rather than an overreliance on biological interventions to treat the health impacts of mental illnesses such as addictions and substance use disorder. In this paper, I will discuss the associated determinants of addictions and substance for the military veteran population, as well as how the social prescribing of psychosocial interventions could be used to reaffirm participantâ€™s identity and enhance their sense of belonging for military veterans, using a real-world example in Wales, UK.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+social+prescribing+of+psychosocial+interventions+in+the+treatment+of+addictions+and+substance+use+disorders+with+military+veterans:+a+reclamation+of+identity+and+belonging+[version+2;peer+review:+2+approved]+(preprint)","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39766,""
"Interrelationships between Health, Economic, and Societal Impacts of the Covid-19 Pandemic and Vaccination: An Impact Diagram (preprint)","BACKGROUND: Health technology assessment (HTA) processes have generally focused on health-related outcomes;however, as broader societal and economic impacts might be equally or more significant in a pandemic setting, vaccinationâ€™s benefits extend beyond the values considered in such processes. Despite this, there is no consensus on how best to capture the broader impacts of vaccination in economic models informing HTAs. This is partly because various economic and societal outcomes are interrelated, sometimes overlapping, and can lead to double counting of effects if assessed individually. OBJECTIVE: We sought to inform discussion on the inclusion of broader value elements into vaccine evaluation frameworks by providing a comprehensive list of relevant elements and mapping their interrelationships in an impact diagram (ID). METHOD: A targeted literature review was conducted to identify value elements related to the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination. A list was compiled based on published vaccine-evaluation frameworks and identified literature on the impact of the pandemic on societal outcomes. The causal pathways between value elements were mapped in an ID. RESULTS: The ID (Figure) illustrates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccination, and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on health-related and financial outcomes of patients, caregivers, the healthcare sector, government, and society. COVID-19 cases and NPIs directly impact health outcomes of patients, healthcare resource use, and medical costs. Vaccinations impact the number of COVID-19 cases, resource use and potentially health outcomes through adverse events. Care management of COVID-19 may place a burden on the health system, leading to deprioritized screening and care of non-COVID-19 patients. It can also cause changes in antibiotic use that may eventually affect anti-microbial resistance. Additionally, NPIs are associated with neglected education, increasing learning inequalities, impact on mental health and quality of life deterioration. These factors have macroeconomic and fiscal implications through supply and demand side channels, and entail environmental consequences. The uncertainty associated with health and economic outcomes imposes health and financial risks on society as well. CONCLUSION: Health-related, economic, and societal consequences of the pandemic and vaccination constitute a complex system of interrelated outcomes that need to be explored to assess the full value of vaccination.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Interrelationships+between+Health,+Economic,+and+Societal+Impacts+of+the+Covid-19+Pandemic+and+Vaccination:+An+Impact+Diagram+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39767,""
"Demystifying Quantum Blockchain for Healthcare (preprint)","The application of blockchain technology can be beneficial in the field of healthcare as well as in the fight against the COVID-19 epidemic. In this work, the importance of blockchain is analyzed and it is observed that blockchain technology and the processes associated with it will be utilised in the healthcare systems of the future for data acquisition from sensors, automatic patient monitoring, and secure data storage. This technology substantially simplifies the process of carrying out operations because it can store a substantial quantity of data in a dispersed and secure manner, as well as enable access whenever and wherever it is required to do so. With the assistance of quantum blockchain, the benefits of quantum computing, such as the capability to acquire thermal imaging based on quantum computing and the speed with which patients may be located and monitored, can all be exploited to their full potential. Quantum blockchain is another tool that can be utilised to maintain the confidentiality, authenticity, and accessibility of data records. The processing of medical records could potentially benefit from greater speed and privacy if it combines quantum computing and blockchain technology. The authors of this paper investigate the possible benefits and applications of blockchain and quantum technologies in the field of medicine, pharmacy and healthcare systems. In this context, this work explored and compared quantum technologies and blockchain-based technologies in conjunction with other cutting-edge information and communications technologies such as ratification intelligence, machine learning, drones, and so on.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Demystifying+Quantum+Blockchain+for+Healthcare+(preprint)","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39768,""
"Examination of Methadone Involved Overdoses During the COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)","Background: The US opioid overdose epidemic continues to escalate. The restrictions on methadone availability including take-home dosing were loosened during the COVID-19 pandemic although there have been concerns about the high street value of diverted methadone. This report examined how fatal overdoses involving methadone have changed over the past two-decades including during the pandemic. Methods: The CDCâ€™s Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) was used to find the unintentional methadone related overdose death rate from 1999-2020. Unintentional methadone deaths were defined using the ICD X40-44 codes with only data for methadone (T40.3). Data from the DEAâ€™s Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System (ARCOS) on methadone overall use, opioid treatment programs use, and pain management use was gathered for all states for 2020 and corrected for population. Results: There have been dynamic changes over the past two-decades in methadone overdoses. Overdoses increased from 1999 (0.9/million) to 2007 (15.9) and declined until 2019 (6.5). Overdoses in 2020 (9.6) were 48.1% higher than in 2019 (t(50)= 3.05, p &lt; .005). The state level correlations between overall methadone use (r(49)= +0.75, p &lt; .001), and opioid treatment program use (r(49) = +0.77, p &lt; .001) with overdoses were positive, strong, and statistically significant. However, methadone use for pain treatment was not associated with methadone overdoses (r(49) = -.08). Conclusions: Overdoses involving methadone significantly increased by 48.1% in 2020 relative to 2019. Policy changes that were implemented following the COVID-19 pandemic involving methadone take-homes may warrant further study before they are made permanent.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Examination+of+Methadone+Involved+Overdoses+During+the+COVID-19+Pandemic+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39769,""
"Food Insecurity and COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Among Adults in the United States (US) (preprint)","Background: Some documented barriers of vaccination behaviors include social determinants of health (SDoH). While there have been many devastations from COVID-19, food security has fluctuated during the pandemic. The purpose of this study is to examine the association with food insecurity and vaccine hesitancy among adults in the U.S. Methods: Federal agencies created the online Household Pulse Survey (HPS) to track social outcomes of the pandemic in the U.S. We performed cross-sectional analysis with data from the Week 44 HPS collected on adults (N=6449, weighted N=37,687,910). Vaccine hesitancy was divided into two groups, and food sufficiency was a binary variable (Yes/no) based on the question that best described the food eaten in the household the last 7 days.  Chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regressions were conducted using replicate weights with SAS. Logistic regressions adjusted for sex, age, race and ethnicity, income, education, COVID-19 infection, health insurance, food insecurity, children &lt;17 years, remote work, health worker status, functional status, and mental health. Results: During HPS Week 44, 11.2% of represented Americans experienced food insecurity, and 13.8% were vaccine hesitant. The unadjusted odds ratio was 2.41 (95% CI = 1.30, 4.50), suggesting adults with food insecurity were more likely to be vaccine hesitant. After adjusting for age, sex, race and ethnicity, marital status, and COVID-19 history, the statistical significance remained (AOR = 2.14, 95% CI = 1.15, 3.99). However, after adjusting for education, we no longer observed a significant association (AOR = 1.70, 95% CI = 0.89, 3.34). Conclusion: Overall, adults with food insecurity were 2.41 times as likely as those with food security to also have vaccine hesitancy. Education mediated the relationship between food insufficiency and vaccine hesitancy. Programs to improve vaccination rates need to also focus on food sufficiency.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Food+Insecurity+and+COVID-19+Vaccine+Hesitancy+Among+Adults+in+the+United+States+(US)+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39770,""

"Older Workersâ€™ Employment and Social Security Spillovers Through the Second Year of the COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)","The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a large and immediate drop in employment among US workers, along with major expansions of unemployment insurance and work from home. We use Current Population Survey and Social Security application data to study employment among older adults and their participation in disability and retirement insurance programs through the second year of the pandemic. We find ongoing improvements in employment outcomes among older workers in the labor force, along with sustained higher levels in the share no longer in the labor force during this period. Applications for Social Security disability benefits remain depressed, particularly for Supplemental Security Income. In models accounting for the expiration of expanded unemployment insurance, we find that the loss of these additional financial supports is associated with a drop in older adult unemployment rates and an increase in Social Security Disability Insurance claiming.

"Fluoxetine pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution quantitatively supports a therapeutic role in COVID-19 at a minimum dose of 20 mg per day [version 3;peer review: 2 approved] (preprint)","Background. Â Various in vitro studies have shown fluoxetine inhibits multiple variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pathogen causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide pandemic and multiple observational clinical studies have shown that patients receiving fluoxetine experienced clinical benefit by lowering the risk of intubation and death. The aim of this study is to conduct population pharmacokinetic dosing simulations to quantify the percentage of patients achieving a trough level for the effective concentration resulting in 50% (EC50) and 90% (EC90) inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 as reported in Calu-3 human lung cells. Methods. Â Pharmacometric parameter estimates used in this study were obtained from the U.S. FDA website from a new drug application for fluoxetine hydrochloride. A population of 1,000 individuals were simulated at standard fluoxetine antidepressant doses (20 mg/day, 30 mg/day, 40 mg/day, 50 mg/day, and 60 mg/day) to estimate the percentage of the patients achieving a trough plasma level for the EC50 and EC90 SARS-CoV-2 inhibition. All analyses were conducted in R. Results. Â By day-10 at 20 mg/day, 93.2% and 47% of the population will achieve the trough target plasma EC50 and EC90 concentrations, respectively, which translates to a lung tissue distribution coefficient of 60-times higher EC50 (283.6 ng/ml [0.82 mM]) and EC90 (1390.1 ng/ml [4.02 mM]). Further, by day-10 at an ideal dose of 40 mg/day, 99% and 93% of patients will reach the trough EC50 and EC90 concentrations, respectfully. Lastly, only a dose of 60 mg/day will reach the SARS-CoV-2 EC90 inhibitory concentration in the brain at pharmacokinetic steady-state. Conclusion. Overall, with a minimum treatment period of 10-days and a minimum dose of 20 mg/day, this study corroborates in vitro studies reporting fluoxetine inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 titers and also multiple observational clinical studies showing therapeutic benefit of fluoxetine in COVID-19 patients.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Fluoxetine+pharmacokinetics+and+tissue+distribution+quantitatively+supports+a+therapeutic+role+in+COVID-19+at+a+minimum+dose+of+20+mg+per+day+[version+3;peer+review:+2+approved]+(preprint)","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39773,""
"The Listening Project: A Qualitative Study on the Experiences of Pre-Registered Nurses During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Scotland (preprint)","Background: During the COVID 19 pandemic academic institutes worldwide were forced to shift to online or socially distanced learning. Nursing students faced unique challenges due to the limited practical learning environment and removal of supernumerary status to meet increased pressure on health care resources. Aim: To explore the experiences and perceptions of pre-registered nurses in relation to their university education during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Underpinned by Lizzioâ€™s (2006) five senses of student success model, a novel qualitative approach using peer-to-peer discussion was utilized to explore the experiences of pre-registered nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Students who were on their second and final year in the nursing program were invited to participate. Interviews were conducted and transcribed using an online meeting platform. Data were analysed using the five main stages of framework analysis. Results: Eleven peer-to-peer discussion with 22 students were conducted. The five themes were linked with the five senses student success model: capability, connectedness, purpose, resourcefulness, and culture. Six sub-themes emerged in the data: confidence and learning process, building relationships, communication, student as health professional and mental health consequences of COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: Whilst there was strength in university provision, the pandemic was an opportunity for students and academics to reflect and learn about how to further support students thereby building programme resilience and enhancing student support processes.

This study examined levels of depression and anxiety among remote and in-person 10th-graders, and how these outcomes varied by race, gender, and socioeconomic status. Methods: Racially and socioeconomically diverse students (n=402) from two high schools in semi-rural Georgia completed a one-time survey in Fall 2020. Results were linked to demographic data provided by the school district. Bivariate analyses assessed for associations between demographics and mental health outcomes, and logistic regression analyses identified predictors of anxiety and depression. Results: Average depression levels were significantly higher among remote than in-person learners (p&lt;.0051). More than half (53%) of virtual and 40% of in-person learners experienced moderate-severe depression (p&lt; .0469). Multiracial, Black, and Hispanic students reported the highest rates of moderate-severe depression, and more minority learners, females, and students eligible for free or reduced-cost lunch (FRL) experienced depressive symptoms than their counterparts. Fewer than 20% of all students experienced moderate-extreme anxiety, and there were no significant differences in anxiety levels by learning modality, race, or FRL. Female sex remained the only significant predictor of depression (OR= 2.91, 95% CI [1.67, 4.66]) and anxiety (OR= 2.92, 95% CI [1.76, 4.85]) after controlling for learning modality, race, and FRL. Conclusion: Our findings suggest levels of depression have been particularly high among female, remote, lower-income, and minority 10th-graders during COVID-19. The pandemicâ€™s effects on high-school youth warrant enhanced mental health screening and tailored interventions to support the psychological well-being of our most vulnerable students both now and in the future.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Impact+of+Remote+vs.+In-Person+Learning+on+Mental+Health+Outcomes+Among+High+School+Students+During+the+COVID-19+Pandemic+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39775,""

"Understanding university student priorities for mental health and well-being support: A mixed-methods exploration using the person-based approach","Poor student well-being at UK universities is overstretching institutional support services, highlighting a need for effective new resources. Despite extensive literature on mental health and well-being interventions, students' engagement with support remains unexplored. The study aimed to understand students' experience of engagement with well-being support, identify their well-being needs and form concrete recommendations for future intervention design and delivery. The Person-Based Approach to intervention design was followed to centralise users' experience, in turn maximising acceptability and effectiveness of resources. An online survey (N = 52) was followed by three focus groups (N = 14). Survey data were analysed descriptively, and reflexive thematic analysis was performed on qualitative data. Mixed-methods data integration produced four key student priorities for well-being resources â€“ ease of access, inclusive and preventative approach, sense of community and a safe space, and applying skills to real-life contexts. Five actionable guiding principles for intervention design were produced through consultation with expert stakeholders. This work helps understand why and how students engage with support at university. The resulting recommendations can inform future intervention development, leading to more acceptable, engaging and effective student well-being resources.

"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the financial viability of Australian general practice","Background: Primary care practices faced many challenges responding to the COVID-19 pandemic including a downturn in patient attendances, the rapid adoption of telehealth and increased bulkbilling requirements. Aim(s): The aim of this research was to understand impacts of COVID-19 and public health response on practice financial viability. Method(s): An online survey of Australian general practices and community allied health practice (AHP) staff operating prior and during the pandemic was administered in April 2021. The survey explored adaptations and impacts on practice finances during early lockdown (March 2020) and a year into the pandemic (March 2021). Respondents were recruited through primary health networks, peak bodies and social media. Survey data were analysed using Stata 16. Finding(s): 72% (n=213) of valid responses were from general practices, including general practitioners (GPs) (n=142), practice managers (n=49) and practice nurses (n=19). 28% (n=84) of responses were from AHPs (most commonly psychologists n=22, chiropractors n=19). During early lockdown most respondents reported reductions in patient numbers (66%) and income (72%). One year into the pandemic most practices reported patient numbers had increased as had practice costs. 46% of respondents reported decreased practice profitability one year after pandemic onset. Reduced profitability was more commonly reported by GP respondents (56%) than AHPs providing mental health services (24%) or physical health services (31%). Implications: Many primary care practices continue to suffer negative financial impacts one year after the pandemic onset. This has potential to decrease practice viability, affecting the sustainability of the primary care workforce, access to services and current models of primary care.","Wright, M.; Wise, S.; Hoffman, R.; Petrozzi, M.

"Investigating the relationships between emotional experiences and behavioral responses amid the Covid-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional survey","The Covid-19 pandemic produced a complex combination of intense negative emotions among the general public, influencing people's coping reactions towardÂ the pandemic. Yet each discrete emotion may affect people's behaviors in different ways. Unveiling the specific emotionâ€“behavior relationships can provide valuable implications for designing effective intervention programs. Through the lens of the appraisal theory of emotion, we assessed the relationships between negative emotions and pandemic-related behaviors among the Chinese population midst the early outbreak of the pandemic. An anonymous online survey was distributed to mainland Chinese participants (n = 2976), which assessed individuals' emotional states and behavioral reactions to the pandemic. Consistent with the differential appraisal theme underlying each negative emotion as delineated by the appraisal theory, mixed relationships between emotions and pandemic-related behaviors were revealed. Specifically, anxiety was positively associated with behaviors of seeking pandemic-related information, sharing such information, and stockpiling preventive goods, yet, contrary to prediction, anxious people were reluctant to adopt preventive measures, which is maladaptive. Sad people sought information less frequently and exhibited lower intention to stockpile preventive goods;but, opposing prediction, they shared information less frequently. Angry people were more active in sharing information and in stockpiling preventive goods. These findings suggest that public health practitioners can utilize the emotionâ€“behavior relationships to identify the vulnerable individuals who tend to adopt maladaptive coping behaviors, help them address emotional distress, and encourage their adoption of effective coping behaviors. This research unveils the distinct relationships between Chinese public's discrete negative emotions (anxiety, anger, and sadness) elicited by the Covid-19 pandemic and their behavioral reactions (seeking information, sharing information, preventive health behavior, and stockpiling) towardÂ the pandemic. Unveiling these specific emotionâ€“behavior relationships can help to identify the vulnerable individuals who tend to adopt maladaptive coping behaviors and encourage their adoption of effective coping behaviors, and help to designÂ effective intervention programs.","Wang, Tingting, Zheng, Xin, Niu, Zhaomeng, Hu, Pengwei, Dong, Ruiqi, Tang, Zhihan","https://www.google.com/search?q=Investigating+the+relationships+between+emotional+experiences+and+behavioral+responses+amid+the+Covid-19+pandemic:+A+cross-sectional+survey","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Health Care Science;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39782,""
"Echocardiographic Evaluation of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) Associated with COVID-19","Cardiac involvement is an observable issue in multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associ20 ated with COVID-19. The most common echocardiographic findings in MIS-C are abnormal coronary arteries, decreased left ventricular function, mitral regurgitation, and pericardial effusion. Abnormalities in the coronary arteries were seen in less than 20% of MIS-C patients. These abnormalities include dilatation or aneurysms in the coronary arteries;however, giant or large aneurysms are rare. On the other hand, transient coronary artery dilatation (which can occur secondary to viral myocarditis) may also mean that the coronary artery Z-scores never exceed 2.5. Reviewing large case series revealed that approximately 30 - 40% of MIS-C patients had decreased left ventricular function. In most cases, left ventricular function is mildly depressed, and severe left ventricular dysfunction was observed in only one-fifth of cases. Hypoxia, myocardial ischemia secondary to coronary involvement, stress-induced cardiomyopathy, injury caused by systemic inflammation, and viral myocarditis are the possible etiologies for the myocardial injury in MIS-C. It is now clear that myocardial strain imaging indices such as a global longitudinal strain (GLS), end-diastolic strain rate (EDSR), and peak left atrial strain (LAS) can demonstrate systolic or diastolic dysfunction in myocarditis patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. Furthermore, right-sided ventricular deformation imaging abnormalities have been reported in adult patients with MIS-C. Less information is currently available on mitral regurgitation and pericardial effusion in pediatric patients with MIS-C;however, in an extensive study on 286 pediatric patients with MIS-C, 28% had pericardial effusion, and 42.7% had mitral regurgitation;both were mild in most patients.","Tahouri, T.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Echocardiographic+Evaluation+of+Multisystem+Inflammatory+Syndrome+in+Children+(MIS-C)+Associated+with+COVID-19","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Comprehensive Pediatrics; 13(Supplement 1):19-20, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39783,""
"What is the role of primary care in COVID-19 programs focused on people experiencing homelessness?","Background: The pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on people who are living in socially disadvantaged situations. People experiencing homelessness are less able to isolate and follow public health messaging to reduce the risk of infection. In addition, due to the higher prevalence of chronic disease, they have a poorer prognosis with infection with higher rates of mortality and hospitalisation. In the early pandemic, many countries implemented programs that were exclusively focused on the care of people experiencing homelessness. Aim/Objectives: Our aim was to describe programs that have been implemented to reduce COVID-19 transmission and severity of illness in homeless populations and to understand the involvement of primary care. Method(s): We performed a rapid review of the international literature documenting COVID-19 related programs for people experiencing homelessness. We searched PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL plus Google using search term combinations of homeless persons and COVID-19. All articles were screened by two independent reviewers and one person extracted the items of interest. Finding(s): After screening 615 studies we included 42 studies and most were from the USA (n = 26). Programs commonly focused on isolation centres for people experiencing homelessness who tested positive for COVID-19 (n = 15). Sixteen studies included an evaluation of program effectiveness and two investigated the perspective of program participants. Universal screening was more effective than symptomatic screening in reducing COVID-19 transmission in homeless shelter settings. Comprehensive healthcare, including mental health and addiction support, was essential for people to be able to tolerate isolation, but care continuity post-isolation was problematic with limited primary care involvement. Implications: Few COVID-19 programs for people experiencing homelessness involve the primary care sector. As continuity of care post-program was a common problem, primary care may have a role in cross-sector collaboration.","Sturgiss, E.; Ball, L.; G, M.

"A Case-Crossover Phenome-wide Association Study (PheWAS) for Understanding Post-COVID-19 Diagnosis Patterns","Post COVID-19 condition (PCC) is known to affect a large proportion of COVID-19 survivors. Robust study design and methods are needed to understand post-COVID-19 diagnosis patterns in all survivors, not just those clinically diagnosed with PCC. We applied a case-crossover Phenome-Wide Association Study (PheWAS) in a retrospective cohort of COVID-19 survivors, comparing the occurrences of 1,671 diagnosis-based phenotype codes (PheCodes) pre- and post-COVID-19 infection periods in the same individual using a conditional logistic regression. We studied how this pattern varied by COVID-19 severity and vaccination status, and we compared to test negative and test negative but flu positive controls. In 44,198 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, we foundenrichment in respiratory,circulatory, and mental health disorders post-COVID-19-infection. Top hits included anxiety disorder (p=2.8e-109, OR=1.7 [95%CI: 1.6-1.8]), cardiac dysrhythmias (p=4.9e-87, OR=1.7 [95%CI: 1.6-1.8]), and respiratory failure, insufficiency, arrest (p=5.2e-75, OR=2.9 [95%CI: 2.6-3.3]). In severe patients, we found stronger associations with respiratory and circulatory disorders compared to mild/moderate patients. Fully vaccinated patients had mental health and chronic circulatory diseases rise to the top of the association list, similar to the mild/moderate cohort. Both control groups (test negative, test negative and flu positive) showed a different pattern of hits to SARS-CoV-2 positives. Patients experience myriad symptoms more than 28 days after SARS-CoV-2 infection, but especially respiratory, circulatory, and mental health disorders. Our case-crossover PheWAS approach controls for within-person confounders that are time-invariant. Comparison to test negatives and test negative but flu positive patients with a similar design helped identify enrichment specific to COVID-19. This design may be applied other emerging diseases with long-lasting effects other than a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given the potential for bias from observational data, these results should be considered exploratory. As we look into the future, we must be aware of COVID-19 survivors' healthcare needs.","Haupert, Shi, Chen, Fritsche, Mukherjee","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2022.104237","20221025","Case-crossover; Electronic Health Records; Flu positive control; Healthcare utilization; Multiple testing; Phenome-wide association study; Post-COVID-19; Test-negative controls; Vaccination; Within-subject confounding","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39786,""
"The experience of COVID-19 among people with depression: Impact on daily life and coping strategies","The prevalence of depression symptoms among U.S. adults increased dramatically during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to understand the impact of the pandemic on people with a history of depression. In June 2020, a national sample of 5023Ã¢â‚¬Â¯U.S. adults, including 760 reporting past/current diagnoses of depression, completed survey measures related to the COVID experience, coping, anxiety, depression, and PTSD. After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, a history of depression increased the odds of negative effects of pandemic on multiple aspects of life: routines, access to mental health treatment, alcohol use, prescription painkiller use, and other drug use. Those with a history of depression also scored significantly higher on the PHQ-8, GAD-7, and PDS-5 (all psÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.0001). Greater use of adaptive coping strategies was significantly associated with lower scores, and greater use of maladaptive strategies with higher scores. Individuals reporting a history of depression reported greater use of both adaptive and maladaptive strategies. Adaptive coping strategies appear to be protective and help regulate symptomatology, suggesting that particular focus during the clinical encounter on developing tools to promote well-being, alleviate stress, and decrease perceptions of helplessness could mitigate the effects.","Sanchez, Hall, da Graca, Bennett, Powers, Warren","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.10.037","20221025","Anxiety; COVID-19; Coping strategies; Depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39787,""
"Understanding the challenges and impact of training on referral of postnatal women to a community physical activity programme by health professionals: A qualitative study using the COM-B model","To understand the value of training for health professionals for improving their ability to effectively refer postnatal women to a targeted community physical activity programme. The study also sought to understand challenges to effective referral of postnatal women from deprived areas. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in January-February 2020 with early years practitioners (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 4), health visitors (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1) and community midwives (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2) who had participated in a training workshop implemented as part of a targeted community physical activity referral programme for postnatal women from deprived areas in the North East of England. Two follow up interviews were also conducted with one midwife and one early years practitioner during the Covid-19 pandemic. Data were analysed thematically and the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, Behaviour (COM-B) model was employed to facilitate identification of the impact of training and the challenges in referral from the health professionals' perspective. The training increased capability to refer by improving knowledge and confidence of health professionals in being able to give appropriate guidance to postnatal women about physical activity without having to refer to other professionals. Health professionals reported adequate opportunities to engage with postnatal women, were motivated to refer and perceived this to be part of their role. The timing and method of message delivery were key contexts for perceived successful referral, particularly for midwives who wanted to ensure the messaging began in the antenatal period. Low staffing levels, limited interprofessional collaboration and finding strategies to engage women from deprived areas were key challenges to effective delivery of physical activity messages. These challenges were exacerbated during Covid-19, with increased mental health issues amongst postnatal women. Training health professionals for physical activity messaging can be a useful way to increase capability, opportunity, and motivation to refer to physical activity interventions for postnatal women in deprived areas to potentially increase physical wellbeing and reduce postnatal depression. The COM-B is a relevant framework to underpin training. A clearly identified referral pathway and staffing issues need to be addressed to improve referrals by health professionals.","Allin, Haighton, Dalkin, Das, Allen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.midw.2022.103516","20221025","Community health; Exercise; Health professionals; Postpartum; Referral","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39788,""
"Effects of social isolation associated with the COVID-19 pandemic on hip muscle strength, hip joint pain, and walking ability in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip joint","To reduce the spread of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, governments in many countries adopted a social isolation strategy. However, social isolation may adversely affect people's health, e.g., by decreasing the muscle function of lower limbs. We recruited 118 patients who had undergone total hip arthroplasty (THA) and 87 patients with moderate to severe hip joint osteoarthritis (OA) and measured hip muscle strength, hip joint pain, and walking ability from before to one year after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, hip flexion (straight leg raise, SLR) strength decreased in 13.1% of patients in the post-THA group and 25.6% in the severe-OA group; in the severe-OA group, the decrease in SLR strength was mainly in patients aged 65 years and older. In addition, pain increased to mild or moderate and walkable distance decreased in more patients in the severe-OA group.","Maezawa, Nozawa, Sano, Maruyama, Sugimoto, Ishijima","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gerinurse.2022.10.001","20221025","COVID-19 pandemic; Osteoarthritis of the hip joint; SLR strength; Social isolation; Walkable distance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39789,""

This cross-sectional study recruited clinical healthcare workers at a regional hospital in Nantou County, Taiwan. The questionnaire collected personal characteristics, data on the impact and coping behaviors of the pandemic, and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). A total of 354 valid questionnaires were collected. The statistical methods employed were univariate and multivariate stepwise regression, and logistic regression. Perceived impact and coping behaviors were found to be moderate in degree, and traumatic stress was lower than that in other countries. However, our data identified the following subgroups that require special attention: those with young age, those living with minor children, nurses, those with self-rated poor mental health, and those with insufficient COVID-19-related training.

"Virtual Reality Applications in Medicine During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Systematic Review","Virtual reality can play an important role during the COVID-19 pandemic in the health care sector. This technology has the potential to supplement the traditional in-hospital medical training and treatment, and may increase access to training and therapies in various health care settings. This systematic review aimed to describe the literature on health care-targeted virtual reality applications during the COVID-19 crisis. We conducted a systematic search of the literature on the PsycINFO, Web of Science, and MEDLINE databases, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. The search string was as follows: ""[(virtual reality)] AND [(COVID-19) OR (coronavirus) OR (SARS-CoV-2) OR (healthcare)]."" Papers published in English after December 2019 in peer-reviewed journals were selected and subjected to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. We used the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool to assess the quality of studies and the risk of bias. Thirty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Seventeen studies showed the usefulness of virtual reality during the COVID-19 crisis for reducing stress, anxiety, depression, and pain, and promoting physical activity. Twenty-two studies revealed that virtual reality was a helpful learning and training tool during the COVID-19 crisis in several areas, including emergency medicine, nursing, and pediatrics. This technology was also used as an educational tool for increasing public understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic. Different levels of immersion (ie, immersive and desktop virtual reality), types of head-mounted displays (ie, PC-based, mobile, and standalone), and content (ie, 360Ã‚Â° videos and photos, virtual environments, virtual reality video games, and embodied virtual agents) have been successfully used. Virtual reality was helpful in both face-to-face and remote trials. Virtual reality has been applied frequently in medicine during the COVID-19 pandemic, with positive effects for treating several health conditions and for medical education and training. Some barriers need to be overcome for the broader adoption of virtual reality in the health care panorama.

"The psychophysical impact of COVID-19 lockdown on pediatric patients with rheumatological disease","COVID-19 was declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020 and unprecedented containment measures were taken to limit its spreading. These exceptional measures may have an impact on the mental health of the population. We hypothesize that children with the rheumatological chronic disease might be a population at higher risk of psychological distress. This study evaluated the psychological effect of social distancing in pediatric rheumatological patients and its possible correlation with disease relapse. Pediatric patients diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) were included in the study. They completed the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC-2) to assess anxious symptoms, the Children Depression Inventory Self Report (CDI-2 SR) for depression symptoms and a semi-structured questionnaire to collect their activities. Their parents completed the Children Depression Inventory 2 Parent (CDI-2 P). The MASC-2 test showed high values in anxiety factors. The CDI-2 SR test showed high values for Ineffectiveness and Functional Problems. The CDI-2 P showed high values for Emotional Problems factor. All the patients with high level of depression were females. The result is that those who take therapy were younger, have reduced values in Functional Problems and in Social Anxiety. 47% of the sample had disease relapse. During the COVID-19 period of isolation, in patients with JIA, there was an increase in anxious and depressive symptoms in female adolescents, a tendency to disease relapse, despite generally good compliance to therapy. Those under treatment were younger and showed reduced values in Functional Problems, Social Anxiety, and Humiliation/Rejection.

"COVID-19 and Unmet Medical Needs for People With Chronic Diseases: A Cross-Sectional Study","Gaps between medical needs and health services accessibility are defined as unmet medical needs (UMN). Previous studies assessing UMNs during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic did not account for factors such as the type of medical insurance or chronic disease. Therefore, this study investigated various factors, including medical insurance and chronic diseases, affecting self-reported UMN during the pandemic in Daejeon Metropolitan City, South Korea. This cross-sectional study was conducted using Daejeon Metropolitan City Health Surveys data from 2020. The weighted prevalence of UMN was estimated among participants (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1494) aged Ã¢â€°Â¥18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years, while chi-squared and logistic models were used to assess the association between UMN and participant characteristics. The prevalence of UMN was 6.4% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°97). Female sex and low education levels were significantly associated with reporting UMN. Medical aid beneficiaries were less likely to report UMN than adults with National Health Programs coverage. Participants with chronic diseases, such as hypertension and arthritis, and those with depression, were more likely to report UMN than adults without these conditions. The findings highlight the need for targeted efforts to decrease UMN in the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for women and individuals with low education levels. The results also indicate that high-risk disease groups should be targeted with additional enabling services to support the management of chronic conditions.","Jung, Che, Park","https://doi.org/10.1177/00469580221133002","20221025","COVID-19; chronic disease; delivery of health care; health policy; health services","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39795,""
"Long-term COVID symptoms, work ability and fitness to work in healthcare workers hospitalized for Sars-CoV-2 infection","COVID-19 can affect the persistence of symptoms and work ability (WA), hence the fitness to work of healthcare workers (HCW). We describe the effects of COVID-19 in hospitalized HCWs of a large Hospital in Lombardy and their implications on WA and fitness to work. Fifty-six HCWs of Fatebenefratelli-Sacco Hospital have been hospitalized for COVID-19 since March 2020. Clinical and fitness-to-work data were acquired from Occupational Health Surveillance Program. A structured questionnaire was administered to 53/56 HCWs 18 months after infection to investigate Long-COVID symptoms and WA. Symptoms most reported at recovery (rhino-pharyngeal swab-NPS-negative) were exertional dyspnea (86.8%), asthenia (86.8%), arthro-myalgia (71.7%), sleep disorders (64.2%), resting dyspnea (62.3%), cough (56.6%). 69.6% underwent evaluation at out-patient clinics experienced in Long-COVID. Ten months after recovery, symptoms related to physical well-being decreased while memory and anxiety/depression were more persistent. At recovery, the WA score decreased from 10 to 8, and then an improvement from 8 to 9 was noted during the survey. At the return-to-work examination, fit-to-work judgements with restrictions increased from 31.4% to 58.7%; then, a slight decrease in the rate of judgements with restrictions was observed at the survey's time. Post-COVID-19 symptoms can persist for a long time and could impact WA and fitness-to-work of HCW. Adequate health surveillance protocols should guarantee the health protection of HCW with persistent disorders after COVID-19.","Mendola, Leoni, Cozzi, Manzari, Tonelli, Metruccio, Tosti, Battini, Cucchi, Costa, Carrer","https://doi.org/10.23749/mdl.v113i5.13377","20221026","Humans; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Work Capacity Evaluation; Health Personnel; Dyspnea","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39796,""

"Impact of ""Long Covid"" on Children: Global and Hong Kong perspectives","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic spares no nation or city, and the virus is responsible for the escalating incidence and mortality all around the world.

The search was restricted to children and adolescent aged &lt; 18 years, and English literature. Many large-scale studies have provided strong scientific evidence as to the detrimental and irreversible sequelae of COVID-19 on the health, psychology, and development of affected children. Many insights to the management of this disease can be obtained from comparing the management of influenza disease. COVID-19 is generally a mild respiratory disease in children. Several syndromes such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and COVID toe are coined but are probably not specific to SARS-CoV-2. ""Long COVID"" or the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, or the prolonged isolation and containment strategies on education and psychosocial influences on children associated with the pandemic, are significant. Healthcare providers must be aware of the potential effects of quarantine on children's mental health. More importantly, health care provides must appreciate the importance of the decisions and actions made by governments, non-governmental organizations, the community, schools, and parents in reducing the possible effects of this situation. Multifaceted age-specific and developmentally appropriate strategies must be adopted by health care authorities to lessen the negative impact of quarantine on the psychological wellbeing of children.","Hon, Leung, Leung, Wong","https://doi.org/10.2174/1573396319666221021154949","20221025","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; coronavirus; long COVID; psychosocial; school","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39798,""
"Factors associated with loss of motivation and hesitation to work amongst frontline health care providers during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional survey from a developing country","The COVID-19 took over the world in 2020 and a lockdown has been imposed seeing its fast spread. Frontline health care workers (HCWs) were reported frequently with a lack of motivation, hesitancy and unwillingness to perform their duties during this pandemic. This cross-sectional survey aims to evaluate the factors associated with lack of motivation and increased hesitancy among the frontline HCWs to perform their duties during COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 239 HCWs were included in this web-based cross-sectional study, who have worked during the COVID-19 pandemic. The anonymous online questionnaire was sent to all faculty, trainees and staff of Aga Khan University Hospital in Karachi, Pakistan. The survey was conducted from September 2020 to January 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic. All data was exported into Statistical Package for Social Sciences Version 19 for multivariate analysis. The risk of getting infected was strongly reported by 180 participants, and it was associated with higher hesitation to work (aORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯6.09 [2.55-14.59]). Fifty-one participants felt that lack of knowledge about prevention and protection was associated with lower motivation to work (aORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.66 [0.35-1.25]). Participants reported higher hesitation due to the burden of changed quality of work, physical exhaustion, mental exhaustion and altered sleep patterns. Sense of feeling protected by their hospitals was a motivating factor, and participants receiving adequate support reported higher motivation to work (aORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯2.60 [1.32-5.14]). Fear of infection, increased working hours, and inadequate support of the workplace played a key role in escalating the hesitancy among HCWs to perform their duties.

"COVID-19-Related Self-Stigma, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Insomnia, and Smartphone Addiction Among Frontline Government Workers with COVID-19 Pandemic Control Duties","The duties related to COVID-19 control and prevention may have caused psychological stress for the individuals in charge (eg, frontline government workers) and have reportedly led to mental health issues, such as insomnia and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, the prevalence of these COVID-19-related disorders and their associated factors remain unclear. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the prevalence rates of insomnia, PTSD, COVID-19-related self-stigma, and smartphone addiction, along with the identification of risk factors and protective factors for Taiwan frontline government workers with COVID-19 pandemic control duties. The survey was carried out with 151 participants between September and October 2021. All participants completed the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (assessing fear of COVID-19), Self-Stigma Scale (assessing self-stigma during the COVID-19 pandemic), Smartphone Application-Based Addiction Scale (assessing the risk of smartphone addiction), Insomnia Severity Index (assessing insomnia), Impacts of Event Scale-6 (assessing PTSD), and a self-designed set of questions assessing trait resilience. The results showed that the prevalence rate was 31.1% for insomnia and 33.8% for PTSD. Furthermore, service duration (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.86, 0.999) and trait resilience (AOR = 0.19; 95% CI = 0.08, 0.46) were protective factors and fear of COVID-19 (AOR = 1.91; 95% CI = 1.02, 3.57) was a risk factor for insomnia.

"Academic self-efficacy, self-esteem, satisfaction with studies, and virtual media use as depression and emotional exhaustion predictors among college students during COVID-19","The aim of the study was to explore the relationship between depression, emotional exhaustion, self-esteem, satisfaction with studies, academic self-efficacy, and the use of virtual media in Peruvian university students during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A total of 569 college students (61.9% female), with a mean age of 21.73 years (standard deviation = 4.95), responded to the following questionnaires: Academic Self-Efficacy Scale, Single Item Self-Esteem Scale, Brief Scale of Satisfaction with Studies, Scale of Use of Virtual Media, Patient Health Questionnarie-2, and Single Item of Academic Emotional Exhaustion. Correlation statistics, regression models, and structural equation modeling (SEM) were used for data analysis. The results demonstrated a direct and significant correlation between virtual media use, academic self-efficacy, self-esteem, depression, and emotional exhaustion (<i>p</i> &lt;.01). In addition, satisfaction with studies (ÃŽÂ² = -0.13), academic self-efficacy (ÃŽÂ² = -0.19), self-esteem (ÃŽÂ² = -0.14), and emotional exhaustion (ÃŽÂ² = 0.19) predicted depression significantly, whereas virtual media use (ÃŽÂ² = 0.17), study satisfaction (ÃŽÂ² = 0.09), and depression (ÃŽÂ² = 0.20) predicted emotional exhaustion associated with academics. The SEM model indicated that self-esteem, satisfaction with studies, and academic self-efficacy negatively predict depression, whereas academic self-efficacy positively predicts virtual media use. Finally, both virtual media use and depression positively predict emotional exhaustion. This model presents optimal goodness-of-fit indices (X<sup>2</sup> = 8.926, df = 6, <i>p</i> =.178; comparative fit =.991, Tucker-Lewis =.979, root mean square error of approximation =.029 [confidence interval 90% =.000-.067], standardized root mean square residual =.022).

"The social and mental impact on healthcare workers: A comparative and cross-sectional study during two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a heavily burden on healthcare workers (HCWs) worldwide. The aim of this study was to compare differences in psychological and social impact between two waves of the pandemic among first- and second-line HCWs in Taiwan. The current study derived data from two cross-sectional surveys conducted in 2020 and 2021. Levels of depression, sleep disturbance, psychological distress, social impact, and demographic variables were collected through self-reported questionnaires. The independent t test was used to compare differences in scores between the first and second wave of the pandemic. Differences between first- and second-line HCWs were also analyzed. A total of 711 HCWs in the first wave and 560 HCWs in the second wave were recruited. For the first- and second-line HCWs, the social impact during the second wave was higher than during the first wave, and they expressed a higher intention to maintain social distancing and were more aware of the pandemic overseas in the second wave. The first-line HCWs had a trend of worse sleep quality during the second wave. In addition, sleep quality was worse in the first-line HCWs than in the second-line HCWs during both waves. The second-line HCWs expressed a greater desire to seek COVID-19-related information than the first-line HCWs during the first wave, and more intended to maintain social distancing during the second wave. Our results show the importance of evaluating the social and mental health burden of HCWs, and especially first-line workers.","Li, Wu, Chou, Hsu, Huang, Hsieh, Lin, Wu","https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000031316","20221026","Humans; Pandemics; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Taiwan; Health Personnel","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39803,""
"Long-COVID post-viral chronic fatigue and affective symptoms are associated with oxidative damage, lowered antioxidant defenses and inflammation: a proof of concept and mechanism study","The immune-inflammatory response during the acute phase of COVID-19, as assessed using peak body temperature (PBT) and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), predicts the severity of chronic fatigue, depression and anxiety symptoms 3-4 months later. The present study was performed to examine the effects of SpO2 and PBT during acute infection on immune, oxidative and nitrosative stress (IO&amp;NS) pathways and neuropsychiatric symptoms of Long COVID. This study assayed SpO2 and PBT during acute COVID-19, and C-reactive protein (CRP), malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyls (PCs), myeloperoxidase (MPO), nitric oxide (NO), zinc, and glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) in 120 Long COVID individuals and 36 controls. Cluster analysis showed that 31.7% of the Long COVID patients had severe abnormalities in SpO2, body temperature, increased oxidative toxicity (OSTOX) and lowered antioxidant defenses (ANTIOX), and increased total Hamilton Depression (HAMD) and Anxiety (HAMA) and Fibromylagia-Fatigue (FF) scores. Around 60% of the variance in the neuropsychiatric symptoms of Long COVID (a factor extracted from HAMD, HAMA and FF scores) was explained by OSTOX/ANTIOX ratio, PBT and SpO2. Increased PBT predicted increased CRP and lowered ANTIOX and zinc levels, while lowered SpO2 predicted lowered Gpx and increased NO production. Lowered SpO2 strongly predicts OSTOX/ANTIOX during Long COVID. In conclusion, the impact of acute COVID-19 on the symptoms of Long COVID is partly mediated by OSTOX/ANTIOX, especially lowered Gpx and zinc, increased MPO and NO production and lipid peroxidation-associated aldehyde formation. The results suggest that post-viral somatic and mental symptoms have a neuroimmune and neuro-oxidative origin.","Al-Hakeim, Al-Rubaye, Al-Hadrawi, Almulla, Maes","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-022-01836-9","20221025","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39804,""
"Feelings of loneliness, COVID-19-specific-health anxiety and depressive symptoms during the first COVID-19 wave in Swiss persons with multiple sclerosis","The aim of our study was to investigate whether self-reported feeling of loneliness (FoL) and COVID-19-specific health anxiety were associated with the presence of depressive symptoms during the first coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) wave. Questionnaires of 603 persons of the Swiss Multiple Sclerosis Registry (SMSR) were cross-sectionally analyzed using descriptive and multivariable regression methods. The survey response rate was 63.9%. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory-Fast Screen (BDI-FS). COVID-19-specific health anxiety and FoL were measured using two 5-item Likert scaled pertinent questions. High scoring FoL (2.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) (2.06-2.98)) and/or COVID-19 specific health anxiety (1.36, 95% CI (0.87-1.85)) were significantly associated with depressive symptoms. Further stratification analysis showed that the impact of FoL on depressive symptoms affected all age groups. However, it was more pronounced in younger PwMS, whereas an impact of COVID-19 specific health anxiety on depressive symptoms was particularly observed in middle-aged PwMS. FoL and COVID-19-specific health anxiety were age-dependently associated with depressive symptoms during the first COVID-19 wave in Switzerland. Our findings could guide physicians, health authorities, and self-help groups to better accompany PwMS in times of public health crises.","Hoepner, Rodgers, Stegmayer, Steinemann, Haag, Calabrese, Manjaly, Salmen, Kesselring, Zecca, Gobbi, Puhan, Walther, von Wyl","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-22445-0","20221026","Middle Aged; Humans; COVID-19; Loneliness; Depression; Multiple Sclerosis; Switzerland; Anxiety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39805,""
"How the 2020 US Presidential election impacted sleep and its relationship to public mood and alcohol consumption","Major sociopolitical events can influence the general public's affective state and other affect-related processes, such as sleep. Here, we investigated the extent that the 2020 US presidential election impacted sleep, public mood, and alcohol consumption. We also explored the relationship between affect and sleep changes during the peak period of election stress. US-residing (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 437) and non-US-residing (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 106) participants were recruited online for participation in the study. A non-representative, convenience sample responded to daily assessments of their affect, sleep, and alcohol consumption during a baseline period (October 1-13, 2020) and in the days surrounding the 2020 US Election (October 30-November 12, 2020). Analyses determined changes within and between US and non-US participants. Election Day evoked significantly reduced sleep amount and efficiency, coupled with heightened stress, negative affect, and increased alcohol use. While US participants were significantly more impacted in a number of domains, non-US participants also reported reduced sleep and greater stress compared to baseline. Across participants, disrupted sleep on Election Night correlated with changes in emotional well-being and alcohol consumption on Election Day. These results suggest that major sociopolitical events can have global impacts on sleep that may interact with significant fluctuations in public mood and well-being. Further, while the largest impact is on the local population, these results suggest that the effects can extend beyond borders. These findings highlight the potential impact of future sociopolitical events on public well-being.","Cunningham, Fields, Denis, Bottary, Stickgold, Kensinger","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleh.2022.08.009","20221024","Affect; Alcohol consumption; COVID-19; Depression; Public mood; Sleep; Stress; US election","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39806,""
"Associations Between Certainty of Covid Infection Status and Reporting of Long Covid Symptoms: Examining the Role of Nocebo","Objectives Some COVID-19 patients develop symptoms after the acute infection, known as â€˜Long COVIDâ€™. We aimed to examine whether belief in COVID-19 infection status acts as a nocebo, causing attribution of possible symptoms to Long COVID. Design Data from questionnaires distributed to the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children cohort. Methods We examined associations between belief in COVID-19 infection status (confirmed by a positive test versus unconfirmed) and reporting of Long COVID symptoms. We explored sex and anxiety as potential modifiers. Results There was no clear evidence of a strong association between belief in COVID-19 infection status and the Long COVID composite score (unstandardised coefficient [B] 0.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.26 to 2.46, p = .935), physical symptoms (4-12 weeks: B -0.65, 95% CI -1.49 to 0.19, p = .128; 12-20 weeks: B -0.01, 95% CI -1.02 to 1.01, p = .998), psychological symptoms (depression: B -0.30, 95% CI -1.39 to 0.78, p = .583; anxiety: B -0.33, 95% CI -1.28 to 0.62, p = .500; wellbeing: B 1.43, 95% CI 1.43, 95% -0.59 to 3.44, p = .165), or duration of symptoms (ongoing COVID-19: odds ratio [OR] 0.78, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.06, p = .116; post-COVID-19 syndrome: OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.05, p = .085). There was no clear evidence of moderation by sex or anxiety. Conclusions Confirmation of diagnosis of COVID-19 by positive test was not associated with increased reporting of Long COVID symptoms; therefore, we found no evidence of a nocebo effect.","Catherine Macleod-Hall et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01B4-6CB-C7B","20221025","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Illness; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; alspac; coronavirus; long covid; nocebo","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","",39807,""
