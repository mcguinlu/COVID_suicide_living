"Mental Health Utilization in Children in the time of COVID-19","Background: In early 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a public health emergency and a combination of lockdown and social distancing measures were put in place across the globe. Many children, adolescents and adults have experienced adverse mental health effects related to the pandemic and its impact on daily life, although the long-term impact on individuals and health systems is not well understood. Methods: This cross-sectional study was based on data from 2018-2021 collected via medical records from our hospital. Admissions were transformed into time-series data, and models were generated to analyze changes in admission rates for mental health emergencies in 2020 and 2021 compared to previous years. Results: Of 1906 inpatient encounters among 1543 unique patients seen by the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Consultation-Liaison service, there was a decrease in overall admissions beginning in March 2020, coinciding with statewide lock down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2020, admissions were reduced 36% compared to average admissions from 2018-2019. By 2021, overall admissions were significantly higher than for the previous three years. Similarly, the count of suicide attempts was significantly higher in 2021 compared to previous years. The rate of patients admitted to inpatient facilities upon discharge was significantly higher during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Conclusion: Admissions for mental health emergencies fluctuated during the period associated with the COVID-19 pandemic across an array of diagnoses. Increases in admissions and severity of mental health emergencies during COVID-19 may reflect a detrimental impact of the pandemic on the mental health of children, as well as unmet needs during this time.","Leah Coates; Rebecca Marshall; Kyle Johnson; Byron Alexander Foster","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.11.21261712","20210813","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-14","",17081,""
"What has changed in the experiences of people with mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic? Findings from follow-up interviews using a coproduced, participatory qualitative approach","Purpose: We sought to understand how the experiences of people in the UK with pre-existing mental health conditions had developed during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: In September-October 2020 we interviewed adults with mental health conditions pre-dating the pandemic whom we had previously interviewed three months earlier. Participants had been recruited through online advertising and voluntary sector community organisations. Interviews were conducted by telephone or video-conference by researchers with lived experience of mental health difficulties and explored changes over time in experiences of participants of the pandemic. Results: We interviewed 44 people, achieving diversity of demographic characteristics and a range of mental health conditions and service use among our sample. Three overarching themes were derived from interviews. The first theme Spectrum of adaptation: to difficulties in access to, or the quality of, statutory mental health services, through developing new personal coping strategies or identifying alternative sources of support. The second theme is Accumulating pressures: from pandemic-related anxieties and sustained disruption to social contact and support, and to mental health treatment. The third theme Feeling overlooked: A sense of people with pre-existing mental health conditions being overlooked during the pandemic by policy-makers at all levels. The latter was compounded for people from ethnic minority communities or with physical health problems. Conclusion: Our study highlights the need to support marginalised groups who are at risk of increased inequalities, and to maintain crucial mental and physical healthcare and social care for people with existing mental health conditions, notwithstanding challenges of the pandemic.","Prisha Shah; Jackie Hardy; Mary Birken; Una Foye; Rachel Rowan Olive; Patrick Nyikavaranda; Ceri Dare; Theodora Stefanidou; Merle Schlief; Eiluned Pearce; Natasha Lyons; Karen Machin; Tamar Jeynes; Beverley Chipp; Anjie Chhapia; Nick Barber; Steven Gillard; Alexandra Pitman; Alan Simpson; Sonia Johnson; Brynmor Lloyd-Evans","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.12.21261913","20210813","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-14","",17082,""
"Development and use analysis of 'gestioemocionalcat', a web app for promoting emotional self-care and access to professional mental health resources during the covid-19 pandemic","Background: Quarantines and nationwide lockdowns dictated for containing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to distress and increase the frequency of anxiety and depression symptoms among the general population. During the national lockdown of the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain, we developed and launched a Web App (Gestioemocional.cat) to promote emotional self-care in the general population and facilitate contact with healthcare professionals. Methods: Gestioemocional.cat targeted all individuals aged 18 years or more and was designed by adapting the contents of a mobile App for adjuvant treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (i.e., the PTSD Coach App) to the general population and the pandemic/lockdown scenario. We retrospectively assessed the utilization pattern of the Web App using data systematically retrieved from Google Analytics. Data were grouped into three time periods, defined using a join point analysis of COVID-19 incidence in our area: first wave, between-wave period, and second wave. Results: The resulting Web App, maintains the navigation structure of the PTSD Coach App, with three main modules: tools for emotional self-care, a self-assessment test, and professional resources for on-demand contact. The self-assessment test combines the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and offers professional contact in the advent of a high level of depression and anxiety; contact is prioritized according to a screening questionnaire administered at the time of obtaining individual consent to be contacted. The tools for emotional self-care can be accessed either on-demand or symptom-driven. The utilization analysis showed a high number of weekly accesses during the first wave. In this period, press releases regarding critical events of the pandemic progression and government decisions on containment measures were followed by a utilization peak, irrespective of the sense (i.e., positive or negative) of the information. Positive information pieces (e.g., relaxation of containment measures due to a reduction of COVID-19 cases) resulted in a sharp increase in utilization immediately after information release, followed by a successive decline in utilization. The second wave was characterized by a lower and less responsive utilization of the Web App. Conclusions: mHealth tools may help the general population coping with stressful conditions associated with the pandemic scenario. Future studies shall investigate the effectiveness of these tools among the general population[-]including individuals without diagnosed mental illnesses[-]and strategies to reach as many people as possible.","Sara Guila Fidel-Kinori; Gerard Carot-Sans; AndrÃ©s Cuartero-Barbanoj; DamiÃ  Valero; Jordi Piera-JimÃ©nez; Rosa RomÃ -MonfÃ ; Elisabet Garcia-Ribatallada; Pol PÃ©rez-Sust; Jordi Blanch-Andreu; Josep Antoni Ramos-Quiroga","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.11.21261793","20210813","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-14","",17083,""
"The influence of repeated mild lockdown on mental and physical health during the COVID-19 pandemic: a large-scale longitudinal study in Japan","The mental and physical effects of repeated lockdowns are unknown. We conducted a longitudinal study of the influence of repeated mild lockdowns during two emergency declarations in Japan, in May 2020 and February 2021. The analyses included 7,893 people who participated in all online surveys. During repeated mild lockdowns, mental and physical symptoms decreased overall, while loneliness increased and social networks decreased. Subgroup analyses revealed that depression and suicidal ideation did not decrease only in the younger age group (aged 18-29) and that younger and middle-aged people (aged 18-49), women, people with a history of treatment for mental illness, and people who were socially disadvantaged in terms of income had higher levels of mental and physical symptoms at all survey times. Additionally, comprehensive extraction of the interaction structure between depression, demographic attributes, and psychosocial variables indicated that loneliness and social networks were most closely associated with depression. These results indicate that repeated lockdowns have cumulative negative effects on interpersonal interaction and loneliness and that susceptible populations, such as young people and those with high levels of loneliness, require special consideration during repetitive lockdown situations.","Tetsuya Yamamoto; Chigusa Uchiumi; Naho Suzuki; Nagisa Sugaya; Eric Murillo-Rodriguez; S_rgio Machado; Claudio Imperatori; Henning Budde","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.10.21261878","20210813","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-14","",17084,""
"Factors influencing wellbeing in young people during COVID-19","COVID-19 infection and the resultant restrictions has impacted all aspects of life across the world. This study explores factors that promote or support wellbeing for young people during the pandemic, how they differ by age, using a self-reported online survey with those aged 8 - 25 in Wales between September 2020 and February 2021. Open-ended responses were analysed via thematic analysis to provide further context. A total of 6,291 responses were obtained from 81 education settings across Wales (including primary and secondary schools as well as sixth form, colleges and universities). Wellbeing was highest in primary school children and boys and lowest in those who were at secondary school children, who were girls and, those who preferred not to give a gender. Among primary school children, higher wellbeing was seen for those who played with others (rather than alone), were of Asian ethnicity (OR 2.3, 95% CI: 1.26 to 4.3), lived in a safe area (OR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.67 to 2.5) and had more sleep. To support their wellbeing young people reported they would like to be able to play with their friends more. Among secondary school children those who were of mixed ethnicity reported lower wellbeing (OR: 5.10, 95% CI: 1.70 to 15.80). To support their wellbeing they reported they would like more support with mental health (due to anxiety and pressure to achieve when learning online). This study found self-reported wellbeing differed by gender, ethnicity and deprivation and found younger children report the need for play and to see friends to support wellbeing but older children/young people wanted more support with anxiety and educational pressures.","Michaela James; Hope Jones; Amana Baig; Emily Marchant; Tegan Waites; Charlotte Todd; Karen Hughes; Sinead Brophy","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.13.21261959","20210813","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-14","",17085,""
"How did people cope during the COVID-19 pandemic? A Structural Topic Modelling Analysis of Free-Text Data from 11,000 UK Adults","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has had substantial impacts on lives across the globe. Job losses have been widespread, and individuals have experienced significant restrictions on their usual activities, including extended isolation from family and friends. While studies suggest population mental health worsened from before the pandemic, not all individuals appear to have experienced poorer mental health. This raises the question of how people managed to cope during the pandemic. Methods: To understand the coping strategies individuals employed during the COVID-19 pandemic, we used structural topic modelling, a text mining technique, to extract themes from free-text data on coping from over 11,000 UK adults, collected between 14 October and 26 November 2020. Results: We identified 16 topics. The most discussed coping strategy was 'thinking positively' and involved themes of gratefulness and positivity. Other strategies included engaging in activities and hobbies (such as doing DIY, exercising, walking and spending time in nature), keeping routines, and focusing on one day at a time. Some participants reported more avoidant coping strategies, such as drinking alcohol and binge eating. Coping strategies varied by respondent characteristics including age, personality traits and sociodemographic characteristics and some coping strategies, such as engaging in creative activities, were associated with more positive lockdown experiences. Conclusion: A variety of coping strategies were employed by individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. The coping strategy an individual adopted was related to their overall lockdown experiences. This may be useful for helping individuals prepare for future lockdowns or other events resulting in self-isolation.","Liam Wright; Meg E Fluharty; Andrew Steptoe; Daisy Fancourt","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.13.21262002","20210813","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-14","",17086,""
"Healthcare presentations with self-harm and the association with COVID-19: an e-cohort whole-population-based study using individual-level linked routine electronic health records in Wales, UK, 2016 - March 2021","Background Multi-setting population-based studies on healthcare service presentations with self-harm covering the first 12 months of the COVID-19 pandemic are yet to be published. Aims Ascertain changes across settings in healthcare service presentations with self-harm during Waves 1 and 2 of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method E-cohort study using individual-level linked routine healthcare data from Wales, UK, 2016-March 2021. We measured weekly proportion of self-harm contacts and people who self-harmed in contact with general practice (GP), emergency department (ED) and hospital admissions. We modelled weekly trends using linear regression and generalised estimated equations, quantifying time differences using difference-in-difference (DiD). Results We included 3,552,210 Welsh residents aged [&ge;]10 years. Counts of self-harm presentations across settings was at a minimum at the start of stay-at-home restrictions during both waves and recovered compared to previous years in 3-5 months. Those who self-harmed in April 2020 were more likely to be seen in GP compared to other settings and previous years - mean rate of OR=1.2, although actual numbers fell. The proportion of self-harm ED contacts admitted to hospital dropped from June 2020 (1.9 [1.5-2.3] pp/month). Self-harm and COVID-19 infection had a bidirectional effect - self-harm history had OR=1.4 [1.2-1.6] and incidence had DiD=1.1 [0.8-1.4]. Conclusions Those that self-harmed and sought help during the COVID-19 pandemic potentially encountered stringent criteria for hospitalisation, particularly in Wave 2, while in Wave 1 they preferentially presented to GP. Reductions in contacts likely resulted in unmet healthcare needs which may later emerge placing further burden on individuals and healthcare services.","Marcos del Pozo Banos; Sze Chim Lee; Yasmin Friedmann; Ashley Akbari; Fatemeh Tobari; Keith R Lloyd; Ronan A Lyons; Ann John","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.13.21261861","20210813","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-14","",17087,""
"Children of parents with mental illness in the COVID-19pandemic: A cross-sectional survey in China","Children of parents with mental illness (COPMI) are vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study aimed to assess the psychosocial impacts of the pandemic and identify potential factors influencing their mental health. 665 COPMI from six sites including Wuhan in China were enrolled. COPMI's mental health and the impacts of COVID-19 were assessed by an online survey. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to examine the association between impact factors and participants' mental health. 16.1 % of participants were in abnormal range of mental health, with interpersonal relationship being the most common problem. 48.6 % of participants reported quite worried about the epidemic. All aspects of adverse effects of COVID-19 were more prevalent among COPMI in Wuhan than in other sites. Concerns about COVID-19 (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.7, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.02), decreased family income (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.0, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.02), being physically abused (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.1, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.04), witnessing family members being physically abused (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.0, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.03), and needs for promoting family members' mental health (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.2, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01) were independent risk factors for participants' mental health.

"Home Alone: Implications of COVID-19 for Mental Health","The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has induced a considerable degree of fear, emotional stress and anxiety among individuals around the world. The objective of this study is to evaluate the relationship between COVID-19 virus cases per 1000 residents and mental health outcomes of individuals across the globe. Using plausibly exogenous variation in daily country-level reports of new COVID-19 cases across the world, this study employs an individual-by-day global data set to assess the association between virus outbreak intensity and short-term measures of mental health outcomes. Results indicate that females are 20.02% (95Ã‚Â % CI [6.65Ã‚Â %, 33.39Ã‚Â %]) more likely than males to find life depressing, suggesting that they may bear a much larger mental health burden than males during the COVID-19 pandemic. The association between the pandemic and mental health is more pronounced among individuals staying at home for the past week, who are 14.81Ã‚Â % (95Ã‚Â % CI [3.46Ã‚Â %, 26.16Ã‚Â %]) more likely to feel anxious and 11.17Ã‚Â % (95Ã‚Â % CI [2.13Ã‚Â %, 20.21Ã‚Â %]) more likely to experience emotional instability than their counterparts. The association between virus outbreak intensity and the likelihood of anxiety among individuals staying at home increases with household size, ranging from 11.73Ã‚Â % (95Ã‚Â % CI [-4.65Ã‚Â %, 28.11Ã‚Â %]) among individuals with 0-1 members in the household to 21.02Ã‚Â % (95Ã‚Â % CI [5.73Ã‚Â %, 36.31Ã‚Â %]) among those with 4-8 members in the household.

The aim of the COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study was to identify trajectories of anxiety, depression and COVID-19-related traumatic stress (CV19TS) symptomology during the first UK national lockdown. We also sought to explore risk and protective factors. The study was a longitudinal, three-wave survey of UK adults conducted online. Analysis used growth mixture modelling and logistic regressions. Data was collected from 1958 adults. A robust 4-class model for anxiety, depression, and CV19TS symptomology distinguished participants in relation to the severity and stability of symptomology. Classes described low and stable and high and stable symptomology, and symptomology that improved or declined across the study period. Several risk and protection factors were identified as predicting membership of classes (e.g., mental health factors, sociodemographic factors and COVID-19 worries). This study reports trajectories describing a differential impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of UK adults. Some adults experienced psychological distress throughout, some were more vulnerable in the early weeks, and for others vulnerability was delayed.

"COVID-19 babies: auto-videosomnography and parent reports of infant sleep, screen time, and parent well-being in 2019 vs 2020","The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted families, yet studies on its effects on infants and their parents have thus far been sparse and based mostly on retrospective parent reporting. This study aimed to prospectively evaluate the impact of COVID-19 living conditions on infant and parent sleep, as well as infant screen exposure, parent daytime sleepiness, and parent depression levels, using multi-method assessment. Infant and parent data collected in 2020 were compared with a matched cohort collected in 2019. The total sample included 1518 US infants aged 1-18 months (MÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 8.5, SDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 4.6; 54% boys). Auto-videosomnography metrics were obtained from the 14-day period prior to survey completion (number of analyzed nights: MÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 12.11 SDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.66 in the 2019 cohort; and MÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 11.91 SDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.41 in the 2020 cohort). Parents completed online questionnaires regarding their infant's sleep and screen exposure, as well as their own sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, and depression levels. Compared to 2019, infants in 2020 slept Ã¢Ë†Â¼40Ã‚Â min more per night on average, as indicated by auto-videosomnography. Infants additionally had earlier sleep timing, and increased parent-reported sleep-onset latency and nocturnal wakefulness. Infant screen time rose by 18.3Ã‚Â min per day for older infants, but remained stable for younger infants. Parents reported lower daytime sleepiness and higher depression symptomology during 2020, whereas no change was apparent in their sleep quality ratings. Restricted living conditions during COVID-19 in the USA led to increased infant screen exposure and parental depression, but also to increased infant sleep duration and reduced parent sleepiness.

"The prevalence of insomnia among health care workers amid the COVID-19 pandemic: An umbrella review of meta-analyses","Health care workers (HCWs) during the COVID-19 pandemic experience numerous psychological problems, including stress and anxiety. These entities can affect their sleep quality and predispose them to insomnia. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of insomnia among HCWs during the COVID-19 crisis via an umbrella review. The PRISMA guideline was used to conduct this review. By searching relevant keywords in databases of Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, studies that reported the prevalence of insomnia among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic (January 2020 to the end of January 2021) and had been published in English were identified and evaluated. The random effects model was used for meta-analysis, and the I<sup>2</sup> index was used to assess heterogeneity. The Egger test was used to determine publication bias. Based on the results of the primary search, 96 studies were identified, and ultimately 10 eligible studies entered the meta-analysis phase. The results of the umbrella review of meta-analyses showed that the prevalence of insomnia among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic was 36.36% (95% CI: 33.36-39.36, I<sup>2</sup>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 59.6%, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.006). The results of this umbrella review of meta-analyses showed a relatively high prevalence of insomnia among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. As insomnia can be associated with other psychological problems, policymakers and health managers should regularly screen HCWs for psychological disorders as well as a possible tendency for suicide. Furthermore, by treating insomnia, one can reduce the incidence of these psychological disorders.","Sahebi, Abdi, Moayedi, Torres, Golitaleb","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2021.110597","20210813","COVID-19; Health care workers; Insomnia; Mental health; Sleep disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-14","",17092,""
"Global survey-based assessment of lifestyle changes during the COVID-19 pandemic","Along with the major impact on public health, the COVID-19 outbreak has caused unprecedented concerns ranging from sudden loss of employment to mental stress and anxiety. We implemented a survey-based data collection platform to characterize how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the socio-economic, physical and mental health conditions of individuals. We focused on three broad areas, namely, changes in social interaction during home confinement, economic impact and their health status. We identified a substantial increase in virtual interaction among individuals, which might be a way to alleviate the sudden unprecedented mental health burden, exacerbated by general awareness about viral infections or other manifestations associated with them. The majority of participants (85%) lived with one or more companions and unemployment issues did not affect 91% of the total survey takers, which was one of the crucial consequences of the pandemic. Nevertheless, measures such as an increased frequency of technology-aided distant social interaction, focus on physical fitness and leisure activities were adopted as coping mechanisms during this period of home isolation. Collectively, these metrics provide a succinct and informative summary of the socio-economic and health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the individuals. Findings from our study reflect that continuous surveillance of the psychological consequences for outbreaks should become routine as part of preparedness efforts worldwide. Given the limitations of analyzing the large number of variables, we have made the raw data publicly available on the OMF ME/CFS Data Center server to facilitate further analyses (https://igenomed.stanford.edu/dataset/survey-study-on-lifestyle-changes-during-covid-19-pandemic).","Agarwal, Kaushik, Sarkar, Rao, Mukherjee, Bharat, Das, Saha","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255399","20210813","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-14","",17093,""

We observed a 66.7% decrease in our surgical volume (285 Ãƒâ€” 95 patients). Patients operated in the pre-pandemic period were older (911.3 [174.8 - 5953.8] days-old) compared to the pandemic period (275 days-old; P&lt;0.05). When the case mix was compared between periods, the percentage of neonatal surgery was increased in the pandemic era (8% Ãƒâ€” 21.1%; P&lt;0.05), and the number of RACHS 1-2 surgeries decreased significantly (60.7 Ãƒâ€” 27.4%; P&lt;0.05). Preoperative LOS was increased in the pandemic period (1.2 Ãƒâ€” 7 days; P=0.001). There was no significant increment in mortality (P=0.1). Two patients tested positive for COVID-19 in the postoperative period and both died. Our program observed a sudden decrease in surgical volume and a consequent increase in surgical complexity. There was a non-significant increment in mortality.","Miana, Manuel, Caneo, Strabelli, Arita, Monteiro, Jatene, Jatene","https://doi.org/10.21470/1678-9741-2020-0657","20210813","COVID-19; Congenital Heart Disease; Coronavirus Infection; Heart Defects, Congenital; Pandemics; SARS-Cov-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-14","",17094,""
"Stress and quality of life of intensive care nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic: Self-efficacy and resilience as resources","Health care workers employed in the COVID-19 emergency are at a high risk of stress. To explore the mediating roles of self-efficacy and resilience between stress and both physical and mental quality-of-life components in intensive care nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cross-sectional survey design. The stress subscale (depression, anxiety, and stress scale in Spanish Scale, DASS-21), the summary components (physical and mental) of health-related quality of life (SF-36), the general self-efficacy scale (GSES), and the resilience scale (RS-14) were administered in 308 intensive care nurses. Serial multiple mediator models were used. There was a significant indirect effect of levels of perceived stress on both physical and mental health components through self-efficacy and resilience. Specifically, greater perception of self-efficacy was associated with a lower perception of stress and greater resilience, while higher resilience was associated with greater physical and mental health (BÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.03; SEÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.02; 95% confidence interval [CI]Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â [-0.07, -0.01]; BÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.03, SEÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.01, 95% CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â [-0.07, -0.01], respectively). It was observed that self-efficacy alone also mediates the relationship of the perception of stress on the components of physical and mental health (BÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.07; SEÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.05; 95% CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â [-0.18, -0.03]; BÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.09; SEÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.04; 95% CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â [-0.17, -0.24], respectively). However, resilience alone was not a significant mediator of these associations. It can be concluded that stress is linked to the physical and mental health components related to quality of life through self-efficacy and resilience. These psychological resources would allow the nursing staff to maintain a good quality of life despite high levels of stress. These findings have implications for future research in terms of both model testing and clinical application.","PeÃƒÂ±acoba, Catala, Velasco, Carmona-Monge, Garcia-Hedrera, Gil-Almagro","https://doi.org/10.1111/nicc.12690","20210813","COVID-19 pandemic; intensive care unit; nurses; quality of life; resilience; self-efficacy; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-14","",17095,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on the mental health in a cohort of Italian Rehabilitation health care workers","COVID-19 pandemic has had a strong impact on health care workers (HCWs), affecting their physical and mental health. In Italy, HCWs have been among the first exposed to an unprecedented pressure, dealing with large numbers of infections during the first pandemic wave. However, the severe psychological consequences on HCWs find little evidence in literature, especially in terms of comparison to the status quo ante pandemic. Aim of this study was to provide an assessment of the mental health burden in a cohort of Italian HCWs during COVID-19 pandemic, comparing their condition with that before the emergency, to direct the promotion of mental well-being among HCWs worldwide. In this retrospective study, we included physicians, physical therapists, and nurses working in Respiratory Intensive Care Unit, Neurology Unit, and Rehabilitation Unit from a Southern Italy University Hospital. All study participants underwent a battery of psychological tests, aimed at verifying their state of mental health during the COVID-19 emergency and before it. Depressive, anxious and burnout symptoms were assessed using the following questionnaires: Maslach Burnout Inventory, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and General Anxiety Disorder-7. Depressive, anxiety, and burnout clinical relevance symptoms were present in HCWs during COVID-19 pandemic more than before the emergency. The 50% of the HCWs obtained a score clinically significant during the emergency. Moreover, a depersonalization factor showed a statistically significant increase in average scores (p&lt;0.0001). The PHQ-9 scale showed that the 47.1% of the operators reported depressive state presence. The number of operators scoring above cut-off for anxiety scale tripled during the emergency (p&lt;0,0001). The female gender conferred greater risks for depression. Taken together, findings of this study showed that our sample of Italian HCWs showed a greater risk for depression, anxiety, and stress during COVID-19 pandemic. These data might be a starting point to plan mental health monitoring and prevention programs for HCWs, thus ensuring patients to receive the best possible care performances even during healthcare crises such as the current pandemic.

"Effects of COVID-19 lockdown on the mental health of dental students: A longitudinal study","Many countries have enforced lockdowns on their populations due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This study aimed to assess the effects of the lockdown on dental students. A longitudinal, repeated cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate psychological problems experienced by dental students during the COVID-19 lockdown in Saudi Arabia. The dental students were selected from different universities using 2-stage cluster sampling. The validated Arabic version of the 21-item depression, anxiety, and stress scale questionnaire was distributed at the beginning and end of the lockdown. Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used as appropriate. Chi-square test was used to compare the proportions between the sociodemographic data, and logistic regression analysis was used to identify variables associated with the students' responses. A total of 1287 respondents participated in this study (695 first-survey respondents, 592 second-survey respondents). There were longitudinally significant differences in the students' mental health outcomes based on gender, university, class year, and survey time during the COVID-19 lockdown. The lockdown increased the likelihood of female, single, and junior students experiencing stress. The students who lived alone recorded a high chance of elevated levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, which showed a significant longitudinal reduction during the lockdown. Moreover, the lockdown increased the likelihood of mental health problems among the students staying in households of two persons or two-five persons. This study indicates the importance of considering the detrimental mental health consequences on dental students in the event of future pandemics.","Hakami, Vishwanathaiah, Abuzinadah, Alhaddad, Bokhari, Marghalani, Shahin","https://doi.org/10.1002/jdd.12758","20210813","COVID-19; Saudi Arabia; anxiety; dental student; depression; lockdown; mental health; psychological impact; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-14","",17097,""
"Differences in COVID-19 Preventive Behavior and Food Insecurity by HIV Status in Nigeria","The aim of the study was to assess if there were significant differences in the adoption of COVID-19 risk preventive behaviors and experience of food insecurity by people living with and without HIV in Nigeria. This was a cross-sectional study that recruited a convenience sample of 4471 (20.5% HIV positive) adults in Nigeria. Binary logistic regression analysis was conducted to test the associations between the explanatory variable (HIV positive and non-positive status) and the outcome variables-COVID-19 related behavior changes (physical distancing, isolation/quarantine, working remotely) and food insecurity (hungry but did not eat, cut the size of meals/skip meals) controlling for age, sex at birth, COVID-19 status, and medical status of respondents. Significantly fewer people living with HIV (PLWH) reported a positive COVID-19 test result; and had lower odds of practicing COVID-19 risk preventive behaviors. In comparison with those living without HIV, PLWH had higher odds of cutting meal sizes as a food security measure (AOR: 3.18; 95% CI 2.60-3.88) and lower odds of being hungry and not eating (AOR: 0.24; 95% CI 0.20-0.30). In conclusion, associations between HIV status, COVID-19 preventive behaviors and food security are highly complex and warrant further in-depth to unravel the incongruities identified.","Folayan, Ibigbami, Brown, El Tantawi, Uzochukwu, Ezechi, Aly, AbeldaÃƒÂ±o, Ara, Ayanore, Ayoola, Osamika, Ellakany, Gaffar, Idigbe, Ishabiyi, Jafer, Khan, Khalid, Lawal, Lusher, Nzimande, Popoola, Quadri, Rashwan, Roque, Shamala, Al-Tammemi, Yousaf, AbeldaÃƒÂ±o ZuÃƒÂ±iga, Okeibunor, Nguyen","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10461-021-03433-3","20210813","COVID-19; Food security; HIV; Health behavior; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-14","",17098,""
"Midcareer Medical School Research Faculty Perspectives on Vitality and Professionalism During the COVID-19 Pandemic","As medical faculty have central roles during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to study the pandemic's association with the vitality and careers of medical school faculty. To examine how the COVID-19 pandemic affected midcareer research faculty in academic medicine. This qualitative study included medical school faculty who participated in the C-Change Mentoring and Leadership Institute. All US medical school faculty recipients of recent National Institutes of Health (NIH) RO1, RO1-equivalent, and K awards were invited to apply to the institute. The 99 applicants who met inclusion criteria were stratified by degree (MD or MD/PhD vs PhD), gender, and race/ethnicity. Enrollment was offered to applicants randomly selected for 40 spots, demographically balanced by sex, underrepresented in medicine minority (URMM) status, and degree. In April 2020, an inquiry was emailed to faculty enrolled in the institute requesting responses to questions about meaning in work, career choice, and values. A qualitative analysis of narrative data responses, using grounded theory, was undertaken to determine key themes. This study is part of a NIH-funded randomized trial to test the efficacy of a group peer mentoring course for midcareer faculty and study the course's mechanisms of action. Key themes in data. Of 40 enrolled participants, 39 responded to the inquiry, for a response rate of 97%. The analytic sample included 39 faculty members; 19 (47%) were women, 20 (53%) identified as URMM, and 20 (53%) had an MD or MD with PhD vs 19 (47%) with PhD degrees. Key themes in the data that emerged describing faculty lived experience of the pandemic included increased meaningfulness of work; professionalism and moral responsibility; enhanced relationships with colleagues; reassertion of career choice; disrupted research; impact on clinical work; attention to health disparities, social justice and advocacy; increased family responsibilities; psychological stress; and focus on leadership. During the pandemic, diverse PhD and physician investigators reported increased meaningfulness in work and professionalism and enhanced relationships, all intrinsic motivators associated with vitality. Working during the pandemic appears to have produced intrinsic rewards positively associated with vitality, in addition to adverse mental health effects. These findings have implications for combatting burnout and retaining investigators in the future.","Pololi, Vasiliou, Bloom-Feshbach","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.20642","20210813","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-14","",17099,""
"Changes in Alcohol Consumption in Canada During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Associations With Anxiety and Self-Perception of Depression and Loneliness","To examine whether changes in alcohol consumption in Canada since the start of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic are associated with feelings of anxiety, depression, loneliness and/or with changes in employment due to COVID-19. Data collection occurred between 29 May 2020 and 23 March 2021 via a web panel, AskingCanadians, which sampled 5892 adults (Ã¢â€°Â¥18Ã‚Â years of age). Data were collected on changes in alcohol consumption compared to before the pandemic (ordinal variable ranging from 1='much less alcohol' to 5='much more alcohol'), anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder-7), self-perceived depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale), self-perceived loneliness, changes in employment status due to COVID-19 and socio-demographic variables (age, gender, living situation, household income and urban vs rural residence). Multivariate associations were assessed using ordinal logistic regression. Effect modification by gender was tested using likelihood-ratio tests. Changes in alcohol consumption were positively associated with anxiety, feeling depressed and loneliness. In particular, people with mild to moderate (ordered Odds Ratio (OR):1.23, 95% Confidence Interval (CI):1.07, 1.62) or severe anxiety (ordered OR:1.49, 95% CI:1.15, 1.93) had a greater odds of increased drinking than did people with no to low levels of anxiety. Gender, age, household income, living situation and survey wave were also associated with changes in drinking. No effect modifications by gender were observed. Given the health harms caused by alcohol use, public health practitioners and primary care physicians should focus health messaging to identify and support individuals at risk of increased alcohol consumption, especially people experiencing depression, loneliness or anxiety.","Shield, Chrystoja, Ali, Sohi, Rehm, Nigatu, Elton-Marshall, Hamilton, Jankowicz, Wells","https://doi.org/10.1093/alcalc/agab055","20210813","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-14","",17100,""
"The Experience of Key Stakeholders During the Implementation and Use of Trauma Therapy via Digital Health for Military, Veteran, and Public Safety Personnel: Qualitative Thematic Analysis","Exposure to occupational stressors and potentially psychologically traumatic events experienced by public safety personnel (eg, paramedics, police, fire, and correctional officers), military members, and veterans can lead to the development of posttraumatic stress injuries and other mental health disorders. Providing emergency services during COVID-19 has intensified the challenges. Owing to COVID-19 restrictions, mental health service providers offering support to these populations have had to rapidly pivot to use digital versus in-person methods of service delivery. This paper aims to explore the experience of mental health service providers regarding digital health service delivery, including the current state of digital mental health service delivery, barriers to and facilitators of the use of digital health for mental health service delivery experienced during the pandemic, and recommendations for implementing and integrating digital health into regular mental health service delivery. This embedded mixed-methods study included questionnaires and focus groups with key stakeholders (N=31) with knowledge and experience in providing mental health services. Data analysis included descriptive, quantitative, and qualitative thematic analyses. The following three themes emerged: being forced into change, daring to deliver mental health services using digital health, and future possibilities offered by digital health. In each theme, participants' responses reflected their perceptions of service providers, organizations, and clients. The findings offer considerations regarding for whom and at what point in treatment digital health delivery is appropriate; recommendations for training, support, resources, and guidelines for digitally delivering trauma therapy; and a better understanding of factors influencing mental health service providers' perceptions and acceptance of digital health for mental health service delivery. The results indicate the implementation of digital health for mental health service delivery to military members, public safety personnel, and veterans. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, remote service delivery methods for trauma therapy are urgently needed to support the well-being of those who have served and continue to serve.","Smith-MacDonald, Jones, Sevigny, White, Laidlaw, Voth, Mikolas, Heber, Greenshaw, BrÃƒÂ©mault-Phillips","https://doi.org/10.2196/26369","20210813","digital health; first responder; mental health; military; mobile phone; psychotherapy; public safety personnel; rehabilitation; telemedicine; telepsychiatry; teletherapy; therapy; trauma; veteran","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-14","",17101,""
"Micronutrient malnutrition across the life course, sarcopenia and frailty","Micronutrient malnutrition, the deficiency of vitamins or minerals, impacts on physical and mental health, in clinical and general populations, across the life course. In older western populations the high prevalence and impact of micronutrient malnutrition is less well recognised. Low- and middle-income countries are experiencing the 'double burden of disease' where malnutrition coexists alongside the non-communicable diseases of aging, obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Held in December 2020, the Winter Conference of the Nutrition Society was designed to cover new areas of research and concern in micronutrient malnutrition across the life course. Common themes arising from the conference were: 1) The continuing high prevalence of micronutrient malnutrition across the life-course, in diverse populations, in high, middle and low-income countries. 2) That multiple deficiencies of micronutrients frequently exist. 3) The primary cause of deficiency is poor quality diets, of low diversity, low in micronutrient dense foods. 4) Clinical conditions, medications for common non-communicable diseases, and environmental conditions, interact with and exacerbate the effects of poor diet quality. 5) Understanding of the mechanistic effects of micronutrients is still emerging. 6) Micronutrients are necessary for maintaining immune function, which has importance for the COVID-19 epidemic. 7) Better biomarkers are needed detect and understand the effects of deficiency. 7) Dietary recommendations need to be updated regularly. Further research is needed in all these areas. Comprehensive public health and government approaches to ensure access and affordability of good quality foods to populations of all ages, particularly during the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, are crucial.","Welch","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0029665121001968","20210813","COVID-19; frailty; micronutrient malnutrition; sarcopenia; vitamin and mineral deficiency","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-14","",17102,""

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may exacerbate this problem with healthcare workers reporting increased anxiety, depression, and insomnia. To assess the rate, severity, and causes of burnout before and during the pandemic, a survey was sent to academic dermatologists through the Association of Professors of Dermatology (APD) listserv and compared to a similar survey administered to the same population prior to the pandemic. Burnout rates have increased from 2018, with 53% of participants experiencing burnout once a week or more and 17% experiencing burnout daily during the pandemic. The most common COVID-related burnout factors involve uncertainty about the future, teledermatology, fear of exposing loved ones to COVID-19, and compensation reduction. The challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic compound existing burnout within dermatology, warranting consideration by academic institutions.","Shah, Dorrell, Feldman, Huang","https://doi.org/10.5070/D327654050","20210813","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-14","",17103,""
"Dynamic relative regional strain visualized by electrical impedance tomography in patients suffering from COVID-19","Respiratory failure due to SARS-CoV-2 may progress rapidly. During the course of COVID-19, patients develop an increased respiratory drive, which may induce high mechanical strain a known risk factor for Patient Self-Inflicted Lung Injury (P-SILI). We developed a novel Electrical Impedance Tomography-based approach to visualize the Dynamic Relative Regional Strain (DRRS) in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and compared these findings with measurements in lung healthy volunteers. DRRS was defined as the ratio of tidal impedance changes and end-expiratory lung impedance within each pixel of the lung region. DRRS values of the ten patients were considerably higher than those of the ten healthy volunteers. On repeated examination, patterns, magnitude and frequency distribution of DRRS were reproducible and in line with the clinical course of the patients. Lung ultrasound scores correlated with the number of pixels showing DRRS values above the derived threshold. Using Electrical Impedance Tomography we were able to generate, for the first time, images of DRRS which might indicate P-SILI in patients suffering from COVID-19.Trial Registration This observational study was registered 06.04.2020 in German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00021276).","Pulletz, Krukewitt, Gonzales-Rios, Teschendorf, Kremeier, Waldmann, Zitzmann, MÃƒÂ¼ller-Graf, Acosta, Tusman, Reuter, BÃƒÂ¶hm","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-021-00748-3","20210813","COVID-19; DRRS; Dynamic relative regional strain; EIT; Electrical impedance tomography; Lung injury; Strain","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-14","",17104,""

"Describing heart rate variability in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation during hospitalization for COVID-19","Myriad cardiovascular manifestations have been reported with COVID-19. We previously reported that failure of PR interval shortening with increasing heart rate (HR) in patients with COVID-19 is associated with adverse outcomes. Here, we report on heart rate variability (HRV) and clinical outcomes in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation (cAF) hospitalized for COVID-19. A retrospective review of admitted COVID-19 patients with cAF between 1 March 2020 to 30 June 2020 was performed. HRV in cAF was compared during pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 admissions; we selected pre-COVID-19 ECGs with HRs that were within 10 beats per minute of the COVID-19 ECGs. Mean HR and each RR interval were recorded. Time-domain measurements of HR variability were then calculated (SDSD, RMSSD, pNN50). Clinical outcomes during COVID-19 were correlated to indices of HRV. A total of 184 ECGs (95 pre-COVID-19, 89 COVID-19) from 38 cAF in-patients were included. Mean age 78.6Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 11.4Ã‚Â years, male 44.7%.

"Life With Corona: Increased Gender Differences in Aggression and Depression Symptoms Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic Burden in Germany","Gender differences (GD) in mental health have come under renewed scrutiny during the COVID-19 pandemic. While rapidly emerging evidence indicates a deterioration of mental health in general, it remains unknown whether the pandemic will have an impact on GD in mental health. To this end, we investigate the association of the pandemic and its countermeasures affecting everyday life, labor, and households with changes in GD in aggression, anxiety, depression, and the somatic symptom burden. We analyze cross-sectional data from 10,979 individuals who live in Germany and who responded to the online survey ""Life with Corona"" between October 1, 2020 and February 28, 2021. We estimate interaction effects from generalized linear models. The analyses reveal no pre-existing GD in aggression but exposure to COVID-19 and COVID-19 countermeasures is associated with sharper increases in aggression in men than in women. GD in anxiety decreased among participants with children in the household (with men becoming more anxious). We also observe pre-existing and increasing GD with regards to the severity of depression, with women presenting a larger increase in symptoms during the hard lockdown or with increasing stringency. In contrast to anxiety, GD in depression increased among participants who lived without children (women &gt; men), but decreased for individuals who lived with children; here, men converged to the levels of depression presented by women. Finally, GD in somatic symptoms decreased during the hard lockdown (but not with higher stringency), with men showing a sharper increase in symptoms, especially when they lived with children or alone. Taken together, the findings indicate an increase in GD in mental health as the pandemic unfolded in Germany, with rising female vulnerability to depression and increasing male aggression. The combination of these two trends further suggests a worrying mental health situation for singles and families. Our results have important policy implications for the German health system and public health policy. This public health challenge requires addressing the rising burden of pandemic-related mental health challenges and the distribution of this burden between women and men, within families and for individuals who live alone.","Abreu, Koebach, DÃƒÂ­az, Carleial, Hoeffler, Stojetz, Freudenreich, Justino, BrÃƒÂ¼ck","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.689396","20210813","COVID-19 pandemic; aggression; anxiety; depression; gender differences; mental health; somatization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-14","",17108,""
"Covid-19 and Families With Parental Mental Illness: Crisis and Opportunity","The COVID-19 emergency has affected us all, but not equally. Families where parents have mental illness (PMI) are potentially at increased risk, but little is known about how they or their support services managed under lockdown/restrictions. We harnessed our existing partnerships with adult and child mental health services in the Republic of Ireland (RoI) and Northern Ireland (NI) to investigate the qualitative experiences of service users and families in coping during the first COVID-19 lockdown (March-May 2020), and how services were supporting them. Semi-structured phone/online interviews were conducted with 22 clinicians/managers (12 from RoI; 10 from NI) who provided information from their caseloads (~155 families with PMI). Sixteen family members (10 from RoI, 6 from NI) were also interviewed. Data were analysed using standard thematic analysis. Sixty percent of families reported improved mental health, primarily due to respite from daily stresses and the ""normalisation"" of mental distress in the general population. Approximately 30%, typically with more severe/enduring mental illness, reported additional challenges, and mental distress including: unmanageable child behaviours; fear of relapse/hospitalisation; financial difficulties; absence of child care; and a lack of routines. Service provision varied considerably across regions. The experiences within this case study highlight unique opportunities to address the multiple stresses of pre-emergency daily living. We also highlight how mental health services and governments might become more ""pandemic ready"" to more effectively support vulnerable families, including addressing service overload issues, optimising the use of digital technologies, and providing in-person contact and social supports where required.","Furlong, McGilloway, Mulligan, Killion, McGarr, Grant, Davidson, Donaghy","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.567447","20210813","COVID-19; children; family; mental disorder; mental health; mental illness; pandemic; parents","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-14","",17109,""
"Feasibility and Effectiveness of Telecounseling on the Psychological Problems of Frontline Healthcare Workers Amidst COVID-19: A Randomized Controlled Trial from Central India","Preliminary reports suggest that during the COVID-19 pandemic, telecounseling could be an effective model of psychological intervention for the frontline healthcare workers (fHCW) with psychological problems. Literature is sparse in this area, particularly from low- and middle-income countries, including India. We aimed to investigate the feasibility and the effectiveness of telecounseling (vs. general education) on the psychological problems of the fHCW over three time-points (baseline vs. end-of-session and at two and four weeks after the intervention). The study followed a single-blind, active arm versus general education, parallel-group randomized control design, with participant allocation in 1:1. Active healthcare workers (HCWs) with mild- to-severe or clinically concerning scores on any of the sub-scales of Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) or Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R; represented by higher scores) were included, while those with known psychiatric illness were excluded. Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U test and linear-mixed effect model (group-, time, and group by time-effect) were used for analysis. There were no baseline group differences (telecounseling group, active arm, <i>n</i> = 9; general education group, control arm, <i>n</i> = 10). A significant time-effect (P = 0.044 to &lt;.001) was found on DASS-21 on intention-to-treat analysis. Per-protocol analysis, additionally, found a significant group effect on Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R; P = 0.036). A significant random effect of the participants was also found (P &lt;.001). Telecounseling could be a feasible and scalable model of psychological interventions for the fHCW with psychological problems, albeit with some feasibility challenges.","Gupta, Kumar, Rozatkar, Basera, Purwar, Gautam, Jahan","https://doi.org/10.1177/02537176211024537","20210813","COVID-19; Frontline; Healthcare workers; Randomize-control trial; Telecounseling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-14","",17110,""
"Psychological Impact of COVID-19 on Children and Adolescents: A Systematic Review","The outbreak of COVID-19 led to a significant psychological impact on individuals, particularly those belonging to vulnerable groups. This study aimed to synthesize literature on the psychological impact of COVID-19 among children and adolescents. Electronic search engines were used to identify studies till March 2021 that reported symptoms of psychological origin in children and adolescents. Information was extracted using a predefined template, and qualitative analysis was conducted using STROBE. One hundred and two relevant papers were identified. Most of the studies were conducted online or telephonically. The study designs were primarily single group cross-sectional, though a few prospective/retrospective designs were also identified. Studies assessing emotional distress showed variable levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms in the study population, with greater severity of anxiety symptoms among females and older adolescents. Reduced physical activity; delayed sleep time; increased sleep duration, screen time, internet use, and sedentary habits, poor quality of life were other notable findings, often correlating with anxiety/depression. Efforts to address bias, discussion on generalizability of their results, and sample size calculation were not reported in most studies. Psychological impact on children/adolescents is significant, either due to the fear of the illness or social isolation related to COVID-19. One may focus on improving sleep habits and physical activity and regulating internet use for maintaining psychological well-being.","Chawla, Tom, Sen, Sagar","https://doi.org/10.1177/02537176211021789","20210813","COVID-19; adolescents; children; psychological impact; social-isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-14","",17111,""
"Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the follow-up and treatment of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: a cross-sectional, multicentre phone call survey","To learn about the attitudes and behaviours of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in relation to the difficulties experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional, multicentre phone call survey. Four university hospitals in Turkey. The study included patients with IPF receiving antifibrotics for at least 3 months and with doctor appointment and/or scheduled routine blood analysis between March and May 2020 (the first 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°months after the official announcement of the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey). Phone calls (a 5Ã¢â‚¬â€°min interview) were performed in June 2020. A questionnaire and the Hospital Anxiety-Depression Scale were applied. Patients' preferences for disease monitoring, patients' attitudes and behaviours towards IPF, drug continuation, COVID-19 diagnosis and anxiety/depression status. The study included 115 patients with IPF (82 male; mean age, 68.43Ã‚Â±7.44 years). Of the patients, 73.9% had doctor appointment and 52.2% had scheduled routine blood testing; 54.5% of patients with doctor appointment self-cancelled their appointments and 53.3% of patients with scheduled routine blood testing did not undergo testing. Of the patients, 32.2% were on nintedanib and 67.8% were on pirfenidone; self-initiated drug discontinuation rate was 22.6%. The percentage of patients communicating with their physicians was 35.7%. The route of communication was by phone (34.8%). The frequency of depression and anxiety was 27.0% and 38.3%, respectively. The rates of drug discontinuation (35.1% vs 16.7%, p&lt;0.05) and depression (37.8% vs 21.8%, p=0.07) were higher in nintedanib users than in pirfenidone users. Only two (1.7%) patients had COVID-19 diagnosis. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant proportion (&gt;50%) of patients self-cancelled their appointments and nearly a quarter of patients discontinued their medications.

"Do people with mental health problems have lower adherence to precautionary measures in COVID-19 pandemic? A cross-sectional observational study in Hong Kong","Mental health problems are prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic, but their effect on adherence to precautionary measures is not well understood. Given that psychological morbidities are associated with lower treatment adherence, and that precautionary measures are important in containing the spread of COVID-19, this study aims to determine if people with mental health problems have lower adherence to precautionary measures against COVID-19. We conducted a cross-sectional territory-wide online survey between 17 June and 31 July 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinically significant mental health problems, adherence to precautionary behaviours, and confounding factors such as sociodemographic factors and self-reported physical health were assessed. The link to the questionnaire was disseminated to the general population in all 18 districts of Hong Kong using various social media platforms. 1036 individuals completed the survey. Of them, 1030 met the inclusion criteria of being adult Hong Kong residents. Adherence to precautionary measures against COVID-19, including wearing face mask, frequent handwashing, household disinfection, social distancing, minimising unnecessary travel, and stocking up on food and daily essentials. Of the 1030 participants, 166 (16.1%) had clinically significant mental health problems. Interestingly, they were more likely to stock up on food and daily essentials during the pandemic (7 (4.2%) vs 15 (1.7%), p=0.04; unadjusted OR=2.49, 95% CI=1.00 to 6.21, p&lt;0.05) and had a lesser tendency to stop social distancing even if the pandemic subsides (86 (51.8%) vs 513 (59.4%), p=0.07; unadjusted OR=0.74, 95% CI=0.53 to 1.03, p=0.07). The latter association remained significant after adjusting for the confounding factors (adjusted OR=0.68, 95% CI=0.48 to 0.96, p=0.03). Contrary to our hypothesis, people who are mentally unwell might go beyond the recommended precautionary measures. Our findings highlight the need to identify mental health problems and provide care and support for those who might go too far with precautionary measures.

"Suicidal behaviour in adults during the COVID-19 pandemic: protocol for systematic review of observational studies","COVID-19 pandemic has an impact on mortality indicators worldwide. Mitigation and repression actions to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease are necessary. However, they are criticised in the economic, social and psychological spheres. This social isolation, increased unemployment, routine changes, news of health complications and deaths related to COVID-19 can cause psychological repercussions that will certainly intensify in the coming months, and suicidal behaviour presents itself as a fatal outcome. It is necessary to know factors associated with suicidal behaviour in adults during the pandemic. Although there are studies, there is no systematic review to assess these factors, specifically in adults. The objective is to critically synthesise the scientific evidence on the factors associated with suicidal behaviour in adults in the COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic review will be carried out, recommended by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol, in seven databases: Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), ISI of Knowledge, Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), SCOPUS, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (PsycINFO), Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and ScienceDirect. Preliminary search was carried out on 30 July 2020 and will be updated in March 2021. No restrictions on publication date, study location or languages will be considered in this review. The preliminary research strategies were carried out on 30 July 2020 and will be updated in February 2021. To measure the agreement between reviewers at each screening stage, Cohen's Kappa will be calculated. Primary outcome will be factors related to suicidal behaviour in adults during COVID-19 pandemic. Grouped standardised mean differences and 95% CIs will be calculated. The risk of bias in observational studies will be assessed using the Methodological Index for Non-Randomised Studies (MINORS). Statistical heterogeneity will be assessed with the I2 statistic. Ethical approval is not required, as primary data will not be collected. The findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications.

"Caring for refugees and newcomers in the post-COVID-19 era: Evidence review and guidance for FPs and health providers","To guide clinicians working in a range of primary care clinical settings on how to provide effective care and support for refugees and newcomers during and after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The described approach integrates recommendations from evidence-based clinical guidelines on refugee health and COVID-19, practical lessons learned from Canadian Refugee Health Network clinicians working in a variety of primary care settings, and contributions from persons with lived experience of forced migration. The COVID-19 pandemic has amplified health and social inequities for refugees, asylum seekers, undocumented migrants, transient migrant workers, and other newcomers. Refugees and newcomers face front-line exposure risks, difficulties accessing COVID-19 testing, exacerbation of mental health concerns, and challenges accessing health care, social, and settlement supports. Existing guidelines for clinical care of refugees are useful, but creative case-by-case strategies must be employed to overcome additional barriers in the context of COVID-19 and new care environments, such as the need for virtual interpretation and digital literacy skills. Clinicians can address inequities and advocate for improved services in collaboration with community partners. The COVID-19 pandemic is amplifying structural inequities. Refugees and newcomers require and deserve effective health care and support during this challenging time. This article outlines practical approaches and advocacy priorities for providing care in the COVID-19 context.","Arya, Redditt, Talavlikar, Holland, Brindamour, Wright, Saad, Beukeboom, Coakley, Rashid, Pottie","https://doi.org/10.46747/cfp.6708575","20210813","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-14","",17115,""
"Persistent effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on diet, exercise, risk for food insecurity, and quality of life: A longitudinal study among US adults","COVID-19 has affected the health and well-being of almost every American. The aim of this study was to examine the sustained impacts of COVID-19 prevention measures on the diet and exercise habits, risk for food insecurity, and quality of life among adults in the U.S. We conducted a longitudinal study using a convenience sample of participants recruited via Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform between March 30 and April 7, 2020, and 8 months into the outbreak, from November 2 to November 21, 2020. We compared self-reported diet and exercise habits and risk for food insecurity shortly after the pandemic began, in April, to those reported in November. We also measured changes in quality-of-life using the PROMIS-29Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â 2 (PROPr) scale. A total of 636 respondents completed both surveys. Compared to reports in April, respondents ate lunch and dinner out more frequently in November and consumed more take-out and fast food. Weekly frequencies of consuming frozen food and the number of daily meals were slightly lower in November than they were in April. 54% of respondents screened positively for being at risk for food insecurity in April, reducing to 41% by November. In April, survey respondents were found to have lower quality-of-life relative to U.S. population norms, but by November levels of depression and cognitive function had improved. Our findings underscore how the initial effects of the pandemic on diet, exercise, risk for food insecurity, and quality of life have evolved. As U.S. states re-open, continued efforts to encourage healthy eating and support mental health, especially to reduce feelings of anxiety and social isolation, remain important to mitigate the potential long-term effects of the pandemic.","Rogers, Lauren, Woo Baidal, Ozanne, Hur","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.105639","20210813","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Diet; Exercise; Food insecurity; Quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-14","",17116,""
"Predictors of Adolescent Resilience During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cognitive Reappraisal and Humor","The COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to slow the spread of disease have particularly affected the lives of adolescents. Many studies have recently identified the risks to adolescent mental health posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, yet few have identified the markers of resilience to the events and concerns associated with the pandemic's lived experience. This study examined the moderating role of psychosocial resources in the association between the tangible and emotional experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic and symptoms of common psychiatric problems during adolescence (depression, anxiety, proactive and reactive aggression, and sleep problems). Participants were adolescents in the United States who were oversampled for early life adversity before the COVID-19 pandemic. The psychosocial resources assessed were humor styles, emotion regulation, social support, optimism, and purpose in life, which have previously been identified as protective in the acute aftermath of stressful events. Greater COVID-19 impact was associated with more anxiety, depressive symptoms, sleep disturbance, and proactive aggression. COVID-19 impact and psychiatric symptoms were unrelated among youth reporting high self-enhancing humor and cognitive reappraisal. Adolescents high in humor and cognitive reappraisal may be protected against the mental health correlates of the COVID-19 pandemic and other prolonged stressors. Importantly, these factors are known to be modifiable through behavioral interventions. Attention to their effectiveness in prevention and intervention studies is needed as the pandemic continues to exert its impact on individuals and society.","Kuhlman, Straka, Mousavi, Tran, Rodgers","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.07.006","20210813","COVID-19; Cognitive reappraisal; Community-level stressors; Developmental psychopathology; Humor; Proactive aggression; Resilience; Sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-14","",17117,""
"Effects of moderate-intensity intermittent hypoxic training on health outcomes of patients recovered from COVID-19: the AEROBICOVID study protocol for a randomized controlled trial","Recent studies point to a lower number and reduced severity of cases in higher altitude cities with decreased oxygen concentration. Specific literature has shown several benefits of physical training, so, in this sense, physical training with hypoxic stimulus appears as an alternative that supports the conventional treatments of the COVID-19 patient's recovery. Thus, this study's primary aim is to analyze the effects of moderate-intensity intermittent hypoxic training on health outcomes in COVID-19 recovered patients. A clinical trial controlled double-blind study was designed. Participants (30-69 years old) will be recruited among those with moderate to severe COVID-19 symptoms, approximately 30 days after recovery. They will be included in groups according to the training (T) and recovery (R) association with hypoxia (H) or normoxia (N): (a) T<sub>H</sub>:R<sub>H</sub>, (b) T<sub>N</sub>:R<sub>H</sub>, (c) T<sub>N</sub>:R<sub>N</sub>, and last (d) the control group. The 8-week exercise bike intervention will be carried out with a gradual load increase according to the established periods, three times a week in sets of 5 min, 90 to 100% of the anaerobic threshold (AT), and a 2.5-min break. Blood will be collected for genotyping. First, after 4 weeks (partial), after 8 weeks, and later, 4 weeks after the end of the physical training intervention, participants will perform assessments. The primary outcome is the maximum oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>peak). The secondary outcomes include lung function, inflammatory mediators, hematological, autonomic parameters, AT, body composition analysis, quality of life, mental health, anthropometric measurements, and physical fitness. The statistical analysis will be executed using the linear regression model with mixed effects at a 5% significance level. This study is designed to provide evidence to support the clinical benefits of moderate-intensity intermittent hypoxic training as a part of the treatment of patients recovered from COVID-19. It may also provide evidence on the efficacy and safety of intermittent hypoxic training in different health conditions. Lastly, this study presents an innovative strategy enabling up to 16 participants in the same training session. ClinicalTrials.gov RBR-5d7hkv.

"Sleeping for two: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia in pregnant women","Insomnia and sleep disturbances are common in pregnancy and have potentially significant consequences for both maternal and infant health. There is limited research examining the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) during pregnancy. With increased distress and limited access to services during the COVID-19 pandemic, there is also an unprecedented need for telehealth delivery of treatment programs for pregnant women. The aims of this trial are to evaluate the impact of the Sleeping for Two adaptation of CBT-I in pregnancy (in-person or telehealth) versus treatment as usual (TAU) in reducing symptoms of insomnia (primary outcome), as well as increasing gestational length and reducing symptoms of depression (secondary outcomes). A two-arm, single-blinded, parallel group randomized controlled trial (RCT) design with repeated measures will be used to evaluate the impact of CBT-I compared to TAU among a sample of 62 pregnant women, enrolled between 12 and 28 weeks of gestation, who self-identify as experiencing insomnia. Five weekly individual sessions of CBT-I will be delivered in person or via telehealth depending on physical distancing guidelines. Assessment of insomnia diagnosis by structured interview, self-reported insomnia symptom severity and sleep problems, and sleep quantity and quality as measured by a daily diary and actigraphy will occur at 12-28 weeks of pregnancy (T1), 1 week post-treatment (T2), and 6 months postpartum (T3). CBT-I delivered in pregnancy has the potential to reduce symptoms of insomnia and depression and could lead to reduced risk of preterm birth, all of which can minimize risk of negative maternal and child health and developmental consequences in the short (e.g., infant death) and long terms (e.g., developmental delays). This RCT builds on a successful open pilot trial conducted by our team and will provide further evaluation of a novel evidence-based treatment for pregnancy-related insomnia, which can be widely disseminated and used to treat individuals that are most in need of intervention. Findings will enhance understanding of pregnancy-related sleep problems, as well as means by which to improve the health and sleep of mothers and their children. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03918057.

"Acute prolonged motor aura resembling ischemic stroke after COVID -Ã¢â‚¬â€°19 vaccination (CoronaVac): the first case report","We report the first case of a patient who suffered transient focal neurological deficit mimicking stroke following CoronaVac vaccination. However, instead of an ischemic stroke, motor aura was suspected. A 24 year-old Thai female presented with left hemiparesis fifteen minutes after receiving CoronaVac. She also had numbness of her left arm and legs, flashing lights, and headaches. On physical examination, her BMI was 32.8. Her vital signs were normal. She had moderate left hemiparesis (MRC grade III), numbness on her left face, arms, and legs. Her weakness continued for 5 days. A brain CT scan was done showing no evidence of acute infarction. Acute treatment with aspirin was given. MRI in conjunction with MRA was performed in which no restricted diffusion was seen. A SPECT was performed to evaluate the function of the brain showing significant hypoperfusion of the right hemisphere. The patient gradually improved and was discharged. In this study, we present the first case of stroke mimic after CoronaVac vaccination. After negative imaging studies had been performed repeatedly, we reach a conclusion that stroke is unlikely to be the cause. Presumably, this phenomenon could possibly have abnormal functional imaging study. Therefore, we believed that it might be due to cortical spreading depression, like migraine aura, which we had conducted a literature review.","Rattanawong, Akaratanawat, Tepmongkol, Chutinet, Tantivatana, Suwanwela","https://doi.org/10.1186/s10194-021-01311-w","20210813","COVID-19; CoronaVac vaccine; Cortical spreading depression; Neurological deficit; Sinovac","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-14","",17120,""

"Student adaptability, emotions, and achievement: Navigating new academic terrains in a global crisis","The COVID-19 pandemic forced students to abruptly shift from traditional and familiar, to largely improvised distance learning formats. This study examined whether individual differences in students' capacity to adjust to situational uncertainty and novelty (i.e., adaptability) explained differences in their achievement-related emotions and learning outcomes in the digital learning context. We assessed 89 university students' trait-level adaptability at the beginning of the 2020 spring semester, mid-semester achievement emotions (joy, hope, anxiety, hopelessness), and end-of-semester perceived learning and knowledge test scores. Controlling for prior digital learning experience, structural equation modeling revealed adaptability to be positively related to hope, and negatively related to anxiety and hopelessness. Anxiety was also negatively related to end-of-semester test scores, and indirectly linked adaptability and test scores. Hopelessness indirectly linked adaptability and perceived learning. Overall, the findings contribute to understanding and supporting students' emotional well-being and learning amidst changing academic circumstances.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lindif.2021.102046","20210801","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-14","",17122,""
