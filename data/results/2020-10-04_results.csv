"Investigation on the mental health status of pregnant women in China during the Pandemic of COVID-19","To evaluate the anxiety and depression in pregnant women in China, and its influencing factors during the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. From February 22 to February 27, a questionnaire survey was conducted on 156 pregnant women, including demographic characteristics, a self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), and a self-depression rating scale (SDS). A total of 13 non-homologous end-joining (8.3%, 13/156) patients were anxious, 79 patients (50.6%, 79/156) were depressed, and 13 patients (8.3%, 13/156) suffered from both anxiety and depression. The SAS score of pregnant women was 40.55Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.09, and the SDS score was 50.42Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°11.64. For the SAS score, only 8.3% of all patients (13/156) were in a light anxiety state. For the SDS score, 46.79% (73/156) of patients was normal, 23.72% of patients (37/156) showed mild depression, 22.44% (35/156) showed moderate depression, and 4.49% (7/156) showed severe depression. No significant changes were observed in SAS and SDS scores between patients from different regions within China, health state, gestational week, educational background, and living condition (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Moreover, no significant differences were observed between diagnosed/suspected patients and the normal control group (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05), and between pregnant women in Wuhan compared to other regions (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). During the COVID-19 epidemic, the anxiety level of pregnant women was the same as that before the epidemic, while the level of depression was significantly higher. Pregnant women who lived in Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic, were not more anxious or depressed compared to pregnant women in other regions during the COVID-19 epidemic. Furthermore, the mental health status of pregnant women with COVID-19 was not more severe.","Dong, Hu, Lu, Huang, Cui, Huang, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00404-020-05805-x","20201003","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Mental health; Pregnant women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-04","",5465,""
"Addressing the mental health of Canadians waiting for elective surgery: a potential positive post-pandemic legacy","The impact of waiting for surgery on the mental health of patients usually receives little attention. Because of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the waits for elective surgery have been lengthening, potentially inducing or exacerbating mental health burdens. Provinces' health systems need to provide better support to assess not only patients' physical health, but also their mental health, and provide them with timely access to care based on need. A stepped care approach is needed to mitigate negative mental health effects associated with prolonged waits for elective operations. To provide the best care possible, we need to recognize and address both the physical and mental health problems of our waiting patients.","Wiseman, Crump, Cadesky, Sutherland","https://www.google.com/search?q=Addressing+the+mental+health+of+Canadians+waiting+for+elective+surgery:+a+potential+positive+post-pandemic+legacy.","20201003","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-04","",5466,""
"Ecological Study on Differences in COVID-19 Fatality among Wuhan, Rest of Hubei, and Rest of China","China's vigorous anti-COVID-19 campaign has been going on for three months since January 20, which has contained the spread of the virus across China. Epidemiological investigations found that COVID-19 fatality rates in Wuhan, rest parts of Hubei province except Wuhan (Rest of Hubei) and rest parts of Mainland China except Hubei province (Rest of China) were different. An ecological study was conducted to analyze the reasons and provide the world with China's anti-COVID-19 epidemic experiences. Infected cases from Mainland China were divided into three populations: Wuhan, Rest of Hubei and Rest of China. Methods were based on <i>The Novel Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Standards.</i> Total confirmed cases, daily severe cases, total deaths from February 12 to April 20 were collected for statistical analysis. 50,333 total confirmed cases in Wuhan made up the most substantial part by comparison with 17,795 in Rest of Hubei and 14,630 in Rest of China, respectively. In the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic, daily severe cases in Wuhan accounted for the majority, and as the epidemic controlled, severe cases in all three populations decreased. Total deaths in Wuhan constituted the most significant proportion, with the highest 3869 in contrast to 643 in Rest of Hubei and 120 in Rest of China. The fatality rates in Wuhan ranged from 2.82% to 7.69%, much higher than 1.80-3.61% in Rest of Hubei, and 0.49-0.88% in Rest of China. Pearson chi-square test for fatality rates in the three populations demonstrated significant differences (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). The ecological comparison study among the three populations have proved that social distancing, quarantine, lockdown, cutting off sources of infection and transmission routes, early detection, early isolation, early treatment are all vital to control the epidemic by reducing COVID-19 confirmed cases, severe cases and the fatality rate.","Ke, Cui, Wong","https://doi.org/10.2991/jegh.k.200902.001","20201003","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; cross-sectional study; ecological study; epidemiological investigation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-04","",5467,""
"Knowledge, Attitude and Practice toward COVID-19 among Egyptians","COVID-19 is a public Health Emergency of International Concern. The aim of this work was to assess the level of Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) among Egyptians toward COVID-19. A cross-sectional study was conducted from March 1st to April 1st, on 3712 participants of different ages and sex. An author designed KAP questionnaire toward COVID-19 administered online and personally was delivered. Satisfactory knowledge, positive attitude and good practice were reported among 70.2%, 75.9% and 49.2% of the participants respectively. Middle-aged participants reported high knowledge and attitude levels with poor practice level (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Females reported high knowledge and practice levels and low attitude (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001 and <i>p</i> = 0.041 respectively). Despite reporting high knowledge and attitude among urban residents (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), practice level was high among rural residents (<i>p</i> = 0.001). Post-graduate education reported the highest levels of KAP (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Rural residents, working and non-enough income participants reported lower level of practice (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Logistic regression was carried out. It was found that unsatisfactory knowledge was associated with low education [Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.51-2.56], and of rural residency (OR = 1.2, 95% CI: 1.05-1.41). Negative attitude was associated with not working (OR = 1.94, 95% CI: 1.61-2.35) and not enough income (OR = 1.29, 95%CI: 1.10-1.51 respectively). Poor practice is associated with young age (OR = 2.41, 95% CI: 1.94-2.98) and low education (OR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.03-1.37) and not working (OR = 4.95, 95% CI: 4.07-6.02). Satisfactory knowledge, positive attitude and poor practice were found among the participants. A good knowledge and lower practice level were found among middle-aged, working participants, and participants with insufficient income. The demographic characters associated with KAP could be the cornerstone in directing policy-makers to target the health education campaigns to the suitable target groups.","Kasemy, Bahbah, Zewain, Haggag, Alkalash, Zahran, Desouky","https://doi.org/10.2991/jegh.k.200909.001","20201003","COVID-19; Egyptians; attitude; knowledge; practice","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-04","",5468,""
"Essential, not peripheral: Addressing health care workers' mental health concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic","In this Opinion, we synthesize recent evidence regarding the mental health impacts of the pandemic with an emphasis on health care workers.

"The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances in COVID-19 patients: a meta-analysis","Evidence from previous coronavirus outbreaks has shown that infected patients are at risk for developing psychiatric and mental health disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances. To construct a comprehensive picture of the mental health status in COVID-19 patients, we conducted a systematic review and random-effects meta-analysis to assess the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances in this population. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, Wanfang Data, Wangfang Med Online, CNKI, and CQVIP for relevant articles, and we included 31 studies (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 5153) in our analyses. We found that the pooled prevalence of depression was 45% (95% CI: 37-54%, I<sup>2</sup> Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 96%), the pooled prevalence of anxiety was 47% (95% CI: 37-57%, I<sup>2</sup> Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 97%), and the pooled prevalence of sleeping disturbances was 34% (95% CI: 19-50%, I<sup>2</sup> Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 98%). We did not find any significant differences in the prevalence estimates between different genders; however, the depression and anxiety prevalence estimates varied based on different screening tools. More observational studies assessing the mental wellness of COVID-19 outpatients and COVID-19 patients from countries other than China are needed to further examine the psychological implications of COVID-19 infections.","Deng, Zhou, Hou, Silver, Wong, Chang, Huang, Zuo","https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.14506","20201003","anxiety; coronavirus; depression; meta-analysis; pandemic; sleep disturbance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-04","",5470,""
"Mental health during COVID-19 lockdown in the United Kingdom","The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic and related lockdown measures have raised important questions about the impact on mental health. This study evaluated several mental health and well-being indicators in a large sample from the United Kingdom (UK) during the COVID-19 lockdown where the death rate is currently the highest in Europe. A cross-sectional online survey with a study sample that mirrors general population norms according to sex, age, education, and region was launched four weeks after lockdown measures were implemented in the UK. Measures included mental health-related quality of life (WHO-QOL BREF psychological domain), well-being (WHO-5), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), perceived stress (PSS-10), and insomnia (ISI). ANOVAs, Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc tests, and t-tests were applied to examine mental health indicators across different sociodemographic groups (age, sex, employment, income, physical activity, relationship status). The sample comprised N=1,006 respondents (54% women) from all regions of the UK. Approximately 52% of respondents screened positive for a common mental disorder, and 28% screened positive for clinical insomnia. Mean scores and standard deviations were as follows: PHQ-9: M=9.0Ã‚Â±7.7; GAD-7: M=8.0Ã‚Â±6.5; ISI: M=10.4Ã‚Â±7.0; PSS-10: M=17.7Ã‚Â±7.9; WHO-QOL BREF: M=58.6Ã‚Â±21.4; WHO-5 score M=13.0Ã‚Â±6.0. Statistical analyses consistently indicated more severe mental health problems in adults under 35 years, women, people with no work, and low income (all p-values &lt;.05). Mental health indices also varied across UK regions. The prevalence of depressive-, anxiety-, and insomnia symptoms is significantly higher in the UK, relative to pre-pandemic epidemiological data. Further studies are needed to clarify the causes for these high rates of mental health symptoms.","Pieh, Budimir, Delgadillo, Barkham, Fontaine, Probst","https://doi.org/10.1097/PSY.0000000000000871","20201003","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-04","",5471,""
"Practicing precision medicine with intelligently integrative clinical and multi-omics data analysis","Precision medicine aims to empower clinicians to predict the most appropriate course of action for patients with complex diseases like cancer, diabetes, cardiomyopathy, and COVID-19. With a progressive interpretation of the clinical, molecular, and genomic factors at play in diseases, more effective and personalized medical treatments are anticipated for many disorders. Understanding patient's metabolomics and genetic make-up in conjunction with clinical data will significantly lead to determining predisposition, diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers and paths ultimately providing optimal and personalized care for diverse, and targeted chronic and acute diseases. In clinical settings, we need to timely model clinical and multi-omics data to find statistical patterns across millions of features to identify underlying biologic pathways, modifiable risk factors, and actionable information that support early detection and prevention of complex disorders, and development of new therapies for better patient care. It is important to calculate quantitative phenotype measurements, evaluate variants in unique genes and interpret using ACMG guidelines, find frequency of pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants without disease indicators, and observe autosomal recessive carriers with a phenotype manifestation in metabolome. Next, ensuring securityÃ‚Â to reconcile noise, we need to build and train machine-learning prognostic models to meaningfully process multisource heterogeneous data to identify high-risk rare variants and make medically relevant predictions. The goal, today, is to facilitate implementation of mainstream precision medicine to improve the traditional symptom-driven practice of medicine, and allow earlier interventions using predictive diagnostics and tailoring better-personalized treatments. We strongly recommend automated implementation of cutting-edge technologies, utilizing machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches for the multimodal data aggregation, multifactor examination, development of knowledgebase of clinical predictors for decision support, and best strategies for dealing with relevant ethical issues.","Ahmed","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40246-020-00287-z","20201003","AÃ¯Â»Â¿rtificial intelligence; Clinics; Genomics; Integrative analysis; Machine learning; Metabolomics; Precision medicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-04","",5472,""
"Whither economic evaluation in the case of COVID-19: What can the field of mental health economics contribute within the Australian context?","COVID-19 has resulted in broad impacts on the economy and aspects of daily life including our collective mental health and well-being. The Australian health care system already faces limitations in its ability to treat people with mental health diagnoses. Australia has responded to the COVID-19 outbreak by, among other initiatives, providing reimbursement for telehealth services. However, it is unclear if these measures will be enough to manage the psychological distress, depression, anxiety and post-traumatic distress shown to accompany infectious disease outbreaks and economic shocks. Decision making has focused on the physical health ramifications of COVID-19, the avoidance of over-burdening the health care system and saving lives. We propose an alternative framework for decision making that combines life years saved with impacts on quality of life. A framework that simultaneously includes mental health and broader economic impacts into a single decision-making process would facilitate transparent and accountable decision making that can improve the overall welfare of Australian society as we continue to address the considerable challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic is creating.","Mihalopoulos, Chatterton, Engel, Le, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1177/0004867420963724","20201003","COVID-19; Economic evaluation; health economics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-04","",5473,""
