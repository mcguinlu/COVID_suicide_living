"Understanding the Agency-Foundation Relationship: The Role of Nonprofit Foundations in Delivering Local Park and Recreation Services","Inadequate funding is a common and longstanding concern for local public park and recreation agencies. Traditionally, these services are funded predominantly through tax-based allocations, supplemented by other streams such as earned revenue, dedicated levies, and sponsorship agreements. Cost-cutting measures such as outsourcing, overall staffing reductions, and an increasing reliance on a parttime workforce have also become increasingly common in the context of local park and recreation service delivery. Partnership with nonprofit organizations represents another potential strategy to adequately fund local park and recreation services. Partnerships between local park and recreation agencies and nonprofit park and recreation foundations have a long history, and help support local park and recreation agencies in a variety of capacities. Their importance may also be growing as a function of the decline in tax-based support and earned revenue due to both the Great Recession and the global COVID-19 pandemic. Such partnerships are not unique to local parks and recreation however, and are common--and widely studied--at the national and transnational level. Despite their importance to local park and recreation service delivery, and the established body of knowledge examining these partnerships at the national and transnational level, the local agency-foundation relationship remains understudied. In this manuscript we begin to address this gap by providing a clearer picture of the agency-foundation relationship, and identifying strategies for how local park and recreation agencies can most effectively leverage these partnerships. To do so, we employ a qualitative research method, interviewing leaders from both local public park and recreation agencies and nonprofit park foundations. Results illustrate a variety of motivations for initiating an agency-foundation relationship (funding/capacity, deteriorating conditions, and equity), as well as a number of distinct benefits of such a partnership (increased operational capacity, advocacy and outreach, expertise, and non-governmental status). Respondents also identified various characteristics of a successful agency-foundation relationhttps ship (effective communication, clear roles and responsibilities, strong connections, and flex bility/responsiveness), and challenges to success (competition for scarce resources, and equity). Based on these results, we propose several strategies to help local park and recreation agencies maximize these partnerships (communicate frequently and with purpose, build relationships, formalize ties, and strive for equitable outcomes).

"Artificial intelligence applications in social media for depression screening: A systematic review protocol for content validity processes","Background The popularization of social media has led to the coalescing of user groups around mental health conditions;in particular, depression. Social media offers a rich environment for contextualizing and predicting usersâ€™ self-reported burden of depression. Modern artificial intelligence (AI) methods are commonly employed in analyzing user-generated sentiment on social media. In the forthcoming systematic review, we will examine the content validity of these computer-based health surveillance models with respect to standard diagnostic frameworks. Drawing from a clinical perspective, we will attempt to establish a normative judgment about the strengths of these modern AI applications in the detection of depression. Methods We will perform a systematic review of English and German language publications from 2010 to 2020 in PubMed, APA PsychInfo, Science Direct, EMBASE Psych, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. The inclusion criteria span cohort, case-control, cross-sectional studies, randomized controlled studies, in addition to reports on conference proceedings. The systematic review will exclude some gray source materials, specifically editorials, newspaper articles, and blog posts. Our primary outcome is self-reported depression, as expressed on social media. Secondary outcomes will be the types of AI methods used for social media depression screen, and the clinical validation procedures accompanying these methods. In a second step, we will utilize the evidence-strengthening Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes, Study type (PICOS) tool to refine our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Following the independent assessment of the evidence sources by two authors for the risk of bias, the data extraction process will culminate in a thematic synthesis of reviewed studies. Discussion We present the protocol for a systematic review which will consider all existing literature from peer reviewed publication sources relevant to the primary and secondary outcomes. The completed review will discuss depression as a self-reported health outcome in social media material. We will examine the computational methods, including AI and machine learning techniques which are commonly used for online depression surveillance. Furthermore, we will focus on standard clinical assessments, as indicating content validity, in the design of the algorithms. The methodological quality of the clinical construct of the algorithms will be evaluated with the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) framework. We conclude the study with a normative judgment about the current application of AI to screen for depression on social media.

"The Psychological Benefits of COVID-19 Vaccination","This study evaluates the extent to which COVID-19 vaccination affects population mental health. Exploiting the within-state and within-survey week variation in the number fully vaccinated per 10 million people, I uncover the favorable effects of vaccination on individuals' psychological well-being. Particularly, a 100% increase in the number fully vaccinated per 10 million people makes individuals 0.24, 0.23, 0.12, and 0.14 percentage points less likely to experience anxiety, worry, displeasure, and depression on a daily basis, respectively. The probability of having at least one of the four symptoms (anxiety, worry, displeasure, and depression) every day also reduces by 0.27 percentage points. The study calls for the expansion of vaccine coverage, especially for disproportionately affected communities.","Nguyen, My","https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/1718800","","Database: CINAHL; Publication details: Advances in Public Health;: 1-9, 2021.; Publication details: Advances in Public Health;: 1-9, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21869,""

"Life in Lockdown: supported self-management of IBD increases disease control through My IBD Care","IntroductionMyIBD Care is a mobile phone application delivering digital therapeutics and remote monitoring for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The app provides a library of self-management content, direct messaging with clinical teams, and a range of clinically validated disease-measures.During the first wave of the COVID pandemic many IBD patients were forced to shield due active disease or medication. In response to this we developed situationally relevant behavioral science-based courses to alleviate the increased risk of patients developing anxiety or depression due to isolation. Our two courses focussed on maintaining healthy relationships and exercise. The courses were created using the same behavior-change framework as existing courses in the app.MethodsFifteen MyIBD users participated in a study designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the â€˜Life in Lockdownâ€™ courses. We assessed changes in mental health (GAD-7) and disease control (IBD-Control) using patient-reported outcome measures delivered through the app.ResultsPatients scored significantly higher on the IBD-control questionnaire following completion of either the 4 or 5-day courses, indicating that they feel more control over their disease following the intervention (median score 5 vs 8.5, p&lt;0.002). We observed non-significant improvement in self-reported anxiety and depression levels, a 17% improvement in self-reported wellbeing, along with an increased level of physical activity, and feelings of social connection.ConclusionsThese measurable improvements following a short course highlight the need for supported self-care for people with IBD during uncertain times. Future work will investigate the effectiveness of non-lockdown-related courses on self-management of IBD in app users.","Moran, Rachel, Miles, Oliver, Parkes, Gareth, Bu, Hayee","https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2021-BSG.331","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Gut; 70(Suppl 4):A178-A179, 2021.; Publication details: Gut; 70(Suppl 4):A178-A179, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21871,""
"Is a novel digital breathing & energy management programme effective in reducing symptoms of long COVID?","IntroductionThe most common symptoms of â€˜Long COVIDâ€™ which is defined as symptoms &gt;12 weeks post COVID infection, are breathlessness and fatigue. Breathing retraining and holistic management for patients suffering with ongoing symptoms of COVID has been recommended to help manage these symptoms.1 Ensuring quality rest and activity energy management is essential for the management of chronic fatigue.1,2 The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of a novel digital 6-week breathing & energy group management programme for patients with Long COVID.MethodWe conducted a pilot, cohort, observational study using qualitative questionnaires pre and post intervention between Jan -May 2021. The intervention was led by breathing, fatigue specialist physiotherapists and psychological well-being practitioners. Baseline information was gathered with an individual digital assessment. Participants were enrolled to weekly digital group sessions focusing on breathing retraining and establishing a good energy management balance. A follow up re-assessment was completed post intervention.Results72 participants aged between 24â€“81, 45 female,27 male, 57 White British, 7 Black British, 2 Black Asian, 6 Other Ethnicity were enrolled. Baseline data showed 87% (n=63) had a breathing pattern disorder (Breathing Pattern Assessment Tool Score&gt; 4.) 69% (n=50) had signs of hyperventilation syndrome (Nijmegen score &gt; 23). 77% were suffering with severe fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) &gt; 5). Outcome measures used were the Self-Reported Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (SR -CRDQ), General Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD7), Patient Health Questionnaire PHQ9 and FSS. 86% (n=62) patients had a clinically significant improvement in at least 1 of the SR-CRDQ domains (breathlessness, emotion, fatigue and mastery).53% (n=38) had a clinically significant reduction in FSS. 51% (n=37) patients had a clinically significant improvement in anxiety or depression.ConclusionAnalysis shows that a digital, novel 6 week breathing and energy management programme was beneficial for patients suffering Long COVID. Continued investigation and further research is required to evaluate the effectiveness of breathing retraining and energy management for patients suffering with Long COVID.ReferencesGeorge PM, et al.

"Traumatisme et rÃ©silience associÃ©s Ã  la pandÃ©mie de la COVID-19Â dans les villes de Bafoussam et de Dschang au Cameroun","L'Ã©mergence de la pandÃ©mie de la Covid-19 dans le monde, a Ã©tÃ© marquÃ©e par une soudainetÃ© et une imprÃ©visibilitÃ© qui ont fascinÃ© l'imaginaire. Au Cameroun, la faiblesse des mesures de dÃ©tection et de prise en charge, associÃ©e Ã  une communication dÃ©sorganisÃ©e, Ã©tait susceptible de gÃ©nÃ©rer une traumatisation importante de la population, qu'interroge l'Ã©tude. Cette Ã©tude Ã©value la symptomatologie de l'Ã©tat de stress post-traumatique, ainsi que la rÃ©silience, associÃ©es Ã  la pandÃ©mie de la Covid-19 dans la RÃ©gion de l'Ouest, au Cameroun. La recherche a eu recours Ã  la mÃ©thodologie des enquÃªtes de santÃ© mentale en population gÃ©nÃ©rale. Elle s'est conformÃ©e aux dispositions Ã©thiques du protocole d'Helsinki. Les outils de collecte des donnÃ©es utilisÃ©es sont : l'Impact of Event Scale-Revised et la Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. Quatre cent-neuf sujets ont Ã©tÃ© recrutÃ©s, reprÃ©sentant un taux de rÃ©alisation de 106,5 %. 70,7 % des sujets ont prÃ©sentÃ© des symptÃ´mes de l'ESPT. Ces symptÃ´mes sont plus souvent lÃ©gers (40,9 %) ou modÃ©rÃ©s (25,6 %). La moyenne des scores enregistrÃ©s Ã  la CD-RISC est de 64,3, l'Ã©cart-type de 15,3 et le coefficient de variation de 24 %. Cette moyenne s'inscrit dans le deuxiÃ¨me quartile de la distribution, tÃ©moignant d'une rÃ©silience moyenne. La pandÃ©mie de la Covid-19 a un potentiel traumatogÃ¨ne non nÃ©gligeable, lequel affecte la santÃ© mentale des populations camerounaises. The emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic in Cameroon, as in Africa and around the world, was marked by a suddenness and unpredictability that fascinated the imagination. The considerable psychic and social repercussions of the pandemic mobilized a significant anguish of death. The sudden onset of the pandemic was followed by spectacular, high-profile deaths that fascinated the imagination, listing it in the order of traumatic events, provoking reactions of astonishment, flight and avoidance. The objective of this study is to determine the symptomatology of post-traumatic stress disorder, as well as the resilience, associated with the Covid-19 pandemic in the Western Region of Cameroon. The research was carried out following the model of general population mental health surveys. The availability of area frames (sampling) made it possible to opt for probabilistic calculations. First and second year master's students in clinical psychology from Dschang University were involved in data collection. They benefited from a two-day seminar on data collection techniques in the general population. The calculated sample size is 384 households. The anticipated response rate, set at 90%, made it possible to increase robustness and to anticipate a total sample of 424 households, spread over 3 districts of Bafoussam and Dschang, according to the choice previously made. The study followed the ethical provisions of the Helsinki Protocol. The data collection tools used are: the Impact of Event Scale-Revised and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. 409 subjects were recruited, representing a completion rate of 106.5%. 70.7% of subjects exhibited symptoms of PTSD. These symptoms are more often mild (40.9%) or moderate (25.6%). Women are more affected (73.7%) by PTSD than men (67.9%). In addition to sex and age, area of residence and marital status, appear to be significantly associated with symptoms of PTSD: subjects under 35 years of age have a significantly higher prevalence rate than those over 35;the rate of PTSD is significantly higher in subjects living in urban areas than in those living in rural areas;single subjects are more affected by PTSD (40.1%) than married subjects (26.7%). The average score recorded on the CD-RISC is 64.3, the standard deviation is 15.3 and the coefficient of variation is 24%. This average falls into the second quartile of the distribution, indicating average resilience. CD-RISC scores are not affected by gender, age, marital status, level of education, or occupational status. These characteristics are therefore not factors of resilience. The Covid-19 pandemic h s had a psychological impact in Cameroon which has made it a major psychosocial stressor. More than 6 in 10 people have symptoms of PTSD. But this symptomatology is often weak or moderate, testifying to an effective resilience, to balance the traumatic effects of the pandemic.

"Monthly Trends in Access to Care and Mental Health Services by Household Income Level During the COVID-19 Pandemic, United States, April: December 2020","Purpose: Since the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in March 2020, ~40% of U.S. adults have experienced delayed medical care. Rates of uninsurance, delayed care, and utilization of mental health services during the course of the pandemic have not been analyzed in detail. We examined monthly trends and disparities in access to care by household income levels in the United States. Methods: Using Census Bureau's nationally representative pooled 2020 Household Pulse Survey from April to December, 2020 (N=778,819), logistic regression models were used to analyze trends and inequalities in various access to care measures. Results: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the odds of being uninsured, having a delayed medical care due to pandemic, delayed care of something other than COVID-19, or delayed mental health care were, respectively, 5.54, 1.50, 1.85, and 2.18 times higher for adults with income &lt;$25,000, compared to those with incomes =$200,000, controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, housing tenure, region of residence, and survey month. Income inequities in mental health care widened over the course of the pandemic, while the probability of delayed mental health care increased for all income groups. Although the odds of taking prescription medication for mental health were higher for low-income adults, the odds of receiving mental health services were generally lower for lower income adults, controlling for all covariates. Conclusion: In light of our findings on persistent health care inequities during the pandemic, increased policy efforts are needed to improve access to care in low-income populations as an equitable COVID-19 recovery response.","Lee, Hyunjung, Singh, Gopal K.","https://doi.org/10.1089/heq.2021.0036","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Health Equity; 5(1):770-779, 2021.; Publication details: Health Equity; 5(1):770-779, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21874,""

"Psychological Impact of COVID-19 on Occupational Therapists: An Online Survey in Japan","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a severe psychological impact on frontline and second-line medical workers. However, few empirical reports have been published on its impact on occupational therapists. Clarifying the mental health status of occupational therapists is important to maintain care quality and prevent psychological problems in this population. To investigate the psychological impact of COVID-19 on Japanese occupational therapists in prefectures with and without severe pandemic-related restrictions and elucidate factors associated with psychological problems such as anxiety, depression, and insomnia. A cross-sectional online survey using region-stratified two-stage cluster sampling conducted May 28-31, 2020. The sample included 371 participants (63.1% women) in the prefectures under specific cautions (i.e., where residents were strictly advised to refrain from outings) and 1,312 in the prefectures without such cautions (61.9% women). The increase in workload due to the pandemic was significantly related to an increase in anxiety, depression, and insomnia, and an attempt to avoid talking face to face with others was significantly related to an increase in anxiety regardless of area. In prefectures under specific cautions as of May 25, 2020, the provision of sufficient information on COVID-19 by the workplace significantly reduced the risk of insomnia. In other prefectures, the provision of sufficient information significantly reduced the risk of depression. These results demonstrate the severe negative psychological impact of the increase in workload resulting from COVID-19 and suggest the importance of psychological support for occupational therapists, such as the provision of sufficient information by the workplace. What This Article Adds: This study highlights the importance of providing psychological support for occupational therapists worldwide.","Ishioka, Ito, Miyaguchi, Nakamura, Sawamura","https://doi.org/10.5014/ajot.2021.046813","20211115","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21877,""
"A qualitative assessment of factors affecting nursing home caregiving staff experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic","A large portion of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United States have occurred in nursing homes; however, current literature including the frontline perspective of staff working in nursing homes is limited. The objective of this qualitative assessment was to better understand what individual and facility level factors may have contributed to the impact of COVID-19 on Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs) and Environmental Services (EVS) staff working in nursing homes. Based on a simple random sample from the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), 7,520 facilities were emailed invitations requesting one CNA and/or one EVS staff member for participation in a voluntary focus group over Zoom. Facility characteristics were obtained via NHSN and publicly available sources; participant demographics were collected via SurveyMonkey during registration and polling during focus groups. Qualitative information was coded using NVIVO and Excel. Throughout April 2021, 23 focus groups including 110 participants from 84 facilities were conducted homogenous by participant role. Staffing problems were a recurring theme reported. Participants often cited the toll the pandemic took on their emotional well-being, describing increased stress, responsibilities, and time needed to complete their jobs. The lack of consistent and systematic guidance resulting in frequently changing infection prevention protocols was also reported across focus groups. Addressing concerns of low wages and lack of financial incentives may have the potential to attract and retain employees to help alleviate nursing home staff shortages. Additionally, access to mental health resources could help nursing home staff cope with the emotional burden of the COVID-19 pandemic. These frontline staff members provided invaluable insight and should be included in improvement efforts to support nursing homes recovering from the impact of COVID-19 as well as future pandemic planning.","Snyder, Anderson, White, Tavitian, Fike, Jones, Jacobs-Slifka, Stone, Sinkowitz-Cochran","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0260055","20211115","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21878,""
"The Psychology of Pandemics","This article reviews the current state of knowledge and promising new directions concerning the psychology of pandemics. Pandemics are disease outbreaks that spread globally. Historically, psychological factors have been neglected by researchers and health authorities despite evidence that pandemics are, to a large extent, psychological phenomena whereby beliefs and behaviors influence the spreading versus containment of infection. Psychological factors are important in determining (<i>a</i>) adherence to pandemic mitigation methods (e.g., adherence to social distancing), (<i>b</i>) pandemic-related social disruption (e.g., panic buying, racism, antilockdown protests), and (<i>c</i>) pandemic-related distress and related problems (e.g., anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, prolonged grief disorder). The psychology of pandemics has emerged as an important field of research and practice during the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As a scholarly discipline, the psychology of pandemics is fragmented and diverse, encompassing various psychological subspecialties and allied disciplines, but is vital for shaping clinical practice and public health guidelines for COVID-19 and future pandemics. Expected final online publication date for the <i>Annual Review of Clinical Psychology</i>, Volume 18 is May 2022. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates.","Taylor","https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-072720-020131","20211115","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21879,""
"The effects of emotional valence and perceived life stress on recalling personal experiences and envisioning future events","Although it is understood that engaging in mental time travel to remember the past and imagine the future relies on similar cognitive processes, there are important differences. Notably, there is evidence that emotional valence differently affects how past and future events are accessed. Here, we explored the differential effect of emotional valence on past and future event generation in the context of personal stress. This is based on findings that an individual's current life stress -a metric of mental health-alters emotional mental time travel. In an online experiment conducted during the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, 421 participants generated specific past and future events to a series of positive and negative cues and then rated the likelihood that the event would occur in the future, the emotion conveyed in the event, and the difficulty of generating the event. Participants also completed a questionnaire estimating current life stress. We found a general bias toward generating specific positive future events that was not present when generating past events. Additionally, we found a small but significant effect of stress levels on ratings of difficulty and likelihood for events generated in response to positive cues. These results provide new insight into how an individual's current stress selectively targets the way positive life events are perceived.

"Quality of life and other patient-reported outcomes in adult Lebanese patients with type 2 diabetes during COVID-19 pandemic","Several studies have shown that COVID-19 pandemic has a negative impact on type 2 diabetic mellitus (T2DM) patients' quality of life (QoL). However, very few studies were performed in Middle Eastern countries. The aim of the current study was to assess, the QoL and diabetes-specific QoL, treatment satisfaction and psychological distress of Lebanese patients with T2DMs using: the Audit of Diabetes-Dependent Quality of Life (ADDQoL), Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire status version (DTSQs) and Kessler 10 (K10) questionnaires and to compare results to those obtained during the pre-COVID-19 period. 461 patients with T2DM participated in the study; 52.6% men, 47.4% women; median age 59Ã‚Â years old. The respective median ADDQoL and DTSQs scores were - 2.2 (interval interquartile range (IQR) - 3.9, - 0.8) (range from - 9 maximum negative impact toÃ¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°3 maximum positive impact) and 30(IQR22-36) (range from 0 maximum dissatisfaction to 36 maximum satisfaction). K10 median score was 26(IQR18-35) (range from minimum score of 10 indicating no distress to maximum score of 50 indicating severe distress). Rural dwelling, lack of exercise, current smoking, diabetic complications, injectable diabetes treatment, and previous COVID-19 infection were all associated with significantly worse ADDQoL, DTSQs, and K10 score indicating greater distress. A significant worsening of ADDQoL scores followed onset of the pandemic with no significant change in DTSQs scores. During the COVID-19 pandemic, T2DM Lebanese patients experienced more negative impact of diabetes on QoL and mental health. Those infected with COVID-19 also reported worse QoL, treatment satisfaction and mental health. This highlights the need for community and individual support.","Naous, Boulos, Sleilaty, Achkar, GannagÃƒÂ©-Yared","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40618-021-01701-6","20211115","Lebanon; Mental health; Quality of life; Treatment satisfaction; Type 2 diabetes","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21881,""
"Acceptability, Feasibility, and Quality of Telehealth for Adolescent Health Care Delivery During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional Study of Patient and Family Experiences","Data regarding the acceptability, feasibility, and quality of telehealth among adolescents and young adults (AYA) and their parents and caregivers (caregivers) are lacking. The aim of this study was to assess the noninferiority of telehealth versus in-person visits by comparing acceptability with respect to efficiency, effectiveness, equity, patient-centeredness, and confidentiality. Cross-sectional web-based surveys were sent to caregivers and AYA following video visits within an Adolescent Medicine subspecialty clinic in May-July 2020. Proportions of AYA and caregivers who rated telehealth as noninferior were compared using chi-squared tests. Feasibility was assessed via items measuring technical difficulties. Deductive thematic analysis using the Institute of Medicine dimensions of health care quality was used to code open-ended question responses. Survey response rates were 20.5% (55/268) for AYA and 21.8% (123/563) for caregivers. The majority of the respondents were White cisgender females. Most AYA and caregivers rated telehealth as noninferior to in-person visits with respect to confidentiality, communication, medication management, and mental health care. A higher proportion of AYA compared to caregivers found telehealth inferior with respect to confidentiality (11/51, 22% vs 3/118, 2.5%, P&lt;.001). One-quarter (14/55) of the AYA patients and 31.7% (39/123) of the caregivers reported technical difficulties. The dominant themes in the qualitative data included advantages of telehealth for efficiency and equity of health care delivery. However, respondents' concerns included reduced safety and effectiveness of care, particularly for patients with eating disorders, owing to lack of hands-on examinations, collection of vital signs, and laboratory testing. Telehealth was highly acceptable among AYA and caregivers. Future optimization should include improving privacy, ameliorating technical difficulties, and standardizing at-home methods of obtaining patient data to assure patient safety.","Wood, Pickel, Phillips, Baber, Chuo, Maleki, Faust, Petsis, Apple, Dowshen, Schwartz","https://doi.org/10.2196/32708","20211115","COVID-19; acceptability; adolescent; cross-sectional; efficiency; equity; experience; feasibility; patient experience; survey; teenager; telehealth; telemedicine; young adult","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21882,""
"COVID-19 mental health impact among children with early brain injury and associated conditions","This study describes the impact of COVID-19 among a clinical research sample of children with early brain injury and associated conditions. Between March 2020 and March 2021, 64 children and their parents participated. Children ranged in age between 3 and 14Ã‚Â years (<i>M</i> =Ã‚Â 6Ã‚Â years, 3Ã‚Â months; <i>SDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â </i>2Ã‚Â years, 4Ã‚Â months) with a range of diagnoses (i.e., neonatal stroke, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), congenital heart disease (CHD) and preterm birth (&lt;32Ã‚Â weeks)). The abbreviated CoRonavIrus Health Impact Survey (CRISIS) was completed by parents as part of their child's routine intake for neuropsychological services. Questions included COVID-19 specific ratings of child mental health impact, child, and parent stressors, with open-ended questions regarding negative and positive COVID-19 related changes. Over 40% of parents described moderate to extreme influence of COVID-19 on their child's mental health. Common child stressors reported included restrictions on leaving the home and social isolation. Among parents, the most common stress reported was caring for their child's education and daily activities. Children's mental health impact was associated with social isolation, parent mental health, COVID-19 economic concern, and number of siblings in the home.

"The Impact of Emotion and Government Trust on Individuals' Risk Information Seeking and Avoidance during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-country Comparison","This study examines the emotional mechanisms of how public trust in the governments' actions to address the COVID-19 pandemic shapes individuals' risk information-seeking and avoidance. To make cross-cultural comparisons, we conducted a multi-country survey early in the pandemic in South Korea, the United States (US) and Singapore. The results suggest that trust was negatively related to fear, anger, sadness and anxiety, and positively related to hope. These emotions were significant mediators of the effect of trust on information seeking and avoidance, except for anger on avoidance. Importantly, the indirect effects of trust in government varied by country. Fear was a stronger mediator between trust and information seeking in South Korea than in the US. In contrast, sadness and anger played more prominent mediating roles in Singapore than in South Korea. This study offers theoretical insights into better understanding the roles of discrete emotions in forming information behaviors. The findings of this study also inform communication strategies that seek to navigate trust in managing pandemics that impact multiple nations.","Ahn, Kim, Kahlor, Atkinson, Noh","https://doi.org/10.1080/10810730.2021.1999348","20211115","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21884,""
"Even Superheroes Need Rest: A Guide to Facilitating Recovery from Work for Health-care Workers during COVID-19 and beyond","The COVID-19 pandemic burdens health-care workers (HCWs) worldwide. Amid high-stress conditions and unprecedented needs for crisis management, organizations face the grand challenge of supporting the mental health and well-being of their HCWs. The current literature on mental health and well-being primarily focuses on improving personal resilience among HCWs. However, this puts the responsibility for coping with COVID-19-related stress almost fully on the individual. This chapter discusses an important alternative framing of this issue - how health-care organizations (HCOs) can facilitate recovery from work processes (i.e., returning to a baseline level by engaging in nonwork activities after work) for their workers. Based on a narrative review of the occupational health psychology literature, we provide practical strategies for supporting the four key recovery experiences of detachment, control, mastery, and relaxation, as well as present general recommendations about how to promote recovery. These strategies can help HCOs facing the grand challenge of sustaining worker well-being and functioning during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as during future pandemics and for workers facing high work pressure in general.","Hefner, Nembhard, Fleuren, Stephenson, Sullivan, Raj, Tietschert, Sriharan, Lai, DePuccio, Thomas, McAlearney","https://doi.org/10.1108/S1474-823120210000020010","20211115","COVID-19 pandemic; Recovery from work; health-care workers; occupational health psychology; personal resilience; recovery experiences","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21885,""
"Toxic behavior in organizations and organizational entropy: a 4th industrial revolution phenomenon?","The increasing prevalence of toxic leadership in business organizations can be at least partly attributed to increasing pressures emanating from the 4th industrial revolution. Pressures on business leaders from increased competition, environmental awareness, commitment to social purpose, and speed and spread of data communications have been made possible by computerisation and automation which have reached increased dominion during the COVID-19 pandemic. These pressures have created enormous challenges for organizational sustainability and survival. Competition to maintain market prominence and profitability and an excellent environmental awareness reputation has induced some leaders to resort to toxic behavior which has spread to employees driven to achieve specific organizational goals. For example, the unbalanced pursuit by leaders of Volkswagen and Boeing to maintain profits and market leadership resulted in a toxic climate that led to illicit employee behavior and affected their mental health, and the extreme purpose orientation of leadership of the Boy Shop promoted unsustainable employee practices arising from the singular and fixated pursuit of a strategic goal. Digital technology also has eroded employee leisure activity and privacy to the extent that many are on duty 24/7. Employee burnout and mental illness have also been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic through employee isolation and the increasing dependence on technology. The purpose of the paper is to present eclectic examples of toxic behavior and its effects on organizational sustainability. The commentary indicates HRM's role in identifying and remedying destructive effects of toxic leadership before they take root in a post-COVID-19 world.","Coldwell","https://doi.org/10.1007/s43546-021-00079-0","20211115","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21886,""
"Psychosocial Health and Physical Activity in People With Major Depression in the Context of COVID-19","<b>Introduction:</b> Major depression is a psychiatric disease associated with physical inactivity, which in turn affects mental and physical health. A randomized controlled trial is being implemented to facilitate physical activity in people with major depression. In March 2020, Swiss state authorities temporarily legislated a lockdown to contain the Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), which influenced health, behavior and research. The aim of this study was to find out whether data gathered before and during/after the lockdown among in-patients with major depression differ with regard to psychosocial health, physical activity and related attitudes and to establish whether baseline data have been affected by the lockdown. <b>Methods:</b> This is a cross-sectional analysis within a randomized controlled trial. Physically inactive, adult in-patients diagnosed with major depression were recruited from four Swiss psychiatric clinics between January 2019 and December 2020. Psychosocial health was measured with questionnaires pertaining to stress, sleep and health-related quality of life. Physical activity was measured with the Simple Physical Activity Questionnaire. Explicit attitudes were measured with seven questionnaires pertaining to physical activity-related motivation and volition. Implicit attitudes toward physical activity were captured with a single target implicit association test. <b>Results:</b> The sample consisted of 165 participants (<i>n</i> = 119 before lockdown, <i>n</i> = 46 during/after lockdown). No statistically significant differences were found between in-patients with major depression assessed before and during/after the COVID-19 lockdown with regard to psychosocial health (stress, <i>p</i> = 0.51; sleep, <i>p</i> = 0.70; physical component of health-related quality of life, <i>p</i> = 0.55; mental component of health-related quality of life, <i>p</i> = 0.64), self-reported physical activity (<i>p</i> = 0.16) and explicit as well as implicit attitudes toward physical activity (<i>p</i> = 0.94). Hence, the COVID-19-induced lockdown seems not to have led to group differences. <b>Conclusion:</b> Baseline data gathered in in-patients suffering from major depression who are physically inactive upon admission to in-patient treatment in Switzerland seem to be unaffected by the COVID-19-induced lockdown. To assess changes in said population regarding psychosocial health and physical activity patterns over time, longitudinal data are needed.","Cody, Kreppke, Beck, Donath, Eckert, Imboden, Hatzinger, Holsboer-Trachsler, Lang, Ludyga, Mans, Mikoteit, Oswald, Rogausch, Schweinfurth, Zahner, Faude, Gerber","https://doi.org/10.3389/fspor.2021.685117","20211115","COVID-19; attitudes; depression; lockdown; physical activity; psychosocial health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21887,""
"The Development, Implementation, and Preliminary Outcomes of a 5-Minute Mindfulness Program to Improve Well-Being and Increase Connection Across a University Campus","In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, people worldwide have experienced increased anxiety, depression, and loneliness and decreased well-being. Mindfulness has been shown to enhance well-being across a variety of settings and for a variety of populations. We developed and implemented a digital mindfulness program called Mindful Moment across a US university system as an innovative wellness resource to facilitate well-being and sense of connection among faculty, staff, and students. Attendees engaged in 5-minute live guided mindfulness sessions twice per week. This paper outlines our program evaluation over the course of fourÃ‚Â months. A total of 236 individuals attended between one to 30 mindful moment sessions. Data were collected on attendance, perception of the program's impact on attendee well-being and connectedness to the community, and feedback for future program development. Data collection included standardized stress and belongingness measures in addition to qualitative data related to perceived impact and reasons for attending. Students, faculty, and staff who attended Mindful Moment and completed surveys reported that the program was easy to access, noted immediate benefits including decreased stress and improved well-being, and some attendees reported increased feelings of connection with the community. The present paper is exploratory in nature, a first step to assessing feasibility and overall impact. Future research assessing the impact of digital mindfulness programs can be improved by including a comparison group, additional standardized assessment, and a pre-post design, allowing for stronger conclusions to be drawn regarding efficacy and generalizability.","Nicksic Sigmon, Bam, Moldow, Beary, Wakefield, Boeldt","https://doi.org/10.1007/s41347-021-00232-4","20211115","COVID-19; Community; Connection; Digital wellness; Mindfulness; Well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21888,""
"COVID-Related Victimization, Racial Bias and Employment and Housing Disruption Increase Mental Health Risk Among US Asian, Black and Latinx Adults","<b>Background:</b> The mental health of racial/ethnic minorities in the U.S. has been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study examined the extent to which disruptions in employment and housing, coronavirus-specific forms of victimization and racial bias independently and conjointly contributed to mental health risk among Asian, Black, and Latinx adults in the United States during the pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> This study reports on data from 401 Asian, Black, and Latinx adults (age 18-72) who participated in a larger national online survey conducted from October 2020-June 2021, Measures included financial and health information, housing disruptions and distress in response to employment changes, coronavirus related victimization distress and perceived increases in racial bias, depression and anxiety. <b>Results:</b> Asian participants had significantly higher levels of COVID-related victimization distress and perceived increases in racial bias than Black and Latinx. Young adults (&lt;26 years old) were more vulnerable to depression, anxiety, and coronavirus victimization distress than older respondents. Having at least one COVID-related health risk, distress in response to changes in employment and housing disruptions, pandemic related victimization distress and perceived increases in racial bias were positively and significantly related to depression and anxiety. Structural equation modeling indicated COVID-related increases in racial bias mediated the effect of COVID-19 related victimization distress on depression and anxiety. <b>Conclusions:</b> COVID-19 has created new pathways to mental health disparities among racial/ethnic minorities in the U.S. by exacerbating existing structural and societal inequities linked to race. Findings highlight the necessity of mental health services sensitive to specific challenges in employment and housing and social bias experienced by people of color during the current and future health crises.","Fisher, Tao, Liu, Giorgi, Curtis","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.772236","20211115","COVID-19; discrimination; employment; housing; mental health; racial bias; victimization distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21889,""
"Burnout Among Healthcare Workers in the COVID 19 Era: A Review of the Existing Literature","In the current period of global public health crisis due to the COVID-19, healthcare workers are more exposed to physical and mental exhaustion - burnout - for the torment of difficult decisions, the pain of losing patients and colleagues, and the risk of infection, for themselves and their families. The very high number of cases and deaths, and the probable future ""waves"" raise awareness of these challenging working conditions and the need to address burnout by identifying possible solutions. Measures have been suggested to prevent or reduce burnout at individual level (physical activity, balanced diet, good sleep hygiene, family support, meaningful relationships, reflective practices and small group discussions), organizational level (blame-free environments for sharing experiences and advices, broad involvement in management decisions, multi-disciplinary psychosocial support teams, safe areas to withdraw quickly from stressful situations, adequate time planning, social support), and cultural level (involvement of healthcare workers in the development, implementation, testing, and evaluation of measures against burnout). Although some progress has been made in removing the barrier to psychological support to cope with work-related stress, a cultural change is still needed for the stigma associated with mental illness. The key recommendation is to address the challenges that the emergency poses and to aggregate health, well-being and behavioral science expertise through long term researches with rigorous planning and reporting to drive the necessary cultural change and the improvement of public health systems.","Leo, Sabina, Tumolo, Bodini, Ponzini, Sabato, Mincarone","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.750529","20211115","COVID-19; burnout; healthcare workers; mental health; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21890,""
"A longitudinal study of mental health before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Syrian refugees","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased anxiety and depression around the world. Refugees may be particularly vulnerable to the mental health effects of the pandemic because of their higher rates of mental health disorders, trauma histories, and daily stressors. This study used data from a controlled trial of a brief behavioural intervention for psychological distress in Syrian refugees living in Azraq Camp in Jordan to examine the psychological effects of the pandemic on refugee mental health. A total of 410 participants were randomized to either the intervention or control arms of the trial and were assessed at baseline and 3-month follow-up. Half the sample (199; 48.5%) completed their 3-month follow-up assessment after the pandemic restrictions began in Jordan and 211 (51.5%) completed the assessment prior to the pandemic. Refugees were independently assessed for symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression at baseline and follow-up, and pandemic-related worries were assessed at follow-up for those who completed their assessment during the pandemic. The most commonly reported worries were economic difficulties (82.4%), shortage of essential supplies (71.3%), and infecting others (59.7%) or themselves (51.9%). Refugees who were assessed during the pandemic had less severe PTSD symptoms than those assessed prior to the pandemic. Significant predictors of pandemic-related worries were lower levels of depression prior to the pandemic and greater anxiety during the pandemic. These findings highlight the specific needs of refugees during the pandemic and suggest that pre-existing mental health issues may not necessarily be the key risk factors for who will experience major mental health issues or worries during the pandemic. <b>Antecedentes</b>: La ansiedad y la depresiÃƒÂ³n alrededor del mundo se han incrementado como consecuencia de la pandemia por la COVID-19. Los refugiados pueden ser particularmente vulnerables a los efectos de la pandemia sobre la salud mental a sus tasas mÃƒÂ¡s altas de trastornos de salud mental, de antecedentes de trauma y de estresores diarios.<b>Objetivos</b>: Este estudio empleÃƒÂ³ los datos del ensayo controlado de una intervenciÃƒÂ³n conductual breve para la angustia psicolÃƒÂ³gica en refugiados sirios que vivÃƒÂ­an en el campo Azraq en Jordania. Se buscÃƒÂ³ evaluar los efectos psicolÃƒÂ³gicos de la pandemia sobre la salud mental de los refugiados.<b>MÃƒÂ©todo</b>: Un total de 410 participantes fueron asignados aleatoriamente, bien al grupo de intervenciÃƒÂ³n o bien al grupo de control del ensayo, y fueron evaluados al inicio y a los 3 meses de seguimiento. La mitad de la muestra (199; 48,5%) completÃƒÂ³ la evaluaciÃƒÂ³n a los 3 meses de seguimiento despuÃƒÂ©s de que comenzaran las restricciones de la pandemia en Jordania, mientras que 211 (51,5%) completaron esta evaluaciÃƒÂ³n antes de la pandemia. Los refugiados fueron evaluados de forma independiente para detectar sÃƒÂ­ntomas del TEPT, de la ansiedad y de la depresiÃƒÂ³n al inicio y en el seguimiento. Las preocupaciones relacionadas a la pandemia se evaluaron durante el seguimiento en aquellos que completaron su evaluaciÃƒÂ³n durante la pandemia.<b>Resultados</b>: Las preocupaciones mÃƒÂ¡s comÃƒÂºnmente reportadas fueron las dificultades econÃƒÂ³micas (82,4%), la escasez de suministros esenciales (71,3%) y la infecciÃƒÂ³n de otros (59,7%) o de ellos mismos (51,9%). Los refugiados que fueron evaluados durante la pandemia tenÃƒÂ­an sÃƒÂ­ntomas de TEPT menos severos que aquellos que fueron evaluados antes de la pandemia. Los predictores significativos de las preocupaciones relacionados con la pandemia fueron niveles mÃƒÂ¡s bajos de depresiÃƒÂ³n antes de la pandemia y mayor ansiedad durante la pandemia.<b>Conclusiones</b>: Estos hallazgos destacan las necesidades especificas de los refugiados durante la pandemia y sugieren que los problemas de salud mental preexistentes no necesariamente pueden ser los factores de riesgo clave para aquellos que experimentarÃƒÂ¡n los principales problemas de salud mental o preocupaciones durante la pandemia. <b>Ã¨Æ’Å’Ã¦â„¢Â¯</b>: COVID-19 Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¥Â¯Â¼Ã¨â€¡Â´Ã¥â€¦Â¨Ã¤Â¸â€“Ã§â€¢Å’Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¦Å â€˜Ã©Æ’ÂÃ¥Â¢Å¾Ã¥Å Â Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ©Å¡Â¾Ã¦Â°â€˜Ã¥ÂÂ¯Ã¨Æ’Â½Ã§â€°Â¹Ã¥Ë†Â«Ã¥Â®Â¹Ã¦Ëœâ€œÃ¥Ââ€”Ã¥Ë†Â°Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂ, Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ¤Â»â€“Ã¤Â»Â¬Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Â²Â¾Ã§Â¥Å¾Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã©Å¡Å“Ã§Â¢Â, Ã¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã¥ÂÂ²Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¦â€”Â¥Ã¥Â¸Â¸Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¦Â¿â‚¬Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Ââ€˜Ã§â€Å¸Ã§Å½â€¡Ã¨Â¾Æ’Ã©Â«ËœÃ£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§â€ºÂ®Ã§Å¡â€ž</b>:Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¤Â½Â¿Ã§â€Â¨Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã©Â¡Â¹Ã¦ÂÂ¥Ã¨â€¡ÂªÃ¥Â±â€¦Ã¤Â½ÂÃ¥Å“Â¨Ã§ÂºÂ¦Ã¦â€”Â¦ Azraq Ã©Å¡Â¾Ã¦Â°â€˜Ã¨ÂÂ¥Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Ââ„¢Ã¥Ë†Â©Ã¤ÂºÅ¡Ã©Å¡Â¾Ã¦Â°â€˜Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥â€ºÂ°Ã¦â€°Â°Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Â®â‚¬Ã§Å¸Â­Ã¨Â¡Å’Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ¥Â¹Â²Ã©Â¢â€žÃ¥Â¯Â¹Ã§â€¦Â§Ã¨Â¯â€¢Ã©ÂªÅ’Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦â€¢Â°Ã¦ÂÂ®, Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã¨â‚¬Æ’Ã¦Å¸Â¥Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã©Å¡Â¾Ã¦Â°â€˜Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â³â€¢</b>:Ã¦â‚¬Â»Ã¥â€¦Â± 410 Ã¥ÂÂÃ¥Ââ€šÃ¤Â¸Å½Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¨Â¢Â«Ã©Å¡ÂÃ¦Å“ÂºÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã©â€¦ÂÃ¥Ë†Â°Ã¨Â¯â€¢Ã©ÂªÅ’Ã¥Â¹Â²Ã©Â¢â€žÃ§Â»â€žÃ¦Ë†â€“Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã§â€¦Â§Ã§Â»â€ž, Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¥Å¸ÂºÃ§ÂºÂ¿Ã¥â€™Å’ 3 Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ¦Å“Ë†Ã§Å¡â€žÃ©Å¡ÂÃ¨Â®Â¿Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¨Â¿â€ºÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¤Â¼Â°Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¥ÂÅ Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦Â Â·Ã¦Å“Â¬ (199; 48.5%) Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã§ÂºÂ¦Ã¦â€”Â¦Ã¥Â¼â‚¬Ã¥Â§â€¹Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã©â„¢ÂÃ¥Ë†Â¶Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¥Â®Å’Ã¦Ë†ÂÃ¤Âºâ€ Ã¥â€¦Â¶ 3 Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ¦Å“Ë†Ã§Å¡â€žÃ©Å¡ÂÃ¨Â®Â¿Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¤Â¼Â°, 211 (51.5%) Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¤Â¹â€¹Ã¥â€°ÂÃ¥Â®Å’Ã¦Ë†ÂÃ¤Âºâ€ Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¤Â¼Â°Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Å“Â¨Ã¥Å¸ÂºÃ§ÂºÂ¿Ã¥â€™Å’Ã©Å¡ÂÃ¨Â®Â¿Ã¦â€”Â¶Ã§â€¹Â¬Ã§Â«â€¹Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¤Â¼Â°Ã©Å¡Â¾Ã¦Â°â€˜Ã§Å¡â€ž PTSD, Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¦Å â€˜Ã©Æ’ÂÃ§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶, Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã©Å¡ÂÃ¨Â®Â¿Ã¦â€”Â¶Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¤Â¼Â°Ã©â€šÂ£Ã¤Âºâ€ºÃ¥Å“Â¨Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¥Â®Å’Ã¦Ë†ÂÃ¨Â¯â€žÃ¤Â¼Â°Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¦â€¹â€¦Ã¥Â¿Â§Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“</b>:Ã¦Å“â‚¬Ã¥Â¸Â¸Ã¦Å Â¥Ã¥â€˜Å Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦â€¹â€¦Ã¥Â¿Â§Ã¦ËœÂ¯Ã§Â»ÂÃ¦ÂµÅ½Ã¥â€ºÂ°Ã©Å¡Â¾ (82.4%), Ã¥Â¿â€¦Ã©Å“â‚¬Ã¥â€œÂÃ§Å¸Â­Ã§Â¼Âº (71.3%), Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¦â€žÅ¸Ã¦Å¸â€œÃ¤Â»â€“Ã¤ÂºÂº (59.7%) Ã¦Ë†â€“Ã¨â€¡ÂªÃ¥Â·Â± (51.9%)Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¤Â¼Â°Ã§Å¡â€žÃ©Å¡Â¾Ã¦Â°â€˜Ã§Å¡â€ž PTSD Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã¤Â¸ÂÃ¥Â¦â€šÃ§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¤Â¹â€¹Ã¥â€°ÂÃ¨Â¯â€žÃ¤Â¼Â°Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤ÂºÂºÃ¤Â¸Â¥Ã©â€¡ÂÃ£â‚¬â€šÃ§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¦â€¹â€¦Ã¥Â¿Â§Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦ËœÂ¾Ã¨â€˜â€”Ã©Â¢â€žÃ¦Âµâ€¹Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â Ã¦ËœÂ¯Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¤Â¹â€¹Ã¥â€°ÂÃ¨Â¾Æ’Ã¤Â½Å½Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦Å â€˜Ã©Æ’ÂÃ§Â¨â€¹Ã¥ÂºÂ¦Ã¥â€™Å’Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¨Â¾Æ’Ã©Â«ËœÃ§Å¡â€žÃ§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¦Â°Â´Ã¥Â¹Â³Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¨Â®Âº</b>:Ã¨Â¿â„¢Ã¤Âºâ€ºÃ¥Ââ€˜Ã§Å½Â°Ã¥Â¼ÂºÃ¨Â°Æ’Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã©Å¡Â¾Ã¦Â°â€˜Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§â€°Â¹Ã¥Â®Å¡Ã©Å“â‚¬Ã¦Â±â€š, Ã¨Â¡Â¨Ã¦ËœÅ½Ã¥â€¦Ë†Ã¥â€°ÂÃ¥Â­ËœÃ¥Å“Â¨Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã©â€”Â®Ã©Â¢ËœÃ¥ÂÂ¯Ã¨Æ’Â½Ã¤Â¸ÂÃ¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¥Â®Å¡Ã¦ËœÂ¯Ã¨Â°ÂÃ¥Â°â€ Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã©Ââ€¡Ã¥Ë†Â°Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¥Â¤Â§Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã©â€”Â®Ã©Â¢ËœÃ¦Ë†â€“Ã¦â€¹â€¦Ã¥Â¿Â§Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥â€¦Â³Ã©â€Â®Ã©Â£Å½Ã©â„¢Â©Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â Ã£â‚¬â€š.","Akhtar, Bawaneh, Awwad, Al-Hayek, Sijbrandij, Cuijpers, Bryant","https://doi.org/10.1080/20008198.2021.1991651","20211115","COVID-19; Pandemic; Syria; mental health; refugee camp","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21891,""
"Impacts of morally distressing experiences on the mental health of Canadian health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","Research is urgently needed to understand health care workers' (HCWs') experiences of moral-ethical dilemmas encountered throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and their associations with organizational perceptions and personal well-being. This research is important to prevent long-term moral and psychological distress and to ensure that workers can optimally provide health services. Evaluate associations between workplace experiences during COVID-19, moral distress, and the psychological well-being of Canadian HCWs. A total of 1362 French- and English-speaking Canadian HCWs employed during the COVID-19 pandemic were recruited to participate in an online survey. Participants completed measures reflecting moral distress, perceptions of organizational response to the pandemic, burnout, and symptoms of psychological disorders, including depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Structural equation modelling showed that when organizational predictors were considered together, resource adequacy, positive work life impact, and ethical work environment negatively predicted severity of moral distress, whereas COVID-19 risk perception positively predicted severity of moral distress. Moral distress also significantly and positively predicted symptoms of depression, anxiety, PTSD, and burnout. Our findings highlight an urgent need for HCW organizations to implement strategies designed to prevent long-term moral and psychological distress within the workplace. Ensuring availability of adequate resources, reducing HCW risk of contracting COVID-19, providing organizational support regarding individual priorities, and upholding ethical considerations are crucial to reducing severity of moral distress in HCWs. <b>Antecedentes</b>: Se necesita con urgencia investigaciones para comprender las experiencias de los dilemas ÃƒÂ©ticos y morales que los trabajadores de la salud encontraron durante la pandemia de la COVID-19 y su asociaciÃƒÂ³n con las percepciones de la organizaciÃƒÂ³n y el bienestar personal. Esta investigaciÃƒÂ³n es importante para prevenir la angustia moral y psicolÃƒÂ³gica a largo plazo y para asegurar que los trabajadores de la salud puedan proveer de manera ÃƒÂ³ptima los servicios de salud.<b>Objetivo</b>: Evaluar la asociaciÃƒÂ³n entre las experiencias en el lugar de trabajo durante la COVID-19, la angustia moral y el bienestar psicolÃƒÂ³gico de los trabajadores de salud canadienses.<b>MÃƒÂ©todos</b>: Se reclutÃƒÂ³ a un total de 1362 trabajadores de salud canadienses, que hablaban francÃƒÂ©s e inglÃƒÂ©s y que fueron contratados durante la pandemia de la COVID-19, para participar en un cuestionario en lÃƒÂ­nea. Los participantes completaron mediciones que reflejaban la angustia moral, la percepciÃƒÂ³n de la respuesta de la organizaciÃƒÂ³n a la pandemia, el <i>burnout</i> y los sÃƒÂ­ntomas de trastornos psicolÃƒÂ³gicos, que incluÃƒÂ­an a la depresiÃƒÂ³n, a la ansiedad y al trastorno de estrÃƒÂ©s postraumÃƒÂ¡tico (TEPT).<b>Resultados</b>: El modelo de ecuaciones estructurales mostrÃƒÂ³ que cuando los predictores de la organizaciÃƒÂ³n se consideraban en conjunto Ã¢â‚¬â€œ los recursos adecuados, el impacto positivo en la vida laboral y un ambiente de trabajo ÃƒÂ©tico Ã¢â‚¬â€œ, predijeron negativamente la gravedad de la angustia moral, mientras que la percepciÃƒÂ³n del riesgo de contraer la COVID-19 predijo positivamente la gravedad de la angustia moral. La angustia moral tambiÃƒÂ©n predijo de manera significativa y positiva los sÃƒÂ­ntomas de la depresiÃƒÂ³n, la ansiedad, el TEPT y el <i>burnout</i>.<b>Conclusiones</b>: Nuestros hallazgos resaltan la urgente necesidad de que las organizaciones de trabajadores de salud implementen estrategias diseÃƒÂ±adas para prevenir la angustia moral y psicolÃƒÂ³gica a largo plazo en el lugar de trabajo. El asegurar la disponibilidad de los recursos adecuados, el reducir el riesgo de que los trabajadores de salud contraigan la COVID-19, el proveer un soporte organizacional adecuado segÃƒÂºn las prioridades individuales y el respetar las consideraciones ÃƒÂ©ticas son fundamentales para reducir la gravedad de la angustia moral en los trabajadores de salud. <b>Ã¨Æ’Å’Ã¦â„¢Â¯</b>:Ã¤ÂºÅ¸Ã©Å“â‚¬Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¨Â§Â£Ã¥ÂÂ«Ã§â€Å¸Ã¤Â¿ÂÃ¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥Â·Â¥Ã¤Â½Å“Ã¨â‚¬â€¦ (HCW) Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¦â€¢Â´Ã¤Â¸Âª COVID-19 Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã©Ââ€¡Ã¥Ë†Â°Ã§Å¡â€žÃ©Ââ€œÃ¥Â¾Â·Ã¤Â¼Â¦Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥â€ºÂ°Ã¥Â¢Æ’Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Â»ÂÃ¥Å½â€ , Ã¥ÂÅ Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã§Â»â€žÃ§Â»â€¡Ã¨Â§â€šÃ¥Â¿ÂµÃ¥â€™Å’Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ¤ÂºÂºÃ¥Â¹Â¸Ã§Â¦ÂÃ¦â€žÅ¸Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥â€¦Â³Ã¨Ââ€Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Å“Â¬Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¤ÂºÅ½Ã©Â¢â€žÃ©ËœÂ²Ã©â€¢Â¿Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©Ââ€œÃ¥Â¾Â·Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥â€ºÂ°Ã¦â€°Â°Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã§Â¡Â®Ã¤Â¿ÂÃ¥Â·Â¥Ã¤Â½Å“Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¨Æ’Â½Ã¥Â¤Å¸Ã¦Å“â‚¬Ã¥Â¥Â½Ã¥Å“Â°Ã¦ÂÂÃ¤Â¾â€ºÃ¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã¦Å“ÂÃ¥Å Â¡Ã©ÂÅ¾Ã¥Â¸Â¸Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¦ÂÃ£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§â€ºÂ®Ã§Å¡â€ž</b>:Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¤Â¼Â°Ã¥Å Â Ã¦â€¹Â¿Ã¥Â¤Â§Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ§Å¡â€ž COVID-19 Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¥Â·Â¥Ã¤Â½Å“Ã¥Å“ÂºÃ¦â€°â‚¬Ã§Â»ÂÃ¥Å½â€ , Ã©Ââ€œÃ¥Â¾Â·Ã¥â€ºÂ°Ã¦â€°Â°Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã¤Â¹â€¹Ã©â€”Â´Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥â€¦Â³Ã¨Ââ€Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â³â€¢</b>:Ã¥â€¦Â±Ã¦â€¹â€ºÃ¥â€¹Å¸Ã¤Âºâ€  1362 Ã¥ÂÂÃ¥Å“Â¨ COVID-19 Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¥Ââ€”Ã©â€ºâ€¡Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¨Â®Â²Ã¦Â³â€¢Ã¨Â¯Â­Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¨â€¹Â±Ã¨Â¯Â­Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Å Â Ã¦â€¹Â¿Ã¥Â¤Â§ HCW Ã¥Ââ€šÃ¤Â¸Å½Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã§ÂºÂ¿Ã¨Â°Æ’Ã¦Å¸Â¥Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Ââ€šÃ¤Â¸Å½Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¥Â®Å’Ã¦Ë†ÂÃ¤Âºâ€ Ã¥ÂÂÃ¦ËœÂ Ã©Ââ€œÃ¥Â¾Â·Ã¥â€ºÂ°Ã¦â€°Â°, Ã§Â»â€žÃ§Â»â€¡Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦, Ã¥â‚¬Â¦Ã¦â‚¬Â Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã©Å¡Å“Ã§Â¢ÂÃ§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶ (Ã¥Å’â€¦Ã¦â€¹Â¬Ã¦Å â€˜Ã©Æ’Â, Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¦Â¿â‚¬Ã©Å¡Å“Ã§Â¢Â (PTSD)) Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Å“â€¹Ã¦Â³â€¢Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦Âµâ€¹Ã©â€¡ÂÃ£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“</b>:Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾â€žÃ¦â€“Â¹Ã§Â¨â€¹Ã¦Â¨Â¡Ã¥Å¾â€¹Ã¨Â¡Â¨Ã¦ËœÅ½, Ã¥Â½â€œÃ¥ÂÅ’Ã¦â€”Â¶Ã¨â‚¬Æ’Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã§Â»â€žÃ§Â»â€¡Ã©Â¢â€žÃ¦Âµâ€¹Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â Ã¦â€”Â¶, Ã¨Âµâ€žÃ¦ÂºÂÃ¥â€¦â€¦Ã¨Â¶Â³Ã¦â‚¬Â§, Ã§Â§Â¯Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â·Â¥Ã¤Â½Å“Ã§â€Å¸Ã¦Â´Â»Ã¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ¥â€™Å’Ã©Ââ€œÃ¥Â¾Â·Ã¥Â·Â¥Ã¤Â½Å“Ã§Å½Â¯Ã¥Â¢Æ’Ã¨Â´Å¸Ã¥Ââ€˜Ã©Â¢â€žÃ¦Âµâ€¹Ã©Ââ€œÃ¥Â¾Â·Ã¥â€ºÂ°Ã¦â€°Â°Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸Â¥Ã©â€¡ÂÃ§Â¨â€¹Ã¥ÂºÂ¦, Ã¨â‚¬Å’ COVID-19 Ã©Â£Å½Ã©â„¢Â©Ã¦â€žÅ¸Ã§Å¸Â¥Ã¦Â­Â£Ã¥Ââ€˜Ã©Â¢â€žÃ¦Âµâ€¹Ã©Ââ€œÃ¥Â¾Â·Ã¥â€ºÂ°Ã¦â€°Â°Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸Â¥Ã©â€¡ÂÃ§Â¨â€¹Ã¥ÂºÂ¦Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ©Ââ€œÃ¥Â¾Â·Ã¥â€ºÂ°Ã¦â€°Â°Ã¤Â¹Å¸Ã¦ËœÂ¾Ã¨â€˜â€”Ã¤Â¸â€Ã¦Â­Â£Ã¥Ââ€˜Ã©Â¢â€žÃ¦Âµâ€¹Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¦Å â€˜Ã©Æ’Â, Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜, PTSDÃ¥â€™Å’Ã¥â‚¬Â¦Ã¦â‚¬Â Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¨Â®Âº</b>:Ã¦Ë†â€˜Ã¤Â»Â¬Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã¥Â¼ÂºÃ¨Â°Æ’Ã¤Âºâ€  HCW Ã§Â»â€žÃ§Â»â€¡Ã¨Â¿Â«Ã¥Ë†â€¡Ã©Å“â‚¬Ã¨Â¦ÂÃ¥Â®Å¾Ã¦â€“Â½Ã¦â€”Â¨Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã©Â¢â€žÃ©ËœÂ²Ã¥Â·Â¥Ã¤Â½Å“Ã¥Å“ÂºÃ¦â€°â‚¬Ã¥â€ â€¦Ã©â€¢Â¿Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©Ââ€œÃ¥Â¾Â·Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥â€ºÂ°Ã¦â€°Â°Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Â­â€“Ã§â€¢Â¥Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ§Â¡Â®Ã¤Â¿ÂÃ¥ÂÂ¯Ã¨Å½Â·Ã¥Ââ€“Ã¨Â¶Â³Ã¥Â¤Å¸Ã¨Âµâ€žÃ¦ÂºÂ, Ã©â„¢ÂÃ¤Â½Å½HCWÃ¦Å½Â¥Ã¨Â§Â¦ COVID-19 Ã§Å¡â€žÃ©Â£Å½Ã©â„¢Â©, Ã¦ÂÂÃ¤Â¾â€ºÃ¤Â¸ÂªÃ¤Â½â€œÃ¤Â¼ËœÃ¥â€¦Ë†Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Â»â€žÃ§Â»â€¡Ã¦â€Â¯Ã¦Å’ÂÃ¤Â»Â¥Ã¥ÂÅ Ã¥ÂÅ¡Ã¦Å’ÂÃ¤Â¼Â¦Ã§Ââ€ Ã¨â‚¬Æ’Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¤ÂºÅ½Ã©â„¢ÂÃ¤Â½Å½Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ©Ââ€œÃ¥Â¾Â·Ã¥â€ºÂ°Ã¥Â¢Æ’Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸Â¥Ã©â€¡ÂÃ§Â¨â€¹Ã¥ÂºÂ¦Ã¨â€¡Â³Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¦Â.","Plouffe, Nazarov, Forchuk, Gargala, Deda, Le, Bourret-Gheysen, Jackson, Soares, Hosseiny, Smith, Roth, MacDougall, Marlborough, Jetly, Heber, Albuquerque, Lanius, Balderson, Dupuis, Mehta, Richardson","https://doi.org/10.1080/20008198.2021.1984667","20211115","COVID-19; Moral distress; anxiety; depressive disorders; health care; organizational environment; posttraumatic stress disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21892,""

"Emotional Reactivity and Emotion Regulation Among Young Adults During COVID-19 Lockdown: The Moderating Role of Gender and Engagement in Sports","The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health have not been fully inspected among the young adults' population. The objectives of the present study were: (1) to examine differences in emotional reactivity and emotion regulation between, both gender and sports engagement level during the first 2 weeks of the lockdown; and (2) to examine the possible impact of emotion regulation on emotional reactivity, and possible significant roles of gender and sports engagement level as moderators. This cross-sectional study included 315 Serbian young adults (aged 18-26 years old) during COVID-19 lockdown. Respondents answered socio-demographic questions and the Serbian version of the Multidimensional Emotion Questionnaire (MEQ). The results of confirmatory factor analysis indicated good fit for both positive and negative reactivity scales (SRMR = 0.037; CFI = 0.984, RMSEA = 0.046, and SRMR = 0.055; CFI = 0.964, RMSEA = 0.064, respectively). Gender differences were found in both positive (<i>p</i> = 0.039; <i>d</i> = 0.28) and negative emotional reactivity scales (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001; <i>d</i> = 0.60), with females reported lower and higher values, respectively. Professional athletes presented higher scores in positive reactivity scale in comparison to non-athletes (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001; <i>d</i> = 0.78) and recreational athletes (<i>p</i> = 0.034; <i>d</i> = 0.34) during 2 weeks of COVID-19 lockdown. Conversely, professional athletes scored lower in negative emotional reactivity scale in comparison to non-athletes (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001; <i>d</i> = 0.85) and recreational athletes (<i>p</i> = 0.006; <i>d</i> = 0.42). Both gender and sports engagement level differences were found for negative, but not for positive emotion regulation scale. Furthermore, results showed that engagement in sports level plays a significant role as moderator in relationship between negative regulation and negative reactivity, where professional athletes presented significant interaction effect and predicted lower negative reactivity scores compared to non-athletes and recreational athletes. However, gender does not moderate the influence of emotion regulation on emotional reactivity either positive or negative. Engagement in sports as a lifestyle may contribute to better emotional harmony especially in the crisis situation as COVID-19 lockdown.","MladenoviÃ„â€¡, StojanoviÃ„â€¡, StojanoviÃ„â€¡, Ã…Â½ivkoviÃ„â€¡, AleksiÃ„â€¡, TeÃ…Â¡anoviÃ„â€¡, MomÃ„ÂiloviÃ„â€¡","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.774732","20211115","COVID-19; emotion regulation; emotional reactivity; gender differences; lockdown; physical activity; sport","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21894,""
"Confounding Factors Affecting the Emotional Intelligence Amongst Jordanian Nursing and Midwifery Undergraduate Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic's Outbreak: A Cross-Sectional Study Using USMEQ-i","<b>Objective:</b> This aim of this study was to determine which variables from the demographic data most affect the EI regarding the COVID-19 outbreak and the lockdown amongst the nursing and midwifery students in Jordan. <b>Background:</b> Emotional intelligence (EI) is the ability to recognize, express, comprehend, motivate, influence and regulate emotions proposed the first EI model, which includes three constructs: emotion assessment and expression, emotion consumption and emotion control. During the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown, face-to-face study methods have been replaced by online teaching, which has caused many psychological effects. <b>Method:</b> A cross-sectional approach was used to measure EI for nursing and midwifery students. The tool was completed online by nursing and midwifery students using Google Forms. All of the findings were received online and then analyzed accordingly. In this study, USMEQ-i was used to gather data from the participants. <b>Results:</b> The general EI score for the student respondents falls into the average score (<i>M</i> = 39.6). Regarding the difference between males and females, the results showed no significant difference. Moreover, the general linear regressions analysis of independent variables on EI score showed four significant factors. Nursing students who study in Years 1 and 4 had significantly higher EI scores than those in Years 2 and 3. EI ability decreased when a student's economic status changed from luxurious to middle income. Moreover, an increase in age significantly decreased the value of EI. This study indicates that all nursing and midwifery students who enrolled in general nursing program tended to have higher EI scores than others (<i>p</i> = 0.006). <b>Conclusion:</b> Year of study, age, average lifestyle and enrollment in a nursing program were found to be the most significant factors associated with EI amongst Jordanian nursing and midwifery students. This issue needs to be researched further, such that appropriate steps can be taken to address it.","Alnjadat, Al-Rawashdeh","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.770261","20211115","COVID-19 lockdown; COVID-19 outbreak; Jordanian nursing students; USMEQ-i; emotional intelligence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21895,""
"A Counseling Application as an Alternative Tool in Increasing Coping Self-Efficacy Among University Students With Academic Distress During Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic in Indonesia: A Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Non-Inferiority Trial","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic increased education-related distress among University students globally, including in Indonesia. Psychological factors, such as academic demands, limited opportunity to meet their peers, problematic use of technology, and domestic problems, influenced the well-being of the students, leading to poor academic performance. A mobile-based counseling application was developed to address the distress among University students. The application was meant to reach students living remotely to enable them to access psychological assistance. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to describe a protocol aimed to evaluate the equivalence of the application when compared to the Treatment-As-Usual (TAU) in increasing the coping self-efficacy (CSE) and resilience of students as well as in decreasing their level of depression. A two-armed parallel randomized control non-inferiority trial will be conducted among approximately 430 students with selected academic problems. The participants will be randomly allocated into the TAU and the intervention groups. The primary and secondary outcomes will be measured by the Indonesian versions of the Coping Self-Efficacy (CSE) Scale, the Resilience Scale (RS-14), and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The data will be collected at baseline, at the end of each session, and after 3 months. The outcomes will be analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVAs, intention-to-treat, and per-protocol analysis. If proven, the application will be used as an alternative media in helping the students. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> Thailand Clinical Trials Registry (TCTR20200530001); Date of registration: May 28, 2020.","Hinduan, Wedyaswari, Reswara, Setyowibowo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.712806","20211115","coping self-efficacy; depression; mobile-based counseling application; non-inferiority controlled trial; resilience (personality); solution-focused brief therapy; technology-based intervention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21896,""
"The Role of Collectivism-Individualism in Attitudes Toward Compliance and Psychological Responses During the COVID-19 Pandemic","This study examined the role of individual differences in horizontal and vertical individualism and collectivism, trust and worries, and concerns about COVID-19 in predicting the attitudes toward compliance of health advice and psychological responses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Chinese university students (<i>N</i>=384, 324 female) completed measures of individualism and collectivism, trust, attitudes toward compliance, and psychological responses to the pandemic. Results showed that not only vertical collectivist orientation but also horizontal individualist orientation significantly predicted higher willingness to comply, whereas vertical individualist orientation significantly predicted lower willingness to comply. Vertical individualist and vertical collectivist orientations predicted higher psychological response in terms of distress, anxiety, and depression, while horizontal collectivistic orientation significantly predicted less psychological problems. Implications of the effect of individual-level cultural orientations on attitudes toward public health compliance and psychological well-being during global health crises are discussed.","Xiao","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.600826","20211115","COVID-19; attitudes toward compliance; collectivism; individualism; psychological responses","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21897,""
"The Mediating Role of Resilience and Extraversion on Psychological Distress and Loneliness Among the General Population of Tyrol, Austria Between the First and the Second Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Background:</b> During the first 3 weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal state of Tyrol, Austria had one of the strictest curfews in Austria and worldwide. The aim of the current study was to investigate the assumingly protective role of resilience and extraversion and its impact on mental health following such an uncertain and unpredictable situation. <b>Methods:</b> Between the first and the second wave of the pandemic, adult residents of Tyrol were invited to participate in an online survey. Next to the assessment of sociodemographic and COVID-19-related variables the Brief-Symptom-Checklist, the Three-Item Loneliness Scale, the Resilience Scaled, and the Big Five Inventory were used to assess psychological distress, loneliness, resilience, and extraversion. Mediation analysis was used to investigate the role of resilience and extraversion in the context of age-, sex-, and partnership- related differences in psychological distress and loneliness. <b>Results:</b> One hundred and forty-five participants took part in the survey (68.2% female). Overall, psychological distress and severe loneliness were more often detected in women and singles. They also were less resilient, while men and singles presented with a lower degree of extraversion. Study participants under the age of 30 experienced severe loneliness more frequently than older people, whereas psychological distress, resilience, and extraversion were comparable between age groups. Resilience significantly mediated the relationship between both study participants' sex and partnership situation on one hand and psychological distress and severe loneliness on the other. In addition, extraversion significantly mediated the relationship between participants' partnership situation and psychological distress. <b>Discussion:</b> Our findings suggest that women, singles, and young people may be particularly affected by the measures and sequelae of the COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions promoting resilience and extraversion among these groups are urgently needed to foster mental health. Ideally, they can be utilized at home in case of renewed mobility restrictions or quarantine in the future.","Chernova, Frajo-Apor, Pardeller, Tutzer, Plattner, Haring, Holzner, Kemmler, Marksteiner, Miller, Schmidt, Sperner-Unterweger, Hofer","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.766261","20211115","COVID-19; extraversion; loneliness; mental health; psychological distress; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21898,""
"COVID-19-Related Psychological and Psychosocial Distress Among Parents and Youth With Physical Illness: A Longitudinal Study","Despite the initial thrust of research aimed at understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on youth with physical illness and their parents, knowledge gaps in the literature remain, providing the impetus for additional investigation. This study described changes in psychological distress from prior to during the COVID-19 pandemic for parents and youth with physical illness, compared parent-proxy and youth self-reported perceptions of COVID-19-related psychosocial health, and modeled factors associated with psychological and psychosocial distress. There were 147 parent-youth dyads (2-16 years) from MY LIFE-a longitudinal study of youth with physical illness. The Kessler-6 (K6) measured psychological distress for the time before the COVID-19 lockdown (December 19 to March 20) and during the pandemic (December 20 to March 21) among parents and youth. COVID-19-related psychosocial health was measured using the CRISIS. Parents and youth reported increases in K6 scores (<i>d</i> = 0.62 and 0.38). Parent-proxy reports on the K6 were lower vs. youth self-reports prior to and during the pandemic (<i>d</i> = 0.63 for both). In contrast, parents reported lower proxy CRISIS scores for worries (<i>d</i> = 0.38) and effects of social restrictions (<i>d</i> = 0.52). Pandemic parent K6 scores were associated with age, combined in-person and online schooling for youth, COVID-19-related worries, and effects of social restrictions. For youth, only COVID-19-related worries and effects of social restrictions were associated with K6 scores. Parent worries were associated with youth sex, parental stress, family functioning, online and combination learning, and social restrictions. Parental depression and worries were associated with effects of social restrictions. Youth worries were associated with online and combination learning, and social restrictions. Youth disability, online learning, and worries were associated with effects of social restrictions. Few clinical factors are associated with COVID-19-related psychological and psychosocial distress. Instead, parent/family factors and youth learning environment have prominent roles in predicting outcomes and have implications for the health, education, and social services systems.","Ferro, Meyer, Yessis, Reaume, Lipman, Gorter","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.761968","20211115","adolescent; children; chronic disease; coronavirus; mental health; multimorbidity; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21899,""

"Anxiety and Stress Levels Associated With COVID-19 Pandemic of University Students in Turkey: A Year After the Pandemic","The outbreak of COVID-19 has been affecting the daily lives of almost everyone and puts huge psychological pressure on people worldwide, including Turkey. Anxiety and stress levels among university students were already a public health concern. Our study aims to demonstrate the anxiety and stress levels of university students in Turkey after the outbreak of COVID-19 according to the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) and COVID Stress Scale (CSS). CAS is a brief mental health screener to identify probable cases of dysfunctional anxiety associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and CSS was developed to understand and assess COVID-19-related distress. An online questionnaire was administered to active 1,265 university students in Turkey between February 27 and March 8, 2021, <i>via</i> Google forms. The questionnaire consists of three parts that assess participants' demographic information, anxiety, and stress levels related to the pandemic. According to CAS and CSS analysis, anxiety and stress levels were associated with each other and influenced university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Both were associated with gender and family member loss. The academic year of students had a relationship with anxiety. It was observed that the danger factor was the highest stressor in university students in Turkey related to the novel coronavirus, followed by contamination fears. Both factors were shown as moderate stressors. As a result of the study, it was revealed that anxiety and stress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic are now included in the social, academic, and physical burdens of the university years, which are decisive and important in terms of mental development and psychological health of the person. It is essential to ascertain the long-term effects of COVID-19 and take effective precautions to support the physical and mental health of today's university students accordingly.","Durbas, Karaman, Solman, Kaygisiz, Ersoy","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.731348","20211115","COVID-19; anxiety; coronavirus; pandemic; stress; students; university; young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21901,""
"Mental Health in Residential Healthcare Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Moderating Role of Selfobject Needs","The COVID-19 outbreak has affected healthcare across all levels. Older adults and those with chronic illness are at greatest risk for infection complications and mortality, which presents significant psychological distress for residential healthcare workers. The concept of selfobject needs, consisting of Mirroring, Idealizing, and Twinship, may be relevant in explaining psychological distress. This study seeks to enhance our understanding of the needs of healthcare workers responsible for elderly patients and evaluate the role of psychosocial support through selfobject needs to mitigate the effects of trauma during the pandemic. Participants (<i>N</i> = 103) employed in residential healthcare facilities in the metropolitan Detroit, MI (USA) region completed an online survey during the peak initial infection. Assessments included standardized measures of trauma-related symptoms, depression, anxiety, and general distress symptoms, as well as a validated measure of selfobject needs. Residential healthcare workers reported mental health symptoms across domains, including clinical elevations in symptoms of trauma, depression, and anxiety. Selfobject needs and mental health outcomes were positively correlated, indicating that greater unmet relational need was associated with greater severity of symptoms. Greater trauma symptom severity as a proxy index of current experience during the pandemic predicted high depressive symptoms, and greater Mirroring need worsened the effect. These results suggest that interventions targeting selfobject needs, specifically Mirroring, may be effective at mitigating acute mental health symptoms among healthcare workers during a distressing event.","Arble, Shankar, Steinert, Daugherty","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.596618","20211115","COVID-19; depression; interpersonal functioning; nursing home; post-traumatic stress disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21902,""
"Stigma: A Barrier in Supporting Nurse Well-Being During the Pandemic","Public media and the nursing literature are replete with data and anecdotal stories evidencing the overwhelming impact to nurses' well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although many organizations have rallied and are providing robust services to support nurses through the pandemic, stigma (negative perceptions, attitudes, and discrimination) about mental health support is contributing to nurses' reluctance to use the many resources available to them. This article outlines strategies for reducing the stigma and eliminating the barriers associated with obtaining the mental and emotional well-being support and services that nurses need and deserve.","Weston, Nordberg","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mnl.2021.10.008","20211115","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21903,""
"Partner responsiveness moderates the relation between COVID-19-related stressors and changes in mood during the pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has created an unusually stressful situation for many people around the world. Due to the restrictions, many have been isolated in their homes, and having a responsive partner may have become even more important. The present study aimed to investigate (1) whether there were any differences in social and work-related stressors and changes in negative mood during the COVID-19 pandemic as a function of marital status, and (2) whether perceived partner responsiveness can attenuate the associations between COVID-19-related stressors and changes in negative mood. The participants were 2,400 Brazilian adults recruited via the Internet, using a virtual sampling strategy. They were assigned to three distinct groups based on their relationship status. The results showed that a relatively large proportion of the sample reported increased levels of negative mood, and that married/cohabitating couples reported low levels of negative change in mood compared to single participants. We also found that partner responsiveness attenuated the association between stress and mental health, but only for people who were dating. Our study contributes new insights by showing that effects on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic are dependent on relationship type and perceived partner responsiveness.","Soares, Rodrigues, de Paula, Thorell, de Miranda","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-02429-5","20211115","COVID-19; Married; Mental health; Relationship quality; Relationships; Single","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21904,""
"Urban green spaces in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic: reflections from Nairobi, Kenya","This paper seeks to examine how the perception and use of Nairobi's urban green spaces (UGS) have been impacted by the Covid- 19 pandemic. The question of how the current pandemic and the resulting government policies will affect urban green spaces has remained elusive. Similarly, the relationship between public health crises and urban green spaces has not been well integrated in the current literature. This paper identifies a nexus between government response to the Covid-19 pandemic and (<i>Un</i>) sustainability of UGS. The authors further reflect on the potential role UGS could play to mitigate the negative effects of the pandemic. Findings of the study show that UGS in Nairobi have not been fully exploited to provide citizens with sufficient access to green spaces yet as the pandemic has shown these spaces could significantly improve physical and mental health for the citizens as well as act as logistical areas for humanitarian activities during a pandemic. The paper therefore concludes with policy recommendations that can give rise to short and long term reforms in the provision and management of UGS.","Okech, Nyadera","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10708-021-10540-0","20211115","Covid-19; Nairobi; Pandemic; Urban green spaces","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21905,""
"[Depression, stress and anxiety in students of human medicine in Ayacucho (Peru) in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic]","To evaluate rates of anxiety, depression and stress, as well as associated factors and changes in habits, among students of human medicine from the Universidad Nacional San CristÃƒÂ³bal de Huamanga [San CristÃƒÂ³bal of Huamanga University] (UNSCH), located in Ayacucho (Peru), in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study was conducted through a virtual survey. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) was used. To evaluate associated factors, prevalence ratios (PR) were estimated using Poisson regression with robust variance. A total of 284 surveys were analysed (48.2% women; median age 22 years). Rates of (at least moderate) depression, anxiety and stress were 24.3%, 28.5% and 13.0%, respectively. Adjusted analyses found that having completed fewer years of study, being Catholic and having a chronic disease were associated with a higher rate of anxiety, while being of a younger age was associated with a higher rate of stress. The students reported mostly decreased physical activity, as well as increased Internet and social media use, hours of sleep, hours spent in front of a screen, food intake, and weight, during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the context of the pandemic, despite the changes in habits described, rates of depression, anxiety and stress were lower than in previous studies in students in the health sciences. The higher rate of anxiety was associated with being in an earlier academic year, Catholicism and chronic diseases, while the higher rate of stress was associated with being of a younger age.","Sandoval, Morote-Jayacc, Moreno-Molina, Taype-Rondan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcp.2021.10.005","20211115","Anxiety; Depression; Medical students; SARS-CoV-2 infection; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21906,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on 'Living Well' with Mild-to-Moderate Dementia in the Community: Findings from the IDEAL Cohort","Negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with dementia have been widely-documented, but most studies have relied on carer reports and few have compared responses to information collected before the pandemic. We aimed to explore the impact of the pandemic on community-dwelling individuals with mild-to-moderate dementia and compare responses with pre-pandemic data. During the second wave of the pandemic, we conducted structured telephone interviews with 173 people with dementia and 242 carers acting as informants, all of whom had previously participated in the IDEAL cohort. Where possible, we benchmarked responses against pre-pandemic data. Significant perceived negative impacts were identified in cognitive and functional skills and ability to engage in self-care and manage everyday activities, along with increased levels of loneliness and discontinuity in sense of self and a decline in perceived capability to 'live well'. Compared to pre-pandemic data, there were lower levels of pain, depression, and anxiety, higher levels of optimism, and better satisfaction with family support. There was little impact on physical health, mood, social connections and relationships, or perceptions of neighborhood characteristics. Efforts to mitigate negative impacts of pandemic-related restrictions and restore quality of life could focus on reablement to address the effects on participation in everyday activities, creating opportunities for social contact to reduce loneliness, and personalized planning to reconnect people with their pre-COVID selves. Such efforts may build on the resilience demonstrated by people with dementia and carers in coping with the pandemic.","Clare, Martyr, Gamble, Pentecost, Collins, Dawson, Hunt, Parker, Allan, Burns, Hillman, Litherland, Quinn, Matthews, Victor","https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-215095","20211115","AlzheimerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease; quality of life; services; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21907,""
"Anxiety and depression in parents of children with autism spectrum disorder during the first COVID-19 lockdown: Report from the ELENA cohort","The Covid-19 pandemic had a strong impact on mental health in the general population. This study conducted during the first lockdown in France considered parents of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) prospectively followed in the ELENA Cohort. We aimed to (1) compare the Anxiety and Depression (AaD) levels during the lockdown between mothers and fathers, (2) compare the parent's AaD between the lockdown and the last ELENA follow-up visit, and (3) identify risk factors for parental AaD during lockdown among socio-demographic and children's clinical characteristics. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to assess AaD in 134 parent's pairs. Parents also completed the Questionnaire about their living conditions during COVID-19, their child's interventions and perceived changes about their child's behaviors and sleep. Child's ASD severity, intellectual and socio-adaptive skills and parent's socio-demographic characteristics were collected from ELENA follow-up. The parents' AaD levels were lower during the lockdown compared to the last ELENA visit that coincided in 96% with the child's ASD diagnosis. The AaD levels were more pronounced in mothers and significantly associated with the child's challenging behaviors, parents' teleworking and perceived knowledge about COVID-19. The perception of an insufficient knowledge was the only risk factor for mothers' AaD. Our findings highlighted the pertinence for an assessment of the mental health of main caregivers of children with ASD, consideration of their gender characteristics, and the importance of providing relevant information during pandemic. Future studies examining the pandemic long-term effects are needed.

"Physical Activity During the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic is Linked to Better Mood and Emotion","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may negatively impact mood and emotion. Physical activity may protect against mood disturbance and promote positive affect. This study asked if physical activity before, during, or the change in physical activity with the pandemic, impacted affect and mood during the pandemic. U.S. adult residents (18-74 years; N=338) were surveyed from April 29-June 3, 2020. Physical activity before and during the pandemic was assessed with the Physical Activity Rating survey. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule measured affect and the Profile of Moods Questionnaire assessed mood. Comparisons between physically inactive and active participants by Analysis of Covariance found greater vigor in participants classed as physically active before the pandemic. Positive affect, vigor, and esteem-related affect were greater in participants physically active during the pandemic. Multiple linear regression revealed relationships between the change in physical activity and mood. Change in physical activity positively associated with positive affect (b=1.06), esteem-related affect (b=0.33), and vigor (b=0.53), and negatively associated with negative affect (b=-0.47), total mood disturbance (b=-2.60), tension (b=-0.31), anger (b=-0.24), fatigue (b=-0.54), depression (b=-0.50), and confusion (b=-0.23). These data demonstrate that physical activity during the pandemic, and increased physical activity relative to before the pandemic, related to better mood. This article is protected by copyright.

"The impact of social factors, especially psychological worries on anxiety and depression in patients with epilepsy","Social factors are believed to affect mental health in patients with epilepsy (PWE). However, there is still a lack of sufficient manifest proof, given the difficulty of exposing PWE to relatively consistent natural social environments with a low or high level of social interaction to study their significant role. This single-center, longitudinal study was conducted via online questionnaires during the coronavirus disease 2019. PWE were recruited from downtown Wuhan and surrounding areas. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 were used to assess psychological status. We analyzed 588 questionnaires completed by 294 PWE who participated in the dual survey. Under lockdown and reopening, the prevalence of anxiety was 13.6%/22.5%, and the prevalence of depression was 19.4%/34.0%. Raising children and seizure-related characteristics, including uncontrolled seizures, seizure exacerbation, seizure frequencyÃ¢â‚¬Â¯Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬Â¯2/m, and changes in drug regimen, were risk factors in the first and second surveys.

"The longitudinal associations of physical activity, time spent outdoors in nature and symptoms of depression and anxiety during COVID-19 quarantine and social distancing in the United States","Stressors associated with COVID-19 pandemic stay-at-home orders are associated with increased depression and anxiety and decreased physical activity. Given that physical activity and time spent outdoors in nature are associated with improved mental health, we examined the longitudinal association of these variables during the pandemic. Over 20,000 adults who participated in the U.S. Kaiser Permanente Research Bank, did not report COVID-19 symptoms, and responded to an online baseline and 3 follow-up surveys over approximately 3Ã¢â‚¬Â¯months formed the cohort. Physical activity was assessed from a modified survey, time spent outdoors was assessed from one question, and anxiety and depression scores were assessed from validated instruments. Almost 60% were women, 82.8% were non-Hispanic white, and more than 93% of respondents were over the age of 50. Less in-person contact with friends and visiting crowded places was highly prevalent (&gt;80%) initially and decreased somewhat (&gt;70%). Participants in the lowest physical activity category (no physical activity) had the highest depression and anxiety scores compared to each successive physical activity category (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001). Spending less time outdoors was associated with higher depression and anxiety scores. This effect was greater for participants in the younger age categories compared with older age categories. The effect of less time spent outdoors on anxiety (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.012) and depression (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001) scores was smaller for males than females.

"Mental health outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in the United States: a national cross-sectional study","Worsening of anxiety and depressive symptoms have been widely described during the COVID-19 pandemic. It can be hypothesized that vaccination could link to reduced symptoms of anxiety and/or depression. However, to date, no study has assessed this. This study aims to examine anxiety and depressive symptoms after vaccination in US adults, meanwhile test sociodemographic disparities in these outcomes. Data from the January 6 - June 7 2021, cross-sectional Household Pulse Survey were analyzed. Using survey-weighted logistic regression, we assessed the relationships between SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and anxiety and/or depressive symptoms, both on overall and sociodemographic subgroups. We controlled for a variety of potential socioeconomic and demographic confounding factors. Of the 453,167 participants studied, 52.2% of the participants had received the COVID-19 vaccine, and 26.5% and 20.3% of the participants reported anxiety and depression, respectively. Compared to those not vaccinated, the vaccinated participants had a 13% lower odds of anxiety (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.85, 95%CI 0.83-0.90) and 17% lower odds of depression (AORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.83, 95%CI 0.79-0.85). Disparities on the above associations were identified in age, marital status, education level, ethnic/race, and income level, but not on gender. The causal inference was not able to be investigated due to the cross-sectional study design. Being vaccinated for SARS-CoV-2 was associated with lower odds of anxiety and/or depressive symptoms. While those more middle-aged or more affluent, were more likely to show these negative associations, the contrary was observed in ethnic minorities and those with lower educational attainment. More strategic and demography-sensitive public health communications could perhaps temper these issues.","Chen, Aruldass, Cardinal","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.10.134","20211114","Anxiety; Depression; SARS-CoV-2 vaccination; United States","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21912,""
"Greenspace and park use associated with less emotional distress among college students in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected many people's psychological health. Impacts may be particularly severe among socially vulnerable populations such as college students, a group predisposed to mental health problems. Outdoor recreation and visits to greenspaces such as parks offer promising pathways for addressing the mental health challenges associated with COVID-19. During the early stages of the pandemic (March-May 2020), we surveyed 1280 college students at four large public universities across the United States (U.S.) to assess how, and why, outdoor recreation and park use changed since the emergence of COVID-19. We also measured students' self-reported levels of emotional distress (a proxy for psychological health) and assessed potential demographic and contextual correlates of distress, including county-level per capita park area and greenness, using generalized linear models. We found that 67% of students reported limiting outdoor activities and 54% reported reducing park use during the pandemic. Students who reduced their use of outdoor spaces cited structural reasons (e.g., lockdowns), concerns about viral transmission, and negative emotions that obstructed active lifestyles. Students who maintained pre-pandemic park use levels expressed a desire to be outdoors in nature, often with the explicit goal of improving mental and physical health. Emotional distress among students was widespread. Models showed higher levels of emotional distress were associated with reducing park use during the pandemic and residing in counties with a smaller area of parks per capita. This study of U.S. college students supports the value of park-based recreation as a health promotion strategy for diverse populations of young adults during a time of crisis.","Larson, Mullenbach, Browning, Rigolon, Jennifer Thomsen, Elizabeth Covelli, Reigner, Sharaievska, McAnirlin, D'Antonio, Cloutier, Helbich, Labib","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.112367","20211114","Coronavirus; Emotional distress; Equity; Greenspace; Higher education; Mental health; Outdoor recreation; University students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21913,""

Herein we describe the effects of a 12-week, home-based, exercise program on overall health and quality of life among quarantined patients with juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM). This prospective, quasi-experimental, mixed methods (qualitative and quantitative) study was conducted between July and December 2020, during the most restricted period ofÃ‚Â COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. The home-based exercise program consisted of a 12-week, three-times-a-week, aerobic and strengthening (bodyweight) training program. Qualitative data were systematically evaluated. Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQOL) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) evaluate symptoms of mental health disorder, HRQL, and quality of sleep. 11 patients (out of 27) met the inclusion criteria (91% female; meanÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°SD age: 13.5Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.2Ã¢â‚¬â€°years). Adherence to the intervention was 72.6%. Barriers to exercise involved poor internet connectivity, excessive weekly sessions, and other commitments.

"A systematic scoping review of research on COVID-19 impacts on eating disorders: A critical appraisal of the evidence and recommendations for the field","Research investigating the effects of COVID-19 on eating disorders is growing rapidly. A comprehensive evaluation of this literature is needed to identify key findings and evidence gaps to better inform policy decisions related to the management of eating disorders during and after this crisis. We conducted a systematic scoping review synthesizing and appraising this literature. Empirical research on COVID-19 impacts on eating disorder severity, prevalence, and demand for treatment was searched. No sample restrictions were applied. Findings (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 70 studies) were synthesized across six themes: (a) suspected eating disorder cases during COVID-19; (b) perceived pandemic impacts on symptoms; (c) symptom severity pre versus during the pandemic; (d) pandemic-related correlates of symptom severity; (e) impacts on carers/parents; and (f) treatment experiences during COVID-19. Pandemic impacts on rates of probable eating disorders, symptom deterioration, and general mental health varied substantially. Symptom escalation and mental health worsening during-and due to-the pandemic were commonly reported, and those most susceptible included confirmed eating disorder cases, at-risk populations (young women, athletes, parent/carers), and individuals highly anxious or fearful of COVID-19. Evidence emerged for increased demand for specialist eating disorder services during the pandemic. The forced transition to online treatment was challenging for many, yet telehealth alternatives seemed feasible and effective. Evidence for COVID-19 effects is mostly limited to participant self-report or retrospective recall, cross-sectional and descriptive studies, and samples of convenience. Several novel pathways for future research that aim to better understand, monitor, and support those negatively affected by the pandemic are formulated.

La escala de sÃƒÂ­ntomas y el empeoramiento de la salud mental durante y debido a la pandemia fueron reportados comÃƒÂºnmente, y los mÃƒÂ¡s susceptibles incluyeron casos confirmados de trastornos de la conducta alimentaria, poblaciones en riesgo (mujeres jÃƒÂ³venes, atletas, padres / cuidadores) e individuos con altos niveles de ansiedad o con miedo de COVID-19. SurgiÃƒÂ³ alguna evidencia de una mayor demanda de servicios especializados en trastornos de la conducta alimentaria durante la pandemia. La transiciÃƒÂ³n forzada al tratamiento en lÃƒÂ­nea fue un desafÃƒÂ­o para muchos, sin embargo, las alternativas de telesalud parecÃƒÂ­an factibles y efectivas. Conclusiones. La evidencia de los efectos de COVID-19 se limita principalmente al autoinforme de los participantes o al recuerdo retrospectivo, los estudios transversales y descriptivos, y las muestras de conveniencia. Se formulan varias vÃƒÂ­as novedosas para futuras investigaciones que tienen como objetivo comprender, monitorear y apoyar mejor a aquellos que fueron afectados negativamente por la pandemia.","Linardon, Messer, Rodgers, Fuller-Tyszkiewicz","https://doi.org/10.1002/eat.23640","20211113","COVID-19; carers; eating disorders; machine learning; mental health; open science; scoping review; systematic review; telehealth; treatment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21915,""
"Predictive factors of erectile dysfunction in Egyptian individuals after contracting COVID-19: A prospective case-control study","This study aimed to screen healthy individuals who contracted COVID-19 for erectile dysfunction (ED) and to determine the potential risk factors that can predict ED in these individuals. One hundred and seven cases versus 90 controls agreed to participate in the study. Two structured interviews with 1Ã‚Â month interval were conducted.

We examined the association of depression with smartphone ownership in school children at four time points: September 2019, July 2020, December 2020, and March 2021. The analysis revealed an interaction between group and time, indicating that depressive symptoms among smartphone owners were significantly more severe than in the other group.

"'Stressed, uncomfortable, vulnerable, neglected': a qualitative study of the psychological and social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on UK frontline keyworkers","Non-healthcare keyworkers face distinct occupational vulnerabilities that have received little consideration within broader debates about 'essential' work and psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was therefore to explore the impact of the pandemic on the working lives and mental health and well-being of non-healthcare keyworkers in the UK. In-depth, qualitative interviews, analysed using a reflexive thematic analysis. Telephone or video call interviews, conducted in the UK between September 2020 and January 2021. 23 participants aged 26-61 (mean age=47.2) years employed in a range of non-healthcare keyworker occupations, including transport, retail, education, postal services, the police and fire services, waste collection, finance and religious services. Keyworkers experienced adverse psychological effects during the COVID-19 pandemic, including fears of COVID-19 exposure, contagion and subsequent transmission to others, especially their families. These concerns were often experienced in the context of multiple exposure risks, including insufficient personal protective equipment and a lack of workplace mitigation practices. Keyworkers also described multiple work-related challenges, including increased workload, a lack of public and organisational recognition and feelings of disempowerment. In efforts to reduce psychosocial concerns among non-healthcare keyworkers, there is a need for appropriate support during the COVID-19 pandemic and in preparation for other infections (eg, seasonal influenza) in the future. This includes the provision of psychological and workplace measures attending to the intersections of personal vulnerability and work conditions that cause unique risks and challenges among those in frontline keyworker occupations.","May, Aughterson, Fancourt, Burton","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-050945","20211115","COVID-19; mental health; occupational &amp; industrial medicine; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21918,""
"Burnout and peritraumatic distress of healthcare workers in the COVID-19 pandemic","To evaluate the current status of emotional exhaustion and peritraumatic distress of healthcare workers (HCWs) in the COVID-19 pandemic, and identify factors associated with their mental health status. An online survey involving 1068 of consented HCWs that included nurses, physicians, and public health officers was conducted in May 2020. Descriptive statistics and multivariate regression analyses were performed on the collected data. Although no significant difference in peritraumatic distress was observed among the surveyed HCWs, the workers' experience of emotional exhaustion varied according to work characteristics. Respondents who were female, older, living with a spouse, and/or full-time workers reported higher levels of emotional exhaustion. Public health officers and other medical personnel who did not have direct contact with confirmed patients and full-time workers had a higher level of peritraumatic distress. Forced involvement in work related to COVID-19, worry about stigma, worry about becoming infected, and perceived sufficiency of organizational support negatively predict emotional exhaustion and peritraumatic distress. Job-related and emotional stress of HCWs should not be neglected. Evidence-based interventions and supports are required to protect HCWs from mental illness and to promote mental health of those involved in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Jang, You, Lee, Lee, Lee, Han, Oh","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11978-0","20211115","COVID-19; Healthcare workers; Mental health; Pandemic; Traumatic distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21919,""
"Frequency and source of worries in an International sample of pregnant and postpartum women during the Covid-19 pandemic","Pregnant and postpartum women face unique challenges and concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus far, no studies have explored the factors associated with increased levels of worry in this population globally. The current study sought to assess the frequency and sources of worry during the COVID-19 pandemic in an international sample of pregnant and postpartum women. We conducted an anonymous, online, cross-sectional survey in 64 countries between May and June 2020. The survey was available in 12 languages and hosted on the Pregistry platform for COVID-19 studies. Participants were sought mainly on social media platforms and online parenting forums. The survey included questions related to demographics, level of worry, support, stress, COVID-19 exposure, frequency of media usage, and mental health indicators. The study included 7561 participants. Eighty-three percent of all participants indicated that they were either 'somewhat' or 'very' worried. Women 13-28Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks pregnant were significantly more likely to indicate that they were 'very worried' compared to those who were postpartum or at other stages of pregnancy. When compared with women living in Europe, those in Africa, Asia and Pacific, North America and South/Latin America were more likely to have increased levels of worry, as were those who more frequently interacted with social media. Different forms of support and stress also had an impact upon level of worry, while indicators of stress and anxiety were positively associated with worry level. Pregnant and postpartum women are vulnerable to the changes in societal norms brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding the factors associated with levels of worry within this population will enable society to address potential unmet needs and improve the current and future mental health of parents and children.","Wyszynski, Hernandez-Diaz, Gordon-Dseagu, Ramiro, Basu, Kim, Koenen","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-021-04241-2","20211115","COVID-19; Mental health, survey; Postpartum; Pregnancy; Worry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21920,""
"Predictors of Burnout in Hospital Health Workers during the COVID-19 Outbreak in South Korea","This study aimed to identify the factors that influence the components of burnout-emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), and personal accomplishment (PA)-among hospital health workers, including doctors and nurses, during the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed 200 healthcare workers' responses to the Employee Health Promotion Survey conducted at a general hospital in Seoul with over 200 hospital beds. The questionnaire included items about COVID-19-related burnout and its influencing factors. We performed three different multiple regression analyses using EE, DP, and PA as the dependent variables. The results show that sex, marital status, workload of treating suspected COVID-19 patients, fear of COVID-19 infection, anxiety, and depression predicted EE. The predictors of DP were job category, consecutive months of work in the current department, satisfaction with work environment, anxiety, and depression. The predictors of PA were the workload of directly interacting with patients, socioeconomic status, and job stress. For EE and DP, burnout was found to be worse in doctors and nurses than in other health workers; moreover, burnout was worse among nurses than among doctors across all three aspects of burnout. The findings can be used to establish tailored policies to address each burnout component.","Jihn, Kim, Kim","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182111720","20211115","COVID-19; Maslach burnout inventory; burnout; depersonalization; doctor; emotional exhaustion; hospital health worker; nurse; personal accomplishment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21921,""
"Silver Linings Reported by Australians Experiencing Public Health Restrictions during the First Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Report","This national study investigated the positives reported by residents experiencing the large-scale public health measures instituted in Australia to manage the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Most Australians had not previously experienced the traditional public health measures used (social distancing, hand hygiene and restriction of movement) and which could potentially impact negatively on mental well-being. The research design included qualitative semi-structured phone interviews where participants described their early pandemic experiences. Data analysis used a rapid identification of themes technique, well-suited to large-scale qualitative research. The ninety participants (mean age 48 years; 70 women) were distributed nationally. Analysis revealed five themes linked with mental well-being and the concept of silver linings: safety and security, gratitude and appreciation, social cohesion and connections, and opportunities to reset priorities and resilience. Participants demonstrated support for the public health measures and evidence of individual and community resilience. They were cognisant of positives despite personal curtailment and negative impacts of public health directives. Stories of hope, strength, and acceptance, innovative connections with others and focusing on priorities and opportunities within the hardship were important strategies that others could use in managing adversity.","Campbell, Thompson, Tynan, Townsin, Booker, Argus","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182111406","20211115","mental health; policy; rapid evaluation; resilience; theme identification","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21922,""
"Eating Behaviour Changes during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review of Longitudinal Studies","Eating behaviour is a complex construct that is liable to be modified by external factors. Due to the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), many restrictive measures were carried out with the aim of reducing the impact of this disease. As a result, lifestyles were disrupted, which could affect eating behaviours. The aim of this systematic review of longitudinal studies was to assess changes in eating behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic by establishing a comparison of eating behaviours before and after the outbreak of the pandemic. This study followed the PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO: CRD42020203246), whereas to assess the quality of the studies, the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) was applied. Out of a set of 826 studies, 23 were included in this systematic review. The main findings provided information about a shift towards modified eating behaviours, characterized by an increased snack frequency and a preference for sweets and ultra-processed food rather than fruits, vegetables, and fresh food. Additionally, an increased alcohol consumption was found among different countries. Consequently, adherence to healthy diets decreased. These findings are relevant to future policies and strategies to assess nutrition in cases of alarming situations such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.","GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-Monroy, GÃƒÂ³mez-GÃƒÂ³mez, Olarte-SÃƒÂ¡nchez, Motrico","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182111130","20211115","COVID-19; eating behaviour; longitudinal studies; systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21923,""
"Cortisol as a Biomarker of Mental Disorder Severity","Cortisol-the most important steroid hormone with a significant effect on body metabolism-strongly affects peripheral tissues and the central nervous system. Fluctuations in cortisol secretion often accompany psychiatric disorders, and normalization of its levels correlates with improvement in the patient's health. This indicates that cortisol may be useful as a biological marker that can help determine the likelihood of mental illness, its impending onset, and the severity of symptoms, which is especially important in the face of the increasing prevalence of mental disorders, including those associated with social isolation and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. This publication reviews recent reports on cortisol levels in healthy participants and shows the current state of knowledge on changes in the levels of this hormone in people at risk for depression, bipolar disorder, and psychosis. It shows how people with psychiatric disorders react to stressful situations and how the applied therapies affect cortisol secretion. The influence of antidepressants and antipsychotics on cortisol levels in healthy people and those with mental disorders is also described. Finally, it reviews publications on the patterns of cortisol secretion in patients in remission.","Dziurkowska, Wesolowski","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10215204","20211115","cortisol; mental disorder; psychotropic drugs","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21924,""
"Determining What Changed Japanese Suicide Mortality in 2020 Using Governmental Database","The pandemic of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused both COVID-19-related health hazards and the deterioration of socioeconomic and sociopsychological status due to governmental restrictions. There were concerns that suicide mortality would increase during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, a recent study reported that suicide mortality did not increase in 21 countries during the early pandemic period. In Japan, suicide mortality was reduced from 2009 to 2019, but both the annual number of suicide victims and the national suicide mortality rates in 2020 increased compared to that in 2019. To clarify the discrepancy of suicide mortality between the first and second half of 2020 in Japan, the present study determines annual and monthly suicide mortality disaggregated by prefectures, gender, age, means, motive, and household factors during the COVID-19 pandemic and pre-pandemic periods using a linear mixed-effects model. Furthermore, the relationship between suicide mortality and COVID-19 data (the infection rate, mortality, and duration of the pandemic) was analysed using hierarchal linear regression with a robust standard error. The average of monthly suicide mortality of both males and females in all 47 prefectures decreased during the first stay-home order (April-May) (females: from 10.1-10.2 to 7.8-7.9; males: from 24.0-24.9 to 21.6 per 100,000 people), but increased after the end of the first stay-home order (July-December) (females: from 7.5-9.5 to 10.3-14.5; males: from 19.9-23.0 to 21.1-26.7 per 100,000 people). Increasing COVID-19-infected patients and victims indicated a tendency of suppression, but the prolongation of the pandemic indicated a tendency of increasing female suicide mortality without affecting that of males. Contrary to the national pattern, in metropolitan regions, decreasing suicide mortality during the first stay-home order was not observed. Decreasing suicide mortality during the first stay-home order was not observed in populations younger than 30 years old, whereas increasing suicide mortality of populations younger than 30 years old after the end of the first stay-home order was predominant. A decrease in suicide mortality of one-person household residents during the first stay-home order was not observed. The hanging suicide mortality of males and females was decreased and increased during and after the end of the first stay-home orders, respectively; however, there was no decrease in metropolitan regions. These results suggest that the suicide mortality in 2020 of females, younger populations, urban residents, and one-person household residents increased compared to those of males, the elderly, rural residents, and multiple-person household residents. Therefore, the unexpected drastic fluctuations of suicide mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan were probably composed of complicated reasons among various identified factors in this study, and other unknown factors.","Matsumoto, Motomura, Fukuyama, Shiroyama, Okada","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10215199","20211115","COVID-19; Japan; age; gender; household; means; motive; region; suicide mortality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21925,""
"Risk factors for psychological distress in electroencephalography technicians during the COVID-19 pandemic: A national-level cross-sectional survey in Japan","To identify the risk factors for psychological distress in electroencephalography (EEG) technicians during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In this national-level cross-sectional survey initiated by Japan Young Epilepsy Section (YES-Japan), a questionnaire was administered to 173 technicians engaged in EEG at four clinics specializing in epilepsy care and 20 hospitals accredited as (quasi-) epilepsy centers or epilepsy training facilities in Japan from March 1 to April 30, 2021. We collected data on participants' profiles, information about work, and psychological distress outcome measurements, such as the K-6 and Tokyo Metropolitan Distress Scale for Pandemic (TMDP). Linear regression analysis was used to identify the risk factors for psychological distress. Factors that were significantly associated with psychological distress in the univariate analysis were subjected to multivariate analysis. Among the 142 respondents (response rate: 82%), 128 were included in the final analysis. As many as 35.2% of EEG technicians have been under psychological distress. In multivariate linear regression analysis for K-6, female sex, examination for patients (suspected) with COVID-19, and change in salary or bonus were independent associated factors for psychological distress. Contrastingly, in multivariate linear regression analysis for TMDP, female sex, presence of cohabitants who had to be separated from the respondent due to this pandemic, and change in salary or bonus were independent associated factors for psychological distress. We successfully identified the risk factors associated with psychological distress in EEG technicians during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Experiences of Work-Family Conflict and Mental Health Symptoms by Gender Among Physician Parents During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has placed increased strain on health care workers and disrupted childcare and schooling arrangements in unprecedented ways. As substantial gender inequalities existed in medicine before the pandemic, physician mothers may be at particular risk for adverse professional and psychological consequences. To assess gender differences in work-family factors and mental health among physician parents during the COVID-19 pandemic. This prospective cohort study included 276 US physicians enrolled in the Intern Health Study since their first year of residency training. Physicians who had participated in the primary study as interns during the 2007 to 2008 and 2008 to 2009 academic years and opted into a secondary longitudinal follow-up study were invited to complete an online survey in August 2018 and August 2020. Work-family experience included 3 single-item questions and the Work and Family Conflict Scale, and mental health symptoms included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale. The primary outcomes were work-to-family and family-to-work conflict and depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms during August 2020. Depressive symptoms between 2018 (before the COVID-19 pandemic) and 2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic) were compared by gender. Among 215 physician parents who completed the August 2020 survey, 114 (53.0%) were female and the weighted mean (SD) age was 40.1 (3.57) years. Among physician parents, women were more likely to be responsible for childcare or schooling (24.6% [95% CI, 19.0%-30.2%] vs 0.8% [95% CI, 0.01%-2.1%]; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and household tasks (31.4% [95% CI, 25.4%-37.4%] vs 7.2% [95% CI, 3.5%-10.9%]; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) during the pandemic compared with men. Women were also more likely than men to work primarily from home (40.9% [95% CI, 35.1%-46.8%] vs 22.0% [95% CI, 17.2%-26.8%]; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and reduce their work hours (19.4% [95% CI, 14.7%-24.1%] vs 9.4% [95% CI, 6.0%-12.8%]; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.007). Women experienced greater work-to-family conflict (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.79; 95% CI, 1.00 to 4.59; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.03), family-to-work conflict (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.09; 95% CI, 1.18-4.99; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.02), and depressive (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.76; 95% CI, 0.56-2.95; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.046) and anxiety (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.87; 95% CI, 1.49-4.26; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) symptoms compared with men. We observed a difference between women and men in depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic (mean [SD] PHQ-9 score: 5.05 [6.64] vs 3.52 [5.75]; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.009) that was not present before the pandemic (mean [SD] PHQ-9 score: 3.69 [5.26] vs 3.60 [6.30]; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.86). This study found significant gender disparities in work and family experiences and mental health symptoms among physician parents during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may translate to increased risk for suicide, medical errors, and lower quality of patient care for physician mothers.

"A Smartphone Intervention for People With Serious Mental Illness: Fully Remote Randomized Controlled Trial of CORE","People with serious mental illness (SMI) have significant unmet mental health needs. Development and testing of digital interventions that can alleviate the suffering of people with SMI is a public health priority. The aim of this study is to conduct a fully remote randomized waitlist-controlled trial of CORE, a smartphone intervention that comprises daily exercises designed to promote reassessment of dysfunctional beliefs in multiple domains. Individuals were recruited via the web using Google and Facebook advertisements. Enrolled participants were randomized into either active intervention or waitlist control groups. Participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition (BDI-II), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Hamilton Program for Schizophrenia Voices, Green Paranoid Thought Scale, Recovery Assessment Scale (RAS), Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), Friendship Scale, and Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) at baseline (T1), 30-day (T2), and 60-day (T3) assessment points. Participants in the active group used CORE from T1 to T2, and participants in the waitlist group used CORE from T2 to T3. Both groups completed usability and accessibility measures after they concluded their intervention periods. Overall, 315 individuals from 45 states participated in this study. The sample comprised individuals with self-reported bipolar disorder (111/315, 35.2%), major depressive disorder (136/315, 43.2%), and schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (68/315, 21.6%) who displayed moderate to severe symptoms and disability levels at baseline. Participants rated CORE as highly usable and acceptable. Intent-to-treat analyses showed significant treatmentÃƒâ€”time interactions for the BDI-II (F<sub>1,313</sub>=13.38; P&lt;.001), GAD-7 (F<sub>1,313</sub>=5.87; P=.01), RAS (F<sub>1,313</sub>=23.42; P&lt;.001), RSES (F<sub>1,313</sub>=19.28; P&lt;.001), and SDS (F<sub>1,313</sub>=10.73; P=.001). Large effects were observed for the BDI-II (d=0.58), RAS (d=0.61), and RSES (d=0.64); a moderate effect size was observed for the SDS (d=0.44), and a small effect size was observed for the GAD-7 (d=0.20). Similar changes in outcome measures were later observed in the waitlist control group participants following crossover after they received CORE (T2 to T3). Approximately 41.5% (64/154) of participants in the active group and 60.2% (97/161) of participants in the waitlist group were retained at T2, and 33.1% (51/154) of participants in the active group and 40.3% (65/161) of participants in the waitlist group were retained at T3. We successfully recruited, screened, randomized, treated, and assessed a geographically dispersed sample of participants with SMI entirely via the web, demonstrating that fully remote clinical trials are feasible in this population; however, study retention remains challenging. CORE showed promise as a usable, acceptable, and effective tool for reducing the severity of psychiatric symptoms and disability while improving recovery and self-esteem. Rapid adoption and real-world dissemination of evidence-based mobile health interventions such as CORE are needed if we are to shorten the science-to-service gap and address the significant unmet mental health needs of people with SMI during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.

"Promoting resilience in persons with serious mental health conditions during the Coronavirus pandemic","This article highlights the profound and far-reaching impact of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) health crisis on persons with serious mental health conditions. To understand and mitigate against the negative effects of the crisis on this population, we offer a resilience intervention framework that attends to three key resilience processes, namely control, coherence, and connectedness (3Cs). We then detail interventions and associated evidence-informed intervention strategies at the individual, interpersonal, and systemic levels that behavioral health professionals can employ to bolster each of the 3Cs for persons with serious mental health conditions. These intervention strategies, which must be implemented in a flexible manner, are designed to enhance the biopsychosocial functioning of persons with serious mental health conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond and strengthen their interpersonal and systemic environments. We conclude with recommendations for future directions.

"The Narrative-Crisis Model of suicide and its prediction of near-term suicide risk","Despite decades of research, much remains unknown about the transition from chronic to imminent suicidal risk. In the context of COVID-19, this question is even more urgent. The present study tests a novel, stepwise model of this transition, termed the Narrative-Crisis Model. This model proposes that, in people with chronic risk factors, stressful life events can trigger a specific progression of cognitive-affective responses (the suicidal narrative and the suicide crisis syndrome), resulting in increased near-term risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior (STB). Identification of each step in this progression provides opportunities for more precise interventions. Concurrent validity was tested with 732Ã‚Â psychiatric patients and predictive validity with 524 participants, assessed one to two months later. Chronic risk factors were measured with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Relationship Styles Questionnaire, and UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale; acute risk factors with the Stressful Life Events Questionnaire, Suicide Narrative Inventory, and Suicide Crisis Inventory. The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale was administered at the initial research assessment and follow-up. Indirect effects were significant for the full model and most pathways, in both concurrent and prospective analyses. In sum, this study provides empirical support for a novel, stepwise model of the progression from chronic to near-term suicidal risk.","Cohen, Mokhtar, Richards, Hernandez, Bloch-Elkouby, Galynker","https://doi.org/10.1111/sltb.12816","20211112","acute risk; chronic risk; stressful life events; suicidal narrative; suicide; suicide crisis syndrome","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21930,""
"Mental distress among young adults in Great Britain: long-term trends and early changes during the COVID-19 pandemic","In Great Britain, few studies documented mental health trends in young adults in the years preceding 2020, the mental health dimensions affected, and how these compare with changes observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Long-term trends in mental health among 16-34Ã‚Â year old men and women between 1991 and 2018, and changes between 2018-19 and July-September 2020 were examined using all waves from the British Household Panel Study (1991-2008), the UK Household Longitudinal Study (2009-20), and the first five UKHLS COVID-19 waves administered in April, May, June, July, and September 2020. Findings are based on the GHQ-12 continuous score (0-36), clinically significant cases (4Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°/12) and severe cases (7Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°/12) for mental distress, and item endorsements. Between 1991 and 2018, the prevalence of cases (4Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°/12) increased from 14-22% to 19-32% across groups. Increases were largest in women aged 16-24. In April 2020, the risk of caseness (4Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°/12) increased across groups by 55% to 80% compared to the 2018-19 baseline. This increase, however, rapidly diminished over time: in July-September 2020, there was only a higher risk of caseness (4Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°/12) in men aged 25-34 (prevalence ratioÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.29, 95% CI 1.01-1.65) compared to the 2018-19 baseline. Whereas distress surged in April 2020, its return to pre-pandemic levels by September 2020 highlights the nuanced impact that the pandemic may have over time. Given the magnitude of the decline in mental health over the past decade, attention must be given to young adults once the pandemic ends.","GagnÃƒÂ©, Schoon, McMunn, Sacker","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-021-02194-7","20211112","General health questionnaire; Psychological distress; Time trends; United Kingdom; Young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21931,""
"Covid-19 and its impact on global mental health","The COVID-19 pandemic may cause a possible rise in incidents associated with mental health issues which may lead to suicidal behaviors such as suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and actual suicide worldwide. COVID-19, manifested by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) in affected people, has been declared by the World Health Organization to be a public health emergency of international concern. The unpredictable consequences and uncertainty surrounding public safety, quarantine and isolation, fake news, and myths about COVID-19, particularly abounding in social media, may negatively impact an individual's mental health, causing depression, anxiety, phobia, and traumatic stress. It has been established that around 90% of global suicides are individuals who suffer from depression.

"COVID-19: insights into virus-receptor interactions","The recent outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) calls for rapid mobilization of scientists to probe and explore solutions to this deadly disease. A limited understanding of the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) relative to other coronavirus strains guides a deeper investigation into the virus/receptor interactions. The cutting-edge studies in thermodynamic and kinetic properties of interactions such as protein-protein interplays have been reviewed in many modeling and analysis studies. Highlighting the thermodynamic assessments of biological interactions and emphasizing the boosted transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 despite its high similarity in structure and sequence with other coronavirus strains is an important and highly valuable investigation that can lead scientists to discover analytical and fundamental approaches in studying virus's interactions. Accordingly, we have attempted to describe the crucial factors such as conformational changes and hydrophobicity particularities that influence on thermodynamic potentials in the SARS-COV-2Ã¢â‚¬â€°S-protein adsorption process. Discussing the thermodynamic potentials and the kinetics of the SARS-CoV-2Ã¢â‚¬â€°S-protein in its interaction with the ACE2 receptors of the host cell is a fundamental approach that would be extremely valuable in designing candidate pharmaceutical agents or exploring alternative treatments.","Sepahvandi, Ghaffari, Bahmanpour, Moztarzadeh, Zarrintaj, UludaÃ„Å¸, Mozafari","https://doi.org/10.1186/s43556-021-00033-4","20211113","ACE2; COVID-19; Conformational changes; Coronavirus; Glycosylation; Hydrophobicity; SARS-CoV-2; Thermodynamics; Virus-cell interactions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21933,""
"Research on Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Review of Methods and Implications in General Population Samples","Increasing concern about the mental health sequelae to the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted a surge in research and publications on the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder in general population samples in relation to the pandemic. We examined how posttraumatic stress disorder in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic has been studied to date and found three general themes: (1) assessment of posttraumatic stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms relied on self-report measures and often did not determine direct trauma exposure as required by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition Criterion A to diagnose posttraumatic stress disorder; (2) inadequate assessment of pre-existing mental disorders and co-occurring stress; and (3) the use of cross-sectional designs in most studies, often relying on snowball sampling strategies to conduct online surveys. Notwithstanding these methodological limitations, these studies have reported moderate to severe posttraumatic symptoms in 25.8% of the general population on average in relation to the pandemic (ranging from 4.6% to 55.3%).

"TikTok Tics: A Pandemic Within a Pandemic","TikTok is a social media platform where users create and share videos. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of this site greatly expanded. Tic and Tourette syndrome content also increased dramatically along with the number of patients with tics in neurology clinics. We compared the phenomenology of ""TikTok tics"" to typical tic disorders. We chose to analyze the most widely viewed videos and therefore focused on the most popular content creators. Videos with the keywords ""tic,"" ""Tourette,"" or ""tourettes"" were reviewed to identify content creators between March 11, 2020 and March 30, 2021. We performed a quantitative assessment of TikTok tics as well as a descriptive analysis of the entire series of videos of each content creator. The mean age of the cohort was 18.8Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old, and the majority were women. Unlike the predominance of facial movements in typical tics, arm movements were most frequent. Average tics per minute was 29, and almost all recorded TikTok tics were severe, causing significant disability. Whereas coprolalia and self-injurious behavior are only infrequently encountered in typical tic disorders, they were present in the overwhelming majority of TikTok subjects. TikTok tics are distinct from what is typically seen in patients with Tourette syndrome, although share many characteristics with functional tics. We believe this to be an example of mass sociogenic illness, which involves behaviors, emotions, or conditions spreading spontaneously through a group. A modern clinician needs to remain abreast of social media sources as knowledge of media content is essential in managing patients in the current environment.","Olvera, Stebbins, Goetz, Kompoliti","https://doi.org/10.1002/mdc3.13316","20211113","COVID; Tourette syndrome; functional neurological disorder; social media; tics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21935,""
"Mental Health Disorders in Nurses During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Implications and Coping Strategies","Nurses caring for patients who contract coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have experienced significant traumas in the form of increased workloads, negative patient outcomes, and less social support system access.

"Periodontal Diseases: Major Exacerbators of Pulmonary Diseases?","Periodontal diseases are a range of polymicrobial infectious disorders, such as gingivitis and periodontitis, which affect tooth-supporting tissues and are linked to playing a role in the exacerbation of several pulmonary diseases. Pulmonary diseases, such as pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, tuberculosis, COVID-19, and bronchiectasis, significantly contribute to poor quality of life and mortality. The association between periodontal disease and pulmonary outcomes is an important topic and requires further attention. Numerous resident microorganisms coexist in the oral cavity and lungs. However, changes in the normal microflora due to oral disease, old age, lifestyle habits, or dental intervention may contribute to altered aspiration of oral periodontopathic bacteria into the lungs and changing inflammatory responses. Equally, periodontal diseases are associated with the longitudinal decline in spirometry lung volume. Several studies suggest a possible beneficial effect of periodontal therapy in improving lung function with a decreased frequency of exacerbations and reduced risk of adverse respiratory events and morbidity. Here, we review the current literature outlining the link between the oral cavity and pulmonary outcomes and focus on the microflora of the oral cavity, environmental and genetic factors, and preexisting conditions that can impact oral and pulmonary outcomes.","Kouanda, Sattar, Geraghty","https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/4712406","20211113","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21937,""
"In-Depth Characterization of Sleep Patterns Among People with Insomnia During the Pandemic of COVID-19","The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on sleep duration and insomnia have been well studied in different studies. However, there is no study available on the characteristics of insomnia during the pandemic. This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of insomnia experienced by the general Iranian population during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional community-based study was designed. We designed an online questionnaire and sent it to Iranian people via available social platforms. The questionnaire contained questions on the socio-demographic characteristics of the participants. We used Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-2 (GAD-2) for detailed characterization of insomnia and its symptoms. In total, 675 people with insomnia with the mean age of 40.28 years (SD=11.15) participated in our study. Prevalence of difficulty initiating sleep (DIS), difficulty maintaining sleep (DMS), and early morning awakening (EMA) were 91.4%, 86.7%, and 77%, respectively. DIS, DMS, and EMA were more common in people with depression and anxiety. FCV-19 score was higher in those with more severe types of DIS, DMS, and EMA (P&lt;0.001). FCV-19 was a risk factor for all patterns of insomnia (OR=1.19, 1.12, 1.02 for DIS, DMS, and EMA, respectively). Fear of COVID-19 is a major contributing factor to insomnia patterns. Investigation of COVID-19 fear in people with insomnia and the addition of attributed relieving or management strategies to conventional management of insomnia are reasonable approaches to improve the sleep condition of people in the pandemic.","Nakhostin-Ansari, Akbarour, Haghighi, Alemohammad, Etesam, Najafi","https://doi.org/10.12865/CHSJ.47.02.02","20211113","Difficulty intiating sleep; Difficulty maintaining sleep; Early morning awakening; Insomnia; Pandemic; Sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21938,""
"How Do People Cope During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Stay Well? A Salutogenic Longitudinal Study in Israel","Employing the salutogenic approach, this longitudinal study explored the effects of coping with the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel, as it evolved from an acute to a chronic stress situation, during the first year. We examined the role of individual [sense of coherence (SOC)], social (perceived social support), and national [sense of national coherence (SONC)] coping resources, as well as situational and demographic factors, in predicting mental health and anxiety. Data was collected in five phases between March 2020 and February 2021 via a repeated panel sample and included 198 Jewish Israelis (52% males) age 18-64 (<i>M</i> = 43.5). The results confirmed the expected pattern of moving from acute to chronic stressful situation: levels of general anxiety were higher in the first phase of the pandemic outbreak as compared to the other phases. Levels of social and national coping resources significantly decreased over time. However, as expected, the salutogenic resource of the individual sense of coherence remained stable and was also found as the main predictor of both anxiety and mental health in the 5 phases of the study. Beyond the explanatory factor of SOC, mental health was better explained by the social and national coping resources, while anxiety was explained by situational factors (level of financial risk and gender). The discussion delineates the longitudinal effects of individual, social, and national coping resources on mental health and anxiety during the dynamic process of the long period of 1 year of the pandemic, evolving from acute to chronic phases of the complicated health, economic, social, and political crisis.","Mana, Catz, Mana, Neuman, Benheim, Sagy","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.729543","20211113","COVID-19; anxiety; longitudinal study; mental health; sense of coherence (SOC); sense of national coherence (SONC); social support; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21939,""

"""I took it off most of the time 'cause I felt comfortable"": unmasking, trusted others, and lessons learned from a coronavirus disease 2019 reinfection: a case report","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reinfection prevalence is unknown. It is essential to understand reinfection symptoms and, importantly, the lived experience. Case study design is the best method for understanding this contemporary pandemic and rare occurrence of reinfections. A 19-year-old White Non-Hispanic woman presented with presumed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reinfection 6Ã‚Â weeks after initially mild symptomatic infection and consistent repeat negative results. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction from saliva was used for detection. Twice-weekly saliva samples were collected (a) before initial infection, (b) resumed on day 10 after initial infection until reinfection was detected, and (c) resumed on day 10 post-reinfection. A 1.5-hour virtual interview was conducted, transcribed, and independently analyzed by two researchers. Four themes emerged: (1) perceived invincibility or inevitability and subsequent immunity increases risk of transmission via inconsistent preventive behaviors; (2) normalcy desires, trusted others, and implicit social pressures to not wear masks and distance increase one's coronavirus disease 2019 risk; (3) physical symptoms are more severe with reinfection compared with first infection; and (4) mental health sequelae (trauma and stigma) are more severe and enduring than physical health outcomes. Unmasked social interactions contradicting public health recommendations were rationalized by social circle members with heavy reliance on feeling asymptomatic, lacking a positive test (testing negative or not testing), or attributing symptoms to allergies. Stigma of testing positive and consequences of not conforming to social group behaviors is overwhelming and creates pressure to take risks.

"Mental health burden of patients with diabetes before and after the initial outbreak of COVID-19: predictors of mental health impairment","The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting people's mental health worldwide. Patients with diabetes are at risk for a severe course of illness when infected with SARS-CoV-2. The present study aims to retrospectively examine mental health changes in patients with diabetes in Germany before and after the initial COVID-19 outbreak, and to furthermore explore potential predictors of such changes. Over the course of eight weeks from April to June 2020, 253 individuals diagnosed with diabetes participated in an online cross-sectional study. Participants completed an anonymous survey including demographics, depression (PHQ-2) and generalized anxiety symptoms (GAD-2), distress (DT), and health status (EQ-5D-3L). In addition, all instruments used were modified to retrospectively ask participants to recall their mental health and health status before the outbreak had started. Additionally examined factors were COVID-19-related fear, trust in governmental actions to face the pandemic, and the subjective level of information about COVID-19. This study shows a significant increase in prevalence of depression symptoms, generalized anxiety symptoms and distress, as well as significantly decreased health statuses in diabetes patients after the initial COVID-19 outbreak. Increased depression symptoms, generalized anxiety symptoms and distress were predicted by COVID-19-related fear, whereas trust in governmental actions to face COVID-19 predicted higher depression symptoms. The results indicate a negative impact of the initial COVID-19 outbreak on mental health and health status in patients with diabetes. In order to improve the efficacy of psychological support strategies for diabetes patients during the pandemic, possible predictors of mental health impairment such as the aforementioned should be examined more thoroughly and addressed more openly.","Moradian, Teufel, Jahre, Musche, Fink, Dinse, Schweda, WeismÃƒÂ¼ller, DÃƒÂ¶rrie, Tan, Skoda, BÃƒÂ¤uerle","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-12101-z","20211112","Anxiety; COVID-19; Changes in mental health; Depression; Diabetes; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21944,""

"Effect of dialectical behavior group therapy on the anxiety and depression of medical students under the normalization of epidemic prevention and control for the COVID-19 epidemic: a randomized study","During the epidemic, the mental health of college students was generally poor, especially anxiety and depression, which should be treated using counseling and intervention. This study aimed to observe the influence of dialectical behavior therapy on the anxiety and depression of medical students during the normalization of the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic. A total of 26 medical students (experimental group) were treated with dialectical behavior therapy intervention for 4 weeks. Changes in depression, anxiety, and stress levels were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, the Somatic Self-rating Scale (SSS), and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10). This group was compared with 26 medical students (control group) without intervention. The value-added scores of the PHQ-9 (t=2.543, P=0.014) and GAD-7 scales (t=3.790, P=0.000) in the experimental group were significantly higher than those in the control group, while in the SSS scale, the value-added score of the depressive symptoms subscale (t=2.234, P=0.030) in the experimental group was significantly higher than that of the control group. For the total score of the PSS-10 scale (t=2.435, P=0.018), the value-added score of the experimental group was significantly higher than that of the control group. The intervention of dialectical behavior therapy can effectively alleviate the depression and anxiety of medical students during the normalization of epidemic prevention and control.

"Virtual Reality Experience Intervention May Reduce Responsive Behaviors in Nursing Home Residents with Dementia: A Case Series","People with advanced dementia often exhibit responsive behaviors such as apathy, depression, agitation, aggression, and psychosis. Non-pharmacological approaches (e.g., listening to music, watching television, doing arts and crafts) are now considered as a first-line strategy to manage responsive behaviors in clinical practice due to the potential risks associated with the antipsychotic medications. To date, no evaluations of immersive non-head mounted virtual reality (VR) experience as a non-pharmacologic approach for people with advanced dementia living in nursing homes have been reported. To evaluate the feasibility (acceptance and safety) of VR experience. A single site case series (nonrandomized and unblinded) with a convenience sample (NÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 24; ageÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 85.8Ã‚Â±8.6 years; Cognitive Performance Scale scoreÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 3.4Ã‚Â±0.6) measuring depression and agitation before and after the intervention. The intervention was a 30-min long research coordinator- facilitated VR experience for two weeks (10 sessions). The intervention was feasible (attrition rateÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0% ; adverse eventsÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0). A reduction in depression and in agitation was observed after the intervention. However, we suggest extreme caution in interpreting this result considering the study design and small sample size. This study provides the basis for conducting a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of VR experience on responsive behaviors in nursing homes. Since our intervention uses a smart remote-controlled projector without a headset, infectious exposure can be avoided following the COVID-19 pandemic-induced physical distancing policy in care homes.","Sultana, Campbell, Jennings, Montero-Odasso, Orange, Knowlton, St George, Bryant","https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-210010","20211115","Dementia; nursing home; responsive behaviors; virtual reality experience intervention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","",21947,""
