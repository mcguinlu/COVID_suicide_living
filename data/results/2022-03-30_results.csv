"Impact of COVID-19 on University Studentsâ€™ Quality of life and mental health in Greece: A Cross-sectional study (preprint)","COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted an increasing deterioration of university studentsâ€™ quality of life and mental health. We conducted a cross-sectional study using an online interview survey on students at public universities in Greece to better understand the effects of the pandemic on their quality of life and mental health. Three tools were used (WHOQOL-BREF, IES-R, and HADS).1.266 university students from public Greek Universities participated in the study. We observed that 55,8% had a score lower than 50 in the psychological domain and 52,3% in the social domain of WHOQOL-BREF. Additionally, 46.6% of the respondents had a score of 37+ on the IES-R questionnaire, 45% of the respondents had abnormal results regarding anxiety and 33.6% had abnormal results regarding depression on the HADS questionnaire. Due to the long duration of the pandemic and measures such as lockdown and stay-at-home orders, the COVID-19 pandemic brings negative impacts on the quality of life and wellbeing of students. The findings of our study highlight the urgent need to develop interventions and strategies to address the quality of life and mental health consequences of university students.","Tsami, Faidra Foteini, Kanellopoulou, Aimilia, Alexopoulou-Prounia, Loukia, Tsapara, Aggeliki, Katsadoros, Kiriakos, Alexopoulos, Panos, Vantarakis, Apostolos","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1453057/v2","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-30","",29210,""
"Using Disaggregated and Latent Variable Analysis to Investigate the Role of Socioeconomic Factors in Concerns and Expectations Related to the Covid-19 Pandemic in Chile (preprint); Social effects | gender effects | healthcare | social security | coronavirus","The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a complex set of psychosocial effects, such as anxiety, depression, financial loss, burnout, and fear of infection. We study the role of socioeconomic factors in the concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the expectations of social changes on a post-pandemic future. The analysis is performed by collecting 22 indicators from a sample of 4,395 adults in Chile. The analysis is performed first by descriptive statistics, then by fusing the indictors into three latent variables, and finally by modelling each indicator as a separate choice. We find that lower-income people are significantly more worried about a range of financial and health issues arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, including concerns about being infected by the virus, losing their job and not being able to pay debts. The concern about facing a large economic crisis is significantly larger in the extremes, i.e., for low- and high-income groups. Age, gender, having a university degree, the possibility of working from home, and the general health status also influence the fears related to the COVID-19 pandemic. From a policy point of view, we conclude that strong policy interventions are necessary to reduce the uneven negative effects of COVID-19 in society, including material and mental health problems. From a methodological point of view, our results show that, while using a latent variable approach allows disentangling the main drivers of the phenomenon, rich content may be omitted when a disaggregated analysis is neglected, therefore both approaches are complementary.","Tirachini, Alejandro, Guevara, Angelo, Munizaga, Marcela, Carrasco, Juan Antonio, Astroza, SebastiÃ¡n, Hurtubia, Ricardo","https://www.google.com/search?q=Using+Disaggregated+and+Latent+Variable+Analysis+to+Investigate+the+Role+of+Socioeconomic+Factors+in+Concerns+and+Expectations+Related+to+the+Covid-19+Pandemic+in+Chile+(preprint);+Social+effects+|+gender+effects+|+healthcare+|+social+security+|+coronavirus","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-30","",29211,""
"Examination of risk exposure models during COVID-19 in relation to youth life satisfaction and internalizing symptoms (preprint)","This study examined mediation of a negative COVID-impact on the relationship between risk exposure, and life satisfaction and internalizing symptoms in youth (aged 9â€“18). Four operationalizations of risk exposure were applied;an Additive versus a Cumulative Risk Model (ARM and CRM), risk clusters and the most salient risk factors. Results showed that a stronger negative COVID-impact is related to lower life satisfaction, more internalizing symptoms and higher additive and cumulative risk. ARM and CRMâ€™s effect on lower life satisfaction is mediated through negative COVID-impact, though not for internalizing symptoms. Clusters of risk factors and risk factors within clusters significantly related to a stronger negative COVID-impact are the clusters â€˜Individual factorsâ€™ (low self-control), â€˜Parentingâ€™ (negative mother-child interaction and low parental responsiveness), â€˜Maternal mental healthâ€™ and â€˜Demographic factorsâ€™ (low SES and high paternal education). From all significant risk factors, low self-control, low parental responsiveness, negative mother-child interaction and low SES were most salient.","Snetselaar, Romy, Liber, Juliette, Geurts, Suzanne, Koning, Ina","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1402875/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-30","",29212,""
"What works for whom with telemental health? A rapid realist review (preprint)","Background:  Telemental health (delivering mental health care via video calls, telephone calls or text messages) is increasingly widespread. Telemental health appears to be useful and effective in providing care to some service users in some settings, especially during an emergency restricting face-to-face contact such as the COVID-19 pandemic. However, important limitations have been reported, and telemental health implementation risks reinforcing pre-existing inequalities in service provision. If it is to be widely incorporated in routine care, a clear understanding is needed of when and for whom it is an acceptable and effective approach, and when face-to-face care is needed. Objective: The aim of this rapid realist review was to develop theory about which telemental health approaches work, or do not work, for whom, in which contexts and through what mechanisms. Methods: Rapid realist reviewing involves synthesising relevant evidence and stakeholder expertise to allow timely development of context-mechanism-outcome (CMO) configurations in areas where evidence is urgently needed to inform policy and practice. The CMOs encapsulate theories about what works for whom, and by what mechanisms. Sources included eligible papers from (a) two previous systematic reviews conducted by our team on telemental health, (b) an updated search using the strategy from these reviews, (c) a call for relevant evidence, including ""grey literature"", to the public and key experts, and (d) website searches of relevant voluntary and statutory organisations. CMOs formulated from these sources were iteratively refined, including through (a) discussion with an expert reference group including researchers with relevant lived experience and front-line clinicians and (b) consultation with experts focused on three priority groups: 1) children and young people, 2) users of inpatient and crisis care services, and 3) digitally excluded groups. Results: A total of 108 scientific and grey literature sources were included. From our initial CMOs, we derived 30 overarching CMOs within four domains: 1) connecting effectively;2) flexibility and personalisation;3) safety, privacy and confidentiality;and 4) therapeutic quality and relationship. Reports and stakeholder input emphasised the importance of personal choice, privacy and safety, and therapeutic relationships in telemental health care. The review also identified particular service users likely to be disadvantaged by telemental health implementation, and a need to ensure that face-to-face care of equivalent timeliness remains available. Mechanisms underlying successful and unsuccessful application of telemental health are discussed. Conclusions: Service user choice, privacy and safety, the ability to connect effectively and fostering strong therapeutic relationships, need to be prioritised in delivering telemental health care. Guidelines and strategies co-produced with service users and frontline staff are needed to optimise telemental health implementation in real-world settings.

"Fear and Anxiety related to Covid-19 pandemic may predispose to perinatal depression (preprint)","Purpose:  . The COVID-19 pandemic situation significantly affected the mental health of the general and clinical population including that of pregnant and puerperal women due to lack of access to healthcare, social isolation, sleep loss, feelings of fear and uncertainties. However, few studies investigated which COVID-19-related psychopathological determinants may predispose to perinatal depression. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 related anxiety and fear on perinatal depression . Methods: . We retrospectively screened 184 perinatal outpatients afferent to Perinatal Mental Health outpatient service, during March 2020-March 2021, by using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), the Fear of COVID-19 (FCV-19-S) and the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS). Results: . The mean EPDS score was 9.0 (SD=5.3), experiencing a clinically relevant perinatal depression in 45.7% of the sample. The mean FCV-19-S score was 15.0 (SD=6.2) and CAS was 1.7 (SD=2.8). Linear regression analyses demonstrated that FCV-19-S (F(1,68)=12.218, R 2 =0.152, p&lt;0.001) and CAS scores (F(1,68)=10.278, R 2 =0.131, p=0.002) statistically significantly predicted EPDS total scores. A positive correlation was reported between FCV-19-S and EPDS (r=0.390, p&lt;0.001) and between CAS and EPDS (r=0.362, p&lt;0.001) . Conclusion:  COVID-19 pandemic with its subsequent isolation, quarantine and lockdown might determine increased levels of anxiety and fear, particularly among women in their perinatal period who may experience a deprivation of their normal sources of family and social support and, hence, experience psychological distress, even in those women without a previous psychiatric history. Further preventive and screening strategies should be implemented in order to early identify at-risk pregnant and puerperal women during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Orsolini, Laura, Pompili, Simone, Mauro, Antonella, Salvi, Virginio, Volpe, Umberto","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1282596/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-30","",29214,""
"â€œCompared to COVID, HIV is nothingâ€: exploring how onshore international students in an Australian City navigate COVID-19 versus BBV/STI risk (preprint)","Background:  This study explored how the COVID-19 pandemic may be shaping BBV/STI risk and protective practices among international students. Methods:  This qualitative study interviewed 16 international university students in Sydney. Generated data were processed using NVivo and analysis was guided by reflexive thematic analysis. Results:  Participants experienced elevated mental health distress because of the COVID-19 pandemic and some reported engaging in casual sexual hook-ups as a strategy to seek relief from the mental health distress they experienced. Some of those sexual hook-ups were condomless partly because COVID-related disruptions impacted condom accessibility during lockdowns. Also, the preventive practices of some participants who reported being sexually active during the lockdowns were focused on preventing COVID-19 while BBV/STI got lesser attention. Conclusion:  This study indicates a need for comprehensive public health response to the near-endemic COVID-19 situation, that focuses on preventing the spread of COVID-19 and the sexual spread of BBVs and infections.","Okeke, Sylvester Reuben","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1465507/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-30","",29215,""
"COVID-19 and the Accelerated Shift to Technology-Enabled Work from Home (preprint); Work from Home | Digitalization | COVID-19 | Labour Markets | Labour Productivity","People have been working remotely from many locations for many years, but the growth in work from home has historically tended to be slow in both the USA and the EU. Most of those who worked from home did so for only a portion, often a small portion, of their working hours. COVID-19 has given a huge impetus to working from home for those jobs that can be performed from home. Work from home can be a driver of sustainability in the context of the green and digital transition. Data on productivity effects of this shift does not offer a compelling view on whether there have been gains or losses, given the multifaceted set of elements that need to be considered and contrasted. However, many workers appreciate and benefit from the flexibility that work from home provides. At the same time, this shift has significant implications for many aspects of our lives, and it raises a number of possible concerns that may need to be addressed by public policy. There is a risk that some groups (women, young workers and those who are less technically capable of using digital technology) may suffer from decline in wages and loss of opportunities for promotion and training. There are some indications of mental health issues due in part to the inability to separate work from private life, increased work hours, and the need to deal with children who are at home, but it is difficult to disentangle aspects that are caused by work from home in general from those that are primarily related to the pandemic. By adopting a comparative approach, this research note explores these aspects and the main differences between the USA and the EU. It concludes by highlighting the key implications for public policy in terms of work-life balance, gender gaps, skill acquisition, modernisation of workflows, technology adoption, managerial culture and flexibility enhancement.","Marcus, J.

"An investigation into the wellbeing of optometry students (preprint)","Introduction:  Wellbeing is synonymous with positive mental health and impacts the efficacy of student learning. The wellbeing of optometry students is an understudied topic. The wellbeing of optometry students studying in a blended undergraduate course during the COVID-19 pandemic was also unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the status of optometry students wellbeing during COVID-19, by identifying their experiences of symptoms of anxiety and depression. Moreover, to determine to what extent students experience these symptoms and what specific factors influenced their wellbeing. Methodology: Participants from four year groups completed online questionnaires. The response rate was 78.38% (n=87). Zung self-rating depression and anxiety scale questionnaires were used to determine whether students identified with a given list of symptoms commonly linked to anxiety or depression. Through open ended questions students wellbeing was further investigated. Results: Participants experienced normal levels of anxiety symptoms and most participants experienced mild to moderate depression symptoms. Of concern is the severe depression symptoms identified in the third and fourth year student cohorts. Mental health, Academics, Lifestyle, Relationships and Sleep were main themes identified that had an influence on the students general wellbeing. Uncertainty and Physical Health themes were additional influences of wellbeing specifically related to COVID-19. Contribution: This preliminary study into wellbeing of optometry students was undertaken in a unique timeframe, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The results provide a platform to determine baseline wellbeing in the future student cohorts and the exploratory identification of factors causing stress and anxiety. The impact of COVID-19 on the wellbeing of students is evident. Conclusion: Optometry students do experience symptoms of depression. COVID-19 has had considerable impact on their academic experience and their wellbeing.

The book introduces thought-provoking cutting-edge research by blending datafication and state theory and setting several European city-regional case studies including Tallinn, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Cardiff, Glasgow, Bilbao, and Belfast, among others. The flagship Big Tech firms of surveillance capitalism, such as Google and Facebook/Metaverse, have already assumed many functions previously associated with the nation-state, from cartography to citizen surveillance, which has deterritorialised citizenship and thus posed the question around the need to better articulate postpandemic technopolitical democracies in Europe. In the context of COVID-19, the production and governance of urban space has experienced a rapid digitalization and datafication, creating new challenges for citizenship. The urban realm is not only the environment where a new standard for digital development is set but also the realm from which rescaling nation-states are pervasively emerging. This rescaling has resulted in a potential hollowing-out of nation-state space, undermining its heretofore privileged position as the only natural platform and geographical expression for the monopoly of sensory and technopolitical power and further creating techno-political and city-regional dynamics inside statesâ€™ border while paradoxically reinforcing their external borders. Rescaling cover demands for data privacy, ownership, sovereignty, donation, co-operation, self-determination, trust, access, and ethics as well as AI transparency, algorithmic automatization, and, ultimately, democratic accountability for digital citizenship, which inevitably may transform our current interpretation of the nation-state as the clear and coherent mapping of a political territory. Furthermore, this book aims to challenge the existing interpretation of how emerging digital citizenship regimes are rescaling the associated spaces/practices of European nation-states. Consequently, Emerging Digital Citizenship Regimes explores the roles played by digital citizenship in the context of changing geographies of the nation-state in Europe in the aftermath of the global pandemic;and reframes the concept of digital citizenship amid the rescaling of nation-states in Europe by connecting it to the increasing digitalisation of urban environment as a corollary of pandemic. By theorising the concept of citizenship in the digital age through the lens of the evolutionary character of its classical concept or by drawing upon the narratives regarding the democratising potential and risks of the Internet, Emerging Digital Citizenship Regimes explores the complex interaction of social and political variables shaping offline and online civic practices and their intertwined relation to the urban environment, analysing the way it is produced and governed in the COVID-19 new context.","Calzada, Igor","https://www.google.com/search?q=Emerging+Digital+Citizenship+Regimes:+Postpandemic+Technopolitical+Democracies+(preprint);+digital+citizenship+|+rescaling+|+pandemic+|+COVID-19+|+blockchain+|+dataism+|+Brexit+|+devolution+|+foundational+economy+|+algorithmic+|+liquid+|+metropolitan+|+stateless+|+action+research+|+mixedmethods+|+nation-states+|+city-regions+|+Tallinn+|+Estonia+|+Amsterdam+|+Netherlands","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-30","",29218,""
"COVID-19 at Work: Exposing How Risk Is Assessed and Its Consequences in England and Sweden (preprint); health and safety | risk assessment | COVID-19 | England | Sweden | work","The crisis which arose suddenly at the beginning of 2020 relating to coronavirus was immediately centred on risk. Predictions had to be made swiftly regarding how it would spread, who it might affect and what measures could be taken to prevent exposure in everyday social interaction, including in the workplace. This was in no way a straightforward assessment, because initially so much was unknown. Those gaps in our knowledge have since, partially, been ameliorated. It is evident that not all those exposed to COVID-19 become ill, and many who contract the virus remain asymptomatic, so that the odds on becoming seriously ill may seem small. But those odds are also stacked against certain segments of the population. The likelihood of mortality and morbidity are associated with age and ethnicity as well as pre-existing medical conditions (such as diabetes), but also with poverty which correlates to the extent of exposure in certain occupations. Some risks arise which remain less predictable, as previously healthy people with no signs of particular vulnerability can experience serious long term illness as well and in rare cases will even die. Perceptions of risk in different countries have led to particular measures taken, ranging from handwashing to social distancing, use of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as face coverings, and even â€˜lockdownsâ€™ which have taken various forms. Use of testing and vaccines also became part of the remedial landscape, with their availability and administration being controlled by different states around the globe in different ways, raising also questions of relative ethical responsibilities of governments and individuals. This complex assessment of risk has then to be translated into the workplace, raising issues of occupational health in terms of exposure to serious illness, ongoing ill health or even potentially death. Many people at work have also experienced stress linked to overwork caused by the effects of the virus on their jobs, namely the increased scale of demands or the new modes of performance of their tasks, for example telework from home (especially in the context of homeschooling when schools are closed). For others, being in a work environment where they are more exposed to the virus and its effects (even subject to guidance as to the best ways to promote safety) does damage to their mental health. How these risks to physical and mental health are to be factored into any assessment for well-being at work is a highly topical issue and the focus of our analysis here. Further, we are aware that what is meant by being at work is itself controversial, given a growing tendency for putative employers to â€˜outsourceâ€™ more risky forms of work, contracting out work when they could face liability for what would otherwise be regarded as occupational risks. It is in this context that we offer a comparative study of England and Sweden. Current statistics indicate that the UK had the 14th highest death rate in a league table of the European Economic Area (EEA) and the UK, while Sweden came 19th. Allegations have been made by labour lawyers that the UK Governmentâ€™s handling of the pandemic has been highly problematic, highlighting the failings of the UKâ€™s labour laws and social security systems. In Sweden, the excess mortality rate during the pandemic was relatively low in comparison with Europe more generally. Swedes were recommended to work from home as much as possible, although â€˜lockdownsâ€™ like those implemented in the UK were not imposed. This means that questions concerning risk assessment and risk management at work have also been of paramount importance for Swedish individuals and society. On 9 February 2022, most COVID-19-related public health restrictions ended in Sweden, as well as free public testing. In England most restrictions were abolished on February 24 and free testing is set to end on 1 April 2022, despite criticisms from scientists and medical professionals. Now is a good time to look back at the different the legal responses to the crisis and also to consider the legal duties of employers now that such public health measures have been lifted. The pandemic is in a new phase, arguably making everyday occupational health and safety issues such as risk assessment more important than ever. In this article, we consider the private and public labour laws and regulatory systems which evaluate and regulate risk at work in our respective countries. The scope (and limitations) of their application and operation have in various respects been exposed in the COVID-19 crisis, such that there may be scope for learning from each othersâ€™ successes and failings. We should stress at the outset the limitations of this comparative analysis. We are not considering the availability of sick pay and various benefits and allowances made available over the period of the pandemic, and their relative adequacy or otherwise, which has been discussed extensively elsewhere. We see risk assessment as playing two roles outlined in the next part of our paper. One is pre-emptive so as (in regulatory terms) to prevent harms rather than only compensating for such harms after the fact. The second role is defensive, protecting an employer from liability by demonstrating that due care was taken. Both roles have inherent problems that comes to light in the COVID-19 pandemic. We then go on to examine who is the legitimate subject of any risk assessment: which â€˜employeesâ€™, â€˜workersâ€™ and even â€˜independent contractorsâ€™ are the legitimate subject of interest? The fourth part considers what risks are deemed relevant, physical or psychological? Finally, we consider the relevant roles of different actors, which goes beyond a standard dichotomy between â€˜governments and individualsâ€™, considering the functions of labour inspection bodies, employers and trade unions, and scope for remedial redress initiated by individuals at work. We note that the aversion of risk raises issues around provision of state support, including inspection, and engagement with collective worker voice that require further attention. We suspect that the similarities and differences that we identify reveal also underlying societal norms, such as the risks which are considered tolerable and how we accept this being decided. In particular, the ways in which risks are framed in the Swedish system as needing to be avoided, as opposed to managed, seems to have made a difference in the context of the coronavirus crisis. What may also have played a part in more effective management of risk is the collective representation of workers through Swedish processes.","Andersson, Peter, Novitz, Tonia","https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID-19+at+Work:+Exposing+How+Risk+Is+Assessed+and+Its+Consequences+in+England+and+Sweden+(preprint);+health+and+safety+|+risk+assessment+|+COVID-19+|+England+|+Sweden+|+work","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-30","",29219,""
"Non-parenteral Ketamine for Depression: A Practical Discussion on Addiction Potential and Recommendations for Judicious Prescribing","Intravenous (IV) ketamine is increasingly used off-label at subanesthetic doses for its rapid antidepressant effect, and intranasal (IN) esketamine has been recently approved in several countries for treating depression. The clinical utility of these treatments is limited by a paucity of publicly funded IV ketamine and IN esketamine programs and cost barriers to private treatment programs, as well as the drug cost for IN esketamine itself, which makes generic ketamine alternatives an attractive option. Though evidence is limited, use of non-parenteral racemic ketamine formulations (oral, sublingual, and IN) may offer more realistic access in less rigidly supervised settings, both for acute and maintenance treatment in select cases. However, the psychiatric literature has repeatedly cautioned on the addictive potential of ketamine and raised caution for both less supervised and longer-term use of ketamine. To date, these concerns have not been discussed in view of available evidence, nor have they been discussed within a broader clinical context. This paper examines the available relevant literature and suggests that ketamine misuse risks appear not dissimilar to those of other well-established and commonly prescribed agents with abuse potential, such as stimulants or benzodiazepines. As such, ketamine prescribing should be considered in a similar risk/benefit context to balance patient access and need for treatment with concern for potential substance misuse.

"COVID-19 Yogun Bakim Hastalarinda Sekonder Bakteriyel Enfeksiyon Durumu ve Mortalite &Uuml;zerine Etkisi","AmaÃ§: Siddetli akut solunum yolu sendromu-koronavirÃ¼s-2 (SARS-CoV-2) ile enfekte hastalarda bakteriyel enfeksiyonun prevalansi, insidansi ve Ã¶zellikleri ile bilgiler sinirlidir. Biz bu Ã§alismada entÃ¼be olarak yogun bakim Ã¼nitelerinde (YB&Uuml;) takip edilen COVID-19 hastalarinda sekonder bakteriyel enfeksiyon (SBE) gelisimi ve bunun mortaliteye etkisini arastirmaya Ã§alistik. GereÃ§ ve YÃ¶ntem: Bu Ã§alismada COVID-19 YB&Uuml;â€™de takip edilen hastalarin verileri retrospektif olarak tarandi. PCR testi pozitif olup entÃ¼be olarak takip edilen hastalar Ã§alismaya dahil edildi. SBEâ€™nin varligi yogun bakima kabul tarihinden 48 saatten sonraki dÃ¶nemde ortaya Ã§ikan CRP yÃ¼ksekligi, prokalsitonin yÃ¼ksekligi, kÃ¼ltÃ¼r sonuÃ§lari ve enfeksiyon hastaliklari konsÃ¼ltasyonuna gÃ¶re karar verildi. SBEâ€™nin tanisinin kondugu an â€œSekonder Bakteriyel Enfeksiyon Zamaniâ€ olarak kabul edildi. Bulgular: Tablo 1 ve Tablo 2â€™de hastalarin demografik verileri ve laboratuvar sonuÃ§lari Ã¶zetlenmistir. Elde edilen bulgularda;hastalarin 24â€™Ã¼nde kan kÃ¼ltÃ¼rÃ¼nde Ã¼reme, 18â€™inde trakeal kÃ¼ltÃ¼rde, 6â€™sinda idrar, 8â€™inde katater, 14â€™Ã¼nde Ã§oklu Ã¼remeler mevcuttu (Tablo 4). SBEâ€™nin tespit edildigi grupta mortalite daha yÃ¼ksek olup (p&lt;0,001) (Tablo 2), katateri olan hasta grubunda ise;sekonder bakteriyel enfeksiyon zamani daha erkendi (p&lt;0,05) (Tablo 3). SonuÃ§: Antibiyoterapi COVID-19 tedavisi iÃ§in etkisiz olsa da, COVID19 sÃ¼phesi olan veya belgelenmis hastalarda ko-enfeksiyonlar dislanamadiginda veya olasi SBE nedeni gibi Ã§esitli nedenlerle uygulanmaktadir. SBEâ€™li hastalarin oraninin %5-30 arasinda degistigi Ã§esitli kohort raporlarinda bildirilmistir. 2003â€™teki ilk SARS-CoV salgini sirasinda, hastalarin %30â€™una SBE teshisi konmus ve ko-enfeksiyon, hastalik siddeti ile pozitif olarak iliskilendirmistir. Ayrica bu SARS-CoV pandemisi sirasinda yogun antibiyotik kullaniminin, Ã§oklu ilaÃ§ direnci olan bakterilerin prevalansinda artisa neden oldugu da gÃ¶rÃ¼lmÃ¼stÃ¼r. SonuÃ§ olarak;antibiyotige direnÃ§li bakterilerin artan sayisi bizi sadece bakteriyel enfeksiyonlara karsi daha savunmasiz birakmiyor, ayni zamanda viral pandemiler sirasinda da savasma gÃ¼cÃ¼mÃ¼zÃ¼n azalmasina neden oluyor.

"COVID-19 ile Myastenia Gravis Birlikteligindeki Bir Olguda Tedavi Stratejileri Nelerdir?","AmaÃ§: OtoimmÃ¼n nÃ¶romÃ¼skÃ¼ler bir hastalik olan Myastenia gravis (MG), siddetli COVID-19 iÃ§in bir risk faktÃ¶rÃ¼ olabilir. Su anda, COVID-19â€™un MG hastalarini nasil etkiledigi net bilinmemektedir. MGâ€™de COVID-19â€™un yÃ¶netimine yÃ¶nelik mevcut kilavuzlar, uzmanlarin teorik olarak fikir birligine dayanmaktadir. Amacimiz, eslik eden COVID-19 enfeksyonu eslik eden MG hastalarinda plazmaferez tedavisinin prognoz Ã¼zerine etkinligini vurgulamaktir. Olgu: Elli bes yas erkek hasta -24 yildir MG tanisi ile takipli- acil servise 2 gÃ¼ndÃ¼r devam eden nefes darligi ve 4 gÃ¼n Ã¶nce yapilan COVID PZR testi pozitifligi ile basvurdu. Favipiravir kullanmiyordu. NÃ¶rolojik muayede solunum sikintisi ve bilateral parsiyel oftalmoparezi mevcuttu. HRCTâ€™de bilateral yaygin opasiteler ve buzlu cam gÃ¶rÃ¼nÃ¼mÃ¼ mevcuttu. COVID-19 pnomonisi ve miyatenik kriz Ã¶n tanisi ile nÃ¶roloji yogun bakim Ã¼nitesine yatirildi. Yatis esnasinda nazal kanul ile 6 l/dk O2 tedavisi baslandi. Ancak SO2 â€™de progesif dÃ¼sÃ¼s nedeni (Sekil 1) ile HFNC ile O2 destegine geÃ§ildi. Favipiravire ek olarak antibiyoterapi (seftriakson) baslandi (Tablo 1) ve 2 doz konvelan plazma tedavisi uygulandi. Ancak solunum sikintisinda progresyon nedeni ile 3. gÃ¼n 1000 mg/gÃ¼n puls steroid tedavisine geÃ§ildi. Besinci gÃ¼n progresif hipoksemisi nedeni ile entÃ¼be edildi (Sekil 2). Altinci gÃ¼n bir kÃ¼r sitokin filtesi uygulandi. Sekizinci gÃ¼n miyastenik kriz nedeni ile 5 gÃ¼n gÃ¼nlÃ¼k plamaferez yapildi. Herhangi bir kompliaksyon olusmadi. On Ã¼Ã§Ã¼ncÃ¼ gÃ¼nde hasta ekstube oldu. Yatisinin 20. gÃ¼nÃ¼ azothipurin 25 mg/gÃ¼n, oral prendnizlon 32 mg/gÃ¼n ve pridostigmin 5/gÃ¼n ile tam iyilik hali ile taburcu edildi. SonuÃ§: COVID-19â€™un bir krizi tetikledigi bu hastada, plazmaferez uygulamasinin, hastanin miyastenik krizinin tetikleyicilerinden biri olabilecek COVID-19 enfeksiyonuna bagli enflamatuvar sitokinleri ortadan kaldirarak iyilesmeyi hizlandirdigina inaniyoruz. COVID-19 tedavisi olarak plazma degisiminin etkinligini degerlendirmek iÃ§in Ã§alismalar devam etmektedir. Hali hazirda mevcut olan intravenÃ¶z immÃ¼noglobulin (&Iacute;V&Iacute;G), COVID-19â€™a karsi koruyucu antikorlara sahip olmayabilir, bu nedenle, bu olguda plazmaferez tercih edildi.

"Prevalence of Anxiety and Depression in Iranian Health Care Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review and","Introduction: Covid-19 pandemic has imposed a significant effect on mental health of the health care workers. The present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed at determining the pooled prevalence of anxiety and depression among Iranian health care workers during the Covid-19 pandemic. Material and Methods: To conduct this systematic review and meta-analysis, Web of Science, Scopus, Medline (PubMed), Embase, SID, Magiran databases and Google Scholar search engine were investigated to find studies over the prevalence of anxiety and depression among health care workers during the Covid-19 pandemic from December 2019 to lune 10, 2021. Quality of the primary studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa tool and the random effects model was applied to estimate the pooled prevalence. Furthermore, chi(2) test and I-2 index were used to evaluate the degree of heterogeneity among the studies. The pooled prevalence of anxiety and depression in different subgroups was reported based on the severity of anxiety and depression, assessment tools, and staff jobs. Results: Of 488 articles obtained as a result of the initial search, 10 related studies were identified and entered into the systematic review and meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of anxiety was 42% (95% CI: 25-75) and the pooled prevalence of depression was 35% (95% CI: 19-55). The pooled prevalence of anxiety was 54% (95% CI: 39-70) in the occupational group of nurses and 29% (95% CI: 17-44) among all health care workers. The pooled prevalence of depression was 46% (95% CI: 30 to 63) and 17% (95% CI: 10 to 26) among nurses and all health workers, respectively. Conclusion: According to the findings, a high prevalence of anxiety and depression was observed among the health care workers of Iran during the Covid-19 epidemic. The authorities are required to plan for preventive and therapeutic interventions to reduce the psychological burden of the epidemic.","Rezaei-Hachesu, V.; Fe'li, S.

Health seeking behavior has changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. What is added by this report? Compared with 2019, overall pediatric emergency department visits decreased by 51%, 22%, and 23% during 2020, 2021, and January 2022, respectively. COVID-19 visits predominated across all pediatric ages;visits for other respiratory illnesses mostly declined. Number and proportion of visits increased for certain injuries (e.g., firearm injuries, self-harm, and drug poisonings), some chronic diseases, and behavioral health concerns, with variations by age group.

"Chaos and complexity: entrepreneurial planning during pandemic","Entrepreneurs are argued to have higher foresight, ability to handle complex situations, and superior planning. This qualitative study attempted to validate these assertions in the pandemic context of COVID19. The pandemic created a complex and chaotic business environment. The information was available to businesspersons of the region before a quarter. Did they show adequate foresight to assimilate information and respond to the crisis? How complex was the situation for planning? What entrepreneurial characteristics were demonstrated? A qualitative study design sought and analyzed business ownerâ€™s responses to these questions. Though the findings are not generalizable, it indicated inadequate but reactive response. Secondly, the challenge of reduced cash flow prompted cost cutting as an operational response. The plan of winning trust in transactions was also an operational response. A few perceived pandemic as an opportunity for product innovation. Business owners demonstrated empathy toward their employees. Interestingly, most business owners indicated fluidity and inadequate information as a barrier for planning. Information acquisition, seeking help from network, responding to imminent events, wait and watch, were predominant operational responses, whereas innovation and shifting of sectors were strategic responses considered by few entrepreneurs. The perception of superior entrepreneurial abilities in anticipating events, planning, strategizing, and handling complexity was less evidenced in this study.","Pathak, Mallika Devi, Kar, Brajaballav, Panda, Madhu Chhanda","https://www.google.com/search?q=Chaos+and+complexity:+entrepreneurial+planning+during+pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Global Entrepreneurship Research;: 1-11, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-30","",29235,""

Bu hastalarda hizla ARDS, sepsis ve multiorgan yetmezlikleri gelisebilmektedir. Tedavide yeterli oksijenizasyonun saglanmasi Ã¶nemli rol oynamaktadir. Bu Ã§alismada yogun bakim Ã¼nitesinde yatmakta olan hastalarin uygun farmakolojik tedavi ve oksijenizasyonlarinin saglanmasiyla beraber prone pozisyonunun tedavi Ã¼zerine etkisini incelemeyi amaÃ§ladik. Hastanemiz anestezi yogun bakim 1-2 Ã¼nitesinde COVID-19 tanisiyla Ocak 2021-Aralik 2021 tarihleri arasinda takip edilen 548 hastayi retrospektif olarak inceledik.

Methods: Some 40 people (18 female, 22 male) receiving in-centre haemodialysis reported COVID-19-related adverse impacts on treatment and rated their COVID-19-related concerns, then completed the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 and four scales of the Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form. Findings: The most common adverse impacts were staff shortages/changes and impaired interaction with staff/patients. Of the sample, 32.4% were severely depressed, 14.7% severely anxious and 18.9% severely stressed. Participants who had tested positive for COVID-19 were more depressed and reported more adverse impacts. Older and married/cohabiting participants had better adjustment and wellbeing. Conclusions: The results help to identify patients with the greatest needs and suggest ways to maintain patient wellbeing during outbreaks of infectious disease.","Elander, James, Kapadi, Romaana, Danton, Ian, Louth, Charlotte, Selby, Nicholas M.; Taal, Maarten W.; Stalker, Carol, Mitchell, Kathryn","https://www.google.com/search?q=Adjustment+and+wellbeing+among+people+with+end-stage+chronic+kidney+disease+receiving+in-centre+haemodialysis+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic","","Database: CINAHL; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Kidney Care; 7(2):70-79, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-30","",29245,""
"Yogun Bakimda COVID-19 ARDS ile &Iacute;zlenen Olgularda Ferritin DÃ¼zeyleri ile Prognoz Arasindaki &Iacute;liskinin Degerlendirilmesi","AmaÃ§: Yogun bakimda koronavirÃ¼s hastaligi-19 (COVID-19) ARDS (CARDS) nedeniyle takip ve tedavi edilen hastalarda yÃ¼ksek ferritin dÃ¼zeyleri ile mortalite ve prognoz arasindaki iliskiyi degerlendirmeyi amaÃ§ladik. GereÃ§ ve YÃ¶ntem: Yogun bakim Ã¼nitemizde CARDS nedeniyle izlenen agir hipoksemik solunum yetmezlikli, invaziv mekanik ventilatÃ¶r destegindeki 150 hasta Ã§alismaya dahil edildi. Yogun bakimda Ã¶len ve yogun bakimdan taburculugu saglanan hastalarin 1. gÃ¼n, 3. gÃ¼n ve 7. gÃ¼ndeki ferritin degerleri ile yogun bakim mortaliteleri karsilastirildi. Bulgular: Ã‡alismaya dahil edilen 150 hastadan yasayan (n=40) ve Ã¶len (n=110) hastalarin 1. (752 vs 687,5), 3. (635 vs 674) ve 7. (684 vs 676,24) gÃ¼n ferritin degerleri arasinda istatistiksel olarak anlamli fark saptanmadi. Hastalarin yogun bakim mortlitesi %73,3 idi. SonuÃ§: Ferritin, vÃ¼cuttaki demir depolarinin iyi bir gÃ¶stergesi olmakla birlikte enflamatuvar sÃ¼reÃ§lerde makrofajlar tarafindan salgilanarak dÃ¼zeyinin yÃ¼kseldigi bilinmektedir. Makrofaj aktivasyon sendromu, Eriskin Still hastaligi gibi bir Ã§ok enflamatuvar hastalikta hiperferritinemi Ã¶n plandadir. COVID-19 enfeksiyonu seyirinde de ferritin dÃ¼zeyleri oldukÃ§a yÃ¼kselmekte ve yÃ¼ksek ferritin dÃ¼zeylerinin enflamatuvar sÃ¼recin iyi bir gÃ¶stergesi oldugu dÃ¼sÃ¼nÃ¼lmektedir. COVID-19 enfeksiyonu ile ilgili henÃ¼z bilinmeyen pek Ã§ok faktÃ¶r mevcut olsa da hastaligin prognozunu Ã¶n gÃ¶rmek yakin takip edilmesi gereken ve yogun bakim yatis gereksinimi olan olgularin degerlendirilmesi aÃ§isindan yol gÃ¶sterici olacaktir.

"Spontan PnÃ¶momediastinum ve COVID-19","AmaÃ§: Hem pnÃ¶motoraks (PNX) hem de pnÃ¶momediastinum (PNM) mekanik ventilasyonun bilinen komplikasyonlaridir. Bununla birlikte, barotravma olmasa bile, PNX veya PNM veya daha nadiren her ikisi de koronavirÃ¼s hastaligi-2019â€™a (COVID-19) bagli olarak gelisebilir. PNM, mediasten iÃ§inde bulunan serbest hava veya gaz olarak tanimlanir. Spontan PNM (SPNM), gÃ¶gÃ¼s travmasi gibi gÃ¶zle gÃ¶rÃ¼lÃ¼r herhangi bir neden ile iliskili olmayan mediasten iÃ§inde bulunan serbest hava veya gaz olarak tanimlanir. Olgu: 01.01.2021-31.12.2021 tarihileri arasinda Kastamonu Egitim ve Arastirma Hastanesi COVID-19 Yogun Bakim &Uuml;niteleriâ€™nde takip edilen 7 hastada SPNX/SPNM saptanmistir. Toplanan veriler arasinda yas, cinsiyet, IMV veya N-IMV tedavisi altinda iken, yogun bakimda yatisin kaÃ§inci gÃ¼nÃ¼nde ve SPNX/SPNM hangisinin gelistigi, tÃ¼p torakostomi ihtiyaci ve sifa-eks durumu mevcuttur. Yedi hastamizin Ã¼Ã§Ã¼ kadin, dÃ¶rdÃ¼ erkektir. &Iacute;ki hastamizda SPNX ve SPNM birlikte gÃ¶rÃ¼nmÃ¼s ve bu hastalara tÃ¼p torakostomi uygulanmistir. SPNX/SPNM, iki hastamizda N-IMV altinda gelismisken, bes hastamizda IMV altinda gelismistir. SPNX/SPNM, hastalarimizin yogun bakima alindiktan sonra ortalama 5. gÃ¼nÃ¼nde gelismistir. Bes hastamiz eksitus olmus, iki hastamiz ise servise devredilmistir. SonuÃ§: COVID-19, ARDSâ€™nin Ã¶nemli bir yeni nedenidir. Bes ARDS hastalarinda barotravma insidansinin daha yÃ¼ksek oldugu, Ã§esitli Ã§alismalarda COVID Ã¶ncesi dÃ¶nem kadar erken bir tarihte bildirilmistir. GerÃ§ekten de, COVID-19 pandemisi nedeniyle ARDS olgularinin artmasiyla birlikte, PNX ve PNM olgularinin insidansinda da bir artis olmustur. PNMâ€™nin kesin mekanizmasi bilinmemekle birlikte, SPNM genellikle kendi kendini sinirlayan bir hastaliktir. Bununla birlikte, potansiyel olarak ciddi dolasim ve solunum patolojisine neden olabilir. Bu nedenle, COVID-19 hastalarinda SPNM olusumu, kÃ¶tÃ¼lesen hastaligin potansiyel bir gÃ¶stergesi olarak yakindan izlenmelidir. COVID-19 hastalarinda PNX/ PMNâ€™nin insidansi, patogenezi ve Ã¶ngÃ¶rÃ¼cÃ¼leri su anda belirsiz ve hatta Ã§eliskilidir. SonuÃ§ olarak tÃ¼m bu nedenler, PNXâ€™in ve PNMâ€™nin COVID19â€™un ciddi bir komplikasyonu oldugunu dÃ¼sÃ¼ndÃ¼rmektedir. Bu durumun kÃ¶tÃ¼ prognozun belirteci olup olmadigini anlamak iÃ§in daha kapsamli Ã§alismalar gerekmektedir.

"Olgu Sunumu: COVID-19 Hastasinda Subdural Hematom","AmaÃ§: COVID-19 pnÃ¶monisi seyri esnasinda Ã§esitli hematolojik degisiklikler ortaya Ã§ikmaktadir. Tromboemboli Ã¼zerine yogunlasan Ã§ok sayida Ã§alisma mevcut olmakla beraber, kanama klinigi ile karsilasilabilmektedir. Kanamaya egilim yaratan sÃ¼reÃ§ler hala tartisilmaktadir. Biz bu olgumuzda, yogun bakim Ã¼nitesinde COVID-19 pnÃ¶monisi ile takip esnasinda intrakraniyal kanama geÃ§iren hastamizi, COVID-19 ve kanama iliskisini tartismak istedik. Olgu: Bilinen hipertansiyon, demans ve diabetes mellitus tanilari olan 77 yasinda kadin hasta, COVID-19 tanisinin 5. gÃ¼nÃ¼nde solunum sikintisi ile yogun bakima yatirildi. Takipneik olan hasta aralikli noninvaziv mekanik ventilasyonu ile takibe alindi.

KoronovirÃ¼sler, kemik iligi tutulumu yaparak anormal hematopoeze neden olabilir. Bununla beraber dolasimda artmis olan antikorlarin ve immÃ¼nkomplekslerin varligi, dolasimda bulunan trombositleri hasara ugratarak sayilarinin azalmasina sebep olabilir. Ayrica akciger hasari sonrasi trombosit aktivasyonu ve agreagasyonunun artmasi nedeni ile trombosit tÃ¼ketimi artabilir ve beraberinde trombositopeni sÃ¼recini kolaylastirabilir. Kanama yatkinligina neden olabilecek bir diger faktÃ¶r de tromboemboli profilaksisi iÃ§in kullanilan heparin ve LMWH uygulamalari olabilir. Bizim olgumuz gibi, tetikleyici hematolojik degisiklikler olmadigi kosullarda gelismis olan intrakraniyal hemorojilerin ise mekanizmasi aÃ§iklanamamistir. Serebral vaskÃ¼ler yapilardaki ACE reseptÃ¶rÃ¼ araciligi ile SARS-CoV-2 virÃ¼sÃ¼nÃ¼n endotelyal tropizminin olmasi nedenlerden birisi olabilir.

Kartal Dr. LÃ¼tfi Kirdar Sehir Hastanesiâ€™nde yatarak tedavi gÃ¶rmekte olan hastalarda glisemik kontrolÃ¼ degerlendirmek amaciyla noktaprevalans Ã§alismasi planlanmistir. Etik kurul onayi alinmistir. GereÃ§ ve YÃ¶ntem: Hastalarin demografik verileri, beslenme sekillleri, diyabet varligi, insÃ¼lin tedavisi, steroid kullanimi son 24 saatte parmak ucundan Ã¶lÃ§Ã¼len en yÃ¼ksek, en dÃ¼sÃ¼k KS dÃ¼zeyi ve gÃ¼n iÃ§inde regÃ¼lasyon seyri standart veri forumuna kaydedilerek degerlendirildi. Bulgular: Ã‡alisma gÃ¼nÃ¼ hastanemizde yatan 35 COVID (C-YB) ve 72 NonCOVID yogun bakim (NC-YB) hastasinin %52,3â€™Ã¼ kadin idi. Hastalarin %30,2â€™sinde diyabet tanisi mevcuttu. %9,3â€™Ã¼ insÃ¼lin infÃ¼zyon tedavisi, %12,1â€™i uzun etkili insÃ¼lin tedavisi almakta idi. %11,2â€™si oral, %12,1â€™i Peg, %43,9â€™u NG, %8,4â€™Ã¼ TPN ile besleniyordu. &Iacute;statistik sonuÃ§larina bakildiginda;hastalarin ortalama KS degeri 158 mg/dL olarak Ã¶lÃ§Ã¼ldÃ¼, tÃ¼m hastalarin %29,9â€™unda glisemik disregÃ¼lasyon ve %6,9â€™unda hipoglisemi tespit edildi. Hipoglisemi gelisen hastalarin hepsi insÃ¼lin tedavisi almakta olan NC-YB hastalari idi (Tablo 1). C-YBâ€™de %28,6 (n=10) hastanin KSâ€™nin regÃ¼le olmadigi, NC-YBâ€™de %30,6 (n=22) hastanin KSâ€™nin regÃ¼le olmadigi tespit edildi. &Iacute;ki grup arasinda KS disregÃ¼lasyonu aÃ§isindan oranlar benzerdi (p=0,510). C-YBâ€™de disregÃ¼lasyon ile steroid kullanimi arasinda ve NC-YBâ€™de disregÃ¼lasyon ile diyabet varligi arasinda korelasyon tespit edildi (p&lt;0,05). Kan sekeri disregÃ¼lasyonu ile beslenme sekli arasinda istatistiksel olarak anlamli iliski yoktu. SonuÃ§: NICE-SUGAR Ã§alismasi, siki glisemik kontrolÃ¼n sagkalima yararinin olmadigini hatta hipoglisemi ataklarinin (%17 oraninda gÃ¶rÃ¼lmÃ¼s) mortaliteyi artirdigini gÃ¶stermis ve tip camiasinda yanki uyandirmistir. Aygencel ve ark.â€™nin glisemik kontrolÃ¼n yogun bakim mortalitesi Ã¼zerine etkisini degerlendirmek Ã¼zere yaptigi Ã§alismada hipoglisemi sikligi %38 ve ortalama kan sekeri degerleri 138 mg/dL olarak Ã¶lÃ§Ã¼lmÃ¼stÃ¼r. Biz klinigimizde KS 140-180 mg/dL arasinda tutmaya hedefledigmiz protokolle daha az hipoglisemi ve disregÃ¼lasyon gelistigini gÃ¶rdÃ¼k. GÃ¼ndemde belli glikoz hedefinin tÃ¼m hastalar iÃ§in her zaman optimal olmayabilecegi glikoz kontrolÃ¼nÃ¼n bireysellestirilmesi tartisilabilir ancak rutin isleyiste her klinigin kendi KS algoritmasini olusturup, kullanmasi iyi bir metabolik kontrol iÃ§in gereklilik oldugu kanaatindeyiz.

"Public attitudes to a human challenge study with SARS-CoV-2: a mixed-methods study [version 1;peer review: 2 approved]","Background: Human challenge studies involve the deliberate exposure of healthy volunteers to an infectious micro-organism in a highly controlled and monitored way. They are used to understand infectious diseases and have contributed to the development of vaccines. In early 2020, the UK started exploring the feasibility of establishing a human challenge study with SARS-CoV-2. Given the significant public interest and the complexity of the potential risks and benefits, it is vital that public views are considered in the design and approval of any such study and that investigators and ethics boards remain accountable to the public. Methods: Mixed methods study comprising online surveys conducted with 2,441 UK adults and in-depth virtual focus groups with 57 UK adults during October 2020 to explore the publicâ€™s attitudes to a human challenge study with SARS-CoV-2 taking place in the UK. Results: There was overall agreement across the surveys and focus groups that a human challenge study with SARS-CoV-2 should take place in the UK. Transparency of information, trust and the necessity to provide clear information on potential risks to study human challenge study participants were important. The perceived risks of taking part included the risk of developing long-term effects from COVID, impact on personal commitments and mental health implications of isolation. There were a number of practical realities to taking part that would influence a volunteerâ€™s ability to participate (e.g. Wi-Fi, access to exercise, outside space and work, family and pet commitments). Conclusions: The results identified practical considerations for teams designing human challenge studies. Recommendations were grouped: 1) messaging to potential study participants, 2) review of the protocol and organisation of the study, and 3) more broadly, making the study more inclusive and relevant. This study highlights the value of public consultation in research, particularly in fields attracting public interest and scrutiny .","Barker, Caroline, Collet, Katharine, Gbesemete, Diane, Piggin, Maria, Watson, Daniella, PristerÃ , Philippa, Lawerence, Wendy, Smith, Emma, Bahrami-Hessari, Michael, Johnson, Halle, Baker, Katherine, Qavi, Ambar, McGrath, Carmel, Chiu, Christopher, Read, Robert C.; Ward, Helen","https://www.google.com/search?q=Public+attitudes+to+a+human+challenge+study+with+SARS-CoV-2:+a+mixed-methods+study+[version+1;peer+review:+2+approved]","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Wellcome open research; 7, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-30","",29253,""

"Special Issue: The public health agency of Canada - innovation strategy (Special Issue: The public health agency of Canada - innovation strategy)","This special issue containing 6 articles provides a contextual orientation to the experience of the Public Health Agency of Canada's Innovation Strategy (PHAC-IS). The broadest positioning of the PHAC-IS is addressing complex public health challenges and health inequities. These challenges are in the public eye now more than ever with the COVID-19 pandemic, as highlighted in the Chief Public Health Officer's Report on the State of Public Health in Canada 2020. The PHAC-IS was established in 2009 as a strategic funding model designed to foster local innovation that would lead to sustainable and equitable health and system changes. Between 2009 and 2020, the PHAC-IS provided significant, long-term funding to organizations in every Canadian province and territory to address complex public health challenges related to healthy weights and mental health promotion. In this regard, the PHAC-IS was a federal funding experiment, and it had a strong commitment to learn from the experience. This special issue is a product of that commitment.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Special+Issue:+The+public+health+agency+of+Canada+-+innovation+strategy.+(Special+Issue:+The+public+health+agency+of+Canada+-+innovation+strategy.)","","Database: GIM; Publication type: article; Publication details: Canadian Journal of Public Health; 112(Suppl. 2):183-269, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-30","",29260,""
"Reimaging a system of care to promote the well-being of children and families: Proceedings of a workshop","This book discusses a virtual workshop, organized by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's Forum for Children's Well-Being (the Forum) and focused on building systems to support children and families in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. The workshop speakers and organizers paid particular attention to how these systems can combat structural racism. Participants engaged in discussions about a broad range of existing tools and resources that could be used to further promote family well-being and health equity in the United States. To highlight the various experiences of youth and families during the pandemic, Forum staff interviewed several teens and parents. A compilation of their responses was shown at the start of the workshop, demonstrating real-life challenges many of them have encountered throughout the year, including instances of racism, mental health struggles, and juggling work and school responsibilities. The workshop is organized into five chapters. Following the introduction, which gives background on the Forum and context for the workshop, the book presents an overview of the need to address structural racism systemically that includes a description of the ways in which it manifests in society. It specifically focuses on the economic system and includes goals and suggestions for reimagining systems for the future. Similarly, it also explores behavioral and public health systems and potential solutions for moving toward an equitable system. Finally, the book highlights the key messages from the presentations and discussions throughout the workshop. This book presents a document that has been prepared by the workshop Rapporteur as a factual summary of what occurred at the workshop.

"Consultation on expanding access to naloxone","Naloxone is a drug that can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose, and may help to prevent overdose deaths.After a change in guidelines in Scotland during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, families of those who use drugs, as well as a wide range of professionals who work in non-drugs services, have been allowed to legally supply take home naloxone kits to anyone likely to witness an overdose. A four-nation consultation has been launched to assess the viability of proposals to widen access to naloxone, by expanding the list of services and individuals that can provide the drug without a prescription or other written instruction. Normally, naloxone is only legally available across the UK on prescription, or from certain drug treatment services without a prescription.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Consultation+on+expanding+access+to+naloxone","","Database: GIM; Publication type: article; Publication details: HPS Weekly Report; 55:33, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-30","",29262,""

"An Intervention Framework for Addressing Stigma on College Campuses: Findings From a 3-Year-Long Intervention Program","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will only exacerbate the rising mental health concerns among college students. However, stigma toward such concerns continues to hinder mental health care utilization among the students, requiring urgent evidence that can help guide college campuses in implementing effective antistigma interventions. We propose and provide evidence for an intervention based on findings from a 3-year-long antistigma intervention that was implemented on a Southeastern college campus in the United States. Unique random samples of college students, totaling N = 1727 across 3 years, were recruited as participants. Each year, participants completed a preintervention and postintervention survey comprising of questions related to demographics, stigma, and mental health care knowledge. Findings indicate that the stakeholder-led intervention decreased personal stigma and increased mental health care knowledge among students who were exposed to the intervention. Further research is needed to assess feasibility and efficacy of the proposed intervention framework on other campuses.","Tomar, Jensen, Pace","https://doi.org/10.1097/NMD.0000000000001527","20220329","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-30","",29264,""
"Prevalence and associated factors of depressive symptoms among the young adults during the post-epidemic period - Evidence from the first wave of COVID-19 in Hubei Province, China","China emerged from the first wave of COVID-19 in a short period of time and returned to normal economic and living order nationwide, making China's entry into the post-COVID-19 epidemic period since April 2020. However, the COVID-19 epidemic had a great impact on young adults' psychological status and may continue into the post-epidemic period. The enormous economic, employment and entrepreneurship pressures of this period may exacerbate this negative impact. This study investigated the depression status of the young adults and put forward the suggestions on how to strengthen the psychological crisis intervention and social security to cultivate the resilience of the young adults after major public health emergencies. This study conducted a questionnaire survey to identify the prevalence of depressive symptoms and explore the associated factors of depressive symptoms among 1069 young adults in X City, Hubei province in September 2020. And the multistage stratified random sampling method was used for sampling. Depressive symptoms were measured using the 10-item version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-10). Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis were adopted for statistical analysis. 1069 respondents (67.68% male; mean ageÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 28.87Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 4.18Ã‚Â years; age rangeÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 18-35Ã‚Â years) were included in final analyses. About 25.9% of the respondents reported depressive symptoms (CES-D-10 scoreÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 7.28Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 3.85). Age, marital status, employment status, monthly disposable income, the cognition, experience and social relationship of the COVID-19 epidemic, and regional discrimination were significantly associated with depressive symptoms. Being male (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.025), age of 25-29Ã‚Â years (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.011), having a household size with 4-5 (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.01) and more than 8 (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.012) family members, a little pessimism about the prospect of COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.044), often (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.018) or always (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.009) participation in anti-epidemic volunteer work were likely to lead to depressive symptoms. In the post-COVID-19 epidemic period, the psychological status of young people is generally stable, but some of them are depressed. Life, work and mental stress affect the generation of depressive symptoms among the young adults.","Wang, Zou","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actpsy.2022.103577","20220329","COVID-19; Depressive symptoms; Hubei Province; Post-epidemic period; Young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-30","",29265,""
"Cognitive dysfunction associated with COVID-19: A comprehensive neuropsychological study","Recent evidence suggests that patients suffering post-acute COVID syndrome frequently report cognitive complaints, but their characteristics and pathophysiology are unknown. This study aims to determine the characteristics of cognitive dysfunction in patients reporting cognitive complaints after COVID-19 and to evaluate the correlation between cognitive function and anxiety, depression, sleep, and olfactory function. Cross-sectional study involving 50 patients with COVID-19 reporting cognitive complaints 9.12Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 3.46 months after the acute infection. Patients were evaluated with a comprehensive neuropsychological protocol, and scales of fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep and an olfactory test. Normative data and an age- and education matched healthy control group were used for comparison. COVID-19 patients showed a diminished performance on several tests evaluating attention and executive function, with alterations in processing speed, divided attention, selective attention, visual vigilance, intrinsic alertness, working memory, and inhibition; episodic memory; and visuospatial processing. Cognitive performance was correlated with olfactory dysfunction, and sleep quality and anxiety to a lesser extent, but not depression. Patients with COVID-19 reporting cognitive symptoms showed a reduced cognitive performance, especially in the attention-concentration and executive functioning, episodic memory, and visuospatial processing domains. Future studies are necessary to disentangle the specific mechanisms associated with COVID-19 cognitive dysfunction.","Delgado-Alonso, Valles-Salgado, Delgado-ÃƒÂlvarez, Yus, GÃƒÂ³mez-Ruiz, Jorquera, Polidura, Gil, Marcos, MatÃƒÂ­as-Guiu, MatÃƒÂ­as-Guiu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.03.033","20220329","COVID-19; Cognitive; Long-term COVID; Neuropsychological assessment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-30","",29266,""

"COVID-19 and Psychological Distress: Racial Differences Among Middle-Aged and Older Adults","COVID-19 has disproportionately impacted older adults and Black individuals. Research has focused on physical outcomes, with less attention to the psychological effects of COVID-19. The objective of this study was to examine the interplay between perceptions of the COVID-19 outbreak as a threat to one's day-to-day life, race, and psychological distress among middle-aged and older men and women. Analyses were conducted on a subsample of self-identified non-Latino Whites and Black individuals aged 50+ (N=3,834) from the American Trends Panel. Psychological distress was assessed with five items adapted from the CES-D and GAD. Perceived COVID-19 day-to-day threat was assessed with a single question. Negative binomial regressions tested the study aim. Perceptions of COVID-19 day-to-day threat were positively associated with psychological distress. Black individuals reported lower distress than Whites. Regardless of gender, greater perceptions of COVID-19 day-to-day threat were associated with greater distress among both White respondents and Black respondents. However, this association was weaker among Black respondents than White respondents. Among men only, the association between COVID-19 day-to-day threat and distress varied by race, patterned similarly to the race differences identified in the total sample. This association did not vary by race among women. This study contributes to the emerging literature focused on older adults and COVID-19 related stressors and psychological distress. An intersectional lens shows how structural oppression may shape perceptions of the pandemic. Future work should consider coexisting intersections in marginalized identities and mental health during COVID-19.","Hamler, Nguyen, Mouzon, Taylor, Qin, Cobb","https://doi.org/10.1093/geront/gnac043","20220329","Health Disparities; Mental Health; Race; Resilience; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-30","",29268,""
"'We do not talk about it': Engaging youth in Malawi to inform adaptation of a mental health literacy intervention","There is limited knowledge on how to tackle mental health problems among youth in Africa. Literature describing community engagement (CE) approaches in low/middle-income countries (LMICs) health research is sparse. CE with youth from LMICS can help steer and shape culturally relevant interventions for stigmatised topics like mental health, resulting in better healthcare experiences. We share our experience of engaging youth in Malawi through advocacy organisations to inform cultural adaptation of a mental health literacy intervention. Young people were recruited using social media from universities and community youth organisations in Malawi to participate in focus group discussions to help culturally adapt content of an existing mental health literacy intervention. Nine online focus groups with 44 individuals were conducted. Discussions involved views and experiences of mental health, including impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Discussions were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using content analysis. Transcript analyses revealed a vicious cycle of poverty and mental health problems for youth in Malawi. Four key themes were identified, 1) poverty-related socioeconomic and health challenges, 2) no one talks about mental health, 3) lacking mental health support and 4) relationship issues. These themes fed into one another within this vicious cycle which perpetually and negatively impacted their lives. The coronavirus pandemic worsened socioeconomic issues, health challenges, mental health and substance use issues, and burden on Malawi's already weak mental health system. Findings suggest increasing untreated mental health burden among Malawi's youth. It highlights great need to address mental health literacy using existing community structures like educational settings to minimise burden on a weak health system. Online focus groups are an effective way of acquiring views from various young people in Malawi on mental health. This CE approach has grown our stakeholder network, strengthening potential for future CE activities and broader research dissemination.","Jumbe, Nyali, Simbeye, Zakeyu, Motshewa, Pulapa","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0265530","20220329","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-30","",29269,""

This study aimed to evaluate pain intensity, depression, and anxiety status in chronic pain patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 110 patients with chronic pain participated on a voluntary basis in this questionnaire survey. The questionnaire form elicited information on sociodemographic characteristics and prepandemic and pandemic data on analgesic need, access to medication, visual analog scale (VAS) pain, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) scores. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in increased levels of depression (74.5%), anxiety (66.4%), increase in analgesic need (60%), and limited access to analgesic drugs (40.0%).

"Uncertainty, Stress, and Resilience During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Greece","The COVID-19 outbreak imposed stress worldwide, as daily routine changed almost overnight, with no time to prepare. A pandemic like this may trigger a chain reaction starting out as surprise, continuing to uncertainty and ending up either in adaptation or in symptoms of fear, anxiety, and/or depression. Resilience on the other hand could lessen anxiety and prove to be a prophylactic coping mechanism against distress. This study explored peritraumatic distress, intolerance of uncertainty (IU), and resilient coping in a sample of 2717 adults who voluntarily and anonymously participated in an online survey conducted in April 2020, in Greece.Results indicated a moderate pandemic-related mental burden and medium resilient coping and designated IU as a significant positive predictor of peritraumatic distress; resilient coping proved to be a significant moderator that alters the strength of the association between IU and distress reactions.","Nikopoulou, Gliatas, Blekas, Parlapani, Holeva, Tsipropoulou, Karamouzi, Godosidis, Diakogiannis","https://doi.org/10.1097/NMD.0000000000001491","20220329","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-30","",29271,""

Predicting variables were age, sex, the Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced subscales scores, the Anxiety Status Inventory total score, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 total score. The prevalence of PTSD-like stress symptoms was 41.33%. Age, social and avoidance coping strategies, and anxiety levels were significant predictors of PTSD-like symptoms.

"The Role of Spirituality and Religiosity in Healthcare During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Integrative Review of the Scientific Literature","The pandemic caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has been affecting populations globallyÃ‚Â since the end of 2019. Previous studies have indicated that spirituality in these times of crisis serves as a source of hope and well-being that helps people get through the day. This study investigated the role of spirituality and religiosity in healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic. An integrative review of the scientific literature available on PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases and a review of the gray literature in the Information System on Gray Literature in Europe (OpenGrey) were carried out. From a total of 1,338 articles searched; 25 articles were included in this review (22 quantitative observational, 2 qualitative and one randomized controlled trial). Our findings revealed the importance of including spirituality in clinical practice for both health professionals and patients. On the one hand, spirituality can be considered a good coping strategy used by healthcare professionals to promote mental health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting in greater patient satisfaction with the care given. On the other hand, addressing spiritual needs of individuals leads to a reduction in stress, anxiety, depression, and an increase in resilience and hope among patients.","de Diego-Cordero, ÃƒÂvila-Mantilla, Vega-EscaÃƒÂ±o, Lucchetti, Badanta","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10943-022-01549-x","20220329","COVID-19 pandemic; Coronavirus; Faith; Health care; Religiosity; Spirituality; Well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-30","",29274,""
"Therapeutic Potential of the Purinergic System in Major Depressive Disorder Associated with COVID-19","Neuroinflammation is closely related to the development of depression, since the latter is caused, among other factors, by inflammatory processes, mainly related to the activation of microglia and expression of specific genes, which occurs during the neuroinflammatory process. Thus, COVID-19 is an important risk factor for the development of depression, since in addition to generating the feeling of stress, which also increases the activity of the immune system, it is also the cause of pathological processes and physiological ones that lead to the development of neuroinflammation, microglial activation, gene expression dysfunction and decreased concentration of available serotonin. That said, drugs are being used to combat COVID-19 to reduce the oxidative stress presented in the disease. Thus, tramadol and fluoxetine are highlighted as drugs used, however, although they present some positive results, such as the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, they are also associated with negative effects such as dependence, pulmonary, cardiac and brain impairment. From this, the purinergic system is highlighted in the literature as a possible therapeutic target. This is because its mechanisms are related to the regulation of microglia, astrocytes and the physiology of important neurotransmitters and hormones. Added to this, there is a modulation of inflammatory activity, especially with regard to the P2X7 receptors of this system. The latter is an important target for the treatment of depression and COVID-19, since positive results were obtained through the genetic exclusion of this receptor and the use of selective antagonists.","SimÃƒÂµes, Galvan, da Silva, IgnÃƒÂ¡cio, Bagatini","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10571-022-01215-6","20220329","Major depression disorder; Neuroinflammation; Purinergic signaling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-30","",29275,""
"One year after the COVID-19 outbreak in Germany: long-term changes in depression, anxiety, loneliness, distress and life satisfaction","Several studies have linked the COVID-19 pandemic to unfavorable mental health outcomes. However, we know little about long-term changes in mental health due to the pandemic so far. Here, we used longitudinal data from a general population sample of 1388 adults from Germany, who were initially assessed between April and May 2020 (i.e., at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany) and prospectively followed up after 6 (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1082) and 12Ã‚Â months (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°945). Depressive and anxiety symptoms as well as loneliness did not change from baseline to 6-month follow-up. While anxiety symptoms did not change in the long run, depressive symptoms and loneliness increased and life satisfaction decreased from baseline to 12-month follow-up. Moreover, vulnerable groups such as younger individuals or those with a history of mental disorders exhibited an overall higher level of psychopathological symptoms across all assessment waves. Our findings suggest a deterioration in mental health during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, which emphasizes the importance to implement targeted health promotions to prevent a further symptom escalation especially in vulnerable groups.","Benke, Autenrieth, Asselmann, PanÃƒÂ©-FarrÃƒÂ©","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00406-022-01400-0","20220329","Lockdown measures; Longitudinal; Mental health; Pandemic; Risk group; Social distancing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-30","",29276,""
"COVID-19 pandemic and mental health problems of adults in United States: mediating roles of cognitive concerns and behavioral changes","We examined the associations of statewide COVID-19 conditions (i.e., state-level case and death rates) with individual-level Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Major Depression Disorder (MDD) focusing on the salient mediating roles of individual-level cognitive concerns and behavioral changes. Using a national representative sample of adults in the United States (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°585,073), we fitted logistic regressions to examine the overall associations between theÃ‚Â COVID-19 pandemic and GAD/MDD. We employed a causal mediation analysis with two mediators: cognitive concerns (i.e., concerns on going to theÃ‚Â public, loss of income, food insufficiency, housing payment, and the economy) and behavioral changes (i.e., taking fewer trips, avoiding eating-out, more online-purchase, more curbside pick-up, and cancelling doctor's appointments). We found relationships of statewide COVID-19 cases with GAD (odds ratio [OR]Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI]Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.05, 1.07) and MDD (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.08; 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.07, 1.09). The ORs were mediated by cognitive concerns for GAD (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.02, proportion mediated: 29%) and MDD (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.01, 17%). Another salient mediator was behavioral changes for GAD (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.02, 31%) and MDD (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.01, 15%). Similar associations were found with statewide COVID-19 death. Our mediation analyses suggest that cognitive concerns and behavioral changes are important mediators of the relationships between statewide COVID-19 case/death rates and GAD/MDD.

"Occupational health, integrative and complementary practices in primary care, and the Covid-19 pandemic","To identify the possible repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic on the workers' health, the care strategies used, and the provision of Integrative and Complementary Practices in health services in the context of COVID-19. Descriptive study, with a qualitative approach, which used a focus group for data collection and content analysis according to Bardin. Eleven health professionals from the city of Registro (SP) participated and, based on the information analysis, four categories emerged: (1) Changes in work routine caused by the pandemic and the feelings they generate in health professionals; (2) Integrative and Complementary Practices as a self-care strategy in the pandemic; (3) Provision of Integrative and Complementary Practices during the pandemic; and (4) Occupational health as the focus and strategy motivator to resume the provision of Integrative and Complementary Practices in the municipality. This study allowed the identification of the impact of the pandemic, especially on workers' mental health, which influenced the search for care strategies that included the Integrative and Complementary Practices. Professionals with this training began to offer the Integrative and Complementary Practices in the service to other workers, given the interruption of their provision to the population due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Pereira, Rocha, FogaÃƒÂ§a, Schveitzer","https://doi.org/10.1590/1980-220X-REEUSP-2021-0362","20220329","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-30","",29279,""
"Prolonged SARS-CoV-2 shedding in a person living with advanced HIV and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: a case report","The global spread of SARS-CoV-2 has necessitated case isolation, with recommended isolation times based on mean time to viral clearance. We present a 28-year-old female living with vertically acquired HIV, undergoing chemotherapy for lymphoma who tested SARS-CoV-2-PCR positive for 164Ã¢â‚¬â€°days. The patient had a history of difficulty taking ARVs, with detectable HIV-RNA and CD4 count below 200Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ãƒâ€”Ã¢â‚¬â€°10<sup>6</sup> for the 8Ã¢â‚¬â€°years prior to presentation with symptoms. She stopped ARVs 10Ã¢â‚¬â€°months prior to experiencing fevers, night sweats and loose stool, with a viral load of 354,000 copies/ml and CD4 count of 30Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ãƒâ€”Ã¢â‚¬â€°10<sup>6</sup>. Following no yield on basic investigations, positron emission tomography scan showed diffuse colonic and oesophageal avidity and a caecal biopsy showed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. She re-started ARVs and underwent five cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy. Her first positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test was detected through routine asymptomatic screening. She self-isolated due to repeated positive tests on a further 8 swabs for a total of 164Ã¢â‚¬â€°days until a negative PCR test. She reported feeling low in mood and frustrated by repeated positive tests and the associated lack of social contact or ability to work. Her positive tests prevented in-person review by her HIV team, which impacted her ARV adherence leading to an unplanned break in therapy.

"Shared trauma during the COVID-19 pandemic: Psychological effects on Israeli mental health nurses","Mental health nurses, tasked with the constant care of clients undergoing mental health treatment, have faced unique challenges arising from the uncertain outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic. The shared exposure of both nurses and their patients to a traumatic event such this pandemic leads to additional challenges and ways of coping. The psychological effects of this shared trauma on mental health nurses arising from the pandemic are the subject of this study. An online survey was used to examine personal levels of anxiety and concern, personal and national resilience (NR), and posttraumatic growth (PTG) among 183 mental health nurses working in mental health services in Israel. Overall, the study revealed moderate levels of concern and relatively low levels of anxiety, with significant negative correlations between personal and NR and levels of concern and anxiety. Higher levels of personal and NR were related to lower levels of concern and anxiety, and there was a significant positive correlation between assessments of personal resilience and NR. A significant positive correlation was found between personal and NR and PTG. Higher religiosity was associated with higher resilience, and higher professional seniority was related to higher PTG. Finally, results for particular demographic subgroups indicate that in Israel, special attention should be given to those mental health nurses who have immigrated to Israel, are non-Jews or have less professional experience.","Dahan, Levi, Segev","https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.12996","20220329","COVID-19; posttraumatic growth; psychiatric nursing; psychological trauma; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-30","",29281,""
"COVID-19 lockdown impact on familial relationships and mental health in a large representative sample of Italian adults","Benefits of national-level stay-at-home order imposed in Italy to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission need to be carefully weighed against its impact on citizens' health. In a country with a strong familial culture and where welfare relies on households, confinement drastically decreased support provided by elder relatives, which may have resulted in mental health worsening. A web-based cross-sectional study (LOST in Italy) was conducted on a representative sample of Italian adults during lockdown (27th of April-3rd of May 2020). We asked 3156 subjects to report on reduced help in housework and childcare from retired parents to assess the impact of confinement on mental health, through validated scales before and during lockdown. Overall, 1484 (47.0%) subjects reported reduced housework help from parents, and 769 (64.0%, of the 1202 subjects with children) diminished babysitting support. Subjects reporting reduced housework help had worsened sleep quality (multivariate odds ratio, ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.74, 95% confidence interval, CI 1.49-2.03) and quantity (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.50, 95% CI 1.28-1.76), depressive (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.32, 95% CI 1.14-1.53) and anxiety symptoms (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.53, 95% CI 1.32-1.78), compared to those reporting unreduced help. Worsening in sleep quality (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.32, 95% CI 1.76-3.05), and quantity (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.80, 95% CI 1.36-2.37), depressive (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.79, 95% CI 1.39-2.31) and anxiety symptoms (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.90, 95% CI 1.48-2.46) was also associated with reduced babysitting help. Mental health outcomes were worse in subjects with poorer housing and teleworking during lockdown. Confinement came along with reduced familial support from parents, negatively impacting household members' mental health. Our findings might inform evidence-based family and welfare policies to promote population health within and beyond pandemic times.","Zeduri, Vigezzi, Carioli, Lugo, Stival, Amerio, Gorini, Pacifici, Politi, Gallus, Odone","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-022-02273-3","20220329","COVID-19 home confinement; Cross-sectional study; Familial relations; Italy; Mental health; Social security system","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-30","",29282,""

"Intersections between COVID-19 and socio-economic mental health stressors in the lives of South African adolescent girls and young women","In contexts where poverty and mental health stressors already interact to negatively impact the most vulnerable populations, COVID-19 is likely to have worsened these impacts. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) in South Africa already faced intersecting mental health stressors and vulnerabilities. It is critical to understand how additional challenges brought on by COVID-19 have intersected with existing vulnerabilities and mental health risks AGYW faced, particularly given the intersections between psychological distress and increased risk behaviours that impact sexual and reproductive health. We aimed to examine socio-economic and mental health impacts of COVID-19 on South African AGYW in order to understand how additional challenges brought on by COVID-19 have intersected with existing challenges, compounding AGYW vulnerabilities. Using qualitative and quantitative methods, framed by the syndemic theory, we examined the intersections between mental health and the COVID-19 epidemic amongst AGYW in six districts of South Africa characterised by high rates of HIV, teenage pregnancy and socio-economic hardship. Between November 2020 and March 2021 we conducted a cross-sectional telephone survey with 515 AGYW, and in-depth interviews with 50 AGYW, aged 15 to 24Ã‚Â years. Our findings reveal how COVID-19 restrictions led to increased experiences of stress and anxiety. Poor mental health was compounded by strained family relationships, increased fear of domestic violence, household unemployment, economic stress and food insecurity. Respondents described feelings of boredom, frustration, isolation, loneliness, fear and hopelessness. However, despite the multitude of challenges, some AGYW articulated emotional resilience, describing ways in which they coped and retained hope. Various psycho-social risk factors already disproportionally affect the mental health of AGYW in these communities; the COVID-19 pandemic intersects with these pre-existing social and environmental factors. Understanding strategies AGYW have used to positively cope with the uncertainty of COVID-19 amongst an array of pre-existing mental health stressors, is key in informing efforts to respond to their needs. Multisectoral interventions are needed to address the drivers of poor mental health among AGYW, and bolster healthy coping mechanisms; interventions seeking to mitigate the mental health impacts on this vulnerable population need to be responsive to the unpredictable pandemic environment.","Duby, Bunce, Fowler, Bergh, Jonas, Dietrich, Govindasamy, Kuo, Mathews","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13034-022-00457-y","20220329","Adolescent girls and young women; COVID-19; Lockdown; Mental health; South Africa","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-30","",29284,""
"The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on primary health care utilization: an experience from Iran","The Covid-19 pandemic affected the performance of Primary Health Care (PHC) worldwide. This study was performed to investigate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the utilization of PHC in Iran. A before and after study conducted between 2019 and 2021. 56 medical science universities across the country were studied. The data extracted from Electronic Health Record (EHR) is entitled ""SIB"". Three major indicators included a weighted average of essential services provided by (physician, dentist, mental health expert, midwife, nutritionist), percentage of actual delivered service, and percentage of customer satisfaction was selected as a criterion for assessing the PHC. Descriptive statistics and analytical statistics (Wilcoxon test) using SPSS 16 software were used for the data analyzing and reporting. There was a significant difference among the examined dimensions before and after Covid-19 separation in all studied indicators except the level of percentage of customer satisfaction (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). So that the percentage of actually delivered services decreased about 1% and the weighted average of essential services provided by a physician, dentist, midwife, mental health experts, and nutritionist decreased 627.95, 718.81, 460.85, 2914.66, 2410.65 numbers, respectively.

"Domestic violence against married women during the COVID-19 pandemic in Egypt","In face of the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries including Egypt implemented stay indoor rules. These regulations slowed the propagation of the coronavirus, meanwhile they contributed to increase mental health issues, particularly the risk of experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV). That might lead to adverse health and social outcomes on the abused women and the children. This study aimed to examine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of intimate partner violence against married women in Egypt. A cross-sectional study enrolled 2068 married women through an electronic survey link. An anonymous self-administered questionnaire was used. It included demographic data and assessed the frequency of exposure to various forms of spousal violence before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The mean age of respondents was 33.8Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.3Ã‚Â years. The commonest types of violent behaviors that have been increased significantly after the COVID-19 pandemic were: twisting arms/pulling the hair (pre 32.8%, post 75%), leaving the house without informing or giving the wife money (pre 12.2%, post 30.3%), restricting interaction with her family members (pre 26.1, post 40.4%), treating her as a servant (pre 28.7%, post 36.7%) and insulting her in front of others (pre 22.9%, post 30.8%).The associated determinants for higher violence rate were; low women education, young age at marriage, low educational and job rank of husband, husband's tobacco use and reduced family income (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). The overall prevalence of economic and some types of physical and emotionally abusive behaviors have been increased after the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic. Special intervention should be designed to address this issue in collaboration with public health organizations.","Abu-Elenin, Elshora, Sadaka, Abdeldaim","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12905-022-01674-5","20220329","COVID-19; Egypt; Violence; Women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-30","",29286,""
"Evaluating telehealth lifestyle therapy versus telehealth psychotherapy for reducing depression in adults with COVID-19 related distress: the curbing anxiety and depression using lifestyle medicine (CALM) randomised non-inferiority trial protocol","There is increasing recognition of the substantial burden of mental health disorders at an individual and population level, including consequent demand on mental health services. Lifestyle-based mental healthcare offers an additional approach to existing services with potential to help alleviate system burden. Despite the latest Royal Australian New Zealand College of Psychiatrists guidelines recommending that lifestyle is a 'first-line', 'non-negotiable' treatment for mood disorders, few such programs exist within clinical practice. Additionally, there are limited data to determine whether lifestyle approaches are equivalent to established treatments. Using an individually randomised group treatment design, we aim to address this gap by evaluating an integrated lifestyle program (CALM) compared to an established therapy (psychotherapy), both delivered via telehealth. It is hypothesised that the CALM program will not be inferior to psychotherapy with respect to depressive symptoms at 8Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks. The study is being conducted in partnership with Barwon Health's Mental Health, Drugs &amp; Alcohol Service (Geelong, Victoria), from which 184 participants from its service and surrounding regions are being recruited. Eligible participants with elevated psychological distress are being randomised to CALM or psychotherapy. Each takes a trans-diagnostic approach, and comprises four weekly (weeks 1-4) and two fortnightly (weeks 6 and 8) 90-min, group-based sessions delivered via Zoom (digital video conferencing platform). CALM focuses on enhancing knowledge, behavioural skills and support for improving dietary and physical activity behaviours, delivered by an Accredited Exercise Physiologist and Accredited Practising Dietitian. Psychotherapy uses cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) delivered by a Psychologist or Clinical Psychologist, and Provisional Psychologist. Data collection occurs at baseline and 8Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks. The primary outcome is depressive symptoms (assessed via the Patient Health Questionnaire-9) at 8Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks. Societal and healthcare costs will be estimated to determine the cost-effectiveness of the CALM program. A process evaluation will determine its reach, adoption, implementation and maintenance. If the CALM program is non-inferior to psychotherapy, this study will provide the first evidence to support lifestyle-based mental healthcare as an additional care model to support individuals experiencing psychological distress.

"The Lesson of the First Italian Lockdown: which Impacts on Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms and Sleep Quality in Patients with Remission Inflammatory Bowel Disease","During the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, decisions were taken adopting restrictive legislative measures, such as the first half of 2020 lockdown. In those months, patients with inflammatory bowel disease have experienced social isolation and reduced access to health care. Our aim was to evaluate, in this condition, the presence of remission subgroups that were most impacted by the lockdown. In the midst of the first Italian lockdown, we recruited patients with remission inflammatory bowel disease administering an online questionnaire including patient demographics, the Beck Anxiety questionnaire Inventory, the Beck Depression Inventory questionnaire and the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index, all validated standardized questionnaires for anxiety symptom levels, depression and sleep quality. Our results showed how female patients (p&lt;0.0001) with Crohn's disease (p&lt;0.001) experienced worse levels of anxiety symptoms. Female patients (p&lt;0.0001), between 50 and 60 years of age (p=0.013) and with Crohn's disease (p=0.047) experienced worse levels of depressive symptoms. Females experienced significantly worse sleep levels (p&lt;0.001). We found a correlation between the number of sleeping hours (p&lt;0.001) and the time taken to fall asleep (p&lt;0.001) and the Beck Anxiety questionnaire Inventory with a linear worsening of the number of minutes taken to sleep as well as with the Beck Depression Inventory questionnaire.

"The glass ceiling thickens: the impact of COVID-19 on academic medicine faculty in the United States","The inequities faced by women in academic Medicine before the COVID-19 pandemic are well established. However, there is little formal data regarding exactly how the pandemic has affected faculty. This cross-sectional study investigated the impact of the pandemic on responsibilities at home, work, and mental health according to gender identification, faculty rank, and faculty appointment. In February 2021, an online questionnaire was broadly distributed to academic medicine faculty. Respondents were asked to provide demographic data, answer questions about their responsibilities at home and work, mental health, and how the pandemic has influenced these. Respondents were also asked to document what their institution(s) can do to help faculty through the pandemic. Responses were analyzed via Pearson's chi-square tests and thematic analysis. Women faculty were more likely to be responsible for the care of others (70%, p =Ã‚Â 0.014), and the impact was negative, especially for early career faculty (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.019). Productivity in research, teaching, and clinical practice were negatively impacted, with women feeling this in clinical practice (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.005), increased teaching load (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.042), and inadequate work environment (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.013). In the areas of self-care and mental health, women (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001), early career-faculty (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001), and clinical faculty (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.029) were more negatively impacted. Early-career women were more likely to fear retribution. Five themes emerged, including Flexible Expectations, Support, Mental Health, Compensation, and Communication. Pre-pandemic stress and burnout were rampant, and this study demonstrates that academic medicine faculty are still suffering. It is the authors' hope that administrations can utilize these data to make informed decisions regarding policies enacted to assist populations who are most vulnerable to the effects of the pandemic.","Lufler, McNulty","https://doi.org/10.1080/10872981.2022.2058314","20220329","COVID-19; academic medicine faculty; childcare; mental health; women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-30","",29290,""

The electronic database search was supplemented by manual searching. A total of 32 papers were identified, including studies on UK paediatric populations, studies on chronic illness in the UK, and international studies on chronic illness and children (including data from the UK). Most studies focussed on epilepsy, cancer, diabetes or asthma. Three categories of impact were identified: (<i>a</i>) impact of policy response on the delivery of and access to child healthcare (<i>b</i>) impact of innovative practice on children's physical and mental health (<i>c</i>) impact of service restrictions on children's physical health. Our results showed that policy response to the pandemic significantly affected healthcare provision for children with chronic illness in the UK. However, the specific assessment of the impact of service restrictions and innovative practice on children's health and wellbeing is limited.

To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on certain aspects of people's day-to-day functioning. The study involved using an online diagnostic survey including a proprietary questionnaire, the DASS 21, and the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale. Information about the pandemic in Poland and around the world was systematically obtained by 48.8 and 27.4% of respondents, respectively (<i>N</i> = 1,312). Whereas, 75.6% of respondents declared having knowledge about the number of infected people in Poland, only 28.7% declared having such knowledge about infections worldwide. Most often, respondents had obtained information online (65.9%). According to 45.7% of respondents, infection with COVID-19 is a major threat, and not enough has been done to reduce its spread in Poland (66.7%) or worldwide (56.1%). Respondents considered social distancing (68.3%), quarantining people arriving from abroad (63.4%), and wearing protective masks and/or gloves (60.4%) to be the most effective actions for combatting the pandemic. Most often, in compulsory quarantines, respondents surfed the Internet (48.8%) and experienced a lack of energy or fatigue (40.2%) and anxiety (54.9%). The severity of anxiety (mean = 4.6 points), stress (7.5 points), and depression (7.3 points) were within normal ranges, and the respondents could generally be included in the group showing mildly severe social phobia (57.9 points). Most respondents considered infection with COVID-19 to be a major threat and feared another quarantine. During quarantine, respondents most often experienced fatigue, a lack of energy, nervousness, anxiety, anger, and sadness. Despite demonstrating anxiety, stress, and depression with severity in the normal range, respondents showed no statistically significant correlation between severity and age, gender, place of residence, or level of education. Although they also showed mildly severe social phobia, only gender, not age, place of residence, or level of education, showed a statistically significant correlation with its severity.","Krajewska-KuÃ…â€šak, KuÃ…â€šak-Bejda, KuÃ…â€šak, Bejda, Ã…Âukaszuk, Waszkiewicz, Cybulski, Guzowski, FiÃ…â€šon, AniÃ…â€ºko, PopÃ…â€šawska","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.846122","20220329","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; pandemic; quarantine; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-30","",29292,""
"The prevalence of inverse health consequences of COVID-19 vaccines: a post-vaccination study","COVID-19 vaccinations are intended to help produce neutralizing antibodies which target surface spike protein to combat the SARS-Cov-2 virus. Similarly, COVID-19 recovered patients exhibit high levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, which predominantly target the surface spike protein and are associated with the occurrence of health consequences in survivors. The aim of the study is to explore the long-term health consequences of the COVID-19 vaccines. A prospective, exploratory observational study conducted both online and offline using various questionnaires with all immunized individuals who had been inoculated for at least a month following their last COVID-19 vaccine either AZD1222Ã‚Â® or BBV152Ã‚Â® vaccines. We evaluated 258 individuals who had taken the COVID vaccine and found that females made up the majority (54.3%) and that the mean age was 24Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years. Postvaccination long-term health issues were reported by 36.05% (93) of the participants, with 37.86% (53) of females and 33.9% (40) of males (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.292) having symptoms. Myalgia was reported by 20.15% (52), fatigue was 13.95% (36), paresthesia was 1.16% (3), ageusia was 0.77% (2), sadness/irritability was 2.31% (6), and loss of concentration/excessive worry was 3.1% (8). Myalgia, fatigue, paresthesia, ageusia, coughs and colds, dyspnea, sadness/irritability, and lack of concentration/ excessive worry are health consequences related to the COVID-19 vaccination which follow a similar pattern of post-COVID syndrome.","Shrestha, Venkataraman","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vacun.2022.03.002","20220329","COVID Vaccine; Inverse Health Consequences; Neutralizing Antibodies; Post-Immunization Consequences; Prevalence Rate","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-30","",29293,""
"Neuropathic Pain in Neurologic Disorders: A Narrative Review","Neuropathic pain is defined as a painful condition caused by neurological lesions or diseases. Sometimes, neurological disorders may also be associated with neuropathic pain, which can be challenging to manage. For example, multiple sclerosis (MS) may cause chronic centralized painful symptoms due to nerve damage. Other chronic neuropathic pain syndromes may occur in the form of post-stroke pain, spinal cord injury pain, and other central pain syndromes. Chronic neuropathic pain is associated with dysfunction, disability, depression, disturbed sleep, and reduced quality of life. Early diagnosis may help improve outcomes, and pain control can be an important factor in restoring function. There are more than 100 different types of peripheral neuropathy and those involving sensory neurons can provoke painful symptoms. Accurate diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy is essential for pain control. Further examples are represented by gluten neuropathy, which is an extraintestinal manifestation of gluten sensitivity and presents as a form of peripheral neuropathy; in these unusual cases, neuropathy may be managed with diet. Neuropathic pain has been linked to CoronaVirus Disease (COVID) infection both during acute infection and as a post-viral syndrome known as long COVID. In this last case, neuropathic pain relates to the host's response to the virus. However, neuropathic pain may occur after any critical illness and has been observed as part of a syndrome following intensive care unit hospitalization.","Mitsikostas, Moka, Orrillo, Aurilio, Vadalouca, Paladini, Varrassi","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.22419","20220329","long covid; multiple sclerosis; neurological disorders; neuropathic pain; pain; post-stroke pain","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-30","",29294,""
"Relationships Between Depressive Symptoms, Interpersonal Sensitivity and Social Support of Employees Before and During the COVID-19 Epidemic: A Cross-lag Study","This study examined the correlation between depressive symptoms, interpersonal sensitivity, and social support before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and verified causal relationships among them. The study used Social Support Scale and Symptom Self-Rating Scale to investigate relevant variables. A total of 1,414 employees from company were recruited for this longitudinal study, which a follow up study was conducted on the same group of participants 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°year later. Paired sample <i>t</i>-test results showed that significant differences were only found in social support, not in depressive symptoms or interpersonal sensitivity. The results of correlation analysis showed that social support, depressive symptoms, and interpersonal sensitivity were significantly correlated between wave 1 and wave 2. The cross-lag autoregressive pathway showed that employees' social support level, depressive symptoms, and interpersonal sensitivity all showed moderate stability. Crossing paths showed that wave 1 social support could significantly predict wave 2 depressive symptoms (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.21, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and wave 2 interpersonal sensitivity (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.21, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Wave 1 depressive symptoms (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.10, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01) could significantly predict wave 2 social support, while wave 1 interpersonal sensitivity (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.07, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.10) could not predict wave 2 social support. Social support can be considered as a protective factor against mental health problems.","Mei, Meng, Hu, Guo, Lv, Qin, Liang, Li, Fei, Cao, Hu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.742381","20220329","COVID-19; cross-lag; depressive symptoms; interpersonal sensitivity; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-30","",29295,""
"Personal protective equipment training &amp; lived experience for healthcare staff during COVID-19","To describe the lived experience of healthcare staff during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic relating to the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and investigate risks associated with PPE use, error mitigation and acceptability of mindfulness incorporation into PPE practice. A qualitative human factors' study at two Irish hospitals occurred in late 2020. Data was collected by semi-structured interview and included role description, pre-COVID-19 PPE experience, the impact of COVID-19 on lived experience, risks associated with PPE use, contributory factors to errors, error mitigation strategies and acceptability of incorporating mindfulness into PPE practice. Of 45 participants, 23 of whom were nursing staff (51%), 34 (76%) had previously worn PPE and 25 (56%) used a buddy system. COVID-19 lived experience impacted most on social life/home-work interface (n=36, 80%). Nineteen staff (42%) described mental health impacts. The most cited risk concerned 'knowledge of procedures' (n=18, 40%). Contributory factors to PPE errors included time (n=15, 43%) and staffing pressures (n=10, 29%). Mitigation interventions included training/education (n=12, 40%). The majority (n=35, 78%) supported mindfulness integration into PPE practice. PPE training should address healthcare staff lived experiences and consider incorporation of mindfulness and key organisational factors contributing to safety.","Cahill, Kay, Howard, Mulcahy, Forde, George, Ziampra, Duffy, Lacey, Fitzpatrick","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinpr.2022.100142","20220329","COVID-19; Healthcare staff; Human factors; Lived experience; Personal Protective Equipment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-30","",29296,""
"Self-compassion, Resilience, Fear of COVID-19, Psychological Distress, and Psychological Well-being among Turkish Adults","During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to examine the variables that may affect the psychological distress and psychological well-being of individuals. This study aims to investigate the mediating effects of psychological resilience, fear of COVID-19, and psychological distress on the relationship between self-compassion and psychological well-being among Turkish adults. The participants of this study were chosen through the convenience sampling method. Participants consist of 617 Turkish adults, 461 (74.7%) females and 156 (25.3%) males. The participants' ages vary between 18 and 24 (<i>M</i> <sub><i>age</i></sub> Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°30.44, <i>SD</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°11.45). The relations between variables were examined by bootstrapping procedure. The results showed that self-compassion, resilience, fear of COVID-19, psychological distress, and psychological well-being are significantly inter-correlated. Self-compassion significantly predicts psychological well-being through the mediating factors of resilience, fear of COVID-19, and psychological distress. It was also found that psychological distress is a mediating factor for the relationship between fear of COVID-19, resilience, and psychological well-being. The indirect effects of self-compassion on psychological well-being through mediating variables were found to be significant. Based on the findings, it can be said that self-compassion decreases individuals' psychological distress and increases their well-being by increasing their resilience. Consequently, psychoeducational programs designed to increase self-compassion and resilience can be vital to support individuals' mental health. In light of the literature, the results, implications, and limitations were discussed.","Hatun, KurtÃƒÂ§a","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-02824-6","20220329","Fear of COVID-19; Psychological distress; Psychological well-being; Resilience; Self-compassion","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-30","",29297,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Wellness of Canadian Plastic Surgery Residents","On top of preexisting burnout, depression, and anxiety among trainees, the COVID-19 pandemic has introduced novel stressors. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on Canadian plastic surgery residents' practice, wellness, and overall training. Surveys for program directors and residents were created and disseminated to all English-speaking Canadian plastic surgery residency training programs. Survey results were pooled and presented as a percentage of responses for each question. Response rates were 50% (n = 5/10) and 25% (n = 19/77) for program directors and residents, respectively. All program directors believed that the pandemic has a negative effect on resident wellness, 80% (n = 4/5) of which believed that their residents were coping effectively. They rated program support for resident wellness as neutral or supportive. Most programs (80%; n = 4/5) introduced strategies to support resident well-being. Most trainees (84%; n = 16/19) reported the pandemic as having a negative effect on their well-being, with approximately 50% endorsing worse emotional, social, psychological, and physical wellness, as well as feelings of burnout. Some reported difficulties coping (21%; n = 4/19). Residents felt that their wellness was supported externally by their own resilience (89%; n = 17/19), family members (74%; n = 14/19), friends (74%; n = 14/19), their partner (68%; n = 13/19), or co-residents (53%; n = 10/19). Internal support by their program was rated as neutral or negative (63%; n = 12/19). Our findings of negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the wellness of Canadian plastic surgery trainees are concerning. Programs must implement appropriate identification and support strategies to improve resident well-being.","Wong, Moltaji, Cross, Wanzel","https://doi.org/10.1097/GOX.0000000000004259","20220329","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-30","",29298,""
