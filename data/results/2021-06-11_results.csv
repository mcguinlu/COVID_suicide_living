"Altered tryptophan absorption and metabolism could underlie long-term symptoms in survivors of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)","The global pandemic of COVID-19 has been lasting for more than one year and there is little known about the long-term health effects of the disease. Long-COVID is a new term that is used to describe the enduring symptoms of COVID-19 survivors. Huang etÃ‚Â al. reported that fatigue, muscle weakness, sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression were the most common complaints in COVID-19 survivors after 6 months of the infection. A recent meta-analysis showed that 80% of COVID-19 survivors have developed at least one long-term symptom and the most common five were fatigue, headache, attention deficit disorder, hair loss, and dyspnea. In this paper, we discuss the hypothesis that altered tryptophan absorption and metabolism could be the main contributor to the long-term symptoms in COVID-19 survivors.","EroÃ„Å¸lu, EroÃ„Å¸lu, GÃƒÂ¼ven","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2021.111308","20210610","Altered; Covid-19; Long-covid; Malabsorption; Metabolism; Tryptophan","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-11","",14728,""
"SARS-CoV-2 contact tracing among disadvantaged populations during epidemic intervals should be a priority strategy: results from a pilot experiment in Barcelona","The aim of this study was to trace contacts of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalised patients and determine the risk factors of infection in urban areas. Longitudinal analysis of contacts identified from index cases. A contact tracing study was carried out in the Northern Metropolitan area of Barcelona, Spain, during the inter-epidemic lapse of May to July 2020, a period of low SARS-CoV-2 incidence. Index cases were notified from the referral hospital. Contacts were traced and followed up for 14 days. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed on day 0 and day 14 for contacts. In total, 368 contacts were identified from 81 index cases (median of seven contacts per index case), from which 308 were traced successfully. The median age of contacts was 28 years, 62% (223 of 368) were men. During the follow-up period, 100 contacts tested positive for COVID-19 (32.5% [95% confidence interval {CI}Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 27.3-38.0]), with a secondary infection rate of 48.3% (95% CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 40.8-55.9) among housemates. Clusters of index and respective contacts tended to aggregate within disadvantaged neighbourhoods (PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001), and non-national index cases (N = 28, 34.1%) resulted in higher secondary infection rates compared with nationals (51.0% [95% CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 41.0-60.9] vs 22.3% [95% CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 16.8-28.8]; PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001).

"Factors associated with alcohol and tobacco consumption as a coping strategy to deal with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and lockdown in Spain","To provide a population-based characterization of sociodemographic and clinical risk and protective factors associated with consumption of alcohol, tobacco, or both as a coping strategy in a sample of the Spanish general population during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Cross-sectional study based on an online snowball recruiting questionnaire. The survey consisted of an ad hoc questionnaire comprising clinical and sociodemographic information and the Spanish versions of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the Impact of Event Scale (IES). The final sample included 21,207 individuals [mean age (SD)Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 39.7 (14.0); females: 14,768 (69.6%)]. Up to 2867 (13.5%) of participants reported using alcohol, 2545 (12%) tobacco and 1384 (6.5%) both substances as a strategy to cope with the pandemic. Sex-related factors were associated with alcohol consumption as a coping strategy [female, ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.600, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001]. However, education level, work status, and income played different roles depending on the substance used to cope.

"Belief and adherence to COVID 19-lockdown restrictions in patients with asthma versus other chronic diseases: results from a cross-sectional survey nested in the ComPaRe e-cohort, in France","<b>Background:</b> Asthma patients are under-represented among patients with COVID-19. Their behavior during lockdown and associated restrictions is unknown, as well as whether it was influenced by coexistent cardiovascular conditions.<b>Methods:</b> We conducted a cross-sectional survey in May 2020, in France, nested in ComPaRe, an e-cohort of adults with chronic diseases. A self-administered questionnaire was mailed to 10,859 people; 3701 fully completed questionnaires. The prevalence of self-reported asthma was 7%. Patients were classified in 4 categories: asthma with (n= 106) or without (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°149) cardiovascular disease and other diseases with (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1186) or without (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2260) cardiovascular disease.<b>Result:</b> Adherence to movement restrictions during the lockdown was very strong: 89% of participants reported a frequency of outings of &quot;less than once per week&quot; and &quot;once or twice per week&quot; for errands and no family-related outings during the lockdown. This proportion and frequency of outings were similar whatever the chronic disease (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.122). Most patients (96%) reported a high feeling of security during the lockdown, but 95% felt anxious or depressed, with no difference by disease. As compared with patients with controlled asthma, those with uncontrolled asthma more frequently reported complaints related to deteriorated medical follow-up, waived care, anxiety or depression.<b>Conclusions:</b> Behaviors during the lockdown in France among the asthma population did not differ from patients with other chronic diseases in this cohort, which strengthens hypotheses for specific disease-related susceptibility to explain the low representation of asthmatics among COVID-19 cases. Special attention should be paid to the subgroup of patients with uncontrolled asthma during lockdowns.","TaillÃƒÂ©, Roche, Tesson, Tardivon, Tran, Couffignal","https://doi.org/10.1080/02770903.2021.1941091","20210610","Asthma/data collection; survey/COVID-19/lockdown","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-11","",14731,""
"Perceived stress and associated factors among health care professionals working in the context of COVID-19 pandemic in public health institutions of southern Ethiopia 2020","Health care professionals are at higher risk of developing stress-related problems during outbreaks, due to the overwhelming clinical workload, fear of contagion, and inadequate protective gears. So, in order to monitoring mental health issues and to understand the factors evidence-based interventions is important. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess perceived stress and associated factors among health care professionals working in the context of COVID-19, Southern Ethiopia. Institution based cross-sectional study was conducted among 798 health care professionals from the 1st May to 1st June 2020. The study participants were selected using simple random sampling technique after allocating a proportion to each health institute based on the size of health care professionals. A pre-tested and structured interviewer-administered questionnaire using KOBO collect survey tool was used to collect data. A total score of &gt;20 points was considered as the cut off for experiencing perceived stress based on perceived stress scale. Both bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis were performed to identify associated factors. The level of statistical significance was set at a p-value of less than 0.05 in multivariable logistic regression. Nearly two-thirds 61.8% (95% CI: 58.4%, 65.2%) of HCPs had perceived stress. Not having COVID-19 updated information (AOR = 2.41, 95% CI: 1.31, 4.43), not at all confident on coping with stress (AOR = 9.94, 95% CI:3.74, 26.41), somewhat confident in coping with stress (AOR = 4.69, 95% CI:2.81, 7.84), moderately confident on coping with stress (AOR = 2.36, 95% CI: 1.46, 3.82), and not getting along well with people (AOR = 4.88, 95% CI: 1.42, 16.72) were positively association with perceived stress. However, feeling overwhelmed by the demand of everyday life (AOR = 0.52 95% CI: 0.35, 0.77) and worrying about what other people think about them (AOR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.24, 0.81) were negatively associated with perceived stress. COVID-19 update, confidence in coping with stress, getting along with people, worrying about what other people think about them, and feeling overwhelmed by the demand of everyday life were factors significantly associated with perceived stress.

"Investigation of superspreading COVID-19 outbreak events in meat and poultry processing plants in Germany: A cross-sectional study","Since May 2020, several COVID-19 outbreaks have occurred in the German meat industry despite various protective measures, and temperature and ventilation conditions were considered as possible high-risk factors. This cross-sectional study examined meat and poultry plants to assess possible risk factors. Companies completed a self-administered questionnaire on the work environment and protective measures taken to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusted for the possibility to distance at least 1.5 meters, break rules, and employment status was performed to identify risk factors associated with COVID-19 cases. Twenty-two meat and poultry plants with 19,072 employees participated. The prevalence of COVID-19 in the seven plants with more than 10 cases was 12.1% and was highest in the deboning and meat cutting area with 16.1%. A subsample analysis where information on maximal ventilation rate per employee was available revealed an association with the ventilation rate (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.996, 95% CI 0.993-0.999). When including temperature as an interaction term in the working area, the association with the ventilation rate did not change. When room temperatures increased, the chance of testing positive for COVID-19 (AOR 0.90 95% CI 0.82-0.99) decreased, and the chance for testing positive for COVID-19for the interaction term (AOR 1.001, 95% CI 1.000-1.003) increased. Employees who work where a minimum distance of less than 1.5 m between workers was the norm had a higher chance of testing positive (AOR 3.61; 95% CI 2.83-4.6). Our results further indicate that climate conditions and low outdoor air flow are factors that can promote the spread of SARS-CoV-2 aerosols. A possible requirement for pandemic mitigation strategies in industrial workplace settings is to increase the ventilation rate.","Pokora, Kutschbach, Weigl, Braun, Epple, Lorenz, Grund, Hecht, Hollich, Rietschel, Schneider, Sohmen, Taylor, Dienstbuehl","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242456","20210610","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-11","",14733,""
"Influencing Factors of Acute Stress Disorder Among Frontline Nurses in Wuhan, China","The current study aimed to investigate the influencing factors of acute stress disorder (ASD) in frontline nurses delivering care in a hospital for COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. In this cross-sectional study, 298 frontline nurses were surveyed during the first month of direct care delivery for patients with COVID-19 via the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire, Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire, and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support. Through logistic regression analysis, we identified the influencing factors of ASD. Our results showed that 13.8% of participants had ASD; frontline nurses were affected by ASD symptoms in different degrees; higher perceived social support from friends and colleagues were the major protective factors of ASD; and a negative coping style was a risk factor for ASD.

"The mental health implications of COVID-19 for adolescents: Follow-up of a four-wave longitudinal study during the pandemic","On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic due to the global outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). While scientists have moved quickly to study the physical health implications of the disease, less attention has been paid to the negative mental health repercussions. The current study utilized a community sample of adolescents who had recently completed a 2-year, four wave study of adolescent mental health (Wave 1 <i>n</i> = 184, <i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 13.9 years; 50.3% female). Participants were recontacted to assess their anxiety, depression, and emotion dysregulation symptoms during the pandemic. Latent growth modeling based on four pre-COVID time points indicated the extent to which the fifth (COVID) time point deviated from trend expectations. Results showed that (a) anxiety and depression scores were significantly higher than previous trajectories would have predicted, and (b) deviations from personal trajectories were associated with higher levels of perceived lifestyle impact due to the pandemic. Furthermore, gender-based analyses revealed that financial impacts, lifestyle impacts, and coronavirus fear were differentially associated with symptom increases for male and female participants. The current study is among the first to report that adolescent mental health trajectories have been altered in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. As physical distancing and other safety precautions may be required for several years, it is essential that we gain a deep understanding of how prevention efforts are associated with significant disruptions to youth mental health to bolster youth resilience during these unprecedented times.

"Program Adaptations to Provide Harm Reduction Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Study of Syringe Services Programs in the US","Syringe services programs (SSPs) are essential to preventing injection drug use-related infections and overdose death among people who use drugs (PWUD). The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic initially impeded SSPs' operations. To effectively support these programs, information is needed regarding SSPs' experiences adapting their services and the challenges posed by COVID-19. We conducted qualitative interviews with leadership and staff from a sample of 31 U.S. SSPs. Respondents discussed urgent concerns including reduced reach of services, suspended HIV/hepatitis C testing, high COVID-19 risk among PWUD, and negative impacts of isolation on overdose and mental health. They also noted opportunities to improve future services for PWUD, including shifting to evidence-based distribution practices and maintaining regulatory changes that increased access to opioid use disorder medications post-pandemic. Findings can inform efforts to support SSPs in restoring and expanding services, and provide insight into SSPs' role in engaging PWUD during the COVID-19 response and future emergencies.

"Resilience of frontline nurses during COVID pandemic in China: A qualitative study","The aim of this study was to describe the resilience of nurses who cared for patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, as well as factors that potentially contributed to that resilience. A total of 23 frontline nurses who cared for patients with COVID-19 were recruited from a COVID-19-designated facility in Shanghai, China, using purposive sampling strategies. In-depth interviews were conducted from March to May 2020. Qualitative data were transcribed verbatim and content analysis was used. Nurses exhibited psychological resilience while caring for patients with COVID-19. They displayed an ability to bounce back from negative mental experiences and transform to a positive mindset to cope with the stress they faced. Factors that enhanced their resilience during the pandemic were: becoming familiar with infectious disease protocols, having a sense of professional achievement, social support, having trust in the infection-control response team in the hospital, and self-regulation. This study could guide the design of future resilience-enhancing interventions that provide positive coping strategies for nurses caring for individuals with infectious diseases during a pandemic.","Huang, Lin, Sun, Zhang, Lu, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1111/nhs.12859","20210610","COVID-19; China; Mental health; Nurses; Resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-11","",14742,""

"Perceived Adequacy of Tangible Support during Stay-at-Home Orders in Chicago and New York","Physical distancing precautions during the COVID-19 pandemic may challenge the provision of tangible support many middle age and older adults receive in managing their health. We examined the association between unmet tangible support needs and self-management behaviors and mental health status during the stay-at-home orders in Chicago and New York. We used data from the COVID-19 &amp; Chronic Conditions study collected between May 1st and May 22nd, 2020. A total of 801 middle age and older adults with Ã¢â€°Â¥1 chronic condition in Chicago and New York City completed the telephone interview. Adequacy of tangible social support was measured using a brief, validated scale that determined whether an individual needed assistance managing his or her health, and if yes, whether this need was met. Participants reported their level of difficulty engaging in self-management behaviors using 2 discrete items; they also self-reported medication adherence using the ASK-12 medication adherence scale. Mental health status was measured using the depression and anxiety PROMIS short-form instruments. Participants' mean age was 63Ã¢â‚¬â€°years; 30% identified as Black, 26% identified as Latino, and 12% identified unmet support needs. Inadequacy of tangible support was associated with greater difficulty managing one's health and accessing medications due to COVID-19, as well as poorer medication adherence, increased anxiety and depressive symptoms, and poorer overall well-being (<i>P</i>'sÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05).

"Assessing Primary Care Contributions to Behavioral Health: A Cross-sectional Study Using Medical Expenditure Panel Survey","To assess primary care contributions to behavioral health in addressing unmet mental healthcare needs due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondary data analysis of 2016 to 2018 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey of non-institutionalized US adults. We performed bivariate analysis to estimate the number and percentage of office-based visits and prescription medications for depression and anxiety disorders, any mental illness (AMI), and severe mental illness (AMI) by physician specialty (primary care, psychiatry, and subspecialty) and medical complexity. We ran summary statistics to compare the differences in sociodemographic factors between patients with AMI by seeing a primary care physician versus those seeing a psychiatrist. Binary logistic regression models were estimated to examine the likelihood of having a primary care visit versus psychiatrist visit for a given mental illness. There were 394 023 office-based visits in the analysis sample. AMI patients seeing primary care physician were thrice as likely to report 1 or more chronic conditions compared to those seeing psychiatrist. Among patients with a diagnosis of depression or anxiety and AMI the proportion of primary care visits ([38% vs 32%, <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001], [39% vs 34%, <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001] respectively), and prescriptions ([50% vs 40%, <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001], [47% vs 44%, <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05] respectively) were higher compared to those for psychiatric care. Patients diagnosed with SMI had a more significant percentage of prescriptions and visits to a psychiatrist than primary care physicians. Primary care physicians provided most of the care for depression, anxiety, and AMI. Almost a third of the care for SMI and a quarter of the SMI prescriptions occurred in primary care settings.

"The 'loneliness pandemic': implications for gerontological nursing","The COVID-19 pandemic compelled states to limit free movement, in order to protect at-risk and more vulnerable groups, particularly older adults. Due to old age or debilitating chronic diseases, this group is also more vulnerable to loneliness (perceived discrepancy between actual and desired social relationships) and social isolation (feeling that one does not belong to society). This forced isolation has negative consequences for the health of older people, particularly their mental health. This is an especially challenging time for gerontological nursing, but it is also an opportunity for professionals to combat age stereotypes reinforced with COVID-19, to urge the measurement of loneliness and social isolation, and to rethink how to further adjust interventions in times of crisis, such as considering technology-mediated interventions in these uncertain times.","Laranjeira","https://doi.org/10.12968/bjon.2021.30.11.652","20210610","COVID-19; Holistic care; Older people; Quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-11","",14748,""
"Undergraduate nursing students' resilience, challenges, and supports during corona virus pandemic","The coronavirus global pandemic interrupted teaching at Australian universities. Face-to-face teaching was replaced by online delivery. This presented challenges for nursing programmes due to the hands-on teaching requirements and clinical placements. Questions were raised around students' resilience and stress in the face of adversity. This study explored undergraduate nursing students' resilience, challenges experienced, and supports utilized during the pandemic. Convenience sampling recruited students from one nursing programme (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 340). Quantitative and qualitative data were collected. The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-25) examined resilience scores through non-parametric analysis. Narrative responses were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. 121 surveys (40.3%) were completed. Most participants were from second year (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 77, 63.6%). The difference in median resilience scores among employed participants was statistically significant (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.029) and higher than the unemployed. The median scores of students working in nursing-related roles were higher than others. Median resilience score across all year levels was 70 (IQRÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 62-80), in the lowest score range. Major themes identified were fear of the virus, isolation, and mental health problems. The coping strategies identified were developing daily routines, staying connected, and establishing self-help techniques.

"Telework and its effects on mental health during the COVID-19 lockdown","During the Covid-19 pandemic, many governments promoted the adoption and development of telework to reduce some of the consequences of the current health crisis on the economy and favor social distancing. The aim of this web-based cross-sectional study was to assess the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on job organization, exploring the effects of lockdown measures on the psychological distress and perceived well-being of workers experiencing telework. A web-based cross-sectional survey has been used to collect data. The participants answered the questionnaire from April 1 to April 30, 2020. The questionnaire consisted of three sections, which investigated: 1) demographic and occupational variables, 2) lifestyle and habits variables, 3) psychological distress and perceived well-being. The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) has been used to evaluate psychological distress and the 5-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5) to explore subjective well-being. Psychological distress was associated with educational level, with habits, and with reporting poor well-being. Poor well-being was associated with a higher job demand during pandemic, lifestyle and habits variables, and psychological distress. This is one of the first studies exploring the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures on the perceived well-being and psychological distress of workers experiencing telework.

"Lockdown Effects on Healthy Cognitive Aging During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Longitudinal Study","The COVID-19 pandemic is a health issue leading older adults to an increased vulnerability to unfavorable outcomes. Indeed, the presence of physical frailty has recently led to higher mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, no longitudinal studies have investigated the role of neuropsychogeriatric factors associated with lockdown fatigue in healthy cognitive aging. Eighty-one healthy older adults were evaluated for their neuropsychological characteristics, including physical frailty, before the pandemic (T0). Subsequently, 50 of them agreed to be interviewed and neuropsychologically re-assessed during the lockdown (T1) and immediately after it (T2). Moreover, during another home confinement, they performed a psychological screening (T3) to evaluate possible mood changes and fatigue. According to Fried's frailty criteria, at T0, 63% of the sample was robust, 34.5% pre-frail, and only 2.5% frail. Significantly, these subjects presented a decrease in handgrip strength and walking speed (29.6 and 6.1%, respectively). Results from Principal Component Analyses and multiple regression models highlighted the contribution of &quot;cognitive&quot; and &quot;psychological&quot; factors (i.e., attentive-executive performance and mood deflections) in explaining handgrip strength and gait speed. At T3, lockdown fatigue was explained by higher scores on the Beck Depression Inventory and lower scores on the Trail Making Test part A. Results from a moderated-mediation model showed that the effect of psychomotor speed on lockdown fatigue was mediated by depression, with a moderating effect of gait speed. Our findings highlight the complex interrelationship between cognitive, psychological, and physical factors in the emergence of pandemic fatigue in a carefully selected older population.","Amanzio, Canessa, Bartoli, Cipriani, Palermo, Cappa","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.685180","20210610","executive functions; gait speed; handgrip strength; lockdown pandemic fatigue; mood deflections; normal aging","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-11","",14753,""
"Problematic Use of Internet-Related Activities and Perceived Weight Stigma in Schoolchildren: A Longitudinal Study Across Different Epidemic Periods of COVID-19 in China","<b>Background:</b> Social distancing and school suspension due to the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) may have a negative impact on children's behavior and well-being. Problematic smartphone use (PSU), problematic social media use (PSMU) and perceived weight stigma (PWS) are particularly important issues for children, yet we have a poor understanding of how these may have been affected by lockdowns and physical isolation resulting from COVID-19. This research aimed to understand how these psychosocial and behavioral variables may be associated with psychological distress, and how these associations may have changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 489 children completed a three-wave longitudinal study from January 2020 to June 2020. The first wave was conducted before the COVID-19 outbreak. The second wave was conducted during the outbreak. The third wave was conducted during post-COVID-19 lockdown. Questionnaires measured psychological distress, PSU, PSMU, and PWS. <b>Results:</b> PSU, PSMU, PWS and psychological distress were all significantly associated with each other. PSU was significantly higher during outbreak. PWS was significantly higher before outbreak. We found an increased association between PSMU and PWS across three waves in all three models. The association between PSU and depression/anxiety decreased across three waves; however, association between PSMU and depression/anxiety increased across three waves. <b>Conclusions:</b> COVID-19 initiated school suspension and associated lockdowns appear to have exacerbated PSU and depression among children. However, PWS was reduced during this period. Children should use smartphones and social media safely and cautiously, and be aware of the potential exposure to weight stigmatization.","Fung, Siu, Potenza, O'Brien, Latner, Chen, Chen, Lin","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.675839","20210610","COVID-19; children; problematic smartphone use; problematic social media use; weight stigma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-11","",14754,""
"Virtual Online Home-Based Treatment During the COVID-19 Pandemic for Ultra-Orthodox Young Women With Eating Disorders","<b>Background:</b> With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the need arose to maintain treatment continuity for religious Jewish Ultra-Orthodox young women with eating disorders (EDs) previously hospitalized in the ED department at the Ultra-Orthodox &quot;Mayanei Hayeshua&quot; medical center in Israel. This need led to the development of home-based online treatment channels, previously unfamiliar, and unaccepted in this population. The implementation of this model had to take into consideration many of the difficulties inherent in the use of online treatment in Jewish Ultra-Orthodox mental health patients. <b>Aims:</b> We sought to investigate our online home-based treatment model implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic in previously hospitalized young Ultra-Orthodox women with EDs. <b>Method:</b> We briefly review the literature on: (1) The Jewish Israeli Ultra-Orthodox culture; (2) Young women in Ultra-Orthodox society; and (3) EDs in Jewish Israeli Ultra-Orthodox women. We then present the inpatient ED department for Ultra-Orthodox young women and describe the online treatment model adapted to this population during the COVID-19 pandemic. We highlight the difficulties, dilemmas, and advantages of our online model with the description of three patients. <b>Findings:</b> Online therapy can serve as a barrier to treatment in some cases, due to physical (lack of suitable online devices except phones), familial (over-crowded families), and religious circumstances, as well as because of the patients' reluctance to take part in this treatment. In other cases, virtual home-based treatment can lead to a positive change. This may be the case in patients who find the distancing online model suitable for them, and in parents who are committed to treatment, using their greater physical and emotional presence at home during the COVID-19 pandemic for the good if their ill-daughters. <b>Discussion:</b> This paper highlights the difficulties and possibilities inherent in a virtual home-based treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic for Ultra-Orthodox young women previously hospitalized because of an ED. This model can be effective for some patients and families if undertaken by a multidisciplinary team that is not only knowledgeable about the treatment of EDs and the use of online strategies but also knowledgeable and culturally sensitive to the specific needs and codes of Ultra-Orthodox populations.","Latzer, Herman, Ashkenazi, Atias, Laufer, Biran Ovadia, Oppenheim, Shimoni, Uziel, Stein","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.654589","20210610","COVID-19; Jewish ultra-orthodox; anorexia nervosa; eating disorders; home hospitalization; online treatment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-11","",14755,""

"The Association Between Social Support, COVID-19 Exposure, and Medical Students' Mental Health","<b>Background:</b> The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has halted in-person medical education worldwide. Limited studies have reported on the mental health status of medical students during this public health emergency. This study aimed to explore the association of personal virus exposure, regional epidemic condition, and social support with medical students' depressive and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak in China. <b>Methods:</b> In February 2020, 5,982 medical students (60.0% females, Mean<sub>age</sub> = 21.7 years, Median<sub>age</sub> = 22 years) completed an online survey consisting of demographics, personal virus exposure, the Patient Health Questionnaire, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, and the Social Support Rating Scale. <b>Results:</b> The prevalence rates of mild to severe depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms were 35.2 and 22.8%, respectively. Multivariate linear regression showed that students with low- or medium-level social support had a higher risk of experiencing depressive or anxiety symptoms than those with high-level social support. COVID-19 exposure was positively associated with mild to severe depressive or anxiety symptoms. Respondents living in provinces with 500-1,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases had an increased risk of experiencing mild to severe depressive symptoms compared with those living in provinces with &lt;100 cases. Other related factors were gender and years of training. <b>Conclusions:</b> Some medical students suffered from a poor psychological status during the COVID-19 outbreak. Low social support was a stronger factor related to poor mental status compared with COVID-19 exposure or the provincial epidemic condition.

"Academic and emotional effects of online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic on engineering students","The unprecedented situation of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused the closure of universities worldwide and has forced the transition to online learning. This exceptional context compels us to understand students' experience with online learning. Previous literature identifies relevant factors that intervene in the online education experience and can affect students' academic development. One of the main concerns is the students' mental health, given the lockdown restrictions under which classes have been conducted. Furthermore, the impact of the prolonged lockdown and the pandemic fatigue on university students and their academic experience is still unclear. This study delves into engineering undergraduate students' online education experience during the COVID-19 pandemic and its emotional impact across time. With this aim, a questionnaire was distributed to second, third, and fourth-year engineering undergraduate students at two time points, approximately six months apart. The results show significant differences in students' connection with other students and teachers, workspace conditions, and boredom between time points. Besides, the findings indicate significant correlations between academic development and quality of online classes, adaptation of the course, workspace conditions, and connection with other students and teachers, and also between students' emotions and connection with other students and teachers.

"Improving the Perception of Patient-Centered Wellness in a Virtual Population During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Perceived health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is fundamental to well-being and is a meaningful way to measure physical and mental health. No standard method exists for measuring perceived HRQOL during the COVID-19 pandemic in participants as they attempt to improve their self-determined wellness goals. An implementation plan that considers the social distancing limitations imposed can be used to predict an individual's likelihood of long-term success. During the four, 2-week plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles, the Social Cognitive Theory model informed the implementation of the four core interventions. To guide iterative changes, the data was analyzed through Excel and run charts. The four core interventions were the shared decision-making tool (SDMT), health mobile app tool (HMAT), wellness tracker tool (WTT), and the team engagement plan. Among 28 participants, perceived quality of life increased by 70%, engagement in shared decision-making increased to 82%, app use and confidence increased to 85%, and goal attainment reached 81%. The SDMT, health app, and wellness tracker created a methodical plan of accountability for increasing participant wellness. The contextual barrier of the COVID-19 pandemic added a negative wellness burden which was mitigated by creating a patient-centered culture of wellness.","Myers, Kennedy","https://doi.org/10.1891/JDNP-D-20-00078","20210610","COVID-19; health-related quality of life; patient-centered care; wellness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-11","",14760,""
"Mental health disorders among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional survey from three major hospitals in Kenya","COVID-19 is an international global health emergency and has posed a great challenge to mental well-being and resilience. Little is known about the mental health impact of COVID-19 among healthcare workers (HCWs) in sub-Saharan Africa or other low-resource settings. We conducted a cross-sectional study between August and November 2020 among HCWs recruited from three major hospitals in Kenya. The survey questionnaire consisted of six components: demographic and work title characteristics; information regarding care of patients with COVID-19; and symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, distress and burnout, measured using standardised questionnaires. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health disorders. A total of 433 (65.2% response rate) individuals participated in the survey. Median age was 32.75 years, 58.4% were females and 68.8% were front-line workers. Depression, anxiety, insomnia, distress and burnout were reported in 53.6%, 44.3%, 41.1%, 31.0% and 45.8% of all participants, respectively. Front-line HCWs, females and doctors were at higher risk of mental health symptoms. Nearly half of participants reported inadequate resources or training to care for patients with COVID-19, and those in the government hospital were more likely to report mental health symptoms. This is among the first studies examining mental health outcomes among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya. Similar to other studies from around the world, HCWs directly involved with patients with COVID-19 reported higher rates of mental health symptoms. Mitigating strategies specific to Kenyan HCWs are urgently needed to help them cope with mental health symptoms during the pandemic.","Shah, Monroe-Wise, Talib, Nabiswa, Said, Abeid, Ali Mohamed, Mohamed, Ali","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-050316","20210610","COVID-19; depression &amp; mood disorders; mental health; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-11","",14761,""
"Evaluation of risk mitigation measures for people with substance use disorders to address the dual public health crises of COVID-19 and overdose in British Columbia: a mixed-method study protocol","The COVID-19 pandemic was preceded by an ongoing overdose crisis and linked to escalating drug overdose deaths in British Columbia (BC). At the outset of these dual public health emergencies, the BC government announced interim Risk Mitigation Guidance (RMG) that permitted prescribing medication alternatives to substances, including opioids, alcohol, stimulants and benzodiazepines, an intervention sometimes referred to as 'safe supply'. This protocol outlines the approach for a study of the implementation of RMG and its impacts on COVID-19 infection, drug-related and systemic harms, continuity of care for people with substance use disorder (SUD), as well as their behavioural, psychosocial and well-being outcomes. We conducted a parallel mixed-method study that involved both analysis of population-level administrative health data and primary data collection, including a 10-week longitudinal observational study (target n=200), a cross-sectional survey (target n=200) and qualitative interviews (target n=60). We implemented a participatory approach to this evaluation, partnering with people with lived or living expertise of drug use, and researchers and public health decision-makers across the province. Linked population-level administrative databases will analyse data from a cohort of BC residents with an indication of SUD between 1996 and 2020. We will execute high-dimensional propensity score matching and marginal structural modelling to construct a control group and to assess the impact of RMG dispensation receipt on a collaboratively determined set of primary and secondary outcomes. Study activities were developed to adhere to the Tri-Council Policy Statement: Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans, recommended COVID-19 research practices, and guided by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's Calls to Action for public health, data governance and research ethics related to Indigenous people. Results will be disseminated incrementally, on an ongoing basis, through the consortium established for this study, then published in peer-reviewed journals.","Nosyk, Slaunwhite, Urbanoski, Hongdilokkul, Palis, Lock, Min, Zhao, Card, Barker, Meilleur, Burmeister, Thomson, Beck-McGreevy, Pauly","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-048353","20210610","epidemiology; health policy; public health; substance misuse","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-11","",14762,""
"Distance education during COVID 19: an Italian survey on the university teachers' perspectives and their emotional conditions","Following the COVID-19 pandemic, distance education (DE) replaced traditional &quot;face-to-face&quot; teaching and has become the main method of teaching. The aim of this study was to 1) evaluate the impact of DE by teachers in our department during the second semester of the 2019-20 academic year following the March-May 2020 Italian national lockdown and 2) evaluate the relationship between DE and the emotional well-being of teachers during the period of home confinement. Ninety-seven university teachers (51.5% women; most represented age group 60-69Ã¢â‚¬â€°years range, 40.2%) responded to an anonymous online cross-sectional survey between July 15 - September 30, 2020, on the advantages and disadvantages of DE, developed by one online teacher focus group. The emotional conditions were assessed by a short version of the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). The internal consistency reliability survey and the 10-item BDI-II were measured by Cronbach's alpha. A correlation analysis (r-Pearson) was conducted between the overall evaluation of the experience of DE and the variables included in the study. Teachers reported difficulties in technical aspects, and in psychological factors, as the discomfort of &quot;speaking in the void&quot; (64.7%). The absence of &quot;face-to-face&quot; eye contact with the students was complained by 81% of teachers. Significant impairments in sleep patterns and loss of energy were reported, with female teachers having greater difficulty concentrating than their male colleagues. A quarter of teachers showed depressive symptoms of varying severity. The most satisfied teachers were those most stimulated by DE (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.752, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.000), who showed a lower impact of depressive symptoms (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.289, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.005). The teaching load in hours influenced the perception of disadvantages (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.214, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.035) and contributed to a lower appreciation of the challenges of DE. The more significant the manifestation of depressive symptoms during the lockdown was, the greater the subjective recovery of a good emotional condition once the domestic confinement was over (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.344, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), despite maintaining DE. Our study highlights the impact of technical, didactic, and psychological difficulties of DE, reported by our teachers. The appreciation of their new learning promoted by DE seemed related to better emotional well-being of university teachers accepting this &quot;challenge&quot; in their important role in the high-education system, influencing good learning and promoting students' professional success.","Casacchia, Cifone, Giusti, Fabiani, Gatto, Lancia, Cinque, Petrucci, Giannoni, Ippoliti, Frattaroli, Macchiarelli, Roncone","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-021-02780-y","20210610","COVID-19 pandemic; Distance education; Medical courses; University; University teachers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-11","",14763,""
"Associations between the working experiences at frontline of COVID-19 pandemic and mental health of Korean public health doctors","Demographic, work environmental, and psychosocial features are associated with mental health of healthcare professionals at pandemic frontline. The current study aimed to find predictors of mental health for public health doctors from working experiences at frontline of COVID-19 pandemic. With first-come and first-served manner, 350 public health doctors with experiences of work at COVID-19 frontline participated online survey on August 2020. Mental health was defined using the total scores of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, the Perceived Stress Scale, and the Stanford Presenteeism Scale-6. Multivariate logistic regression models of mental health with lowest Akaike Information Criterion were determined among all combinations of working environments, perceived threats and satisfaction at frontline, and demographics that were significant (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05) in the univariate logistic regression. Perceived distress, lowered self-efficacy at work, anxiety, and depressive mood were reported by 45.7, 34.6, 11.4, and 15.1% of respondents, respectively. Predictors of poor mental health found in the multivariate logistic regression analyses were environmental (insufficient personal protective equipment, workplace of screening center, prolonged workhours) and psychosocial (fear of infection and death, social stigma and rejection) aspects of working experiences at frontline. Satisfaction of monetary compensation and proactive coping (acceptance and willingness to volunteer at frontline) were predictive of better mental health. Sufficient supply of personal protective equipment and training on infection prevention at frontline, proper workhours and satisfactory monetary compensation, and psychological supports are required for better mental health of public health doctors at frontline of COVID-19 pandemic.","Han, Choi, Cho, Lee, Yun","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03291-2","20210610","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Health personnel; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-11","",14764,""
"Knowledge, attitudes and practices of patients with chronic illnesses during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional survey from Pakistan","We studied the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the physical and mental health of patients with chronic illnesses and their behavioural responses. We conducted a cross-sectional knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) survey among outpatients with chronic illnesses in Lahore, Pakistan. Four hundred and one participants were surveyed (84% above 50 years of age). One or two chronic illnesses were present in 130 (32%), three or four in 211 (53%) and more than four in 60 (15%). The majority correctly identified the sources of Covid-19 infection and higher risk patients. Of the respondents, 127 (32%) described feeling more vulnerable. Respondents reported a lack of trust in the community response (199; 49.6%) and hospital measures (167; 41.6%) to slow the spread of Covid-19 and 369 (92%) practiced some degree of social distancing. Respondents described negative impacts of lockdown measures on their physical and mental health (235; 58.6% and 262; 65.3%, respectively). Many reported difficulty in getting medical help during the pandemic (302; 75.2%). Half of the respondents (200; 49.8%) felt that delays in receiving care had adversely affected their health. Respondents with chronic illnesses frequently reported negative behavioural and health impacts during the Covid-19 pandemic.","Mahmood, Rehman, Arif, Rehman, Aasim, Saeed","https://doi.org/10.1177/17423953211023961","20210610","Chronic illness; Covid-19; attitudes; health behavior; health knowledge; mental health; practices","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-11","",14765,""
"The experience of frontline nurses four months after COVID-19 rescue task in China: A qualitative study","Aims The study was to explore the experience of frontline nurses four months after COVID-19 rescue task. Background Frontline medical staff are prone to follow-up mental health problems and different feeling after COVID-19 rescue task. However, the experience of frontline nurses after COVID-19 rescue task has not been well described. Methods The study used a qualitative study design with semi-structured interview guide. Individual semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with 15 frontline nurses who were involved COVID-19 rescue task from two tertiary-A hospitals in Hefei, China from July 10, to August 28, 2020. We followed the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ) checklist. Results Four main themes emerged from the interviews: recurring involuntary memories about the experience, feeling guilty and depressed, cultivation of occupational ability, increased professional pride and happiness. Conclusion The study demonstrated that frontline nurses had both positive and negative experiences four months after COVID-19 rescue task. It is necessary to long-term follow up and attention to the experience of the frontline nurses after COVID-19 rescue task. These insights provide a specific direction for the psychological reconstruction of frontline nurses and the construction of nursing team. Relevance to clinical practice Nursing managers should formulate psychological reconstruction plan according to the experience of frontline nurses after COVID-19 rescue task, so as to relieve the psychological stress and promote the mental health of nurses. At the same time, we should strengthen the disaster rescue ability training of nurses should be strengthened to better respond to future rescue task.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnu.2021.05.007","20210801","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-11","",14766,""
