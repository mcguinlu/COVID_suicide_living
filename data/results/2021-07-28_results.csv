"The US COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey, 2020-2021: Continuous real-time measurement of COVID-19 symptoms, risks, protective behaviors, testing and vaccination","The U.S. COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (CTIS) is a large, cross-sectional, Internet-based survey that has operated continuously since April 6, 2020. By inviting a random sample of Facebook active users each day, CTIS collects information about COVID-19 symptoms, risks, mitigating behaviors, mental health, testing, vaccination, and other key priorities. The large scale of the survey -- over 20 million responses in its first year of operation -- allows tracking of trends over short timescales and allows comparisons at fine demographic and geographic detail. The survey has been repeatedly revised to respond to emerging public health priorities. In this paper, we describe the survey methods and content and give examples of CTIS results that illuminate key patterns and trends and help answer high-priority policy questions relevant to the COVID-19 epidemic and response. These results demonstrate how large online surveys can provide continuous, real-time indicators of important outcomes that are not subject to public health reporting delays and backlogs. The CTIS offers high value as a supplement to official reporting data by supplying essential information about behaviors, attitudes toward policy and preventive measures, economic impacts, and other topics not reported in public health surveillance systems.","Joshua A Salomon; Alex Reinhart; Alyssa Bilinski; Eu Jing Chua; Wichida La Motte-Kerr; Minttu RÃ¶nn; Marissa B Reitsma; Katherine Ann Morris; Sarah LaRocca; Tamer Farag; Frauke Kreuter; Roni Rosenfeld; Ryan Tibshirani","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.24.21261076","20210726","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16475,""
"Ten insights into 4IR in the mining industry","AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT Abstract: South Africaâ€™s mining industry is increasingly making use of innovative and cutting-edge technologies to run more efficient operations. In addition, the use of technologies helps to manage risk, to improve health and safety, reduce the cost of maintenance and extraction, as well as bringing about a skills uplift. â€œAdoption of innovations emerging out of the 4IR did not go into lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the application of 4IR technologies helping Minerals Council members and others to manage the pandemic more effectively,â€ said Minerals Council South Africa CEO Roger Baxter. The COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated the digitisation of the work process, as well as the adoption of automation and other innovative tools in the mining industry. â€œSouth African mining needs 4IR. We need to be globally competitive on costs and on environmental, social and governance issues. Over the last decade, multi-factor productivity in South Africa has fallen by 7.6%,â€ Baxter said. He added that mining cost inflation was 2-3% higher annually than general inflation, leading to two thirds of our output being on the upper half of the global mining cost curve. â€œMining output declined by 10% and minerals sales contracted by 11%.â€","[Data Missing]","https://www.google.com/search?q=Ten+insights+into+4IR+in+the+mining+industry","","Database: Africa Wide Information; Publication details: Mining News; 2021(February), 2021.; Publication details: Mining News; 2021(February), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16476,""
"Pandemic kills more in US than two World Wars and Vietnam","AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT Abstract: The United States reached a staggering milestone on Monday (22 February), surpassing 500,000 known coronavirus-related deaths, A toll higher than of the number of Americans who died on the battlefields of World War I, World War II and the Vietnam War combined, reports The New York Times. The nationâ€™s total virus toll is higher than in any other country in the world. It has far surpassed early predictions of loss by some federal experts. â€œThe magnitude of it is just horrifying,â€ said Jeffrey Shaman, a professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University who has modelled the virusâ€™s spread and says that the scale of loss was not inevitable, but a result of the failure to control the virusâ€™s spread in the United States","[Data Missing]","https://www.google.com/search?q=Pandemic+kills+more+in+US+than+two+World+Wars+and+Vietnam","","Database: Africa Wide Information; Publication details: Medical Brief; 2021(0341), 2021.; Publication details: Medical Brief; 2021(0341), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16477,""

"Impact of Pharmaceutical Waste Generation and Handling on Environmental Health in Developing Countries: COVID - 19 Pandemic in Perspective!","AJOL Abstract: The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the novel Covid-19 pandemic currently ravaging the world as a global mishap due to its wide-spreading across different nations. As the number of confirmed cases continues to increase daily, there will be a great need for the delivery of pharmaceutical palliatives to developing nations for them to manage the situation. Most pharmaceutical supplies used in many developing countries such as test kits and protective suits are a complex mixture of toxic and non-degradable compounds that are improperly disposed into open dump sites. The increase in Covid-19 cases and strategic attention to grapple will lead to multiple waste generation problems, thereby posing another health risk if not properly handled and disposed. In this review, we have highlighted the composition, categories, and hazards associated with pharmaceutical wastes and also appraised the current disposal practices and recommended some appropriate disposal methods of these associated wastes","Ejeromedoghene, O.; Nwosisi, M.

"""Take your Kung-Flu back to Wuhan"": Counseling Asians, Asian Americans, and pacific islanders with race-based trauma related to COVID-19","Following the outbreak of COVID-19, reports of discrimination and violence against Asians and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) have increased substantially. The present article offers a timely conceptualization of how public and societal fears related to COVID-19 may contribute to unique mental health disparities and the presence of race-based trauma among AAPIs residing in the United States. The relationships between media, increasing rates of xenophobia and sinophobia, and racial discrimination are provided. Next, the deleterious effects of race-based discrimination on the emotional and physical well-being of people of color and Indigenous groups (POCI) and AAPIs are described. Finally, the article identifies the clinical implications of counseling AAPI clients, encourages a decolonization of current trauma-focused interventions, and presents specific strategies to heal race-based trauma in AAPI client populations.

"Religious Coping During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Gender, Occupational and Socio-economic Perspectives Among Malaysian Frontline Healthcare Workers","Objective: At the dawn of the new decade of the 20th century, the world was taken aback by the scourge of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study aimed to study the nature of religious coping of frontline healthcare workers seen through the perspective of gender, socio-economic status, and occupation. Methods: An online-based study was carried out among frontline healthcare workers involved in the care of COVID-19 patients (n = 200). Sociodemographic data form and the Brief Religious Coping scale were used in this study. Results: There were more female healthcare workers (60.5%) and doctors (69.5% vs. 30.5%). Healthcare workers used more positive religious coping than negative religious coping (median score: 22 vs. 9). Positive religious coping was seen more in females (median score: 23 vs. 21, P = .015). Non-doctors applied positive coping more than doctors (median score: 26 vs. 21, P &lt; .001). There were significant differences in positive religious coping scores across income groups, with the B40 group having the highest score (median score: 24). Post hoc pairwise comparison concluded that the B40 group had significantly higher positive religious coping scores than the M40 group. Conclusion: Positive coping was utilized more among female healthcare workers, nondoctors, and the lowest socio-economic group. As prior literature has shown that positive religious coping is desirable and has superior mental health outcomes, our findings show that more effort should be channeled into enhancing positive religious coping, particularly among male healthcare workers, doctors, and the middle and high socio-economic group.

"Psychosocial Factors Associated with Depression and Anxiety During COVID-19 Pandemic Among Outpatients with Depression","Objective: Long-term social distancing, isolation, and economic fallout may be significant psychological triggers during pandemic, such as COVID-19, especially for those with underlying psychiatric illness. This study was conducted to address the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic among patients with depression based at a teaching hospital in Malaysia. Methods: This is a cross-sectional online study among patients with depression from University Malaya Medical Centre, using Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Montgomery-Ã…sberg Depression Rating Scale-Self Assessment (MADRS-S), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP), and Social Media Addiction during COVID-19 Pandemic (SMACOP). Results: One hundred seventy-eight patients participated in this study. The mean total of the KAP score is 12.65 (SD = 2.65), with knowledge section (mean = 7.34 [SD = 2.13]), attitudes section (mean = 2.63 [SD = 0.58]), and practices section (mean = 2.69 [SD = 1.00]). They scored moderately on the MADRS-S (mean = 21.03 [SD = 4.62]) and ISI (mean = 20.25 [SD = 4.62]) but had high GAD-7 scores (mean = 16.8 (SD = 6.27]). From the multiple logistic regression analyses, depressive symptoms of greater severity (MADRS-S 18-34) are significantly associated with more severe insomnia (P &lt; .001, adjusted OR = 9.101, 95% CI: 3.613-22.924). Furthermore, the high anxiety level is associated with the younger age group (P = .029, Adjusted OR = 2.274, 95% CI: 1.090-4.746), greater severity of insomnia (P &lt; .001, Adjusted OR = 22.9, 95% CI: 6.145-85.343), and higher risk of COVID-19 related social media addiction (P = .011, adjusted OR = 2.637, 95% CI: 1.253-5.550). Conclusion: This study demonstrates the high levels of sleep disturbances and anxiety symptoms experienced by outpatients with depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. These are closely linked to the younger age group and at-risk social media addiction related to COVID-19.

"How stress, discrimination, acculturation and the gut microbiome affect depression, anxiety and sleep among Chinese and Korean immigrants in the USA: a cross-sectional pilot study protocol","IntroductionAlthough a considerable proportion of Asians in the USA experience depression, anxiety and poor sleep, these health issues have been underestimated due to the model minority myth about Asians, the stigma associated with mental illness, lower rates of treatment seeking and a shortage of culturally tailored mental health services. Indeed, despite emerging evidence of links between psychosocial risk factors, the gut microbiome and depression, anxiety and sleep quality, very few studies have examined how these factors are related in Chinese and Korean immigrants in the USA. The purpose of this pilot study was to address this issue by (a) testing the usability and feasibility of the studyâ€™s multilingual survey measures and biospecimen collection procedure among Chinese and Korean immigrants in the USA and (b) examining how stress, discrimination, acculturation and the gut microbiome are associated with depression, anxiety and sleep quality in this population.Method and analysisThis is a cross-sectional pilot study among first and second generations of adult Chinese and Korean immigrants in the greater Atlanta area (Georgia, USA). We collected (a) gut microbiome samples and (b) data on psychosocial risk factors, depression, anxiety and sleep disturbance using validated, online surveys in English, Chinese and Korean. We aim to recruit 60 participants (30 Chinese, 30 Korean). We will profile participantsâ€™ gut microbiome using 16S rRNA V3-V4 sequencing data, which will be analysed by QIIME 2. Associations of the gut microbiome and psychosocial factors with depression, anxiety and sleep disturbance will be analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics, including linear regression.Ethics and disseminationThis study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board at Emory University (IRB ID: STUDY00000935). Results will be made available to Chinese and Korean community members, the funder and other researchers and the broader scientific community.","Kim, Sangmi, Zhang, Wenhui, Pak, Victoria, Jasmine Ko, Aqua, Vicki Stover, Hertzberg, Spahr, Chandler M.; Slavich, George M.; Bai, Jinbing","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-047281","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BMJ Open; 11(7), 2021.; Publication details: BMJ Open; 11(7), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16485,""
"Informality and the Infrastructures of Inclusion: An Introduction","ABSTRACT The worrying welfare and political risks of expanding informal economies have put concerns about economic inclusion at the heart of contemporary development thinking â€” concerns further intensified in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Amid a collective â€˜will to includeâ€™, this Debate adopts an infrastructural lens to decipher the distributive and governance implications of the complex institutional, financial and digital linkages through which informal workers and consumers are being included in the circuits of contemporary market economies. Looking beyond imaginaries of seamless linkages, the articles in this Debate examine the specific processes through which these inclusive connections engage with informal actors, focusing on how they work and for whom. Articles focus on various types of inclusive infrastructures that connect deprived communities to jobs, resources and social citizenship, ranging from social protection systems to employment linkages and services for hard-to-reach populations. With a view to cutting through the ideological blurring of inclusive discourses, this Introduction will examine the strategies of legibility and regulatory restructuring effected through inclusive infrastructures. It reveals the hidden politics of inclusive linkages, reflects on the techniques of governance operating through socio-technical connections, and examines processes of resistance and failed connections reworking inclusive infrastructures from below.

"Trends in utilisation of hypnotics among Scandinavian young people","Conversely, patients with sleep disorders may be prescribed alternative hypnotic drugs that were not explored in this study, such as clonidine, one of the most commonly prescribed agents for children with ASD or ADHD and comorbid insomnia in the US, or trazodone for children with sleep problems related to anxiety or depression.11 This could lead to underestimation of the prevalence of sleep disorders. Throughout their work, the authors clearly state that the main aim of the study was to describe utilisation patterns of hypnotics and not prevalence estimates of sleep disorders. For example, drugs such as antihistamines may be used for the treatment of disorders highly prevalent in childhood, such as acute otitis media or allergic rhinitis.

"The Impact of COVID-19 on Psychotherapy Participation Among Individuals With Enrolled in Treatment Research","The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted many aspects of daily life and required a rapid and unprecedented shift in psychotherapy delivery from in-person to telemental health. In the present study, we explored the impact of the pandemic on individuals' ability to participate in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) psychotherapy and the association between the impact of COVID-19 impact on health and financial well-being and psychotherapy participation. Participants (N = 161, 63.2% male, Mage = 42.7 years) were United States military veterans (n = 108), active duty military personnel (n = 12), and civilians (n = 6), who were participating in one of nine PTSD treatment trials. The results indicate a predominately negative COVID-19 impact on therapy participation, although some participants (26.1%) found attending therapy sessions through telehealth to be easier than in-person therapy. Most participants (66.7%) reported that completing in vivo exposure homework became harder during the pandemic. Moreover, the impact of the pandemic on PTSD symptom severity and daily stress were each associated with increased difficulty with aspects of therapy participation. The findings highlight the unique challenges to engaging in PTSD treatment during the pandemic as well as a negative impact on daily stress and PTSD severity, both of which were related to treatment engagement difficulties.","McLean, C.

"A biopsychosocial-spiritual model of cell phone addiction","This study aimed to understand the biopsychosocial-spiritual factors that could impact and exacerbate addictive cell phone behavior by testing two hypotheses. First, higher levels of extraversion and neuroticism, lower levels of self-efficacy, and lower levels of spiritual well-being would be associated with cell phone addiction. Second, cell phone addiction would be negatively correlated with sleep quality and positively correlated with symptoms of anxiety and depression. Multiple regression analyses were used in order to determine the direction and strength of the above variables in relation to cell phone addiction. Results partially supported the hypotheses. More specifically, higher levels of cell phone addiction were correlated to higher levels of extraversion, neuroticism, anxiety, and depression. Conversely, there were no statistically significant associations found between cell phone addiction and reports of sleep quality, self-efficacy, or spiritual well-being. Findings from this study offered potential insights that may inform clinical practice to use empirically based treatments for anxiety and depression, which could decrease levels of cell phone addiction. Psychoeducation within the schools and psychological community on self-efficacy and spiritual well-being could provide a protective factor to cell phone addiction, anxiety, and depression.

"Secondary traumatic stress and burnout among student support personnel","As mental health concerns have increased among school-aged students in the United States, student support personnel have assumed greater responsibility in providing mental health services in schools. In the United States, it is estimated that 7.7 million children need mental health support annually. Of those children who receive care, 70% to 80 % receive mental health services in school. The purpose of this research study was to examine the prevalence of secondary traumatic stress (STS) and burnout among school psychologists, school counselors, and school social workers as indicated by the Professional Quality of Life (PROQOL) measure. Additionally, administration of the Brief COPE survey examined coping skills and self-care practices among participants to determine coping strategies that can serve as risk or protective factors among student support personnel who have experienced indirect trauma. Due to COVID-19, five questions were created to examine student support personnel's' preparedness for returning to school. Data were gathered from student support personnel (N = 230) recruited from closed Facebook groups for school psychologists, guidance counselors, and school social workers. Findings indicated that student support personnel experienced elevated levels of secondary trauma (53%) and burnout (56%). A Pearson correlation was used to explore the relationship between secondary trauma and burnout, with results indicating a positive correlation between secondary trauma and burnout scores (r (211) = .63, P &lt; .05). Findings also indicated that participants had generally positive and consistent self-care routines in place to help them deal with stress. The most frequent coping strategies used were positive, with 60% of participants (n = 116) who claimed to engage in acceptance as a coping strategy between the items ""a medium amount"" to ""a lot."" To address if demographic variables, personal trauma, and coping skills (positive and negative) were related to elevated secondary trauma scores, elevated burnout scores, self-reported work productivity, and self-reported absenteeism, multiple linear regression analyses were conducted. Results of the regression analyses revealed that the only variable that predicted elevated burnout scores, elevated secondary trauma, and lower self-reported work productivity was negative coping strategies. Implications for supporting the mental health of student support personnel are discussed.

"The effects of paced breathing versus progressive muscle relaxation on hypoglycemia confidence and diabetes distress in individuals with type 1 diabetes","Individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are more likely to experience mental health symptoms, such as anxiety and depression. Recent literature shows that some particular mental health concerns related to T1D are fear of hypoglycemia and diabetes distress, both of which are also associated with poor glycemic control. Despite the prevalence of these symptoms among individuals with T1D, there is minimal research evaluating the effectiveness of psychological interventions with this population. The purpose of this study was to determine whether one month of either Paced Breathing (PB) or Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) is a more effective intervention in increasing hypoglycemia confidence, measured using the Hypoglycemia Confidence Scale (HCS), and decreasing diabetes distress, measured using the Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS), in individuals with T1D. Twenty-seven participants completed this study. Fourteen participants were randomly assigned to the PB condition, and 13 were randomly assigned to the PMR condition. Results indicated an increase in HCS and decrease in DDS scores between baseline and post-test administrations for both groups, and these differences were significant. There were no differences in post-test HCS and DDS scores between groups. There were no differences between baseline and post-test HbA1c or time in range for either group. Previous research also shows improvements in HCS and DDS scores after interventions, consistent with this study. The results of this study indicate that relaxation techniques may be effective in improving confidence managing hypoglycemia and reducing diabetes distress among individuals with T1D. Because of the methodological changes to this study required due to COVID-19, future research should compare the effects of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Biofeedback to Electromyography (EMG) biofeedback on various psychological and metabolic outcomes in individuals with T1D. .

"REINVENTING THE FUTURE OF WORK AND BUSINESS: THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE","The post-Covid world is fraught with severe repercussions particularly psychological where human beings have been severely impacted both on the personal and professional fronts. We are staring at a mental health crisis which can be extremely debilitating in the long run and extremely detrimental to the growth of our economy. As we look at a new work culture emerging from a pandemic-stricken ambience we realize that it has undergone multifarious upheavals which as professionals in varied fields we are trying to come to terms with. Still combating the ravages wrought by this disease we are trying to rebuild our economy and also create an open dialogue through which we can negotiate the well-being of the employees in different fields who have continued to work throughout the pandemic. There has been trauma coupled with fear, anxiety, depression and angst which employees have tried to grapple with, cope with and ultimately find a solution to. The key to survival lies in the fact that the employers along with their employees need to develop a culture which will focus on self-care and collective psychological well-being. An attitude towards a holistic wellness and welfare of the workforce might be the solution to the problem. Today we are looking at a world which is already trying to limp back to the ""new normal"" status with optimism and alacrity so that they can minimize the visible after effectsof this pandemic. But what about those which are invisible? This paper is going to focus on the psychological impacts of this pandemic and the tentative emotions of apprehension and uncertainty which challenge our employees as they prepare to tackle the unseen challenges of a post-Covid world. It will also focus on strategies which can be implemented to ensure that this transition is seamless so that an environment of productivity, empowerment and care is created and enforced.","Mukherjee, Yajnaseni","https://doi.org/10.23862/kiit-parikalpana/2021/v17/i1/209025","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Parikalpana: K I I T Journal of Management; 17(1):138-146, 2021.; Publication details: Parikalpana: K I I T Journal of Management; 17(1):138-146, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16493,""
"Prospects of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and their landscape (Special Issue: SARS-CoV-2)","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus -2 (SARS-CoV-2), puzzled the whole world with its diverse, unique clinical spectrum, and unprecedented transmission dynamics. The disease caused by this virus is named as Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), reported first time in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. It had spread to almost all countries of the world disrupting the health and economy of many countries. It was the recent zoonotic spillover disease reported in humans from the Coronavirus group, without proper medicine and non-existence of prior immunity, this disease posed a challenge to both the scientific and medical fraternity. The search for safe, effective drugs to treat the disease and vaccines against the causative agent SARS- CoV-2 had begun all over the world with public and private partnerships. Many countries are part of the solidarity trail for identifying the effective drugs, clinical trials and vaccines for this global pandemic. Here in this review, we are focussing on the different vaccine production platforms being used in the preparation of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, their current status and prospects. Vaccine production technology significantly advanced in recent times by imbibing the cutting edge technologies such as nucleic acid based technologies such as DNA/RNA/Codon deoptimization and availability of safe and effective viral vectors produced through rDNA technology. The availability of complete genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2, geared up for the production of vaccine candidates based on these new vaccine production platforms, and in a record time of 4-5 months, these vaccine candidates entered in human clinical trials for the evaluation of safety and efficacy. Prior knowledge on SARS and MERS-CoV's structural and genomic features, vaccine production platforms used in making vaccines against them greatly augmented in the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine efforts. As per World Health Organization (WHO) a total of202 vaccine candidates are under developing for SARS-CoV-2, among them 47 entered in clinical trials and 156 are in the preclinical stage. These vaccines are prepared by an amalgamation of both new and old traditional vaccine production platforms such as nucleic acid base platforms, inactivated, live attenuated, recombinant viral vectors, protein and peptide-based vaccines. The success of these vaccine candidates lies in the generation of effective immune response for SARS-CoV-2 across all age groups and people with co-morbidities. We briefly summarize the different strategies of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine production and their prospects with an emphasis on different routes of administration and added a basic mathematical model depicting the importance of vaccination for any pandemic.","Bharti, Kotarya, Abhishek, Pandeya, Khalko, R.

"Interrupted dreams: memories and emotions of travel experiences during COVID-19 breakthrough","This work aims to understand the experiences of tourists who traveled during the Covid-19 breakthrough, exploring the emotions and memories of in a chronological context of the trip. The method is qualitative, based on 21 in-depth interviews with Brazilian tourists who started trips between January and March 2020, contemplating experiences in every continent of the world. The data analysis data was based on grounded theory, through open, axial and selective coding. The results demonstrate the particularities experienced in travel experiences during the pandemic, with emotions that permeate happiness, fear, frustration, tension and relief. Still, it discusses how tourists got involved with travel planning, were pressured socially and made risk assessments before traveling. During the trip, unexpected experiences generated the transfiguration of the trip previously planned, the precarious service and helplessness, as well as self-protection behavior (or not) were listed. Finally, tourists reflected on the trip and its consequences. The contributions involve the classification of studies on tourism and Covid-19, and the proposal of a theoretical framework which discusses the emotions and memories of travelers before, during and after the travel experience.","Mayer, V.

"Prescription Drug Dispensing to US Children During the COVID-19 Pandemic","BACKGROUND: After the US coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, overall prescription dispensing declined but then rebounded. Whether these same trends occurred for children is unknown. METHODS: Using the IQVIA National Prescription Audit, which contains monthly dispensing counts from 92% of US retail pharmacies, we assessed changes in the monthly number of prescriptions dispensed to US children aged 0 to 19 years during 2018-2020. We compared dispensing totals in April to December 2020 and April to December 2019 overall, by drug class, and among drug classes that typically treat acute infections (eg, antibiotics) or chronic diseases (eg, antidepressants). RESULTS: Between January 2018 and February 2020, the median monthly number of prescriptions dispensed to children was 25 744 758. Dispensing totals declined from 25 684 219 to 16 742 568 between March and April 2020, increased to 19 657 289 during October 2020, and decreased to 15 821 914 during December 2020. Dispensing totals during April to December 2020 (160 630 406) were 27.1% lower compared with April to December 2019 (220 284 613). Among the 3 drug classes accounting for the most prescriptions in 2019, the corresponding percentage changes were -55.6% for antibiotics, -11.8% for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medications, and 0.1% for antidepressants. Among drug classes that typically treat acute infections and chronic diseases, percentage changes were -51.3% and -17.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Prescription dispensing to children declined by one-quarter in April to December 2020 compared with April to December 2019. Declines were greater for infection-related drugs than for chronic disease drugs. Decreased dispensing of the latter is potentially concerning and warrants further investigation. Whether reductions in dispensing of infection-related drugs are temporary or sustained will be important to monitor going forward.","Chua, K. P.; Volerman, A.; Conti, R.

"Innovative method used in modern time for the treatment of hospital wastewater","With the advent of technologies in many countries, pharmaceutically active compounds (PhAC), personal care products (PPCPs), and other medicines have been treated by particular facilities. Although the overall rate of PhACs extraction from hospital wastewater (HWW) through different secondary wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) has been high equal to 79â€“99%, activity and proliferation of neurotransmitters are inhibited by antiseptics due to the low removal rate of some elements, such as naproxen, excellent-performance technologies are still needed. Venlafaxine and citalopram are the most used antidepressants associated with 10â€“12% removal value through WWTPs. While HWW contains various types of antibiotics, they improve biocidesâ€™ bacterial tolerance against treatment. Ozonation is one of the methods to enhance biodegradability, whereas biofilm reactors have effectively removed emerging contaminants (ECs). Combined activate sludge (CAS) and membrane filtration bioreactors will potently exclude compounds, but previous studies show that membrane filtration bioreactors are around 30%-55% more efficient. ECs elimination in tertiary treatment has shown its great ability rather than conventional treatment sectors. Moreover, ozone treatment can decrease in PPCPs value as 90â€“98% through activated carbon beds. Activated carbon (NAC) has shown its full capability for micropollutants removal from PAC and membrane bioreactors as well as PPCP reside removal from treated effluents. The ratio of infect COVID-19 in one area was directly proportional, as revealed by SARS-CoV-2 detection in both HWW and wastewater in almost all countries. In this research study, multiple treatment techniques are evaluated in order to offer great-performance technology.

A self-designed questionnaire was used to investigate the basic demographic information and COVID-19-related questions. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9(PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7(GAD-7), and Insomnia Severity Index(ISI) were used to estimate the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and insomnia among the medical staff. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was performed with PHQ-9 score, GAD-7 score, and ISI score as dependent variables. Multivariate logistic regression analysis(forward-conditional method) on depression, anxiety, and insomnia as dependent variables was performed with basic demographic information and COVID-19-related questions as independent variables. [Results] Among the surveyed medical staff, the prevalence rates of depression, anxiety, and insomnia were 14.3%, 11.2%, and 23.2%, respectively. There were no significant differences in the prevalence rates among different age, gender, local risk level, and occupation groups and those aiding Hubei Province or not. The medical staff who directly contacted fever or diagnosed patients had more serious depression(b=1.73, 95% CI: 0.79-2.66) and insomnia(b=2.43, 95% CI: 1.48-3.39) and a higher risk of insomnia(OR=1.89, 95% CI: 1.21-2.96). The medical staff whose current protective measures cannot prevent infection had more serious depression(b=1.72, 95% CI: 0.65-2.80), anxiety(b=1.75, 95% CI: 0.76-2.75), and insomnia(b=1.73, 95% CI: 0.63-2.82), and had a higher risk of depression(OR=1.97, 95% CI: 1.11-3.49), anxiety(OR=3.00, 95% CI: 1.64-5.46), and insomnia(OR=1.79, 95% CI: 1.08-2.96).[Conclusion] During the COVID-19 epidemic, the risks of depression, anxiety, and insomnia among selected medical staff are increased compared with the non-epidemic period.

"Brazilian's frequency of anxiety, depression and stress symptoms in the COVID-19 pandemic; FrequÃªncia de sintomas de ansiedade, depressÃ£o e estresse em brasileiros na pandemia COVID-19","Abstract  Objectives: to analyze the frequency of anxiety, stress and depression in Brazilians during the COVID-19 pandemic period.  Methods: cross-sectional study conducted with Brazilians during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data collection was performed via an online electronic form containing self-reported sociodemographic and mental health variables using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) using the snow-ball sampling technique. For the whole study, a significance level of 0.05 was considered, except for the application of the stepwise method, which considered a level of 0.2.  Results: 1,775 people responded the survey, mostly women (78.07%), white (58.13%), single (45.78%), currently working (63.74%). 32.03% received psychotherapy or some type of emotional support before the pandemic, 19.03% had some psychiatric diagnosis and 8.49% started some support after the beginning of the pandemic. The mean scores investigated by the DASS-21 scale were 5.53869 for depression, 4.467334 for anxiety and 8.221202 for stress.  Conclusions: during the COVID-19 pandemic, sociodemographic and mental health characteristics were mapped and in Brazilians and the symptoms of anxiety, depression and stress were identified mainly in women, single people, who did not currently work and already had some previous mental health symptom.; Resumo  Objetivos: analisar a frequÃªncia de ansiedade, estresse e depressÃ£o em brasileiros no perÃ­odo da pandemia COVID-19.

"Assessing online gaming and pornography consumption patterns during COVID-19 isolation using an online survey: Highlighting distinct avenues of problematic internet behavior","The Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has required drastic safety precautions to contain virus spread, involving a protracted self-isolation period. Those with greater perceived or actual life stress are vulnerable to develop problematic internet behaviors. Thus, we assessed how COVID-19 social isolation affected online gaming (OG) and pornography viewing (PV) in the general population. We developed an online cross-sectional survey, Habit Tracker (HabiT), completed by 1,344 adults (Ã¢â€°Â¥18Ã‚Â years). HabiT was released internationally with individuals from 80 countries participating; a majority residing in the United States and United Kingdom. We measured changes in OG (IGDS9-SF) and PV (CYPAT) behaviors before and during the COVID-19 quarantine period. We also assessed psychiatric factors such as anxiety, depression (HADS), and impulsivity (SUPPS-P). The primary outcome measures were change in amount of, and current OG and PV severity during quarantine. These measures were related to ten COVID-19-related stress factors. Overall, we observed a large increase in OG and a minor increase in PV. Those who increased OG (63%) and PV (43%) during quarantine were younger individuals, males, those who left the quarantine household infrequently, those who reported low frequency or poor quality social interactions, and those with higher depression, anxiety, and urgency impulsivity. Our findings highlight similarities between forms of problematic internet behaviors driven by stress, depression, anxiety; while highlighting distinct avenues which these behaviors can manifest. We emphasize the relevance of identifying those in need of emotional regulation interventions, to mitigate problematic internet behaviors in the context of COVID-19 isolation.","Sallie, Ritou, Bowden-Jones, Voon","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2021.107044","20210726","COVID-19; Internet use; Online gaming; Pornography; Self-isolation; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16505,""
"Social psychology and COVID-19: What the field can tell us about behavior in a pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc in the lives of people around the world. Pandemics are powerful situations that can be examined from a social psychological lens. In this special section, four articles present data collected before and during the pandemic, providing a type of quasi-experimental design that helped examine the impact of the pandemic on social behavior. A number of findings emerged: the pandemic potentially increased instances of cyberbullying; the pandemic may have increased reports that Black-White intergroup interactions are more competitive and discriminatory; the pandemic may have reduced negative attitudes and bias in domestic versus international students in the U.S; and the pandemic may have allowed feelings of helplessness to provide a fear-reducing mechanism. We expand upon these findings by discussing how social psychology can help us understand and modify behaviors related to health and social relations during major threats like a pandemic.","Meier, Cook, Faasse","https://doi.org/10.1080/00224545.2021.1935830","20210726","Behavior; Behavioral Change; COVID-19; Pandemic; Social Psychology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16506,""
"Impact of COVID-19-like symptoms on occurrence of anxiety/depression during lockdown among the French general population","The outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic lead to high levels of morbidity and mortality around the globe. Consequences of this outbreak and possible associated infection are an increase in mental health disorders and an increased likelihood of internalizing problems, particularly depression. However, to date few studies have tested this hypothesis while taking into account individuals' preexisting mental health difficulties. We used longitudinal data collected among 729 persons in the context of the French TEMPO cohort between March and June 2020 (7 waves of data collection). COVID-19-like symptoms as well as anxiety/depression (assessed by the Adult Self Report), were reported at each wave of data collection. To study the relationship between COVID-19-like symptoms and anxiety/depression, we used generalized estimation equation (GEE) models controlled for socio-demographic and health-related characteristics, including anxiety/depression prior to 2020. Overall, 27.2% of study participants reported anxiety/depression during lockdown. 17.1% of participants reported COVID-19-like symptoms during the course of follow-up, 7.3% after the beginning of lockdown, with an average number of 2.7 symptoms, and 3.6% reported respiratory distress. In multivariate analyses, nearly all the considered indicators of COVID-19-like symptoms were associated with higher odds of symptoms of anxiety/depression (symptoms Yes/No: OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.08-2.55; symptoms after the beginning of lockdown: OR = 1.91, 95% CI = 1.03-3.52; number of symptoms: OR for each additional symptom = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.02-1.39. This relationship exists after taking into account prior symptoms of anxiety/depression, which are associated with a 5-fold increased likelihood of psychological distress. And this impact is stronger among men than women. Our study shows higher risk of anxiety/depression among persons who experienced COVID-19-like symptoms, even after accounting for prior mental health difficulties. COVID-19 infection could have both a direct and indirect impact on the occurrence of psychological difficulties, and this association should be studied in greater detail.","Mary-Krause, Herranz Bustamante, HÃƒÂ©ron, Andersen, El Aarbaoui, Melchior","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255158","20210726","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16507,""
"University students' strategies of coping with stress during the coronavirus pandemic: Data from Poland","The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the functioning of universities worldwide. In Poland, the transfer to online teaching was announced without prior warning, which radically changed students' daily functioning. This situation clearly showed the students' helplessness and difficulties with coping with this new, stressful situation, highlighted in many previous studies. A sudden and far-reaching change in daily functioning caused anxiety, depression, and stress in this group. Thus, from a pedagogical and psychological point of view, it is pertinent to examine the students' strategies of coping with stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. To this end, in 2020, a sample of Polish students was anonymously measured using the Mini-COPE questionnaire. Data was gathered from 577 students from 17 universities. The statistical analysis showed that during the coronavirus pandemic, Polish students most often used the coping strategies of: acceptance, planning, and seeking emotional support. Such factors as age, gender, and place of residence influenced the choice of specific strategies of coping with stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results also showed that the youngest students had the lowest coping skills. The results allow for concluding that the students' maladaptive strategies of coping with stress, especially during the pandemic, may result in long-term consequences for their psychophysiological health and academic achievements. Thus, based on the current results and on the participatory model of intervention, a support program for students is proposed which would involve psychological, organizational, and instrumental support.","Babicka-Wirkus, Wirkus, Stasiak, KozÃ…â€šowski","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255041","20210726","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16508,""
"Perceived fear of COVID-19 and its associated factors among Nepalese older adults in eastern Nepal: A cross-sectional study","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected all age groups worldwide, but older adults have been affected greatly with an increased risk of severe illness and mortality. Nepal is struggling with the COVID-19 pandemic. The normal life of older adults, one of the vulnerable populations to COVID-19 infection, has been primarily impacted. The current evidence shows that the COVID-19 virus strains are deadly, and non-compliance to standard protocols can have serious consequences, increasing fear among older adults. This study assessed the perceived fear of COVID-19 and associated factors among older adults in eastern Nepal. A cross-sectional study was conducted between July and September 2020 among 847 older adults (Ã¢â€°Â¥60Ã¢â‚¬â€°years) residing in three districts of eastern Nepal. Perceived fear of COVID-19 was measured using the seven-item Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S). Multivariate logistic regression identified the factors associated with COVID-19 fear. The mean score of the FCV-19S was 18.1 (SD = 5.2), and a sizeable proportion of older adults, ranging between 12%-34%, agreed with the seven items of the fear scale. Increasing age, Dalit ethnicity, remoteness to the health facility, and being concerned or overwhelmed with the COVID-19 were associated with greater fear of COVID-19. In contrast, preexisting health conditions were inversely associated with fear. Greater fear of the COVID-19 among the older adults in eastern Nepal suggests that during unprecedented times such as the current pandemic, the psychological needs of older adults should be prioritized. Establishing and integrating community-level mental health support as a part of the COVID-19 preparedness and response plan might help to combat COVID-19 fear among them.","Yadav, Yadav, Singh, Ghimire, Rayamajhee, Kanti Mistry, Rawal, Ali, Kumar Tamang, Mehta","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254825","20210726","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16509,""
"Sense of coherence, social support and religiosity as resources for medical personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic: A web-based survey among 4324 health care workers within the German Network University Medicine","The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in severe detrimental effects on the mental well-being of health care workers (HCW). Consequently, there has been a need to identify health-promoting resources in order to mitigate the psychological impact of the pandemic on HCW. Our objective was to investigate the association of sense of coherence (SOC), social support and religiosity with self-reported mental symptoms and increase of subjective burden during the COVID-19 pandemic in HCW. Our sample comprised 4324 HCW of four professions (physicians, nurses, medical technical assistants (MTA) and pastoral workers) who completed an online survey from 20 April to 5 July 2020. Health-promoting resources were assessed using the Sense of Coherence Scale Short Form (SOC-3), the ENRICHD Social Support Inventory (ESSI) and one item on religiosity derived from the Scale of Transpersonal Trust (TPV). Anxiety and depression symptoms were measured with the PHQ-2 and GAD-2. The increase of subjective burden due to the pandemic was assessed as the retrospective difference between burden during the pandemic and before the pandemic. In multiple regressions, higher SOC was strongly associated with fewer anxiety and depression symptoms. Higher social support was also related to less severe mental symptoms, but with a smaller effect size, while religiosity showed minimal to no correlation with anxiety or depression. In professional group analysis, SOC was negatively associated with mental symptoms in all groups, while social support only correlated significantly with mental health outcomes in physicians and MTA. In the total sample and among subgroups, an increase of subjective burden was meaningfully associated only with a weaker SOC. Perceived social support and especially higher SOC appeared to be beneficial for mental health of HCW during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the different importance of the resources in the respective occupations requires further research to identify possible reasons.","Schmuck, Hiebel, Rabe, Schneider, Erim, Morawa, Jerg-Bretzke, Beschoner, Albus, Hannemann, Weidner, Steudte-Schmiedgen, Radbruch, Brunsch, Geiser","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255211","20210726","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16510,""
"Work and social functioning in frontline healthcare workers during the covid-19 pandemic in Italy: role of acute post-traumatic stress, depressive and anxiety symptoms","Evidence highlights healthcare workers (HCWs) facing outbreaks, particularly the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, are at increased risk of negative mental health outcomes, particularly post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), anxiety and depression. Data from previous outbreaks highlighted the risk for a negative impact on HCWs' social and occupational functioning, but scant data have investigated this issue in the framework of the covid-19 pandemic. A number of effective interventions have been proposed to support mental health and well-being of HCWs in emerging infectious outbreaks, but it is important to acknowledge the differential impact of mental disorders on different dimensions of functioning. The study explored the associations between work and social functioning and PTSS, depression and anxiety in a sample of 265 frontline HCWs employed at a major university hospital in Italy (Pisa), facing the first period of the covid-19 pandemic. Individuals were assessed by means of the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) for PTSS, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for depressive symptoms, the General Anxiety Disorder-7 Item (GAD-7) for anxiety symptoms and the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) to assess work and social functioning. Higher levels of functioning impairment were found among individuals with moderate to severe acute PTSS, depressive and anxiety symptoms with respect to those without. Acute PTSS and depressive symptoms were predictive factors of impairment in each domain of functioning analyzed. Anxiety symptoms were associated with impairment in both work and home management activities. Frontline activity was associated with impairment in both private and social leisure activities. Long-term perspective studies are warranted to better investigate the psychopathological burden on HCWs' work and social functioning and to promote adequate intervention strategies.","Carmassi, Pedrinelli, Dell'Oste, Bertelloni, Cordone, Bouanani, Corsi, Baldanzi, Malacarne, Dell'Osso, Buselli","https://doi.org/10.1708/3654.36346","20210726","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16511,""
"[The covid-19 pandemic in Italy: the impact on social life and mental health]","Italy, one of the first countries to be heavily hit by the spread of the new Coronavirus, has activated precautionary measures aimed at limiting its spread. This emergency situation may be cause of psychological distress in the general population. Therefore, the Italian Twins Registry has decided to carry out an epidemiological study to investigate the social and mental health impact of the covid-19 pandemic on Italian adults. The study has a longitudinal design and is aimed at twins of all ages residing in Italy. An online questionnaire was administered to collect information on socio-economic and health status of the participants, as well as of the households during the lockdown, and on the impact of the pandemic on participants' lives. Levels and prevalence of symptoms of anxiety, stress and depression were measured using validated instruments, such as the STAI-6, IES-R and PHQ-9. This article shows the results of the first wave of the survey (June 2020). A total of 2589 twins participated in the study, with a mean age of 45 years (range 18-93 years). Covid-19's prevalence among respondents was less than 1% and about 13% of the subjects reported that, at least, one of the household's members had symptoms of covid-19. Sixty percent of the participants changed the place and way of working and a third of the sample had to completely suspend their work. About half of the sample showed symptoms of an anxiety disorder and about 10% of the subjects had symptoms of a probable post-traumatic stress or depressive disorder. Higher mean scores on the three assessment instruments were observed among women, subjects with a low level of education and those residing in the Southern of Italy. Anxiety symptoms decreased with age. The study shows that the pandemic has had important repercussions on the socio-economic condition and mental health of the Italian population and suggests that some individuals are more vulnerable than others.","Medda, Gigantesco, Picardi, Carluccio, D'Ippolito, Ferri, Brescianini, Toccaceli, Stazi","https://doi.org/10.1708/3654.36345","20210726","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16512,""
"Overview of behavioural and psychological consequences of COVID 19","The paper aims to provide an overview of the psychological and behavioural impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on variations in behavioural response in different geographical areas due to the existence of different social-cultural contexts. Whilst anxiety, depression and economic stressors are common findings worldwide, specific behavioural responses are heavily influenced by government stances, misinformation, conspiratorialism and competing demands of resource scarcity. This has led to very different understandings of the pandemic even in geographically close areas, and more so when comparing disparate regions such as Africa, South America and Europe. The paper also comments on the absence of robust evidence regarding increases of suicidality and violence on a global level, whilst noting evidence certainly exists in specific regions. The psychological and behavioural impact of COVID is heavily influenced by the local lens. Beyond a very broad brush approaches, expected behaviours from one area cannot easily be extrapolated to others. Where possible, clinicians should be guided by local data, ideally placing expectations of responses in a cultural context.","Kendrick, Isaac","https://doi.org/10.1097/YCO.0000000000000729","20210726","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16513,""
"Frontline nurses' willingness to work during the COVID-19 pandemic: A mixed-methods study","Frontline nurses' willingness to work has significant implications for maintaining workforce stability and quality of care during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, few studies have investigated their willingness and the corresponding reasons. This study aims to examine frontline nurses' willingness to work, identify its predictors and explore its corresponding reasons. A mixed-methods design was conducted. Based on a multilevel behavioural-diagnostic model, a questionnaire survey was used to collect quantitative and qualitative data concurrently from 13 February to 24 February 2020 to explore frontline nurses' willingness to work and the corresponding reasons in two hospitals in Wuhan, China. One was a designated hospital which only received COVID-19 patients, and the other was built up temporarily for COVID-19 patients. Of the 2014 participants, most (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1950, 96.8%) indicated their willingness to work, and a few (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 64, 3.2%) expressed their unwillingness. Binary logistic regression analysis identified five predictors of participants' willingness to work, including monthly family income, average working hours per shift, belief in their colleagues' preparedness, belief in their hospitals' preparedness and levels of depression. These indicators explained 27% of the variance (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .05). Frontline nurses' willingness to work mainly arose from professional commitment, patriotism and faith, while unwillingness to do so primarily stemmed from safety concerns and family responsibility. Most frontline nurses were willing to work and showed great professional commitment. Professional commitment and patriotism were two important individual-level factors affecting frontline nurses' willingness to work during a pandemic. Strategies should be implemented, such as appreciating and acknowledging their contribution, rewarding their valuable work, arranging reasonable working hours, enhancing colleagues' and hospitals' preparedness, and providing emotional support. Moreover, adequate personal protective equipment, self-protection training and social support should be ensured to address frontline nurses' safety concerns and family responsibility.","Ke, Chan, Kong, Fu, Li, Shen, Zhu","https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.14989","20210726","COVID-19; frontline nurses; mixed-methods study; pandemic; willingness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16514,""
"Home quarantine induced health anxiety during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic- evidence from Iraq","This study aimed to assess the compliance to voluntary home quarantine and to examine the prevalence and associated factors of health anxiety among the voluntarily home quarantined population during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey questionnaire including the health anxiety questionnaire was administered to 1578 eligible adults from the general population of 19 governorates of Iraq. Self-reported compliance with home confinement was reported by a majority of respondents (83%) and was followed to a larger extent by young adults (62.2%), females (53.9%), unmarried individuals (56.7%), university graduates (54.5%), unemployed individuals (48.6%), and inhabitants of the northern provinces (50.2%). Compliance was significantly correlated to the level of personal knowledge on COVID-19. The quarantined individuals experienced greater health anxieties and preoccupations and exhibited increased reassurance-seeking behaviour. Higher knowledge of COVID-19 was a protective factor against health anxiety. A significant mental health burden is discovered among Iraqis during the quarantine period. Based on the insights gleaned from this study, psychological education and interventions should be prioritized to diminish the psychological impact of the quarantine experience, especially among the high-risk groups. Improvement in compliance to quarantine can be approached by providing better information regarding the novel infection.","Taha","https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2021.242","20210726","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Health anxiety; Iraq; Pandemic; Quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16515,""

"Healthcare providers' perceptions of virtual-care with children's mental health in a pandemic: A hospital and community perspective","The purpose of the present study was to explore the experiences of a diverse group of mental health clinicians both in hospital and in the community, who were required to rapidly adopt virtual-care practices in the delivery of mental health services to children, adolescents, and their families. Mental health clinicians (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 117) completed the Clinician Virtual-Care Experience Survey assessing the following domains: ease of technology use, client/patient-provider interaction quality, and clinician wellbeing. Although over 70% of clinicians had not used virtual-care to deliver mental health services prior to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic, more than 80% felt it was easy to operate the virtual platforms. Clinicians were divided in their perceptions of the effectiveness of virtual-care, with only 42% reporting that they felt they were as effective in delivering healthcare services virtually as compared to in-person. Virtual-care was described as being more effective for specific populations, while challenges were described in building rapport and when delivering difficult or unexpected feedback. Clinicians felt there were some benefits of adopting virtual-care practices, while challenges were also identified. Understanding of the impact of virtual-care on service providers is essential in order to strengthen mental healthcare for children, adolescents, and their families even beyond the pandemic.","Romanchych, Desai, Bartha, Carson, Korenblum, Monga","https://doi.org/10.1111/eip.13196","20210726","COVID-19; children and adolescents; mental health; psychiatry; virtual-care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16517,""
"Depressive symptoms and perception of risk during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic: A web-based cross-country comparative survey","Evidence is accumulating of the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health measures on mental health. In this emergent field, there has been little research intoÃ‚Â the role of risk perception on depressive symptoms and the contribution of health-care resources to model risk perception and mental health. The aim of this paper is to describe the relationship between individual-level perception of risk and depression, controlling for a set of confounders and for country-level heterogeneity. A cross-sectional and observational online survey was conducted using a non-probability snowball sampling technique. We use data on 11,340 respondents, living in six European countries (Italy, Sweden, United Kingdom, France, Poland, Czech Republic) who completed survey questionnaires during the first months of the pandemic. We used a fixed-effect approach, which included individual and macro-level variables. The findings suggest that a high proportion of people suffering from depression and heightened risk perception is positively associated with reporting depressive symptoms, even if this relationship varies significantly between countries. Moreover, the association is moderated by contextual factors including health-care expenditure as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product, hospital beds for acute care, and number of medical specialists per head of population. Investment in health care offers a concrete means of protecting the mental health of a population living under pandemic restrictions.","Terraneo, Lombi, Bradby","https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-9566.13350","20210726","COVID-19; mental health; pandemic; public health; risk perception","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16518,""
"Health risk assessment and health management of urban residents facing epidemic pneumonia","As the birthplace of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China, Hubei Province is prone to outbreak of epidemic pneumonia and respiratory infectious diseases due to its large population mobility and high population density. The research aims to assess the health risk of urban residents with epidemic pneumonia as an example, and formulate corresponding health management measures according to the risk degree, thus providing the basis for improving the physical and mental health level of urban residents. Hubei Province, the birthplace of COVID-19, is selected as the study area. Five cities (Wuhan, Ezhou, Jingzhou, Huanggang, and Xiaogan) with the largest number of confirmed cases are assessed for health risk. The method of health risk assessment for residents is put forward, including establishing a quantitative model and determining risk index, vulnerability index, and exposure index of epidemic pneumonia. According to the characteristics of COVID-19, the corresponding health management measures are put forward. The order of vulnerability index is HuanggangÃ¢â‚¬Å &gt; Ã¢â‚¬Å JingzhouÃ¢â‚¬Å &gt; Ã¢â‚¬Å XiaoganÃ¢â‚¬Å &gt; Ã¢â‚¬Å EzhouÃ¢â‚¬Å &gt; Ã¢â‚¬Å Wuhan; the order of risk index is WuhanÃ¢â‚¬Å &gt; Ã¢â‚¬Å XiaoganÃ¢â‚¬Å &gt; Ã¢â‚¬Å JingzhouÃ¢â‚¬Å &gt; Ã¢â‚¬Å EzhouÃ¢â‚¬Å &gt; Ã¢â‚¬Å Huanggang; the order of exposure index is WuhanÃ¢â‚¬Å &gt; Ã¢â‚¬Å JingzhouÃ¢â‚¬Å &gt; Ã¢â‚¬Å XiaoganÃ¢â‚¬Å &gt; Ã¢â‚¬Å HuanggangÃ¢â‚¬Å &gt; Ã¢â‚¬Å Ezhou; the order of risk is WuhanÃ¢â‚¬Å &gt; Ã¢â‚¬Å JingzhouÃ¢â‚¬Å &gt; Ã¢â‚¬Å EzhouÃ¢â‚¬Å &gt; Ã¢â‚¬Å HuanggangÃ¢â‚¬Å &gt; Ã¢â‚¬Å Xiaogan.

"Mental health emergencies and COVID-19: the impact of 'lockdown' in the East Midlands of the UK","The most immediate response of the research community to COVID-19 has been a focus on understanding the effects, treatment and prevention of infection. Of equal and ongoing importance is elucidating the impact of mitigation measures, such as lockdown, on the well-being of societies. Research about mental health and lockdown in the UK has predominately involved large surveys that are likely to encounter self-selection bias. Further, self-reporting does not constitute a clinical judgement. To (a) compare the age, gender and ethnicity of patients experiencing mental health emergencies prior compared with during lockdown, (b) determine whether the nature of mental health emergencies has changed during compared with before lockdown, (c) explore the utility of emergency medical service data for identifying vulnerability to mental health emergencies in real time during a pandemic. A total of 32 401 clinical records of ambulance paramedics attending mental health emergencies in the East Midlands of the UK between 23 March and 31 July 2020 and the same period in 2019 were analysed using binary logistic regression. People of younger age, male gender and South Asian and Black ethnicity are particularly vulnerable to acute mental health conditions during lockdown. Patients with acute cases of anxiety have increased during lockdown whereas suicide and intentional drug overdose have decreased. Self-reported data may underrepresent the true impact of lockdown on male mental health and ethnic minority groups. Emergency medical data can be used to identify vulnerable communities in the context of the extraordinary circumstances surrounding the current pandemic, as well as under more ordinary circumstances.","Moore, Siriwardena, Gussy, Tanser, Hill, Spaight","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.973","20210726","COVID-19; emergency medical data; lockdown; mental health; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16520,""
"Women's psychological health, family function, and social support during their third trimester of pregnancy within the COVID-19 epidemic: A cross-sectional survey","The study aims to investigate women's psychological health, family function, and social support during the third trimester within the COVID-19 epidemic. From January 30, 2020 to February 26, 2020, 177 pregnant women during their third trimester (mean gestation time was 37.05Ã‚Â±4.06 weeks) in a maternal and children's hospital were investigated using the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Family APGAR Index, and the Perceived Social Support Scale. Non-parametric tests were conducted in the study. The statistical significance was set as p &lt; 0.05. The incidence rate of the participants' anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 epidemic was 19.21% and 24.29%, respectively. The participants' greatest concerns in the previous week were the risk of virus transmission (79.66%), and the prenatal examination and fetal growth (70.62%). The SAS ranks were higher in the participants who were concerned about the prenatal examination and fetal growth and work-related affairs. The participants' psychological health was indirectly affected by the epidemic through the supply of medical resources and work-related factors. The medical staff should employ family support and social resources to guarantee the accessibility of medical services and living materials to decrease the pregnant women's stress and further improve their psychological health.","He, Ren, Luo, Xiang, Wang, Gu, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2021.244","20210726","COVID-19; family function; pregnant women; psychology; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16521,""
"Syndemic contexts: findings from a review of research on non-communicable diseases and interviews with experts","Syndemics are characterized by the clustering of two or more health conditions, their adverse interaction, and contextual factors that create the conditions for clustering and/or interaction that worsens health outcomes. Studying syndemics entails drawing on diverse disciplines, including epidemiology and anthropology. This often means collaboration between researchers with different scholarly backgrounds, who share and - ideally - integrate their findings. This article examines how context within syndemics has been defined and studied. A literature review of empirical studies focusing on syndemics involving non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and mental health conditions was conducted and the full text of 13 articles was analyzed. The review was followed-up with semi-structured interviews with 11 expert researchers working in the field. The review and interviews highlighted a relatively consistent definition of syndemics. The reviewed studies of NCD-related syndemics tended to focus on micro-level context, suggesting a need to analyze further underlying structural factors. In their syndemics research, respondents described working with other disciplines and, although there were some challenges, welcomed greater disciplinary diversity. Methodological gaps, including a lack of mixed methods and longitudinal studies, were identified, for which further interdisciplinary collaborations would be beneficial. NCD-related syndemics research would benefit from further analysis of structural factors and the interconnections between syndemic components across multiple levels, together with more ambitious research designs integrating quantitative and qualitative methods. Research on the COVID-19 pandemic can benefit from a syndemics approach, particularly to understand vulnerability and the unequal impacts of this public health crisis.","Pirrone, Dieleman, Reis, Pell","https://doi.org/10.1080/16549716.2021.1927332","20210726","Syndemics; conceptualisation; context; interdisciplinarity; methodology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16522,""
"Mental Health and COVID-19: Policies, Guidelines, and Initiatives from the Asia-Pacific Region","The COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020 due to rapid intercontinental spread and high morbidity and mortality. Globally, the disease has had a major impact on human lives, including health, economic, employment, psychological, and overall well-being. The COVID-19, besides causing respiratory, neurological, and cardiovascular diseases, has had significant impact on mental health. Major mental health disorders, including depression, anxiety, and stress, have risen in parallel with increasing prevalence of COVID-19. Many population groups, including children, the elderly, those with chronic illnesses, and health care workers, have been affected. This review gives an overall assessment of the prevalence of COVID-19-associated psychological morbidity. In countries in the Asia-Pacific region, prevalence of depression ranged between 4.9% and 43.1%, anxiety from 7.0 to 43.0%, and stress from 3.4% to 35.7%. As COVID-19 continues to severely affect the psychosocial well-being of the population at large, countries have developed and revised policies, guidelines, and introduced new initiatives to curb mental health issues among their citizens. In the long run, pre-disaster preparedness is important to alleviate long-term post-pandemic psychiatric morbidity and to develop psychological resilience toward disasters and pandemic, alongside investment for better mental health coverage.","Samy, Awang Bono, Tan, Low","https://doi.org/10.1177/10105395211025901","20210726","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; guidelines; mental health; policies; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16523,""

"Breast health screening: a UK-wide questionnaire","Currently, there is an unmet clinical need in identifying and screening women at high risk of breast cancer, where tumours are often aggressive and treatment intervention is too late to prevent metastasis, recurrence and mortality. This has been brought into sharp focus by the SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic, constantly changing hospital policies and surgical guidelines in reducing access to established screening and treatment regimens. Nipple aspirate fluid (NAF), is thought to provide a unique window into the biological processes occurring within the breast, particularly in the context of a developing neoplasm. Evaluation of NAF in asymptomatic women, for novel chemical biomarkers of either early disease and/or cancer risk offers tremendous promise as a tool to facilitate early detection and to supplement screening. However, it is acceptability as a method of collection and screening by women is critical and yet unknown. A breast health questionnaire was disseminated to women through breast cancer charities, patient support groups and social media platforms, with the aim of collecting opinions on the acceptability of use of NAF as a potential screening tool. Following ethical approval a questionnaire was prepared using online surveys consisting of four parts: (a) introduction on breast health screening in the UK, (b) core demographic data, (c) questions regarding screening and the acceptability of using NAF and (d) opinions about the process of collecting and using nipple fluid for screening. The voluntary and anonymous questionnaire was disseminated through social media, professional networks, charity websites and by individuals between October 2019 and December 2020. Survey responses were collected electronically, and the data analysed using online surveys statistical tools. A total of 3178 women completed the questionnaire (65.9% Caucasian, 27.7% Asian/British Asian, 0.6% black and 5.0% other). Of these, 2650 women (83.4%) had no prior knowledge of NAF and 89.4% were unaware that NAF can be expressed in up to 90% of all women. Concerning their risk of breast cancer, 89.8% of women were keen to know their future risk of breast cancer, 8.5% were unsure whether they wanted to know their risk and a further, 1.6% did not want to know. Regarding screening, 944 women (29.8%) were unaware of the lack of routine National Health Service Breast Screening for those under the age of 47 years. Furthermore, 53.0% of women were unaware that mammographic screening is affected by breast density. In terms of the acceptability of home testing for breast health, 92.0% were keen to undergo a home test. Both 79.7% and 70.9% stated they would consider hand massage and a breast pump to acquire nipple fluid samples, respectively. A further 48.6% of women would consider the use of a hormonal nasal spray for the same purpose. However, with regards to acquiring results from NAF testing, 42.6% of women would prefer to receive results at home and 34.2% in a medical facility. Finally, 91.6% of women believed that breast health should be incorporated as part of school education curriculum. Public awareness regarding breast screening protocols and limitations of mammography could be improved. Many women were unaware that NAF might be a useful biofluid for future risk prediction, and yet the concept of self-testing of nipple fluid, with either hand massage or a breast pump was well received. Efforts should be made to increase awareness of the benefits of alternative and supplementary tests, especially in the context of high-risk individuals and younger patients.","Jiwa, Takats, Leff, Sutton","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjnph-2021-000266","20210727","COVID-19; biomarker; mental health; microbiome","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16526,""
"Weight loss, hypertension and mental well-being improvements during COVID-19 with a multicomponent health promotion programme on Zoom: a service evaluation in primary care","Obesity is a risk factor for complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection, increasing the need for effective weight management measures in primary care. However, in the UK, COVID-19 restrictions have hampered primary care weight management referral and delivery, and COVID-19 related weight gain has been reported. The present study evaluated outcomes from a multicomponent weight loss and health promotion programme in UK primary care, delivered remotely due to COVID-19 restrictions. Patients with obesity, type 2 diabetes or pre-diabetes attended six 90Ã¢â‚¬â€°min sessions over 10 weeks on Zoom. The dietary component comprised a low-carbohydrate 'real food' approach, augmented with education on physical activity, intermittent fasting, gut health, stress management, sleep and behaviour change. Anthropometric and cardiometabolic data were self-reported. Mental well-being was assessed with the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale. Subjective outcomes and participant feedback about the programme were collected with an anonymous online survey. Twenty participants completed the programme. Weight loss and improvements in body mass index, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and mental well-being achieved statistical and clinical significance. Mean weight loss (5.8Ã¢â‚¬â€°kg) represented a 6.5% weight loss. Participants' subjective outcomes included weight loss without hunger (67%) and increased confidence in their ability to improve health (83%). All participants reported the usage of Zoom to access the programme as acceptable with 83% reporting it worked well.

"Community Case Study of Naloxone Distribution by Hospital-Based Harm Reduction Program for People Who Use Drugs in New York City","<b>Background:</b> In 2017, The Respectful and Equitable Access to Comprehensive Healthcare (REACH) Program at Mount Sinai Hospital became a registered Opioid Overdose Prevention Program (OOPP) and received funding from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to develop a program to provide overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND) training to at risk population and bystanders. We report on the programmatic quality improvement initiatives conducted. <b>Methods:</b> From April 2017 to December 2020, the REACH OOPP conducted 290 opioid overdose reversal trainings, throughout the Mount Sinai Health System and in multiple other community settings. OEND training was at times offered alone and in other settings alongside Hepatitis C Virus point of care testing. Additionally, a ""train the trainer"" model was implemented whereby medical students and nurses at outpatient clinics were trained to train others. <b>Results:</b> There were 4235 naloxone kits distributed to 3,906 participants. The training venues included hospital settings (patients and medical staff), public events, substance use programs, educational facilities, homeless prevention programs, faith-based organizations, alternative to incarceration programs, and community-based organizations. We implemented two types of training. During outreach sessions, we utilized one-on-one personalized sessions to train bystanders. When training clinic staff in the ""train the trainer"" model we utilized a standardized didactic presentation with slides. The two top reasons participants reported for being trained were ""Just in case I see someone overdose"" (59.3%) and ""I'm worried that someone I know will overdose OR that I will overdose"" (20.2%). <b>Conclusion:</b> The REACH program at Mount Sinai Hospital developed an effective model to train community bystanders and health care staff by leveraging administrative support and building on broader programmatic initiatives to promote drug user health and stigma-free care for people who use drugs. Hospitals do not currently mandate staff training or keeping naloxone stocked at inpatient units or outpatients clinics posing a challenge when implementing an OEND program in this setting. A recommended policy change needed to decrease overdose deaths is for hospitals to be required to implement systematic naloxone education and access for all health care personal and at risk patients.","Riazi, Toribio, Irani, Hughes, Huxley-Reicher, McBratney, Vu, Sigel, Weiss","https://doi.org/10.3389/fsoc.2021.619683","20210727","COVID-19; naloxone; naloxone training; narcan; opioid education; overdose; overdose education and naloxone distribution; take-home-naloxone","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16529,""
"Grief in Response to Uncertainty Distress Among Veterinary Students During the Early Stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic","The abrupt and life-altering shifts brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic have stimulated research in fields ranging from social sciences to virology. This study explored perceptions and experiences of COVID-19's impact on students at Lincoln Memorial University-College of Veterinary Medicine (LMU-CVM) and considered how to respond to these. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 20 students from LMU-CVM. Thematic analysis elucidated five subthemes that were combined into two main themes based on Bertuccio's framework of grief in response to uncertainty distress. Uncertainty and disruption of routine were subthemes of ambiguous loss, while lost opportunities, milestones missed, and risk concern came under anticipatory grief. There was overlap and fluidity within these themes, with frustration, stress, and unexpected benefits pervading all categories. Differences were noted between classes, with clinical students expressing concern over graduation and lack of preparedness, and preclinical students with online assessment, lost opportunities for clinical experiences, and the loss of social connections. These results point to mitigation strategies for the adverse effects of COVID-19-related stressors specific to this population that encompass academic, physical, and mental well-being concerns. Clear communication, assurance of quality education, flexibility for meeting family needs, financial assistance, and mental health support are the areas evident from the interviews where successful responses might be targeted.

"Attitudes Toward COVID-19 Vaccines in Chinese Adolescents","<b>Background:</b> As COVID-19 vaccination programs are being implemented widely, it is important to examine the attitudes of adolescents toward the COVID-19 vaccine and its uptake. The aim of this study was to examine the acceptance of and attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines, and their associated factors among adolescents in China. <b>Methods:</b> This was a cross-sectional, observational study conducted between November 27, 2020 and March 12, 2021 using snowball sampling method. Basic sociodemographic characteristics, health-related information, severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms, and attitudes and behavior toward COVID-19 vaccines were assessed. <b>Results:</b> Overall, 1,057 adolescents participated in this study, yielding a response rate of 89.3%. There were 799 (75.59%) [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 73.00-78.18%] adolescents who would accept future COVID-19 vaccination. Binary logistic regression analysis revealed that adolescents who previously heard about COVID-19 vaccines (<i>P</i> = 0.001, odds ratio (OR) = 1.90, 95%CI:1.32-2.74), who thought that COVID-19 vaccines could protect them from COVID-19 infection (<i>P</i> = 0.002, OR = 2.93, 95%CI: 1.49-5.70), and those who encouraged their family members and friends to get vaccinated (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001, OR = 12.19, 95%CI: 6.78-21.92) and who believed that vaccines are safe (<i>P</i> = 0.012, OR = 3.94, 95%CI: 1.36-11.44) were more likely to accept future COVID-19 vaccination. In addition, younger adolescents (<i>P</i> = 0.003, OR = 0.93, 95%CI: 0.89-0.98) were more likely to accept future COVID-19 vaccines than older adolescents. <b>Conclusions:</b> In conclusion, Chinese adolescents appeared to have positive attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines.

"Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Psychological Well-Being and Mental Health Based on a German Online Survey","<b>Objective and Background:</b> To contain the COVID-19 pandemic, public health actions have changed the everyday life with an inevitable impact on individuals and their social life. Since intact (socio-)psychological functioning and mental health are protective factors contributing to the immune system and preventing diseases, it is crucial to identify individuals with increased vulnerability. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a German online survey from April until August 2020 investigating health-related, social, behavioral, and psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. One hundred and seventy three adults participating in the survey were analyzed (39.9% male, age: <i>M</i> = 44.81Ã‚Â±13.31). We explored effects on mental health by (a) clustering participants in two clusters and (b) analyzing the clusters using correlations and regression models. <b>Results:</b> Participants belonged either to a cluster characterized by higher general well-being or to a more concerned cluster depending on their responses. The correlation analysis revealed a significant negative relation between age and well-being with younger participants revealing higher depression scores in the concerned cluster. Furthermore, multiple regression models revealed that the number of risk factors only has a significant influence on psychological well-being in the concerned but not in the comfortable cluster. <b>Conclusion:</b> We found that especially participants at (a) younger age and (b) greater risk of a severe course of disease reported reduced mental well-being and seemed to be weakened in their psychological protective factors in our sample. These insights allow to provide tailored recommendations for preventive and immediate actions to promote psychological well-being and reduce stress.","Lingelbach, Piechnik, Gado, Janssen, Eichler, Hentschel, Knopf, Schuler, Sernatinger, Peissner","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.655083","20210727","COVID-19 pandemic; correlation; mental and public health; mixed data clustering; multiple regression; psychological well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16532,""
"Depression and Coping Styles of College Students in China During COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systemic Review and Meta-Analysis","<b>Background:</b> The rapid spread and uncertain outcome of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) around the world have caused worry, fear, and stress among the general population. Nevertheless, the prevalence of depression among college students in China during lockdown, following the COVID-19 pandemic, and their coping strategies have not been quantitatively assessed. <b>Objective:</b> We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of depression among college students in China during the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic and assess their coping strategies. <b>Methods:</b> Systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to assess the prevalence of depression among college students in China and their coping strategies. <b>Results:</b> The results indicated that, during lockdown in the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence rates of college students in China suffering from mild, moderate, and severe depression were 25% (95% CI = 17-33%), 7% (95% CI = 2-14%), and 2% (95% CI = 1-5%), respectively. Besides, the proportion of college students who use WeChat and Weibo to acquire COVID-19 knowledge was 39% (95% CI = 13-68%), whereas the proportion of college students using mental health application services (APPs) to deal with depression was 59% (95% CI = 41-73%). <b>Conclusions:</b> The prevalence of depression among college students in China was high during the lockdown in the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, considering the adverse outcomes of depression, it is imperative to screen college students in China for depression during the CIVID-19 pandemic and provide them with necessary psychological interventions to control and prevent depression. Social media platforms, such as WeChat and Weibo, and mental health APPs could provide an opportunity for psychological health information dissemination for college students.

"SPICE-19: a 3-Month Prospective Cohort Study of 640 Medical Students and Foundation Doctors","There is paucity of data around the support that medical students have been provided with, need to be provided with, and would like to be provided with during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study sought to explore the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical students and establish the support they require. A prospective, observational, multicentre study was conducted in 2020. All medical students and interim foundation year 1 doctors were eligible to participate. Six hundred forty individuals participated from 32 medical schools. Participants reported a drop in their mood following the onset of the pandemic (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). This drop in mood was evident in both May and August. Participants did have an improved mood in August compared to May (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). There was a significant decrease in pandemic disease-anxiety (13.8/20 to 12.4/20, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and consequence-anxiety (6.3/10 to 6.0/10, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) between May and August.

"Increases in Stressors Prior to-Versus During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States Are Associated With Depression Among Middle-Aged Mothers","Working parents in are struggling to balance the demands of their occupation with those of childcare and homeschooling during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, studies show that women are shouldering more of the burden and reporting greater levels of psychological distress, anxiety, and depression relative to men. However, research has yet to show that increases in psychological symptoms are linked to changes in stress during the pandemic. Herein, we conduct a small-<i>N</i> study to explore the associations between stress and psychological symptoms during the pandemic among mothers using structural equation modeling, namely latent change score models. Thirty-three mothers completed questionnaires reporting current anxious and depressive symptoms (Beck Anxiety and Depression Index, respectively), as well as stressful life experiences prior to-versus during the pandemic (Social Readjustment Rating Scale). Women endorsed significantly more stressful events during the pandemic, relative to the pre-pandemic period. Additionally, 58% of mothers scored as moderate-to-high risk for developing a stress-related physical illness in the near future because of their pandemic-level stress. Depressive symptoms were associated with the degree of change in life stress, whereas anxiety symptoms were more related to pre-pandemic levels of stress. The present study preliminarily sheds light on the nuanced antecedents to mothers' experiences of anxious and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although further work is needed in larger, more diverse samples of mothers, this study highlights the potential need for appropriate policies, and prevention and intervention programs to ameliorate the effects of pandemics on mothers' mental health.","Taylor, Frenzel, Johnson, Willett, White, Badura-Brack, Wilson","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.706120","20210727","anxiety; coronavirus Ã¢â‚¬â€œ COVID-19; depression; maternal; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16535,""
"Protectors of Wellbeing During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Key Roles for Gratitude and Tragic Optimism in a UK-Based Cohort","The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a global threat to physical and mental health worldwide. Research has highlighted adverse impacts of COVID-19 on wellbeing but has yet to offer insights as to how wellbeing may be protected. Inspired by developments in wellbeing science and guided by our own theoretical framework (the GENIAL model), we examined the role of various potentially protective factors in a sample of 138 participants from the United Kingdom. Protective factors included physical activity (i.e., a health behaviour that helps to build psychological wellbeing), tragic optimism (optimism in the face of tragedy), gratitude (a prosocial emotion), social support (the perception or experience of being loved, cared for, and valued by others), and nature connectedness (physical and psychological connection to nature). Initial analysis involved the application of one-sample <i>t</i>-tests, which confirmed that wellbeing (measured by the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being scale) in the current sample (<i>N</i> = 138; <i>M</i> = 46.08, SD = 9.22) was significantly lower compared to previous samples (<i>d</i> = -0.36 and <i>d</i> = -0.41). Protective factors were observed to account for up to 50% of variance in wellbeing in a hierarchical linear regression that controlled for a range of sociostructural factors including age, gender, and subjective social status, which impact on wellbeing but lie beyond individual control. Gratitude and tragic optimism emerged as significant contributors to the model. Our results identify key psychological attributes that may be harnessed through various positive psychology strategies to mitigate the adverse impacts of hardship and suffering, consistent with an existential positive psychology of suffering.","Mead, Fisher, Tree, Wong, Kemp","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.647951","20210727","COVID-19; GENIAL model; gratitude; positive psychology; second wave positive psychology; tragic optimism; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16536,""

"RCTE: A Reliable and Consistent Temporal-ensembling Framework for Semi-supervised Segmentation of COVID-19 Lesions","The segmentation of COVID-19 lesions from computed tomography (CT) scans is crucial to develop an efficient automated diagnosis system. Deep learning (DL) has shown success in different segmentation tasks. However, an efficient DL approach requires a large amount of accurately annotated data, which is difficult to aggregate owing to the urgent situation of COVID-19. Inaccurate annotation can easily occur without experts, and segmentation performance is substantially worsened by noisy annotations. Therefore, this study presents a reliable and consistent temporal-ensembling (RCTE) framework for semi-supervised lesion segmentation. A segmentation network is integrated into a teacher-student architecture to segment infection regions from a limited number of annotated CT scans and a large number of unannotated CT scans. The network generates reliable and unreliable targets, and to evenly handle these targets potentially degrades performance. To address this, a reliable teacher-student architecture is introduced, where a reliable teacher network is the exponential moving average (EMA) of a reliable student network that is reliably renovated by restraining the student involvement to EMA when its loss is larger. We also present a noise-aware loss based on improvements to generalized cross-entropy loss to lead the segmentation performance toward noisy annotations. Comprehensive analysis validates the robustness of RCTE over recent cutting-edge semi-supervised segmentation techniques, with a 65.87% Dice score.","Ding, Abdel-Basset, Hawash","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2021.07.059","20210726","COVID-19; CT scans; Deep learning; Semi-supervised learning; Temporal-ensembling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16542,""

"Twitter communication of the UK public on dental health and care during a COVID lockdown: ""My kingdom for a dentist""","The COVID-19 pandemic forced a UK-wide closure of dental services. An understanding of public concerns about dental care was urgently needed to inform careful resumption of paused dental services. To describe public concerns about dental care during lockdown. Framework analysis of relevant Twitter posts identified collected using the Awario tool. Of 1863 tweets manually screened for eligibility, 285 were relevant, as they contained views expressed by the public. The number of tweets by country were proportionate to the population size. The key views expressed in tweets focused on: 'oral health impact' ('oral health and self-care', 'types of dental problems', 'managing symptoms at home', 'views on consequences of delaying treatment') and 'dental service or care provision' ('views on managing dental care response', 'experiences with access to dental care'). The impact of COVID-19 on dental services raised many physical and mental health concerns for the public, highlighting their importance.

"Rationale and study design of an early care, therapeutic education, and psychological intervention program for the management of post-intensive care syndrome and chronic pain after COVID-19 infection (PAIN-COVID): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial","Critically ill patients with COVID-19 are an especially susceptible population to develop post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Patients can suffer acute severe pain and may have long-term mental, cognitive, and functional health deterioration after discharge. However, few controlled trials are evaluating interventions for the prevention and treatment of PICS. The study hypothesis is that a specific care program based on early therapeutic education and psychological intervention improves the quality of life of patients at risk of developing PICS and chronic pain after COVID-19. The primary objective is to determine whether the program is superior to standard-of-care on health-related quality of life at 6 months after hospital discharge. The secondary objectives are to determine whether the intervention is superior to standard-of-care on health-related quality of life, incidence of chronic pain and degree of functional limitation, incidence of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress syndrome at 3 and 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°months after hospital discharge. The PAINCOVID trial is a unicentric randomized, controlled, patient-blinded superiority trial with two parallel groups. The primary endpoint is the health-related quality of life at 6 months after hospital discharge, and randomization will be performed with a 1:1 allocation ratio. This paper details the methodology and statistical analysis plan of the trial and was submitted before outcome data were available. The estimated sample size is 84 patients, 42 for each arm. Assuming a lost to follow-up rate of 20%, a sample size of 102 patients is necessary (51 for each arm). This is the first randomized clinical trial assessing the effectiveness of an early care therapeutic education, and psychological intervention program for the management of PICS and chronic pain after COVID-19. The intervention will serve as proof of the need to implement early care programs at an early stage, having an incalculable impact given the current scenario of the pandemic.

"Sense of purpose in life predicts greater willingness for COVID-19 vaccination","Despite the clear public health significance of herd immunity to COVID-19, a host of individual differences influence willingness to get vaccinated. One factor likely to motivate individuals is the extent they have a sense of purpose in life, based on the health correlates of purpose and purposeful individuals' desire to return to their pre-pandemic environments. The current study examined sense of purpose as a predictor of COVID-19 vaccination willingness in the United States immediately following the initial approval of a COVID-19 vaccine in the United States in 2020. A nationwide sample of U. S. adults (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2009) completed a poll including information on their sense of purpose in life, demographic factors, and depressive symptoms, immediately following the initial approval of a COVID-19 vaccine in the United States in 2020. In addition, they reported on how willing they would be to get the vaccine, assuming that the costs would be covered, as well as their motivations to get the vaccine. Multiple regression analyses found that sense of purpose predicted greater willingness to get vaccinated, even when accounting for demographic factors, political affiliation, and psychological wellbeing. Adults higher on sense of purpose reported greater importance of getting the vaccine for personal health, the health of others, and to return to regular activities. Exploratory analyses also suggest that purpose may provide a stronger impetus to vaccinate among those in age groups associated with lower risk for severe COVID-19 complications. Although cross-sectional in nature, the current findings suggest sense of purpose in life may be an important factor in encouraging vaccination. Implications are discussed regarding how purposeful messaging may yield greater vaccination rates among individuals who otherwise may be less motivated due to health concerns.","Hill, Burrow, Strecher","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114193","20210727","COVID-19; Sense of purpose; Vaccination; Vaccine attitudes","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16550,""
"Child and family factors associated with child mental health and well-being during COVID-19","Understanding the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on the current generation of youth is critical for post-pandemic recovery planning. This study aimed to identify the most salient child (i.e., connectedness to caregivers, screen time, sleep, physical activity, peer relationships, and recreational activities) and family (i.e., COVID-19 financial impact, maternal depression and anxiety) factors associated with children's mental health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic, after controlling for pre-pandemic mental health. This study included 846 mother-child dyads (child age 9-11) from the All Our Families cohort. Mothers reported on the child's pre-pandemic mental health at age 8 (2017-2019) and during COVID-19 (May-July 2020), the family's financial impact due to COVID-19, and maternal depression and anxiety. During COVID-19 (July-August 2020), children reported on their screen time, sleep, physical activity, peer and family relationships, and recreational activities, as well as their happiness, anxiety and depression.

"Weight gain in Chinese youth during a 4-month COVID-19 lockdown: a retrospective observational study","To observe the weight change in Chinese youth during a 4-month COVID-19 lockdown, and the association between weight change and mental health, physical activity and sedentary time changes, and dietary habits. A retrospective observational study. Two universities located in Zhejiang and Hunan provinces, China. This study enrolled 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°889 college students whose body weight was measured before the lockdown (1 December 2019-20 January 2020) at the two universities, and reported their weight measured at home or community after the end of the lockdown (1-23 May 2020) via an online follow-up questionnaire. The primary outcome was the weight change in Chinese youth during a 4-month lockdown resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The secondary outcomes were the relationships of weight change to COVID-19-related stress, depression, anxiety, physical activity and sedentary time changes, and dietary habits. Participants' ages ranged from 17 to 27 years (<i>M</i>=19, SD=1) with 80.2% identified as female. The average absolute and relative changes in body weight were 2.6 (95% CI 2.0 to 3.2)) kg and 4.2% (95% CI 4.0% to 4.3%) for men, and 2.1 (1.9 to 2.4)Ã¢â‚¬â€°kg and 4.2% (95% CI 3.9% to 4.4%) for women. An increase in overweight and obese individuals according to Asian cut-off points as a demographic percentage by 4.5% and 2.7% and 4.8% and 3.4% in men and women, respectively (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001), was observed. Weight gain was significantly associated with increased sedentary time and an increase in COVID-19-related stress and depression score.

Population-based cross-sectional study. Iceland. A total of 22Ã¢â‚¬â€°861 individuals were recruited through invitations to existing nationwide cohorts and a social media campaign from 24 April to 22 July 2020, of which 373 were patients recovering from COVID-19. Symptoms of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire), anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder Scale) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; modified Primary Care PTSD Screen for DSM-5) above screening thresholds. Adjusting for multiple covariates and comorbidities, multivariable Poisson regression was used to assess the association between COVID-19 severity and mental morbidities. Compared with individuals without a diagnosis of COVID-19, patients recovering from COVID-19 had increased risk of depression (22.1% vs 16.2%; adjusted relative risk (aRR) 1.48, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.20 to 1.82) and PTSD (19.5% vs 15.6%; aRR 1.38, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.09 to 1.75) but not anxiety (13.1% vs 11.3%; aRR 1.24, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 0.93 to 1.64).

"Creating a Proficiency-based Remote Laparoscopic Skills Curriculum for the COVID-19 Era","Social distancing restrictions due to COVID-19 challenged our ability to educate incoming surgery interns who depend on early simulation training for basic skill acquisition. This study aimed to create a proficiency-based laparoscopic skills curriculum using remote learning. Content experts designed 5 surgical tasks to address hand-eye coordination, depth perception, and precision cutting. A scoring formula was used to measure performance: cutoff time - completion time - (KÃ¢â‚¬Â¯Ãƒâ€”Ã¢â‚¬Â¯errors)Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯score; the constant K was determined for each task. As a benchmark for proficiency, a fellowship-trained laparoscopic surgeon performed 3 consecutive repetitions of each task; proficiency was defined as the surgeon's mean score minus 2 standard deviations. To train remotely, PGY1 surgery residents (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯29) were each issued a donated portable laparoscopic training box, task explanations, and score sheets. Remote training included submitting a pre-test video, self-training to proficiency, and submitting a post-test video. Construct validity (expert vs. trainee pre-tests) and skill acquisition (trainee pre-tests vs. post-tests) were compared using a Wilcoxon test (median [IQR] reported). The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas PARTICIPANTS: Surgery interns RESULTS: Expert and trainee pre-test performance was significantly different for all tasks, supporting construct validity. One trainee was proficient at pre-test. After 1 month of self-training, 7 additional residents achieved proficiency on all 5 tasks after 2-18 repetitions; trainee post-test scores were significantly improved versus pre-test on all tasks (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.01). This proficiency-based curriculum demonstrated construct validity, was feasible as a remote teaching option, and resulted in significant skill acquisition. The remote format, including video-based performance assessment, facilitates effective at-home learning and may allow additional innovations such as video-based coaching for more advanced curricula.","Nagaraj, AbdelFattah, Scott, Farr","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsurg.2021.06.020","20210724","COVID-19.

"Suicidal Ideation and Attitudes Regarding Help Seeking in US Physicians Relative to the US Working Population","To evaluate the prevalence of suicidal ideation (SI) and attitudes regarding help seeking among US physicians relative to the general US working population. A secondary analysis of a cross-sectional survey of US physicians and a probability-based sample of the US working population was conducted between October 12, 2017, and March 15, 2018. Among 30,456 invited physicians, 5197 (17.1%) completed the primary survey. Suicidal ideation in the last year, attitudes regarding help seeking, symptoms of depression, and burnout were assessed by standardized questions. Among the 4833 physicians who responded regarding SI, 316 (6.5%) reported having suicidal thoughts in the last 12 months. Most physicians (3527 [72.9%]) reported that they would seek professional help if they had a serious emotional problem. Physicians with SI were less likely to report that they would seek help (203/316 [64.2%]) than physicians without SI (3318/4517 [73.5%]; P=.001). On multivariable analysis, symptoms of depression (odds ratio [OR], 4.42; 95% CI, 1.89 to 11.52), emotional exhaustion (OR, 1.07 each 1-point increase; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.11), and self-valuation (OR, 0.84 each 1-point increase; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.99) were associated with SI. Among individuals aged 29 to 65 years, physicians were more likely than workers in other fields to report SI (7.1% vs 4.3%; P&lt;.001), a finding that persisted on multivariable analysis. In this national study conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic, 1 in 15 US physicians had thoughts of taking their own life in the last year, which exceeded the prevalence of SI among US workers in other fields.","Shanafelt, Dyrbye, West, Sinsky, Tutty, Carlasare, Wang, Trockel","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2021.01.033","20210724","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16555,""
"Willingness to use a wearable device capable of detecting and reversing overdose among people who use opioids in Philadelphia","The incidence of opioid-related overdose deaths has been rising for 30Ã‚Â years and has been further exacerbated amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Naloxone can reverse opioid overdose, lower death rates, and enable a transition to medication for opioid use disorder. Though current formulations for community use of naloxone have been shown to be safe and effective public health interventions, they rely on bystander presence. We sought to understand the preferences and minimum necessary conditions for wearing a device capable of sensing and reversing opioid overdose among people who regularly use opioids. We conducted a combined cross-sectional survey and semi-structured interview at a respite center, shelter, and syringe exchange drop-in program in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, during the COVID-19 pandemic in August and September 2020. The primary aim was to explore the proportion of participants who would use a wearable device to detect and reverse overdose. Preferences regarding designs and functionalities were collected via a questionnaire with items having Likert-based response options and a semi-structured interview intended to elicit feedback on prototype designs. Independent variables included demographics, opioid use habits, and previous experience with overdose. A total of 97 adults with an opioid use history of at least 3Ã‚Â months were interviewed. A majority of survey participants (76%) reported a willingness to use a device capable of detecting an overdose and automatically administering a reversal agent upon initial survey. When reflecting on the prototype, most respondents (75.5%) reported that they would wear the device always or most of the time. Respondents indicated discreetness and comfort as important factors that increased their chance of uptake. Respondents suggested that people experiencing homelessness and those with low tolerance for opioids would be in greatest need of the device. The majority of people sampled with a history of opioid use in an urban setting were interested in having access to a device capable of detecting and reversing an opioid overdose. Participants emphasized privacy and comfort as the most important factors influencing their willingness to use such a device.

"ENgage YOung people earlY (ENYOY): a mixed-method study design for a digital transdiagnostic clinical - and peer- moderated treatment platform for youth with beginning mental health complaints in the Netherlands","The onset of mental disorders typically occurs between the ages of 12 and 25, and the burden of mental health problems is the most consequential for this group. Indicated prevention interventions to target individuals with subclinical symptoms to prevent the transition to clinical levels of disorders, even leading to suicide, have shown to be effective. However, the threshold to seek help appears to be high. Digital interventions could offer a solution, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. This implementation study will investigate the digital indicated prevention intervention ENgage YOung people Early (ENYOY), the Dutch version of the original Moderated Online Social Therapy Platform (MOST+) from Australia. In addition, the relationship between stress biomarkers, symptoms and outcome measures of youth using the platform will be investigated in this study. The MOST+ platform will be adapted, translated and developed for the situation in the Netherlands in collaboration with a Youth Panel. A prospective cohort of 125 young people (16-25Ã¢â‚¬â€°years) with beginning mental health complaints will be on the platform and followed for a year, of which 10 participants will have an additional smart watch and 10 participants will be asked to provide feedback about the platform. Data will be collected at baseline and after 3, 6 and 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°months. Outcome measures are Psychological Distress assessed with the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), Social and occupational functioning (measures by the SOFAS), positive mental health indicators measured by the Positive Health Instrument, stress biomarkers with a smart-watch, website journeys of visitors, and feedback of youth about the platform. It will be a mixed-method study design, containing qualitative and quantitative measures. This trial will specifically address young people with emerging mental health complaints, and offers a new approach for treatment in the Netherlands. Considering the waiting lists in (child and adolescent)-psychiatry and the increase in suicides among youth, early low-threshold and non-stigmatizing help to support young people with emerging psychiatric symptoms is of crucial importance.

"Prenatal and Postnatal Anxiety and Depression in Mothers during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The aim of this study was to assess the changes in the occurrence of prenatal and postnatal anxiety and depression symptoms, and to assess what factors significantly affect the appearance of symptoms of depression and anxiety in young mothers. The study group consisted of 130 women after childbirth. Due to the ongoing restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the survey was prepared online. The questionnaire was fully anonymous, and it contained the authors' own questions and two standardized questionnaires: the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and Generalized Anxiety Disorders GAD-7. The conducted analysis clearly indicated that the level of postpartum depression, in as many as 52 of the mothers, had increased significantly compared to the time before delivery, when symptoms of depression were shown by 22 women (<i>p</i> = 0.009). However, there was no statistically significant change between prenatal and postnatal anxiety. There are many factors associated with postnatal depression.

"Mental Health and Psychological Wellbeing during the COVID-19 Lockdown: A Longitudinal Study in the Balearic Islands (Spain)","Confining the entire population to a lockdown after the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 was an unprecedented measure designed to protect the health of those living in Spain. The objective of the present study is to assess the evolution of mental health and psychological wellbeing during lockdown. To do this, we carried out a longitudinal study, via an online survey over the eight weeks of lockdown (weekly assessments). Sociodemographic variables were recorded, along with data related to COVID-19, psychological wellbeing (anxiety, depression, psychotropic drugs, consultations made to improve mood or anxiety), life satisfaction, and self-perceived health. A total of 681 individuals participated in the study, 76.8% were women; the mean age was 43 years old (SD = 12.7). Initially, high scores were reported for anxiety, depression, and the number of consultations to improve mood, but these decreased significantly over the study period. The reverse seems to be true for life satisfaction, perceived good health, and intake of psychotropic drugs. We also identified groups whose psychological wellbeing was more susceptible to the effects of lockdown. Women, those worried about their jobs after the pandemic, and those afraid of being infected were the most affected individuals. More generally, after the initial negative effect on psychological wellbeing, various indicators improved over the lockdown period.","Ripoll, Contreras-Martos, Esteva, Soler, Serrano-Ripoll","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10143191","20210726","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; fear; life satisfaction; lockdown; mental health; prospective; psychological wellbeing; psychotropic drugs; self-perceived health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16559,""
"COVID-19 Pandemic-Related Anxiety in Pregnant Women","The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak influenced general and mental health worldwide. The objective of this study was to assess the anxiety level during the COVID-19 pandemic among pregnant women and compare it between COVID-infected and non-infected groups. We prospectively assessed the daily routine and anxiety level using a bespoke questionnaire and GAD-7 scale validated for pregnant women. With logistic regression, we established possible risk factors of generalized anxiety disorder spectrum and main causes of concern. The dataset included 439 responders of our survey. Of which, 21% had COVID-19 infection during pregnancy; 38% were screened for possible generalized anxiety disorder and the proportion was higher in women who suffered from COVID-19 (48% vs. 35%, <i>p</i> = 0.03). Pre-pregnancy anxiety or depression diagnosis and intentional social contact avoidance increased the risk of anxiety (aOR 3.4 and 3.2). Fetal wellbeing was the main concern for 66% of the responders. The COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions substantially altered daily lives of pregnant women, exaggerating the prevalence of anxiety compared with the pre-COVID-19 studies (38% vs. 15%). COVID-19 infection during pregnancy was associated with increased levels of generalized anxiety scores. Patient-tailored psychological support should be a mainstay of comprehensive antenatal medical care in order to avoid anxiety- and stress-related complications.","Nowacka, Kozlowski, Januszewski, Sierdzinski, Jakimiuk, Issat","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18147221","20210726","COVID-19; anxiety; coronavirus; maternal medicine; mental health; pandemic; pregnancy; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16560,""
"Demographics, Socioeconomic Status, Social Distancing, Psychosocial Factors and Psychological Well-Being among Undergraduate Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic impacted on academic routine because of the social distancing measures. This study examined the relationships of sociodemographic characteristics, social distancing aspects and psychosocial factors on psychosocial well-being among undergraduate students during the social distancing period due to COVID-19. A web-based survey was conducted of undergraduate students at a public university in Brazil (<i>n</i> = 620). Demographics, socioeconomic status (SES), social distancing factors, negative affectivity (DASS-21), sense of coherence (SOC-13), social support and psychosocial well-being (GHQ-12) were measured. The direct and indirect links between was variables was tested using structural equation modelling. The estimated model showed that greater social support, higher sense of coherence and lower negative affectivity were directly associated with better psychological well-being. Female gender, higher SES, not working during the social distancing period and availability of online modules were indirectly associated with psychological well-being through psychosocial factors. Working during the social distancing period and availability of online modules mediated the link of age, gender, SES with psychological well-being. Our findings suggest the need to provide psychological support, online teaching and financial aid to undergraduate students during the social distancing period due to COVID-19 pandemic to improve their psychological well-being.","Silva, Guedes, Santos-Pinto, Miranda, Ferreira, Vettore","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18147215","20210726","COVID-19; mental health; psychological well-being; undergraduate students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16561,""
"The combined effect of Covid-19 and neighbourhood deprivation on two dimensions of subjective well-being: Empirical evidence from England","The Covid-19 pandemic is hitting societies hard, and people living in disadvantaged circumstances are among the most affected. We investigate the combined effects of the Covid-19 crisis and living in a deprived neighbourhood on two dimensions of subjective well-being: hedonic (i.e. mental health) and evaluative (i.e. life satisfaction) subjective well-being. We use longitudinal data from the Understanding Society UK panel. We combine data gathered in the main survey between 2015 and 2019 with very recent data from the Covid-19 online survey between April and July 2020. Leveraging a sample of nearly 9,600 English individuals, we first run a set of cross-sectional OLS regressions to analyse changes over time in the relationship between neighbourhood deprivation and subjective well-being. Then, as our main model of interest, we use a fixed effect difference-in-differences model to provide more robust evidence. Since the beginning of the crisis, both levels of hedonic and evaluative well-being have decreased as a result of the pandemic and lockdown. However, for those living in more deprived neighbourhoods the level of hedonic well-being decreased more than for those living in better areas. We found no such difference for evaluative well-being. Our results highlight the importance of reducing neighbourhood inequalities as the spatial clustering of disadvantages has increased by the pandemic.","Bonomi Bezzo, Silva, van Ham","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255156","20210727","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16562,""
"Facing the COVID-19 pandemic inside maternities in Brazil: A mixed-method study within the REBRACO initiative","COVID-19 pandemic posed major challenges in obstetric health care services. Preparedness, development, and implementation of new protocols were part of the needed response. This study aims to describe the strategies implemented and the perspectives of health managers on the challenges to face the pandemic in 16 different maternity hospitals that comprise a multicenter study in Brazil, called REBRACO (Brazilian network of COVID-19 during pregnancy). Mixed-method study, with quantitative and qualitative approaches. Quantitative data on the infrastructure of the units, maternal and perinatal health indicators, modifications on staff and human resources, from January to July/2020. Also, information on total number of cases, and availability for COVID-19 testing. A qualitative study by purposeful and saturation sampling was undertaken with healthcare managers, to understand perspectives on local challenges in facing the pandemic. Most maternities early implemented their contingency plan. REBRACO centers reported 338 confirmed COVID-19 cases among pregnant and post-partum women up to July 2020. There were 29 maternal deaths and 15 (51.8%) attributed to COVID-19. All maternities performed relocation of beds designated to labor ward, most (75%) acquired mechanical ventilators, only the minority (25%) installed new negative air pressure rooms. Considering human resources, around 40% hired extra health professionals and increased weekly workload and the majority (68.7%) also suspended annual leaves. Only one center implemented universal screening for childbirth and 6 (37.5%) implemented COVID-19 testing for all suspected cases, while around 60% of the centers only tested moderate/severe cases with hospital admission. Qualitative results showed that main challenges experienced were related to the fear of the virus, concerns about reliability of evidence and lack of resources, with a clear need for mental health support among health professionals. Study findings suggest that maternities of the REBRACO initiative underwent major changes in facing the pandemic, with limitations on testing, difficulties in infrastructure and human resources. Leadership, continuous training, implementation of evidence-based protocols and collaborative initiatives are key to transpose the fear of the virus and ascertain adequate healthcare inside maternities, especially in low and middle-income settings. Policy makers need to address the specificities in considering reproductive health and childbirth during the COVID-19 pandemic and prioritize research and timely testing availability.","Costa, Souza, Pacagnella, Bento, Ribeiro-do-Valle, Luz, Lajos, Nobrega, Griggio, Charles, Tedesco, Fernandes, Martins-Costa, Peret, Feitosa, Mattar, Cunha Filho, Vetorazzi, Haddad, Andreucci, Guida, Correa Junior, Dias, Oliveira, Melo Junior, Menezes, Luz, Cecatti","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254977","20210727","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16563,""
"Assessing social support impact on depression, anxiety, and stress among undergraduate students in Shaanxi province during the COVID-19 pandemic of China","Following the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in China, undergraduate students may experience psychological changes. During emergency circumstances, social support is an important factor influencing the mental health condition among undergraduate students in Shaanxi province. This study aims to find the factors associated with mental health symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress among undergraduate students in Shaanxi province during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. A cross-sectional study was conducted from Feb 23 to Mar 7, 2020. A total of 1278 undergraduate students from the universities located in Shaanxi province participated in this study. The mental health symptoms were measured by 12-item Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS) and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) instruments. This survey showed that females receive more social support compared to males (t = -5.046, P&lt;0.001); males have higher-level depression symptoms (t = 5.624, P&lt;0.001); males have higher-level anxiety symptoms (t = 6.332, P&lt;0.001), males have higher-level stress symptoms (t = 5.58, P&lt;0.001). This study also found participants who have low social support was negatively correlated with mental health symptoms. In Conclusion, Males and low social support were associated with having the higher level of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms among undergraduate students in Shaanxi province during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Therefore, it is suggested that people should supply more social support for undergraduate students in Shaanxi province during COVID-19 pandemic.","Guo, Zhang, Bai, Minhat, Nazan, Feng, Li, Luo, Zhang, Feng, Li, Si, Qiao, Ouyang, Saliluddin","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253891","20210727","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16564,""
"Older People's Personal Strengths During the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic","Although several biopsychosocial variables could play an important role as risk and protective factors of mental health, COVID-19 outbreak studies among older people have seldom focused on protective factors. The purpose of this study was to analyze how older adults' personal strengths predict their well-being and emotional distress. 783 Spanish people aged 60 and over completed a survey that included sociodemographic characteristics, perceived health, direct or indirect infection by COVID-19, resilience, gratitude, experiential avoidance, family functioning, emotional distress and well-being. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was performed. SEM invariance was also used to analyze whether there were differences between older people affected by COVID-19 and those not affected. The best model supports the mediation effect of resilience, gratitude and experiential avoidance on older people's well-being and emotional distress. Whether participants or relatives had been infected by the virus or not did not affect the results. Variables used as criteria in older adults are related to well-being and emotional distress, but only indirectly and mediated by resilience, gratitude and experiential avoidance. This confirms the importance of considering psychological strengths in older people's well-being. Interventions focused on these personal resources should be considered.","PÃƒÂ©rez-Rojo, LÃƒÂ³pez, Noriega, MartÃƒÂ­nez-Huertas, Velasco, Carretero, LÃƒÂ³pez-Frutos, Galarraga, Pillemer","https://doi.org/10.7334/psicothema2020.453","20210726","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16565,""

"Perceptions of Diseases of Despair by Members of Rural and Urban High-Prevalence Communities: A Qualitative Study","Diseases of despair (ie, mortality or morbidity from suicidality, drug abuse, and alcoholism) were first characterized as increasing in rural White working-class populations in midlife with low educational attainment and associated with long-term economic decline. Excess mortality now appears to be associated with working-class citizens across demographic and geographic boundaries, but no known qualitative studies have engaged residents of rural and urban locales with high prevalence of diseases of despair to learn their perspectives. To explore perceptions about despair-related illness and potential intervention strategies among diverse community members residing in discrete rural and urban hotspots. In this qualitative study, high-prevalence hotspots for diseases of despair were identified from health insurance claims data in Central Pennsylvania. Four focus groups were conducted with 60 community members in organizations and coalitions from 3 census block group hotspot clusters in the health system between September 2019 and January 2020. Focus groups explored awareness and beliefs about causation and potential intervention strategies. A descriptive phenomenological approach was applied to thematic analysis, and a preliminary conceptual model was constructed to describe how various factors may be associated with perpetuating despair and with public health. In total, 60 adult community members participated in 4 focus groups (44 women, 16 men; 40 White non-Hispanic, 17 Black, and 3 Hispanic/Latino members). Three focus groups with 43 members were held in rural areas with high prevalence of diseases of despair, and 1 focus group with 17 members in a high-prevalence urban area. Four themes emerged with respect to awareness and believed causation of despair-related illness, and participants identified common associated factors, including financial distress, lack of critical infrastructure and social services, deteriorating sense of community, and family fragmentation. Intervention strategies focused around 2 themes: (1) building resilience to despair through better community and organizational coordination and peer support at the local level and (2) encouraging broader state investments in social services and infrastructure to mitigate despair-related illness. In this qualitative study, rural and urban community members identified common factors associated with diseases of despair, highlighting the association between long-term political and economic decline and public health and a need for both community- and state-level solutions to address despair. Health care systems participating in addressing community health needs may improve processes to screen for despair (eg, social history taking) and codesign primary, secondary, and tertiary interventions aimed at addressing factors associated with distress. Such actions have taken on greater urgency with the COVID-19 pandemic.","George, Snyder, Van Scoy, Brignone, Sinoway, Sauder, Murray, Gladden, Ramedani, Ernharth, Gupta, Saran, Kraschnewski","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.18134","20210726","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16567,""
"Methadone Access for Opioid Use Disorder During the COVID-19 Pandemic Within the United States and Canada","Methadone access may be uniquely vulnerable to disruption during COVID-19, and even short delays in access are associated with decreased medication initiation and increased illicit opioid use and overdose death. Relative to Canada, US methadone provision is more restricted and limited to specialized opioid treatment programs. To compare timely access to methadone initiation in the US and Canada during COVID-19. This cross-sectional study was conducted from May to June 2020. Participating clinics provided methadone for opioid use disorder in 14 US states and territories and 3 Canadian provinces with the highest opioid overdose death rates. Statistical analysis was performed from July 2020 to January 2021. Nation and type of health insurance (US Medicaid and US self-pay vs Canadian provincial). Proportion of clinics accepting new patients and days to first appointment. Among 268 of 298 US clinics contacted as a patient with Medicaid (90%), 271 of 301 US clinics contacted as a self-pay patient (90%), and 237 of 288 Canadian clinics contacted as a patient with provincial insurance (82%), new patients were accepted for methadone at 231 clinics (86%) during US Medicaid contacts, 230 clinics (85%) during US self-pay contacts, and at 210 clinics (89%) during Canadian contacts. Among clinics not accepting new patients, at least 44% of 27 clinics reported that the COVID-19 pandemic was the reason. The mean wait for first appointment was greater among US Medicaid contacts (3.5 days [95% CI, 2.9-4.2 days]) and US self-pay contacts (4.1 days [95% CI, 3.4-4.8 days]) than Canadian contacts (1.9 days [95% CI, 1.7-2.1 days]) (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). Open-access model (walk-in hours for new patients without an appointment) utilization was reported by 57 Medicaid (30%), 57 self-pay (30%), and 115 Canadian (59%) contacts offering an appointment. In this cross-sectional study of 2 nations, more than 1 in 10 methadone clinics were not accepting new patients. Canadian clinics offered more timely methadone access than US opioid treatment programs. These results suggest that the methadone access shortage was exacerbated by COVID-19 and that changes to the US opioid treatment program model are needed to improve the timeliness of access. Increased open-access model adoption may increase timely access.","Joudrey, Adams, Bach, Van Buren, Chaiton, Ehrenfeld, Guerra, Gleeson, Kimmel, Medley, Mekideche, Paquet, Sung, Wang, You Kheang, Zhang, Wang, Edelman","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.18223","20210726","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16568,""

"Non-communicable Disease Surveillance in Malaysia: An Overview of Existing Systems and Priorities Going Forward","In 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) set a comprehensive set of nine global voluntary targets, including the landmark ""25 by 25"" mortality reduction target, and 25 indicators. WHO has also highlighted the importance of Non-Communicable Disease (NCD) surveillance as a key action by Member States in addressing NCDs. This study aimed to examine the current national NCD surveillance tools, activities and performance in Malaysia based on the WHO Global Monitoring Framework for NCDs and to highlight gaps and priorities moving forward. A desk review was conducted from August to October in 2020, to examine the current national NCD surveillance activities in Malaysia from multiple sources. Policy and program documents relating to NCD surveillance in Malaysia from 2010 to 2020 were identified and analyzed. The findings of this review are presented according to the three major themes of the Global Monitoring Framework: monitoring of exposure/risk factor, monitoring of outcomes and health system capacity/response. Currently, there is a robust monitoring system for NCD Surveillance in Malaysia for indicators that are monitored by the WHO NCD Global Monitoring Framework, particularly for outcome and exposure monitoring. However, Malaysia still lacks data for the surveillance of the health system indicators of the framework. Although Malaysia has an NCD surveillance in place that is adequate for the WHO NCD Global Monitoring Framework, there are areas that require strengthening. The country must also look beyond these set of indicators in view of the increasing burden and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"General Perception of Doctor-Patient Relationship From Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic in China: A Cross-Sectional Study","The doctor-patient relationship (DPR) is essential in the process of medical consultations and treatments. Poor DPR may lead to poor medical outcomes, medical violence against doctors, and a negative perception of the healthcare system. Little is known about how DPR is affected during this novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This cross-sectional study aimed to explore the DPR during the COVID-19 pandemic. There were 1,903 participants in China (95% response rate) who were recruited during the pandemic online <i>via</i> convenience and snowball sampling. Several questionnaires were used to evaluate participants' attitudes toward DPR, including the Patient-Doctor Relationship Questionnaire (PDRQ-9), Chinese Wake Forest Physician Trust Scale (C-WFPTS), a survey on medical violence against doctors, factors that affect and improve DPR, and general trust in medical services. Results revealed that DPR improved, and doctor-patient trust increased compared to participants' retrospective attitude before the pandemic. In addition, patients' violence against doctors decreased during the pandemic. Better doctor-patient trust and lower violence toward doctors are related to better DPR. Furthermore, we found that the main factors that could improve DPR include communication between doctors and patients, medical technology and services, and medical knowledge for patients. This study helped to better understand DPR in China, which may contribute to future health policies and medical practices in order to improve DPR and doctor-patient trust.","Zhou, Chen, Liao, Wu, Ma, Wang, Wang, Li, Wang, Wang, Liu, Liu, Yang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.646486","20210727","COVID-19; communication; doctor-patient relationship; medical violence; trust","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16571,""
"Coronavirus disease and the cardiovascular system: a narrative review of the mechanisms of injury and management implications","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, is now a pandemic, having already spread to 188 countries, with more than 28,280,000 infections worldwide. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the responsible infectious agent, and similar to other human coronaviruses, uses membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (membrane-bound ACE2) for entry into the host cells. COVID-19 has important cardiovascular implications, especially for patients with pre-existing cardiovascular co-morbidities, potentially mediated through several mechanisms, including direct myocardial injury, worsening of those pre-existing cardiovascular co-morbidities, and adverse cardiovascular effects of potential therapies for COVID-19. The disease is causing a significant burden on health systems worldwide. Elective surgeries and procedures were postponed for a considerable period of time, and many patients with known cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors presented late to hospitals, for fear of contracting COVID-19, with serious adverse consequences. Significant negative impact on a population level is highlighted by prolonged isolation, decreased exercise and physical activity, and higher levels of depression and anxiety, all predisposing to elevated cardiovascular risk. This article provides a timely overview of COVID-19 and its impact on the cardiovascular system, focusing on the pathogenesis, potential adverse cardiovascular events, the potential treatment options, protection for health care providers and patients, and what the cardiovascular community could do to mitigate the impact of COVID-19.","Brizneda, Bansal, Jain, Kapadia, Svensson, Menon, Cremer, Reed, Rampersad, Grimm, Griffin, Xu","https://doi.org/10.21037/cdt-20-779","20210724","COVID-19; Coronavirus disease; cardiovascular disease (CVD); cardiovascular system; membrane-bound ACE2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16572,""
"Increases in Anxiety and Depression During COVID-19: A Large Longitudinal Study From China","Although accumulating evidence suggests the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with costs in mental health, the development of students' mental health, including the change from their previous levels of depression and anxiety and the factors associated with this change, has not been well-studied. The present study investigates changes in students' anxiety and depression from before the pandemic to during the lockdown and identifies factors that are associated with these changes. 14,769 university students participated in a longitudinal study with two time points with a 6-month interval. Students completed the Anxiety and Depression subscales of the Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) before the COVID-19 outbreak (October 2020, Time 1), and the Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) during the pandemic (April 2020, Time 2). The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms were 1.44 and 1.46% at Time 1, and 4.06 and 22.09% at Time 2, respectively, showing a 181.94% increase in anxiety and a 1413.01% increase in depression. Furthermore, the increases in anxiety and depression from pre-pandemic levels were associated with students' gender and the severity of the pandemic in the province where they resided. This study contributes to the gap in knowledge regarding changes in students' mental health in response to the pandemic and the role of local factors in these changes. Implications for gender and the Typhoon Eye effect are discussed.","Wu, Zhang, Parks-Stamm, Hu, Ji, Cui","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.706601","20210724","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; longitudinal study; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16573,""
"Exploring the Relationship Between Mental Well-Being, Exercise Routines, and the Intake of Image and Performance Enhancing Drugs During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: A Comparison Across Sport Disciplines","<b>Introduction:</b> Physical distancing under the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had a significant impact on lifestyles, including exercise routines. In this study, we examined the relationship between mental health and addictive behaviors, such as excessive exercise and the use of image and performance enhancing drugs (IPEDs) across 12 sport disciplines. <b>Materials and methods:</b> A large cross-sectional sample of the adult population (<i>N</i> = 2,295) was surveyed. The mean age was 33.09 (<i>SD</i> = 11.40). The number of male participants was 668 (30.0%). The use of IPEDs was assessed in conjunction with psychometric measures such as the Exercise Addiction Inventory (EAI) and the Appearance Anxiety Inventory (AAI). The participants were grouped into activity group (AG) and non-activity group (NAG) according to the presence or absence of their exercise habits. The results were compared between these groups, as well as across sport disciplines, while taking into account the relationship between different psychological measures and IPEDs consumption. <b>Results:</b> The frequency of IPEDs use was higher among AG (34.6%) than NAG (14.6%), although AG participants reported less history of addictions (7.1%) than NAG (11.8%). The logistic regression analysis revealed that scores equal to or above cutoff points, in both the EAI and AAI, predicted the IPEDs use. Regarding the differences across the various sport disciplines, those who were involved in practicing Weight Lifting and Cross Fit were found to be more at risk of excessive exercising and more inclined to use a wide range of IPEDs. <b>Conclusions:</b> Although exercise could help to increase well-being and prevent addictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, our results show that those in the AG are particularly vulnerable to excessive IPEDs use. Sport disciplines associated with higher EAI and AAI scores have also shown a higher tendency to excessive IPEDs use. Furthermore, the factor of having above the cutoff scores in EAI or AAI in each sport could indicate larger IPEDs consumption regardless of the discipline. In light of the current findings, it is necessary to better define the ""non-excessive"" levels of exercise in various sport disciplines and an adequate intake of IPEDs to ensure the safety and well-being of people during a pandemic.","Shibata, Burkauskas, Dores, Kobayashi, Yoshimura, Simonato, De Luca, Cicconcelli, Giorgetti, Carvalho, Barbosa, Monteiro, Murai, GÃƒÂ³mez-MartÃƒÂ­nez, Demetrovics, ÃƒÂbel, Szabo, Ventola, Arroyo-AnllÃƒÂ³, Santos-Labrador, Griskova-Bulanova, Pranckeviciene, Bersani, Fujiwara, Corazza","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.689058","20210724","COVID-19; IPEDS; enhancement; excessive exercise; supplement","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16574,""
"Online Mental Health Assessments of COVID-19 Patients in South Korea","Experiences of infectious diseases cause stressful and traumatic life events, hence, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients could suffer from various mental health problems requiring psychological support services. This study investigates the severity of mental health problems among confirmed COVID-19 patients. From March to November 2020, we collected the data from 118 COVID-19 patients who voluntarily participated in the National Center for Disaster Trauma's online mental health assessment consisting of self-report scales like Primary Care of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder screen (PC-PTSD), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15), and P4 Suicidality Screener. For control, 116 other disaster-experienced and 386 non-COVID-19-experienced participants were recruited. The COVID-19 patients showed more severe symptoms including post-traumatic symptoms, depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms than control groups across all four screening scales (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Regarding high-risk, COVID-19 patients had an increased association with high-risk compared to the comparison groups (PC-PTSD: OR = 24.16, 95% CI = 13.52-43.16 <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001; PHQ-9: OR = 14.45, 95% CI = 8.29-25.19, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001; GAD-7: OR=20.71, 95% CI = 10.74-39.96, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001; PHQ-15: OR = 5.65, 95% CI = 3.44-9.25, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001; P4: OR = 14.67, 95% CI = 8.95-25.07, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). This study's results imply that there is a high-risk of overall mental health problems, especially stronger associations of post-traumatic stress symptoms, in COVID-19 patients. These findings help inform practitioners about the psychological responses to COVID-19 experiences and to prepare appropriate interventions and services for the incremental number of confirmed cases.","Lee, Lee, Hyun, Hong, Kim, Kim, Sim","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.685445","20210724","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; post-traumatic stress disorder; psychological trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16575,""
"COVID-19 Pandemic Stress-Induced Somatization in Transplant Waiting List Patients","<b>Background:</b> The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in widespread socioeconomic restrictions including quarantine, social distancing and self-isolation. This is the first study investigating the psychological impact of the pandemic on patients waiting for liver or kidney transplantation, a particularly vulnerable group. <b>Methods:</b> Twenty-seven patients on the transplantation waiting list and 43 healthy controls took part in an online survey including the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-2), the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Alcohol Use Identification Test (AUDIT-C), the 12-item Operationalized Psychodynamic Diagnosis Structure Questionnaire (OPD-SQS) and a questionnaire to determine cognitions and beliefs, attitude and fear related to COVID-19. <b>Results:</b> BSI-18 Somatization was increased in waiting list patients compared to controls. Correlation analyses indicated a relationship between Somatization and the fear of contracting the coronavirus in the patient group; however this association was weak. In patients and controls, other psychologicial symptoms (depression, anxiety) correlated highly with emotional distress due to social distancing. There were no differences between patients and controls in depression scores and sleep disturbances. Alcohol consumption and personality structure were not related to COVID-19 fears. <b>Conclusion:</b> In times of the first lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic, patients on the transplantation waiting list have high somatization symptoms associated with COVID-19 fears. As vulnerable group, they need psychological counseling to improve mental well-being during times of crisis.","Wagner-Skacel, Dalkner, Bengesser, Ratzenhofer, Fink, Kahn, Pilz, MÃƒÂ¶rkl, Lenger, Fazekas, Matzer, Butler, Reininghaus, MÃƒÂ¼ller, Kniepeiss","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.671383","20210724","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; depression; mental health; patient education; somatization; transplant waiting list","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16576,""
"Previous History of Migraine Is Associated With Fatigue, but Not Headache, as Long-Term Post-COVID Symptom After Severe Acute Respiratory SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Case-Control Study","To investigate the association of pre-existing migraine in patients hospitalised and who recovered from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection with the presence of post-coronavirus disease (COVID) symptoms. No study has investigated the role of migraine as a risk factor for development of post-COVID symptoms. A case-control study including individuals hospitalised during the first wave of the pandemic (from February 20 to May 31, 2020) was conducted. Patients with confirmed previous diagnosis of migraine were considered cases. Two age- and sex-matched individuals without a history of headache per case were also recruited as controls. Hospitalisation/clinical data were collected from hospital medical records. Patients were scheduled for a telephone interview. A list of post-COVID symptoms was systematically evaluated, but participants were invited to freely report any symptom. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were used to assess anxiety/depressive symptoms and sleep quality. Multivariable conditional logistic regression models were constructed. Overall, 57 patients with confirmed diagnosis of migraine and 144 non-migraine controls who had recovered from COVID-19 were assessed at 7.3 months (SD 0.6) after hospital discharge. The number of post-COVID symptoms in the migraine group was significantly greater (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.29-2.25, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) than in the non-migraine group. Fatigue was significantly more prevalent (OR 2.89, 95% CI 1.32-6.32, <i>P</i> = 0.008) in the migraine group. However, no between-groups difference in the prevalence of headache as a post-COVID symptom was detected. Patients with a history of migraine who recovered from COVID-19 exhibited more long-term fatigue as post-COVID sequelae than those without migraine. Some of the pathophysiological changes associated with migraine could predispose to the occurrence of post-COVID symptoms.","FernÃƒÂ¡ndez-de-Las-PeÃƒÂ±as, GÃƒÂ³mez-Mayordomo, GarcÃƒÂ­a-AzorÃƒÂ­n, Palacios-CeÃƒÂ±a, Florencio, Guerrero, HernÃƒÂ¡ndez-Barrera, Cuadrado","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2021.678472","20210724","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; fatigue; migraine; post-COVID; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-28","",16577,""
"A cultural experience to support mental health in people aged 16-24 during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to a typical museum website: study protocol of an online randomised controlled trial","Despite the high prevalence of common mental disorders in adolescents and young adults, and their association with poor health and socio-economic outcomes throughout the lifespan, many young people do not seek or receive help for such disorders. There is growing interest in the community sector in supporting mental health in young people; however, there is little by way of experimental research in this area. During the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown, we designed an online cultural experience to reduce anxiety and depression and support mental health in people aged 16-24. The O-ACE POP (Online Active Community Engagement Proof of Principle) study is a UK-based online randomised controlled trial of an online cultural experience named Ways of Being, involving human centred narratives and viewpoints, compared with a typical museum website (the Ashmolean Museum). We aim to compare efficacy on Ã‚Â affect, Ã‚Â symptoms ofÃ‚Â epression and anxiety, flourishing and loneliness as well as investigating potential mechanisms of action. The COVID-19 pandemic has provided a unique opportunity to design an innovative approach to supporting mental health in young adults. Findings derived from this study will allow us to evaluate the efficacy of this intervention and will inform the design of studies to further refine the resource and test it further.
