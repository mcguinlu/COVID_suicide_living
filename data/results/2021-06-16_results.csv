"NHS CHECK: protocol for a cohort study investigating the psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has had profound effects on the working lives of healthcare workers (HCWs), but the extent to which their well-being and mental health have been affected remains unclear. This longitudinal cohort study aims to recruit a cohort of NHS healthcare workers, conducting surveys at regular intervals to provide evidence about the prevalence of symptoms of mental disorders, investigate associated factors such as occupational contexts and support interventions available. Methods and Analysis All staff, students, and volunteers working in each of the 18 participating NHS Trusts in England will be sent emails inviting them to complete a survey at baseline, with email invitations for the follow up surveys being sent 6 and 12 months later. Opening in late April 2020, the baseline survey collects data on demographics, occupational and organisational factors, experiences of COVID-19, a number of validated measures of symptoms of poor mental health (e.g. depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder; PTSD), and measures of constructs such as resilience and moral injury. These regular surveys will be complemented by in-depth psychiatric interviews with a select sample of healthcare workers. Qualitative interviews will also be conducted, to gain deeper understanding of the support programmes used or desired by staff, and facilitators and barriers to accessing such programmes. Ethics and Dissemination Ethical approval for the study was granted by the Health Research Authority (reference: 20/HRA/210, IRAS: 282686) and local Trust Research and Development approval. Cohort data are being collected via Qualtrics online survey software, are pseudonymised and held on secure University servers. Participants are aware that they can withdraw from the study at any time, and there is signposting to support services for any participant who feels they need it. Only those consenting to be contacted about further research will be invited to participate in the psychiatric and qualitative interview components of the study. Findings will be rapidly shared with NHS Trusts to enable better support of staff during the pandemic, and via academic publications in due course.","Danielle Lamb; Neil Greenberg; Matthew Hotopf; Rosalind Raine; Reza Razavi; Rupa Bhundia; Hannah Scott; Ewan Carr; Rafael Gafoor; Ioannis Bakolis; Siobhan Hegarty; Emilia Souliou; Anne Marie Rafferty; Rebecca Rhead; Danny Weston; Sam Gnanapragasam; Sally Marlow; Simon Wessely; Sharon Stevelink","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.08.21258551","20210615","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-16","",14964,""
"Low-dose fluvoxamine modulates endocytic trafficking of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein: a potential mechanism for anti-COVID-19 protection by antidepressants","Commonly prescribed antidepressants may be associated with protection against severe COVID-19, with one drug (fluvoxamine) currently undergoing a Phase 3 clinical trial. The mechanism of their action, however, remains unknown. Here, I investigated the effect of fluvoxamine on membrane trafficking of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its cell host receptor ACE2 in HEK293T cells. A sub-therapeutic concentration (80 nM) of fluvoxamine rapidly upregulated fluid-phase endocytosis, resulting in enhanced accumulation of the spike-ACE2 complex in enlarged early endosomes. Diversion of endosomal trafficking provides a simple cell biological mechanism consistent with the protective effect of antidepressants against COVID-19, highlighting their therapeutic and prophylactic potential.","Not available","https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.15.448391","20210615","","bioRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-16","",14965,""
"Speaking Softly and Listening Hard: The Process of Involving Young Voices from a Culturally and Linguistically Diverse School in Child Health Research","The involvement of young people in the planning of research continues to be rare, particularly for young people from culturally and linguistically diverse communities. This paper describes our experience in establishing a Youth Research Advisory Group (YRAG) in South West Sydney (SWS), including barriers and successful strategies. One hundred and fifteen students between school Years 7 and 12 (ages 11-18) took part in at least one of five sessions between 2019 and 2021. In total, we carried out 26 YRAG sessions, with between five and 30 students in each. Sessions focused on mapping the health priorities of the participants and co-developing research project proposals related to their health priorities. Our work with students revealed that their main areas of concern were mental health and stress. This led to material changes in our research strategy, to include ""Mental Health"" as a new research stream and co-develop new mental health-related projects with the students. Important strategies that enabled our research included maintaining flexibility to work seamlessly with organisational and individual preferences, and ensuring our processes were directed by the schools and-most importantly-the students themselves. Strategies such as maintaining an informal context, responding rapidly to student preference, and regularly renegotiating access enabled us to engage with the students to deepen our understanding of their experiences.","Samir, Nora; Diaz, Antonio Mendoza; Hodgins, Michael; Matic, Simone; Bawden, Samira; Khoury, Jessica; Eapen, Valsamma; Lingam, Raghu","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18115808","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(11)2021 May 28.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(11)2021 May 28.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-16","",14966,""
"Sleep Valuation Is Associated with Components of Sleep Health and Daytime Functioning in a College Sample: A Survey Study","Sleep valuation, the worth individuals place on sleep, is an understudied construct in the field of sleep medicine. This study introduced a Sleep Valuation Item Bank and explored how sleep valuation is related to sleep health and daytime functioning within a sample of college students. The participants in this study were 247 (85% white, 83% female) undergraduate students who completed an online survey that included questions from a Sleep Valuation Item Bank and questions about sleep and daytime functioning. Correlation and regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between sleep valuation, aspects of sleep health and daytime functioning. Mediation analyses were conducted to determine whether the sleep health variables explained the associations between sleep valuation and daytime functioning. In correlation analyses, sleep valuation was negatively associated with sleepiness and sleep quality. It was also associated with daytime functioning, including general mental and physical health, depression, and anxiety. In the regression analyses, daytime impairments including poorer physical and mental health, anxiety, and depression were associated with higher sleep valuation. Poorer sleep health, including greater sleepiness and lower sleep quality, explained these associations and were associated with higher sleep valuation. Thus, while daytime impairments, such as anxiety and depression, are related to sleep valuation, this relationship may be due in part to the sleep disturbance that often co-occurs with these impairments.","Nielson, Spencer A; Taylor, Jordan; Simmons, Zach; Decker, Andrea N; Kay, Daniel B; Cribbet, Matthew R","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18115644","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(11)2021 May 25.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(11)2021 May 25.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-16","",14967,""
"Using a Tablet-Based App to Deliver Evidence-Based Practices for Suicidal Patients in the Emergency Department: Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial","BACKGROUND: Emergency departments (EDs) have the potential to provide evidence-based practices for suicide prevention to patients who are acutely suicidal. However, few EDs have adequate time and personnel resources to deliver recommended evidence-based assessment and interventions. To raise the clinical standard of care for patients who are suicidal and seeking psychiatric crisis services in the ED, we developed Jaspr Health, a tablet-based app for direct use by such patients, which enables the delivery of 4 evidence-based practices. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of Jaspr Health among suicidal adults in EDs. METHODS: Patients who were acutely suicidal and seeking psychiatric crisis services participated in an unblinded pilot randomized controlled trial while in the ED. Participants were randomly assigned to Jaspr Health (n=14) or care as usual (control; n=17) groups. Participants were assessed at baseline, and a 2-hour posttest using self-report measures and a semistructured interview were conducted. RESULTS: Conditions differed significantly at baseline with regard to age but not other demographic variables or baseline measures. On average, participants had been in the ED for 17 hours before enrolling in the study. Over their lifetime, 84% (26/31) of the sample had made a suicide attempt (mean 3.4, SD 6.4) and 61% (19/31) had engaged in nonsuicidal self-injurious behaviors, with an average rate of 8.8 times in the past 3 months. All established feasibility and acceptability criteria were met: no adverse events occurred, participants' app use was high, Jaspr Health app user satisfaction ratings were high, and all participants using Jaspr Health recommended its use for other suicidal ED patients. Comparisons between study conditions provide preliminary support for the effectiveness of the app: participants using Jaspr Health reported a statistically significant increase in receiving 4 evidence-based suicide prevention interventions and overall satisfaction ratings with their ED experience. In addition, significant decreases in distress and agitation, along with significant increases in learning to cope more effectively with current and future suicidal thoughts, were observed among participants using Jaspr Health compared with those receiving care as usual. CONCLUSIONS: Even with limited statistical power, the results showed that Jaspr Health is feasible, acceptable, and clinically effective for use by ED patients who are acutely suicidal and seeking ED-based psychiatric crisis services.

"COVID-19 Health Communication: Key Moderators of Message Framing","Objective  Earlier studies on message framing in the health sector have often focused on the effectiveness of framing in terms of behaviour change and decision making  Much less attention has been paid to the influence of message framing on the emotional responses of the recipients  This neglected aspect is extremely important particularly at times of crises because health care professionals wish to persuade the public to comply with their health advice without causing unnecessary anxiety  The current study examined the effect of message framing on the affect of Arabic-speaking Saudi nationals and residents of Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 lockdown  The effect of message outcome/severity and the recipients' age/levels of depression and anxiety was also investigated  Materials & methods  A total of 348 participants of three age groups completed the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck et al , 1996) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger et al , 1983), and rated the positivity of 48 COVID-19 health messages of different framing along a 6-point Likert scale  Results  The results showed a strong effect of message framing and severity and the recipients' age on the recipients' emotional responses  A limited influence for message outcome was also noted  Conclusions  It is recommended to use gain framed health messages to the public in order to avoid anxiety and maintain their positive affect  This is particularly recommended with younger adults whose affect gets negatively impacted by loss-framed messages quite easily  Loss-framed messages are recommended for in severe situations that have desirable outcomes","El-Dakhs, D.

"Promoting Mental Health of Nurses During the Coronavirus Pandemic: Will the Rapid Deployment of Nurses' Training Programs During COVID-19 Improve Self-Efficacy and Reduce Anxiety?","Introduction The nursing profession is extremely demanding and stressful  Nurses have been facing a tremendous amount of fear and anxiety during the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic  General self-efficacy is considered one of the most influential factors that can modify the impact of anxiety on nurses' mental health  In this study, we aimed to determine the predictors of self-efficacy and anxiety among nurses during the current COVID-19 pandemic  Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey involving 368 nurses working in a tertiary care hospital  The General Self-Efficacy scale (GSE) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7) were used for assessing self-efficacy and anxiety  The chi-square test followed by bivariate and multivariable regression analyses was performed to identify the determinants of self-efficacy and anxiety  Results The mean age of the nurses was 28 91 years (SD=3 68), with a mean working experience in the nursing field of 5 32 years (SD=2 48)  The mean self-efficacy and anxiety scores were 32 19 (SD=4 53) and 3 82 (SD=2 87), respectively  Mullivariable analysis showed that higher age (&gt;30 years, p= (X)3), professional education acquired through a diploma course instead of a graduate degree (p&lt; 001), and lack of training on handling COVID-19 patients (p= 003) were significant determinants of higher anxiety among nurses  Similarly, higher economic status (p= 001), sufficient COVID-19 training (p= 049), having family members tested positive for COVID-19 (p= 012), professional experience (&lt;= 5 years, p&lt;0 001), and quarantine period (s14 days, p= 002) were revealed to be independent determinants of a higher sense of self-efficacy among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic  Conclusion Receiving adequate levels of training on COVID-19 plays a vital role in improving self-efficacy and reducing anxiety among nurses during the ongoing pandemic  Managing anxiety, increasing self-efficacy, and ensuring more exposure to COVID-19-related training may improve nurses' mental health and prepare them for fighting pandemics in a much better and more efficient manner","Dharra, S.; Kumar, R.","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.15213","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Cureus; 13(5):11, 2021.; Publication details: Cureus; 13(5):11, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-16","",14973,""

"Psychological impact of Corona Virus Disease on genera population in Karachi","Introduction: In the present day, the most contagious and emerging respiratory disease is Corona Virus Disease 2019 (abbreviated to COVID-19)  It's a considerable issue to public health and was first detected in Wuhan  China in December 31, 2019  It is an emerging viral infection that is spreading across the globe  Symptoms of COVID-19 infection include general symptoms (fever and myalgia), respiratory symptoms (chills, cough, coryza, sore throat, breathing difficulty), and gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea)  In addition to physical impairment, COVID-19 also poses serious psychological impact and ultimately inducement of fear  There is a perceptible decline in an individual's mental health  Stress, anxiety and depression in the general population is apparent, though frequency and severity varies widely  This is mainly due to falsehoods circulating on social media that is media paranoia;the next vulnerable population is diagnosed patients and health care workers especially those physicians dealing with quarantined patients  Therefore, individuals should focus only on information from relevant sources and avoid spread of rumors  And since there's no treatment yet, one should take necessary precautionary measures along with quality sleep to keep oneself physically and mentally fit  Using cross-sectional analysis, this study aimed to evaluate the burden on the mental health of the general population of Pakistan during the COVID-19 pandemic  We were also interested in exploring risk factors which jeopardize psychological wellbeing  This might assist health care workers in safeguarding psychological health of the community during the COVID-19 pandemic  Objective: To determine the psychological impact of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the general population in the vicinity of Jinnah Post Graduate Medical Centre (JPMC)  Karachi  Methodology: A cross sectional study from October 2020 to January 2021 was conducted in the vicinity of Jinnah Post Graduate Medical Center in Karachi  The study was conducted on 139 visitors coming to the tertiary care hospital  The sampling technique was non probability purposive sampling  The data was collected by distributing a Structured Questionnaire  The questionnaire was given to the data collectors who distributed them to the visitors coming to the hospital;which in this case was JPMC  Written consent was taken from the participants and all ethical considerations and research protocols were observed  Data was collected in the form of pretested self-administered questionnaires  In order to standardize the questionnaires, a pilot study was conducted among research participants for the purpose of examining content validity  Data collected was analyzed using SPSS software version 20 0 and chi square test was used to determine factors associated with demographic profile and physical activity and dietary patterns  The statistical analysis was conducted with 95% confidence interval and p-value of &lt;0 05 was taken as threshold of statistical significance

"COVID-19, Loneliness and Technological Addiction: Longitudinal Data","The COVID-19 outbreak has been shown to have had a negative impact on mental health: furthermore, lockdown measures may have increased levels of loneliness and addiction  Preliminary studies indicated an increased frequency of gaming and social media use during this time and augmented levels of loneliness likely account for the increase in gaming and social media addiction during lockdown  We conducted a longitudinal study administering a battery of self-report questionnaires at the beginning of lockdown (Stage 1) and three days before the end of the lockdown (Stage 2)  Specifically, we measured loneliness feelings, frequency of gaming, and social media use, as well as both gaming and social media addiction  Data were analysed using Structural Equation Modeling  We found that loneliness levels longitudinally predicted both gaming and social media addiction, even when controlling for gaming and social media use at Stage 1  Increased feelings of loneliness, a well-known risk factor for gaming, along with social media addiction, may be a central variable heightening vulnerability to the onset or the maintenance of technological addiction during forced social isolation  Thus, future preventive interventions may want to target this issue","Rogier, G.; Zobel, S.

"Tracking NO2 emission from thermal power plants in North India using TROPOMI data","Exposure to air pollution is the largest environmental health risk in India, where the coal-fed thermal power plants (TPPs) are identified as the single largest air pollution source  The key to an efficient air quality management plan is strict compliance of the TPPs with emission norms  Yet, in-situ measurements are lacking, and the bottom-up emission inventory is not periodically updated in India  Here we adopt a top-down approach to estimate NO2 emission from nine TPPs within 300 km of the megacity Delhi using TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) data  We first estimate the NO2 lifetime for each TPP using an e-folding decay length along the wind direction and combine it with the NO2 columnar molecular density to estimate the NO2 emission  Our estimates show a correlation coefficient of 0 88, and a root mean square error of 4 15 kt/year with the ECLIPSE V5 bottom-up inventory  NO2 emission in these TPPs varied in the range of 8 0â€“30 6 kt/year with considerable seasonal variability  Using this data, we report a decrease in NO2 emission in the range 41%â€“290% during the COVID-19 lockdown period relative to the same period in the previous year  As India launched the National Clean Air Program to control air pollution, our method would be highly useful in tracking the emission compliance of the TPPs across the country  Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Saw, G.

"Emergency Department Visits for Nonfatal Opioid Overdose During the COVID-19 Pandemic Across Six US Health Care Systems","STUDY OBJECTIVE: People with opioid use disorder are vulnerable to disruptions in access to addiction treatment and social support during the COVID-19 pandemic  Our study objective was to understand changes in emergency department (ED) utilization following a nonfatal opioid overdose during COVID-19 compared to historical controls in 6 healthcare systems across the United States  METHODS: Opioid overdoses were retrospectively identified among adult visits to 25 EDs in Alabama, Colorado, Connecticut, North Carolina, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island from January 2018 to December 2020  Overdose visit counts and rates per 100 all-cause ED visits during the COVID-19 pandemic were compared with the levels predicted based on 2018 and 2019 visits using graphical analysis and an epidemiologic outbreak detection cumulative sum algorithm  RESULTS: Overdose visit counts increased by 10 5% (n=3486;95% confidence interval [CI] 4 18% to 17 0%) in 2020 compared with the counts in 2018 and 2019 (n=3020 and n=3285, respectively), despite a 14% decline in all-cause ED visits  Opioid overdose rates increased by 28 5% (95% CI 23 3% to 34 0%) from 0 25 per 100 ED visits in 2018 to 2019 to 0 32 per 100 ED visits in 2020  Although all 6 studied health care systems experienced overdose ED visit rates more than the 95th percentile prediction in 6 or more weeks of 2020 (compared with 2 6 weeks as expected by chance), 2 health care systems experienced sustained outbreaks during the COVID-19 pandemic  CONCLUSION: Despite decreases in ED visits for other medical emergencies, the numbers and rates of opioid overdose-related ED visits in 6 health care systems increased during 2020, suggesting a widespread increase in opioid-related complications during the COVID-19 pandemic  Expanded community- and hospital-based interventions are needed to support people with opioid use disorder and save lives during the COVID-19 pandemic","Soares, W.

"COVID-19 Social Distancing with Speech-Enabled Online Market Place for Farmers","Corona virus (COVID-19) has been rampant in most countries across the world, leading to a global crisis, and it has been so dangerous because of its ability to spread through any medium especially when there is physical contact of any object  So, this puts many people including the farmers and the customers at a bigger risk when they sell or buy products physically in a market place  This is a major challenge to an Indian farmer today to sell the product at the right price at the right time  Moreover, social distancing is the need of the hour, and hence, it is an even bigger challenge to monitor the market place to avoid physical contact  Also, many initiatives by governments, local bodies, and cooperative societies to eliminate the intermediaries are not turning effective due to the non-awareness, non-accessibility, ignorance, and ease of usage difficulties  Keeping the current pandemic situation in mind and social distancing being the need of the hour, this paper proposes a speech-enabled interactive voice response (SEIVR) wherein the farmer and the customer can sell and buy products online, i e , without any physical contact  In the current technology era, online market platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, and Olx are effectively cutting short these supply-chain overheads by establishing a direct connection between buyer and seller  Hence, the proposed implementation of a speech-enabled interactive voice response (SEIVR)-based online market place for farmers which even ensure social distancing will help to reduce the spread of the virus  The objective of this work is to build an agriculture-based mobile application with speech-enabled interactive voice response (SEIVR) based on speech recognition application with the Telugu language as a case study  Â© 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd","Mohan, D.; Sheela, K.

"Impact of Confinement in Patients under Long-Term Noninvasive Ventilation during the First Wave of the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic: A Remarkable Resilience","During the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Switzerland, confinement was imposed to limit transmission and protect vulnerable persons. These measures may have had a negative impact on perceived quality of care and symptoms in patients with chronic disorders. To determine whether patients under long-term home noninvasive ventilation (LTHNIV) for chronic respiratory failure (CRF) were negatively affected by the 56-day confinement (March-April 2020). A questionnaire-based survey exploring mood disturbances (HAD), symptom scores related to NIV (S3-NIV), and perception of health-care providers during confinement was sent to all patients under LTHNIV followed up by our center. Symptom scores and data obtained by ventilator software were compared between confinement and the 56 days prior to confinement. Of a total of 100 eligible patients, 66 were included (median age: 66 years [IQR: 53-74]): 35 (53%) with restrictive lung disorders, 20 (30%) with OHS or SRBD, and 11 (17%) with COPD or overlap syndrome. Prevalence of anxiety (n = 7; 11%) and depressive (n = 2; 3%) disorders was remarkably low. Symptom scores were slightly higher during confinement although this difference was not clinically relevant. Technical data regarding ventilation, including compliance, did not change. Patients complained of isolation and lack of social contact. They felt supported by their relatives and caregivers but complained of the lack of regular contact and information by health-care professionals. Patients under LTHNIV for CRF showed a remarkable resilience during the SARS-CoV-2 confinement period. Comments provided may be helpful for managing similar future health-care crises.","Cantero, Pasquina, Dao, Cedraschi, Adler, Plojoux, Janssens","https://doi.org/10.1159/000516327","20210615","Anxiety; COVID-19; Chronic respiratory failure; Confinement; Depression; Mood disturbances; Noninvasive ventilation; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-16","",15016,""

Effective HIV-self management is critically important in managing symptoms as well as viral suppression. We examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV self-management, social support, social isolation, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and stress in PLHIV. 85 PLHIV were recruited from social media sites and completed an online survey. Data were collected between April 23 and 30, 2020. Participants reported increases in social isolation, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and stress and decreases in social support and overall HIV self-management from pre- to during the pandemic. Additionally, the Social Support domain and Chronic Nature of HIV domain of the HIV Self-Management Scale were also decreased from pre- to during the pandemic. The ability for PLHIV to maintain HIV self-management during this time is essential and HIV care providers should have plans in place to provide support.","Wion, Miller","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10461-021-03335-4","20210615","Affective symptoms; COVID-19; HIV/AIDS; Self-management; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-16","",15018,""
"The effect of remote peer support on stigma in patients after breast cancer surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis","Patients after breast cancer surgery have a high sense of stigma due to the formation of surgical scars, loss of breast shape or other reasons, leading to anxiety, depression, and other adverse mental health problems, thus reducing their quality of life. Remote peer support intervention based on telephone, internet or email is low-cost and easy to spread, and protects patients' privacy, solves the barriers to access that many patients face when attending face-to-face programs. Therefore, remote peer support may be an effective way to reduce stigma and improve mental health in patients after breast cancer surgery during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Eight databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CNKI, PsycNET, MEDLINE, Psychology &amp; Behavioral Sciences Collection and Web of Science) will be used to select eligible studies that were published from inception to May, 2021. The eligible studies will be screened, extracted and then the methodological quality will be evaluated independently by 2 reviewers. Review manager software version 5.3 software and Stata version 14.0 software will be used for meta-analysis.

"Undergraduate medical education amid COVID-19: a qualitative analysis of enablers and barriers to acquiring competencies in distant learning using focus groups","Due to comprehensive social distancing measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic, medical faculties worldwide have made a virtue of necessity in resorting to online teaching. Medical faculties grapple with how to convey clinical competencies to students in this context. There is a need for research not only to map but also to explain the effect of these secondary measures on students' learning and mental wellbeing. During a period of ongoing comprehensive social distancing measures in Germany, we translated a competency-based curriculum including obstetrics, paediatrics, and human genetics to an e-learning course based on online patient and teacher encounters. In our qualitative study on students' and teachers' views, we identify potential enablers and drivers as well as barriers and challenges to undergraduate medical education under lockdown. In summer 2020, we conducted six focus group interviews to investigate medical students' and teachers' perspectives, experiences and attitudes. All focus groups were videotaped, transcribed verbatim and coded. To guide our deductive and inductive analysis, we applied the theoretical framework of Regmi and Jones. Content analysis was performed in a multi-perspective group. We identified five major themes contributing to a successful use of clinical competency-based e-learning under lockdown: Communication (with teachers, students, and patients), Mental wellbeing, Structure and self-organization, Technical issues, and Learning and commitment. We discuss enablers and potential barriers within all themes and their overlap and link them in an explanatory model. In our setting, students and teachers find e-learning holds strong potential and especially in times of COVID-19 it is greatly appreciated. We broaden the understanding of the impact of distant learning on acquiring competencies, on attitudes, and on mental wellbeing. Our model may serve for a thoughtful, necessary transition to future e-learning and hybrid programs for a competency-based medical education with ongoing social distancing measures.","Reinhart, Malzkorn, DÃƒÂ¶ing, Beyer, JÃƒÂ¼nger, Bosse","https://doi.org/10.1080/10872981.2021.1940765","20210615","COVID-19 pandemic; clinical competence; e-learning; mental health; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-16","",15020,""
"Exploring the Changes of Suicide Probability During COVID-19 Among Chinese Weibo Users","<b/><i>Background:</i> Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) threatens people's physical and mental health, globally, and it may even trigger suicide ideation and suicidal behavior. <i>Aims:</i> We aimed to examine the impact of COVID-19 on suicide risk by sampling Chinese Weibo users and analyzing their social media messages. <i>Method:</i> We predicted the probability of suicide (including hopelessness, suicidal ideation, negative self-evaluation, and hostility) of Weibo users in order to assess the changes in suicide probability at different times. Repeated-measures ANOVA was performed to examine the differences in suicide probability in different regions during different periods. <i>Results:</i> There was no significant difference in suicide probability between profoundly infected areas (PIAs) and less infected areas (LIAs) before the outbreak of COVID-19. LIAs had an increase in hopelessness during the COVID-19 growth period, while hopelessness and hostility in PIA increased during the COVID-19 decline period, indicating potential suicide probability. <i>Limitations:</i> Results should be interpreted with caution, and cross-cultural research may be considered in the future. <i>Conclusion:</i> COVID-19 has a dynamic impact on suicide probability.

"Short-Term Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Suicidal Ideation","<b/><i>Background:</i> Few studies have examined the effect of pandemics on suicide-related outcomes. <i>Aims:</i> We examined whether suicidal ideation levels among the general population changed owing to the COVID-19 pandemic by tracking individuals between January and April 2020. <i>Method:</i> We used a prospective observational longitudinal design (<i>n</i> = 6,683) and stratified sampling to conduct online surveys of the general adult population in Japan before (baseline) and during the pandemic (follow-up). <i>Results:</i> Suicidal ideation levels were significantly lower during than before the pandemic; however, the effect size was very small. Participants who were younger, with unstable employment, without children, with low income, and receiving psychiatric care were more likely to have higher suicidal ideation levels during the pandemic. <i>Limitations:</i> Because this was an Internet survey and subject to selection bias, the sample was not necessarily representative of the Japanese population. At the time of the survey, COVID-19 cases and deaths in Japan were relatively lower than in other developed countries. The dropout rate may have affected the results. <i>Conclusion:</i> Although the short-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicidal ideation is limited, relatively young and economically vulnerable individuals are more likely to show exacerbated suicidal ideation during the pandemic.","Sueki, Ueda","https://doi.org/10.1027/0227-5910/a000797","20210615","COVID-19; mental health; novel coronavirus; public health; suicidal behaviors; suicide prevention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-16","",15022,""
"Mental health of children with neurodevelopmental disorders during COVID-19: A brief report of family experiences from a low and middle income country","COVID-19 has grossly impacted lives of people across the globe. In particular, children have also been affected due to closure of schools, therapy, and day care centers. Families have been challenged with new circumstances, and mental health professionals are coming up with novel ways to help these families who have children with mental health issues. This article describes experiences of families who have children with a diagnosed neurodevelopmental disorder with comorbid mental health difficulties and their ways of coping with the pandemic challenges. The series will throw light on ground level experiences of families during the pandemic, give insights into their ways of adapting, and brings out problem areas which healthcare professionals must work on, to design novel ways of care.

"Depression, Suicidal Thoughts, and Burnout Among Physicians During the COVID-19 Pandemic: a Survey-Based Cross-Sectional Study","Frontline workers have been a bulwark in the fight against COVID-19, while being subject to major unexpected stressors. These include conflicting news, evolving guidelines, perceived inadequate personal protective equipment, overflow of patients with rising death counts, absence of disaster training, and limitations in the implementation of social distancing. This study investigates the incidence and associated factors of depression, suicidal thoughts, and burnout among physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic. In a cross-sectional survey-based study of resident, fellow, and attending physicians from a tertiary university hospital during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York from April 24 to May 15, 2020, demographics and practice specialty, attending vs. resident/fellow status, call frequency, emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and depression severity were examined. Two hundred twenty-five subjects completed the survey (response rate of 16.3%), with rates of 6.2% depression, 6.6% suicidal ideation, and 19.6% burnout. Depression, suicidal ideation, and burnout were all associated with history of prior depression/anxiety and frequency of on call. Suicidal ideation and burnout were also associated with younger age. There was no difference in rates of depression, suicidal ideation, or burnout between attending and resident physicians. Female physicians reported less work-life balance and more burnout. These findings highlight the importance of considering physician mental health during times of peak stress, such as natural or man-made disasters. The prominence of premorbid depression/anxiety as a relevant factor underscores the need to further understand physician mental health and provide early screening and treatment.","Al-Humadi, Bronson, Muhlrad, Paulus, Hong, CÃƒÂ¡ceda","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40596-021-01490-3","20210615","Burnout; COVID-19; Coronavirus disease 2019; Depression; Physician mental health; Suicidal ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-16","",15025,""

This study aimed to compare physical and mental health between people from the United States (U.S.) and China, and to correlate mental health parameters with variables relating to physical symptoms, knowledge about COVID-19, and precautionary health behaviors. To minimize risk of exposure, respondents were electronically invited by existing study respondents or by data sourcing software and surveys were completed via online survey platforms. Information was collected on demographics, physical symptoms, contact history, knowledge about COVID-19, psychologic parameters (i.e. IES-R; DASS-21), and health behaviors. The study included a total of 1445 respondents (584 U.S.; 861 China). Overall, Americans reported more physical symptoms, contact history, and perceived likelihood of contracting COVID-19. Americans reported more stress and depressive symptoms, while Chinese reported higher acute-traumatic stress symptoms. Differences were identified regarding face mask use and desires for COVID-19 related health information, with differential mental health implications. Physical symptoms that were possibly COVID-19 related were associated with adverse mental health. Overall, American and Chinese participants reported different mental and physical health parameters, health behaviors, precautionary measures, and knowledge of COVID-19; different risk and protective factors were also identified.","Wang, Tripp, Sears, Xu, Tan, Zhou, Ma, Xu, Chan, Ho, Ho","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10865-021-00237-7","20210615","COVID-19; China; Masks; Pandemic; Psychological impact; United States","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-16","",15026,""
"The impact of COVID-19 on patients with hematological malignancies: the mixed-method analysis of an Israeli national survey","The COVID-19 pandemic required reevaluation of the therapeutic approach and added emotional stress for patients with hematological malignancies at high risk of contracting the virus. We aimed to evaluate how it affected such patients during the second lockdown in Israel. This national survey included Hebrew-speaking patients with hematological malignancy. This included three tools with 28 items of sociodemographic and medical baseline characteristics, management of hematological disease, and evaluation of emotional coping during COVID-19 pandemic; the Hebrew version of the Patient Health Questionnaire 9; and 3 qualitative open-ended questions. Data was analyzed by mixed methods which combined both quantitative and qualitative thematic analyses. Four hundred eight patients responded to the survey. The management of their hematological disease included a decrease in the number of visits to the hematology clinic (37.0%), delay of some treatment schedules (9.1%), and prescription of replacement therapies permitting less visits to the clinic (2.2%). The frequency and intensity of &quot;feeling afraid&quot; regarding COVID-19 infection was increased (meanÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°SD: 4Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°1 to 5Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°2 in a 1-7 Likert scale), and a high rate of depression was recorded, which appeared to be more evident in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). The management of hematological malignancies during pandemics should always take into consideration patients' fears, as well as the development of depression related to isolation and loneliness, in addition to the high risk of severe disease. Patients with CML had a high rate of depression which obviously needs to be managed very carefully during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Levy, Sharf, Norman, Tadmor","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-021-06324-4","20210615","COVID-19; Coping; Depression; Hematological malignancies; Mixed methods; Survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-16","",15027,""
"Does wearing personal protective equipment affect the performance and decision of physicians? A cross-sectional study during the COVID-19 pandemic","The use of personal protective equipment (PPE) decreased the probability of viral transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, some drawbacks have been observed with its extensive use, such as headaches, anxiety, and stress among physicians, which could affect decision-making processes, the performance of physicians, and consequently patients' safety. Few articles have studied the impact of PPE on physicians from different specialties. This study assessed the effect of wearing PPE on the performance and decision-making of physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic and compared the effects of wearing PPE on physicians from different specialties. A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out through an anonymous 39-item online questionnaire. The physicians were divided according to the probability and frequency of performing invasive procedures. Group 1 included emergency medicine and critical care physicians, intensivists, and anesthetists, group 2 included physicians from different surgical subspecialties, and group 3 included physicians from different medical fields. This study included 272 physicians; group 1 included 54, group 2 included 120, and group 3 included 98 physicians. Approximately, 90.4% of the participants aged between 30 and -40 years, and 72.8% of the participants were specialists. Results indicated that the comfort, vision, and communication were significantly reduced in all groups (81.1%, 88.7%, and 75.5%, respectively). In contrast, the handling of instruments was not significantly affected in the second group only. In addition, the decision-making and the rate of complications were not significantly affected. There was a negative impact of wearing PPE on the non-technical skills (vision, communication and overall comfort), and the technical skills of the physicians. The decision-making and patients' safety were not significantly affected. Recommendations include additional improvement of the PPE design due to its crucial effect on both non-technical and technical skills of physicians.","Foula, Nwesar, Oraby, Foula, Alarfaj, Foula, Mohamed","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2021.102488","20210615","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-16","",15028,""
"The impact of sitting time and physical activity on mental health during COVID-19 lockdown","The primary aim of this study was to investigate the association between physical activity (PA) and sitting time on adults' mental health (i.e., depression, anxiety and wellbeing) and the influence of mediators and confounders. An online survey was disseminated in the UK between May and June 2020. A total of 284 participants (33.5Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°12.4Ã‚Â years) self-reported their PA, sitting time and mental health through validated questionnaires. Multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed that being of younger age, female, on a lower income, with one or more comorbid health conditions, with a previous diagnosis of mood disorder and increased sitting time independently correlated with higher depression scores (<i>F</i> (13,219)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°12.31, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), and explained 42% of the variance.

"Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Membrane Protein Interacted with IRF7 to Inhibit Type I IFN Production during Viral Infection","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly pathogenic porcine enteropathogenic coronavirus causing severe enteritis and lethal watery diarrhea in piglets. PEDV infection suppresses the synthesis of type I IFN, and multiple viral proteins of PEDV have been shown to target the adaptors of innate immune pathways to inhibit type I IFN production. In this study, we identified PEDV membrane (M) protein as a new antagonist of type I IFN production in both human embryonic kidney HEK293T cells and porcine kidney PK-15 cells and determined the antagonistic mechanism used by M protein to target IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF7), an important regulator of type I IFN production. IRF7 is phosphorylated and activated by TBK1 and IKKÃŽÂµ in response to viral infection. We found that PEDV M protein interacted with the inhibitory domain of IRF7 and significantly suppressed TBK1/IKKÃŽÂµ-induced IRF7 phosphorylation and dimerization of IRF7, leading to the decreased expression of type I IFN, although it did not affect the interaction between TBK1/IKKÃŽÂµ and IRF7. As expected, overexpression of M protein significantly increased PEDV replication in porcine cells. The M proteins of both epidemic PEDV strains and vaccine strain showed similar antagonistic effect on type I IFN production, and the 1-55 region of M protein was essential for disruption of IRF7 function by interacting with IRF7. Taken together, our data identified a new, to our knowledge, IFN antagonist of PEDV, as well as a novel, to our knowledge, antagonistic mechanism evolved by PEDV to inhibit type I IFN production.","Li, Zhu, Yang, Cao, Yang, Ma, Zhao, Tian, Liu, Ma, Xiao, Zheng","https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.2001186","20210615","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-16","",15030,""
"Mental health interventions for healthcare workers during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Spain","In order to reduce distress associated with working with COVID-19 patients, several psychological intervention programmes for healthcare workers have been developed in Spain. We aimed to describe the main characteristics and components of these programmes for healthcare workers treating COVID-19 patients in Spanish hospitals. An online survey was designed to evaluate the main characteristics of psychological intervention programmes for healthcare workers during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. Valid responses were received from 36 hospitals. Most of these programmes offered both in-person and online therapy. The most common aim of these interventions was emotional regulation, which was treated by psychoeducational and cognitive-behavioural techniques in individual interventions. Group interventions mainly used psychoeducation and mindfulness. Only half of the teams that offered in-person interventions received training in the proper use of personal protective equipment. Several hospitals in Spain have developed mental health interventions for healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, deploying a wide range of therapeutic modalities and techniques. The rapid implementation of these programmes during the pandemic suggests that safety may not have received sufficient attention. The planning and development of interventions for healthcare workers during pandemics merits greater attention by national and regional authorities and institutions.","Priede, LÃƒÂ³pez-ÃƒÂlvarez, Carracedo-SanchidriÃƒÂ¡n, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-Blanch","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsmen.2021.05.004","20210615","COVID-19; Distress; Healthcare workers; Malestar psicolÃƒÂ³gico; Mental health; Psychological treatment; Salud mental; Trabajadores sanitarios; Tratamiento psicolÃƒÂ³gico","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-16","",15031,""
"Overcoming the Challenges of the Mental Health Care System in United States in the Aftermath of COVID-19","The impact of pandemic events such as the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic led to an economic crisis worldwide as well as an increase of mental health problems. In the United States, the gaps in the mental health care system struggle to meet the needs of vulnerable populations and have caused a major public health problem. We aim to increase the awareness of health care professionals, psychiatrists, and policy makers regarding failures and gaps in the mental health care system and suggest new ideas to overcome the growing burden of mental disorders. We utilized data from PubMed, Science Direct, Cochrane, Embase and Clinicaltrials.gov databases to analyze available information on the US mental health system. We included any relevant articles addressing the prevalence of mental diseases, disparities and the gaps for an accessible and affordable mental health system, as well as the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic. 'COVID-19', 'Coronavirus', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'mental health', 'Health, Mental' were used. Following scoping review of several studies we noticed that while prevalence of mental health problems in the US varies between states and socio-demographic groups, it is among the top 10 causes of premature death and disability in adults. We noticed that mental health problems are currently one of the costliest public health issues in the healthcare system. Tracking Poll from one of the studies in our scoping review suggested that financial inequities are magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic and that psychological distress was substantially larger among respondents with lower income (33%), Hispanics (28%) and Blacks (26%). Furthermore, in another poll 62% of US population are shown to be anxious due to COVID-19. We observed that the prevalence of reported symptoms of psychological distress among US adults increased when compared to 2018. Common barriers such as failure of accessibility, insufficient funding, insufficient psychiatric beds, limited insurance access and economic burden, clinician shortages, fragmented care, insufficient mental health care policies and insufficient education and awareness about mental illness become more prominent during the COVID-19 pandemic era. The impact of COVID-19 on mental health is alarming, which affects public health and has made the health care system more vulnerable. Pandemic events not only cause acute negative impact, they also result in long-lasting health problems, isolation and stigma. The COVID-19 pandemic threatens the mental health of the population and its long-term consequences can lead to a secondary pandemic. The outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health emphasize the need for policies and strategies to support and strengthen a concerted effort to address its burden on the US mental health care system. In addition, it magnifies the need for high quality and well-funded research for future pandemics.","Radfar, Caceres, Sosa, Filip","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1092852920002886","20210615","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-16","",15032,""
"Vulnerability of personality disorder during the Covid-19 crises - a multicenter survey of treatment experiences among patients referred to treatment","The societal shutdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic involved mental health services for personality disorder (PD) and was introduced from 12 March 2020 in Norway. Rapid implementation of treatment modifications was required for patients typically characterized by insecure attachment and vulnerability to separation. To investigate immediate reactions to the shutdown of services; alternative treatment received; and differences related to age in a clinical sample of patients with PD. A survey performed from June to October 2020 (after the first Covid-19 wave) among 1120 patients from 12 units offering comprehensive group-based PD programs. The response-rate was 12% (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°133). Negative feelings of anxiety, sadness, and helplessness were noteworthy immediate reactions, but the dominating attitude was accommodation. Younger patients (&lt;26 years) reported more skepticism and less relief. Modified treatment was mainly telephone therapy. Digital therapy was less available, but was more frequent among younger patients. A minority received digital group therapy. Most patients rated the frequency and quality of modified treatments as satisfactory in the given situation, but also worried about own treatment progress, lack of group therapy, and 47% missed seeing the therapist when having telephone consultations. The survey confirms a radical modification from comprehensive group-based PD programs to telephone consultations, low availability of digital consultations and group treatments. Taking a short-term, first wave perspective, the survey indicates a noteworthy capacity among poorly functioning patients for accommodating to a clearly challenging situation, as well as considerable concern about treatment progress.","Kvarstein, Zahl, StÃƒÂ¤nicke, Pettersen, Baltzersen, Johansen, Eikenaes, Arnevik, Hummelen, Wilberg, Pedersen","https://doi.org/10.1080/08039488.2021.1934110","20210615","Covid-19 crises; Personality disorder; treatment experience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-16","",15033,""
"E-mental health in child psychiatry during COVID-19: an initial attitudinal study","COVID-19 propelled e-mental health within the Australian health system. It is important to learn from this to inform mental healthcare during future crises. A lexical analysis was conducted of clinician reflections during COVID-19 as they delivered psychiatry services to children and families in New South Wales (<i>n</i> = 6) and transitioned to e-mental health. E-mental health can extend the reach of, and access to psychiatry services, particularly for individuals disadvantaged by inequity. Yet e-mental health can be problematic. It is partly contingent on technological prowess, equipment, internet access as well as space and privacy. Relatedly, e-mental health can hinder clinician capacity to conduct examinations, monitor child development as well as assess risk and the need for child protection. Given the benefits and limitations of e-mental health, a model that supports face-to-face mental healthcare and e-mental health may be of value. This model would require practical, yet flexible policies and protocols that protect the privacy of children and families, safeguard them from harm, and respect the needs and preferences of children, families and clinicians.","Eapen, Dadich, Balachandran, Dani, Howari, Sequeria, Singer","https://doi.org/10.1177/10398562211022748","20210615","COVID-19; change management; child psychiatry services; e-mental health; knowledge translation; lexical analysis; qualitative","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-16","",15034,""
"[Inpatient Psychiatric Treatment in the Corona-crisis by Psychologists and Psychiatrists in Home-office and in the Clinic]","Since the emergence of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in March 2020, many people in Germany have become ill. This meant a challenge for the care of mentally ill hospitalized patients. There was a social shut-down in Bavaria with a decrease in social contacts. The present study deals with psychiatric care provided to these patients by psychologists and psychiatrists working in the home office and in the clinic. Psychologists from the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at LMU Munich, together with physicians working in the clinic, established telephone-based patient care for inpatients during the acute crisis in the home office during quarantine, in which 23 patients with depressive and schizophrenic disorders participated. Psychologists then worked in the hospital with 98 hospitalized patients. Current distress and its stresses were addressed and new therapeutic components were integrated into care. The feasibility of home office, its possibilities and limitations are presented. In this study, care concepts for hospitalized patients with affective and schizophrenic disorders as well as current stress factors and psychotherapeutic concepts will be addressed. The current approach was positively evaluated by patients and physicians and is thus promising in the current situation. With the exception of patients in the acute ward, all patients and even older ones benefited from this measure. During the crisis from March to August, all psychologists worked on full-time positions with the usual treatment frequency of 1-2 sessions a week, which was especially important for elderly individuals. During the acute COVID-19 crisis, there was a pause only in the treatment of ward-wide groups and family groups. Psychologists, like physicians and nurses, had a system-relevant role to play. Seit Auftreten der neuen Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemie im MÃƒÂ¤rz 2020 erkrankten viele Menschen in Deutschland. Dies bedeutete eine Herausforderung fÃƒÂ¼r die Versorgung psychisch kranker stationÃƒÂ¤rer Personen. Es kam zu einem sozialen Shut-down in Bayern mit Abnahme der sozialen Kontakte. Die vorliegende Studie beschÃƒÂ¤ftigt sich mit der Umsetzung der stationÃƒÂ¤ren psychiatrischen Versorgung durch Psychologen und Psychiater im homeoffice und in der Klinik. Psychologen der Klinik fÃƒÂ¼r Psychiatrie und Psychotherapie der LMU MÃƒÂ¼nchen etablierten in der akuten Krise im homeoffice wÃƒÂ¤hrend der QuarantÃƒÂ¤ne zusammen mit den in der Klinik tÃƒÂ¤tigen Ãƒâ€žrzten eine telefonische Patientenversorgung fÃƒÂ¼r stationÃƒÂ¤re Patienten, an der 23 Patienten mit depressiven und schizophrenen StÃƒÂ¶rungen teilnahmen. Die Psychologen arbeiteten danach im stationÃƒÂ¤ren Setting mit 98 Teilnehmern. Die derzeitige Notlage und ihre Belastungen werden thematisiert und neue therapeutische Komponenten in die Versorgung integriert. Die Umsetzbarkeit von homeoffice, deren MÃƒÂ¶glichkeiten und Grenzen werden vorgestellt. Konzepte der stationÃƒÂ¤ren Patientenversorgung fÃƒÂ¼r Betroffene mit affektiven und schizophrenen StÃƒÂ¶rungen sowie aktuelle Belastungsfaktoren und psychotherapeutische Konzepte werden thematisiert.

"In this together: Psychological wellbeing of foreign workers in the United Arab Emirates during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated infection prevention and control measures (e.g. quarantine, lockdown and isolation), have had an adverse impact on mental health. To date, the mental health status and challenges of foreign workers during the pandemic have been neglected in the literature. This cross-sectional web-based survey assessed levels of post-traumatic stress, depression, anxiety and insomnia among an international sample of foreign workers (nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°319) resident in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The majority of participants were female (76%), European (69%) and highly educated (83% had a bachelor's or higher degree). Results indicate high rates of post-traumatic stress, depression, anxiety, and insomnia, especially among women, younger individuals, and those with a previous diagnosis of a psychological disorder. Additionally, foreign workers' perceptions of pandemic severity in their home nations (mild, moderate, severe) were positively correlated with their symptom levels of depression, anxiety and insomnia. Overall, these findings may help inform future public mental health strategy and pandemic preparedness plans with reference to safeguarding the psychological wellbeing of foreign workers.","Barbato, Thomas","https://doi.org/10.1002/ijop.12786","20210614","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Foreign workers; Post-traumatic stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-16","",15037,""
"&quot;Every day is just kind of weighing my options&quot; Perspectives of young adult cancer survivors dealing with the uncertainty of the COVID-19 global pandemic","We explored adolescent and young adult cancer survivor (AYA) experiences with COVID-19 to understand the impact of living through a pandemic, unmet needs, and coping strategies. AYAs were recruited nationally, completed an online survey, and attended one of six online focus groups. We used qualitative content analysis to analyze focus group data. Thirty-nine AYAs completed the survey, and 24 also participated in the focus groups. In the survey, AYAs responded that COVID-19 increased anxiety about their health or their family's health, feelings of isolation, and worries about job security. Overarching focus group themes included AYA behavioral responses to the pandemic similar to their peers, the added burden of cancer, and unexpected advantages of a cancer history. When discussing the added burden of cancer, subthemes included difficulties and delays in medical care, mental health stressors, and compounding uncertainty. Unexpected advantages of a cancer history included relying on coping strategies developed during active treatment and resiliency from practicing social distancing during treatment. AYAs have struggled in the early pandemic in ways similar to their peers but with compounding uncertainty regarding their unknown risk due to cancer history. Healthcare providers and systems can better support AYAs by providing additional psychosocial supports, developing strategies to triage good candidates for telehealth, and providing information about cancer survivor-specific risks for COVID-19. Our findings indicate a need for psychosocial supports that address managing anxiety and uncertainty. AYAs may be able to draw on their cancer experiences to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic.","Shay, Allicock, Li","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11764-021-01069-9","20210614","Adolescent and young adult (AYA); COVID-19; Focus group; Qualitative; Social distancing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-16","",15038,""

Although several cross-sectional studies have been carried out, a longitudinal perspective is needed to better understand the evolution of psychological distress indicators within this population. The objectives of this study were to assess the evolution of psychological distress and to identify psychological distress trajectories of Canadian HCW during and after the first wave of COVID-19. This prospective cohort study was conducted from May 8 to September 4, 2020, and includes a volunteer sample of 373 HCW. Symptoms of post-traumatic disorder, anxiety, and depression were assessed using the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i> fifth edition (PCL-5), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Descriptive statistics were used to illustrate the evolution of psychological distress indicators, whereas latent class analysis was carried out to identify trajectories. During and after the first wave of COVID-19, the rates of clinical mental health symptoms among our sample varied between 6.2% and 22.2% for post-traumatic stress, 10.1% and 29.9% for depression, and 7.3% and 26.9% for anxiety. Finally, 4 trajectories were identified: recovered (18.77%), resilient (65.95%), subchronic (7.24%), and delayed (8.04%). The longitudinal nature of our study and the scarcity of our data are unique among existing studies on psychological distress of HCW in COVID-19 context and allow us to contextualize prior transversal data on the topic. Although our data illustrated an optimistic picture in showing that the majority of HCW follow a resilience trajectory, it is still important to focus our attention on those who present psychological distress. Implementing preventive mental health interventions in our health-care institutions that may prevent chronic distress is imperative. Further studies need to be done to identify predictors that may help to characterize these trajectories.","Dufour, Bergeron, Rabasa, Guay, Geoffrion","https://doi.org/10.1177/07067437211025217","20210614","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; health-care workers; post-traumatic; psychological distress; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-16","",15039,""

"Investigation on the Loss of Taste and Smell and Consequent Psychological Effects: A Cross-Sectional Study on Healthcare Workers Who Contracted the COVID-19 Infection","The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between psychological distress and taste and sense of smell dysfunctions on healthcare workers (HCW) who contracted the COVID-19 infection in the midst of the disease outbreak. Reports of sudden loss of taste and smell which persist even after recovery from COVID-19 infection are increasingly recognized as critical symptoms for COVID-19 infections. Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional study on COVID-19 HCW (<i>N</i> = 104) who adhered to respond to a phone semistructured interview addressing the virus symptoms and associated psychological distress. Data were collected from June to September 2020. Findings confirm the association between experienced taste/olfactory loss and emotional distress and suggest that dysfunctions of taste and smell correlate positively with anxiety and depression. Furthermore, their psychological impact tends to persist even after the recovery from the disease, suggesting the need for appropriate psychological interventions to prevent people from developing more serious or long-lasting psychological disorders and, as far as HCW, to reduce the risk of work-related distress.","Dudine, Canaletti, Giudici, Lunardelli, Abram, Santini, Baroni, Paris, Pesavento, Manganotti, Ronchese, Gregoretti, Negro","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.666442","20210615","COVID-19; healthcare workers; psychological distress; smell loss; taste disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-16","",15041,""
"Mental Health Status of Late-Middle-Aged Adults in China During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic","<b>Background:</b> The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and related compulsory measures have triggered a wide range of psychological issues. However, the effect of COVID-19 on mental health in late-middle-aged adults remains unclear. <b>Methods:</b> This cross-sectional, web-based survey recruited 3,730 participants (Ã¢â€°Â¥ 50 years old) between February 28 and March 11 of 2020.

Data saturation was achieved by the 11<sup>th</sup> participant and two more interviews were performed to confirm the same. Interviews were transcribed, and a seven-step Colaizzi method was used to identify different themes. The psychological impact of SARS-CoV-2 on HCPs who tested positive can be summarized into four broad themes. These are challenges faced by HCPs, social concerns, experience of quarantine period, and positive experiences. Challenges they faced were about dealing with uncertainty, fear of spreading infection, and stigma. In the social concerns theme, what featured was concerns about family, social support from friends and hospital, and stigmatizing experience in neighborhood. In the quarantine experience theme, self-care and desperation to connect prominently colored their emotional and psychological experience. There were positive experiences also, which included personal strength, sense of gratitude, growth, and professional commitment. The personal stories of HCPs highlight that while they coped effectively during the recovery process, it may be important to address psychosocial factors of well-being as they worked with patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2.","Venkatesh, Samyuktha, Wilson, Kattula, Ravan","https://doi.org/10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_2055_20","20210615","Health care providers; SARS-CoV-2; mental health; psychological impact; qualitative study","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-16","",15044,""

"The nature, cause and consequence of COVID-19 panic among social media users in India","The recent pandemic of COVID-19 has not only shaken the healthcare but also economic structure around the world. In addition to these direct effects, it has also brought in some indirect difficulties owing to the information epidemic (hereafter termed as infodemic) on social media. We aimed to understand the nature of panic social media users in India are experiencing due to the flow of (mis)information. We further extend this investigation to other countries. We performed a cross-sectional study on 1075 social media users from India and 29 other countries. This revealed a significant increase in social media usage and the rise of panic (symbolizing a sense of alarm and/or fear) over time in India. Several of these behaviors are unique to social media users in India possibly because of later outbreak of COVID-19 and a prolonged uninterrupted lockdown. The amount of social media usage might not be causal but has a significant role in generating panic among the people in India. As multiple countries are entering into the second phase of lockdown, this study focused on India might provide a unique perspective of how various factors, including infodemic, affect the mental state of individuals around the globe.

"Protective Predictors Associated With Posttraumatic Stress and Psychological Distress in Chinese Nurses During the Outbreak of COVID-19","<b>Background:</b> The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) posed an unprecedented threat to Chinese healthcare professionals. Nevertheless, few studies notably focused on the mental health conditions of nurses and explored protective factors to prevent posttraumatic stress and psychological distress. This study aimed to explore the prevalence and the predictive factors especially defensive predictors associated with posttraumatic stress and psychological distress in nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> In this online study, 1,728 nurses (~77.5% came from the COVID-19 pandemic frontline) were included in the final analysis. Posttraumatic stress disorder checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (PCL-5) and Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ) was used to assess posttraumatic stress and psychological distress. <b>Results:</b> The results demonstrated that the prevalence of posttraumatic stress and psychological distress in nurses throughout China between February 1, 2020 and February 13, 2020 was 39.12 and 24.36%, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression indicated that insomnia, high panic intensity, and high impact of the COVID-19 pandemic were risk predictors of posttraumatic stress and psychological distress in nurses. Married participants had a 1.58 times increased risk of having posttraumatic stress when compared with the single participants.

"Using Mindfulness to Reduce Anxiety and Depression of Patients With Fever Undergoing Screening in an Isolation Ward During the COVID-19 Outbreak","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to spread globally. This infectious disease affects people not only physically but also psychologically. Therefore, an effective psychological intervention program needs to be developed to improve the psychological condition of patients screened for fever during this period. This study aimed to investigate the effect of a brief mindfulness intervention on patients with suspected fever in a screening isolation ward awaiting results of the COVID-19 test. The Faces Scale and the Emotional Thermometer Tool were used to investigate 51 patients who were randomly divided into an intervention group and a control group. All patients completed self-rating questionnaires online at the time they entered the isolation ward and before they were informed of the results. The intervention group listened to the mindfulness audios through hospital broadcasts in the isolation ward before their lunch break and while they slept. Compared with the control group, the intervention group's life satisfaction score increased (<i>F</i> = 4.02, <i>p</i> = 0.051) and the emotional thermometer score decreased (<i>F</i> = 8.89, <i>p</i> = 0.005).

The main objective of this paper is to examine the psychoeducational impact of the required COVID-19 quarantine in Spain among children with dyslexia and their families. A sample of 32 children with dyslexia and their mothers participated in this study. Children and adolescents with dyslexia and their mother completed several measures before the required national quarantine in Spain and again during the quarantine. Children completed measures of depression, state anxiety, reading activity, and reading motivation. Mothers provided demographic information and completed measures related to students' emotional and behavioral difficulties as well as parenting stress, parental distress, and a questionnaire about educational problems during quarantine. Major findings showed that during quarantine, children with dyslexia had increased levels of depression and anxiety symptoms, and parents perceived their children as having more emotional symptoms, hyperactivity-inattention, and conduct problems. During quarantine, children and adolescents with dyslexia also showed less reading activity and less reading motivation. Parents also reported significantly more stress, during quarantine compared to pre-quarantine conditions. Some demographic and psychological variables predicted children's state anxiety as well parental stress. The questionnaire related to impacts of quarantine also revealed several important findings. For example, nearly all parents of children with dyslexia reported (a) difficulties in establishing study routines, (b) that the quarantine negatively affected their child's learning, and (c) that they did not receive sufficient help from teachers on how to support their child's learning. Additionally, the vast majority of the parents were very worried about the child's learning and school success, the child's motivation and interest in reading, the child's peer relations, and the professional skills of the child's teacher. This study offers a preliminary investigation into this topic and elucidates several psychoeducational challenges that children with dyslexia and their families have experienced during the quarantine in Spain. Study findings highlight the need to provide immediate support for children with dyslexia and emphasizes the importance of developing prevention programs to mitigate any future negative impacts of COVID-19 on children with dyslexia and their parents.","Soriano-Ferrer, Morte-Soriano, Begeny, Piedra-MartÃƒÂ­nez","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.648000","20210615","COVID-19; dyslexia; parent stress; psychoeducational impact; quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-16","",15049,""
"Immediate Psychosocial Impact on Healthcare Workers During COVID-19 Pandemic in China: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","<b>Objectives:</b> The corona virus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic spread globally, and we aimed to investigate the psychosocial impact on healthcare workers (HWs) in China during the pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched seven electronic databases for cross-sectional studies on psychosocial impact on HWs in relation to COVID-19 from January 1, 2020 to October 7, 2020. We included primary studies involving Chinese HWs during the pandemic, and data were extracted from the published articles. Our primary outcome was prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress disorders. We pooled prevalence value with their 95% confidence interval using random effect models and assessed study quality on the basis of an 11-item checklist recommended by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020195843). <b>Results:</b> We identified 25 articles comprising a total of 30,841 completed questionnaires and 22 studies for meta-analysis. The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress disorders was 34.4% (29.5-39.4%), 31.1% (24.5-37.7%), and 29.1% (24.3-33.8%) for HWs. The pooled prevalence of anxiety disorders for HWs from late January to early February was 46.4% (42.9-49.9%), significantly higher than those in mid-term February (28.0%, 23.9-32.1%) and after late February (27.6%, 16.0-39.2%). The pooled prevalence of depression disorders for HWs from late January to early February was 46.5% (38.8-54.2%), significantly higher than those in mid-term February (27.1%, 19.8-34.5%) and after late February (32.9%, 16.2-49.5%). HWs working in Hubei Province had a higher prevalence of anxiety (37.9 vs. 30.8%) and a lower prevalence of depression (27.5 vs. 34.7%) than those working in other regions. Nurses had a higher prevalence of anxiety (44.1 vs. 29.0%) and depression (34.1 vs. 29.2%) than other HWs. <b>Conclusions:</b> About one-third of HWs in China suffered anxiety, depression, and stress at the early epidemic of COVID-19. HWs in Hubei Province, especially nurses, had a higher prevalence of psychological disorders. During the pandemic, a negative psychological state may persist in a proportion of Chinese HWs, fluctuating with the control of the pandemic. The long-term impact should continue to be observed. Attention should be paid to HWs for their psychological impact due to the pandemic. <b>Systematic Review Registration:</b> The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020195843).","Dong, Liu, Yang, Lu, Dai, Zhang, Robinson, Liu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.645460","20210615","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; meta-analysis; psychosocial impact; systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-16","",15050,""
"Acupuncture Combined With Emotional Therapy of Chinese Medicine Treatment for Improving Depressive Symptoms in Elderly Patients With Alcohol Dependence During the COVID-19 Epidemic","<b>Objective:</b> We aimed to analyze the characteristics and psychological mechanism of depressive symptoms in elderly patients with alcohol dependence under the COVID-19 epidemic and to observe the effect of acupuncture combined with emotional therapy of Chinese medicine treatment on depressive symptoms in elderly patients with alcohol dependence. <b>Methods:</b> Sixty patients were randomly divided into two groups. One group was treated by a set of emotional therapy of Chinese medicine treatment for 12 weeks (control group). One group was treated by a set of acupuncture combined with emotional therapy of Chinese medicine treatment for 12 weeks (treatment group). We compared the curative effect between the control group and the treatment group, the mean alcohol consumption, the SF-36 scores before and after treatment, and the scores of Hamilton Depression Scale before and after treatment of 3, 6, and 9 weeks. <b>Results:</b> Based on the cognitive behavior model, the characteristics and psychological mechanism of depression in elderly patients with alcohol dependence under the COVID-19 epidemic situation were summarized. The total effective rate of the control group was 60%, and that of the treatment group was 100% (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The alcohol consumption of the patients in each group decreased significantly after treatment (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), and there was no significant difference in alcohol consumption between the treatment group and the control group (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). After 12 weeks of treatment, there were significant differences in PF, RF, physical pain, general health status, energy, and mental health between the treatment group and the control group (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Before and after treatment, there were significant differences in PF, RF, physical pain, general health, energy, emotional function, and mental health (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) of the treatment group. The PF, energy, and mental health of the control group were significantly different before and after treatment (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). There was no significant difference between the treatment group and the control group in the scores of Hamilton Depression Scale before treatment. There was significant difference between the treatment group and the control group in the scores of Hamilton Depression Scale at 3, 6, and 9 weeks after treatment. <b>Conclusion:</b> Attention, cognition, emotion, behavior, and physical response reinforce each other, creating a vicious cycle that reinforces and sustains the depressive symptoms of elderly alcohol dependence under the COVID-19 epidemic, and acupuncture combined with emotional therapy of Chinese medicine treatment for improving the depressive symptoms of elderly alcohol dependence during the epidemic period of COVID-19 has a brilliant therapeutic effect.","Zhao, Tong, Wang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.635099","20210615","COVID-19; acupuncture; depressive symptoms; elderly alcohol dependence; emotional therapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-16","",15051,""
"Mental Health of Chinese People During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Associations With Infection Severity of Region of Residence and Filial Piety","This study aims to investigate mental health among Chinese people living in areas with differing levels of infection severity during the COVID-19 outbreak. It also assesses the association between reciprocal and authoritarian filial piety and mental health in times of crises. A sample of 1,201 Chinese participants was surveyed between April and June 2020. Wuhan city (where 23.4% of participants resided), Hubei province outside Wuhan (13.4% of participants), and elsewhere in China (63.1% of participants) were categorized into high, moderate, and low infection severity areas, respectively. The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale's severity cut-points were used to categorize participants. In the overall sample, 20.9, 34.2, and 29.0% of the participants showed elevated (mild to extremely severe) levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. Those in the highest infection severity group were significantly more likely to be categorized as having elevated levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. General linear modeling was performed on a composite mental distress variable (taking into account stress, anxiety, and depression scores). This model indicated that, even after adjusting for group differences in age, gender, education, and filial piety, the high infection severity group displayed more mental distress than the low infection severity groups. The model also found reciprocal filial piety to have a negative association with mental distress. Conversely, authoritarian filial piety was found to be unrelated to mental distress when controlling for the other variables in the model. No evidence was found for an interaction between either authoritarian or reciprocal filial piety and infection severity, which suggests that the negative association observed between reciprocal filial piety and mental distress was relatively consistent across the three infection severity groups. The findings suggest that future public health programs may integrate the promotion of filial piety as a strategy to help Chinese people maintain good mental health in the face of pandemic crises.","Li, Li, Yu, Miller, Rouen, Yang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.633452","20210615","COVID-19 infection severity; anxiety; depression; filial piety; meaning maintenance model; mental health prevalence; stress; terror management theory","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-16","",15052,""
"Emotional Reactions and Adaptation to COVID-19 Lockdown (or Confinement) by Spanish Competitive Athletes: Some Lesson for the Future","The Coronavirus Covid 19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has produced terrible effects in the world economy and is shaking social and political stability around the world. The world of sport has obviously been severely affected by the pandemic, as authorities progressively canceled all level of competitions, including the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. In Spain, the initial government-lockdown closed the Sports High-performance Centers, and many other sports facilities. In order to support athlete's health and performance at crises like these, an online questionnaire named RECOVID-19, was designed to assess how athletes were living their lives during such periods of home confinement. The main purpose of the questionnaire was to assess the impact of prolongued confinement on athlete's psychological, emotional, and behavioral performance. One thousand, two hundred forty-eight athletes participated in the survey. They had the fllowing characteristics: (Mean age = 22.31 Ã‚Â± 11.49, Female: 53%), who compete at National (<i>N</i>: 1017, Mean age = 21.58 Ã‚Â± 11.42, Female: 52%) and International level (<i>N</i>: 231, Mean age = 25.56 Ã‚Â± 11.22, Female: 57%). Results showed that during the confinement period, those athletes who lacked motivation reported a higher level of stressful thoughts, more behavioral problems, and greater emotional upheaval (anger, fatigue, tension, and depression). However, those athletes who accepted confinement measures as necessary, and were in favor of respecting the rules of social isolation, fostered positive emotional states such as feelings of friendship. In addition, the availability of some sport equipment together with the ability to continue some training, were (1) protective factors against emotional stress, lack of motivation and behavioral problems; and (2) they were associated with greater respect for, and adherence to, confinement rules. Gender differences, tested by multigroup analysis, revealed that coping activities were more often associated to negative emotional states among women, whereas the ongoing availability of training information and future conditions were equally protective factors for both genders. This study also showed that receiving coaching, support and completing frequent training routines seem to be valuable tools to prevent or reduce some of the harmful effects of isolation on athlete's emotional well-being. The conclusions derived from this research would possibly help sport authorities to design supporting policies and plans to support athletes and trainers in future disruptive health crises.","Jaenes SÃƒÂ¡nchez, AlarcÃƒÂ³n Rubio, Trujillo, PeÃƒÂ±aloza GÃƒÂ³mez, Mehrsafar, Chirico, Giancamilli, Lucidi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.621606","20210615","COVID-19; athletes; confinement; coping activities; mood/emotion; sport; stress; training","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-16","",15053,""
"Changing Patterns of Substance Use During the Coronavirus Pandemic: Self-Reported Use of Tobacco, Alcohol, Cannabis, and Other Drugs","As in many other countries worldwide, the coronavirus pandemic prompted the implementation of an &quot;intelligent lockdown&quot; in the spring of 2020 in the Netherlands, including the closure of nightlife venues and cancellation of festivals. Such restrictions and social distancing could particularly affect people who use alcohol or other drugs in recreational settings and give rise to new challenges and additional needs in the field of addiction prevention and care. To monitor changes in substance use and provide services with practical directions for tailored prevention, an anonymous web survey was set up, targeting a convenience sample aged 16 years or older through various social media and other online channels. Between May and October 2020, a total of 6,070 participants completed the survey, mainly adolescents and young adults (16-24 years old). These data were used to explore and describe changing patterns in substance use. Overall results showed declined current use compared to &quot;pre-corona,&quot; but mask underlying variation in changing patterns, including discontinued (tobacco 10.4%, alcohol 11.3%, cannabis 16.3%, other drugs 30.4%), decreased (tobacco 23.0%, alcohol 29.1%, cannabis 17.4%, other drugs 20.7%), unchanged (tobacco 30.3%, alcohol 21.2%, cannabis 22.3%, other drugs 17.3%), increased (tobacco 29.6%, alcohol 32.1%, cannabis 32.9%, other drugs 25.3%), and (re)commenced use (tobacco 6.7%, alcohol 6.3%, cannabis 11.1%, other drugs 6.2%). Especially the use of drugs like ecstasy and nitrous oxide was discontinued or decreased due to the lack of social occasions for use. Increased use was associated with coping motives for all substance types. As measures combatting the coronavirus may need to be practiced for some time to come, possibly leading to prolonged changes in substance use with lingering &quot;post-corona&quot; consequences, timely and ongoing monitoring of changing patterns of substance use is vital for informing prevention services within this field.","Benschop, van Bakkum, Noijen","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.633551","20210615","COVID-19; alcohol; cannabis; coronavirus; drugs; substance use; tobacco","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-16","",15054,""
"Personality and Lockdown: A Study on Italian Undergraduates During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The current study aimed at increasing our understanding of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on undergraduate students, particularly with respect to the association between personality traits; defense mechanisms (DMs); depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms (DASSs); and compliance with the government recommended health measures. A sample of 1,427 Italian undergraduate students were administered the Personality Inventory for the DSM-5-Brief Form; the Defense Style Questionnaire-40; and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21. Compliance with the COVID-19 behavioral recommendations was measured through a 10-item survey measure. Results showed that immature DMs and internalizing personality traits (i.e., detachment, negative affect, psychoticism) were risk factors of DASSs. Furthermore, subjects with higher levels of DASSs appeared less compliant with the health measures recommended by the Italian government.

"Adverse Childhood Experiences and Mindfulness in Chinese College Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Mindfulness has been found to have many positive effects on life outcomes, including mental health and educational achievement. However, less is known about the antecedents of mindfulness, particularly in Chinese college students. This study examines the effect of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) on mindfulness among Chinese college students in September 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesized that ACEs negatively affected students' mindfulness. The data were collected from 1,871 college students from 12 colleges across China. The results aligned with our hypothesis that ACEs was negatively associated with mindfulness. In particular, emotional abuse and neglect in childhood appear to have the most negative effects on mindfulness compared to other dimensions of ACEs such as physical abuse and household challenges.","Huang, Yang, Geng, Chen, Cheung, Deng, Dong, Hu, Hua, Liao, Tan, Tu, Wang, Yu, Zhang, Zhang, Zhuo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.619128","20210615","China; adverse childhood experiences; college; mindfulness; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-16","",15056,""
"The supramolecularly complexes of calix[4]arene derivatives toward favipiravir antiviral drug (used to treatment of COVID-19): a DFT study on the geometry optimization, electronic structure and infrared spectroscopy of adsorption and sensing","While the world is in search of a vaccine that can cure COVID-19 disease, favipiravir is the most commonly used antiviral drug in the treatment of patients during the pandemic process. In this study, we investigated the host-guest interaction between the popular supramolecule calix[4]arene derivatives and the favipiravir drug by using the DFT (Density Functional Theory) method. The B3LYP hybrid method and 6-31G (d,p) basis set were utilized to determine the optimized structures of the host and guest molecules and their complexes. The negative adsorption energy (Ã¢Ë†â€ E) and adsorption enthalpy (Ã¢Ë†â€ H) calculated for the complexes formed between calix[4]arene compounds and favipiravir drug molecule mentioned that adsorption of favipiravir molecule was an exothermic process on calix[4]arene structures. On the other hand, among the calixarene derivatives in the study, Gibbs free energy change (Ã¢Ë†â€ G) value for the adsorption was only negative on calix[4]arene4 molecule. The infrared spectroscopy (IR) calculations were performed by examining the C=O, O-H and NH<sub>2</sub> vibrational frequencies to see the adsorption behavior in the favipiravir-calix[4]arene complex. After adsorption of the favipiravir molecule, HOMO-LUMO gap values decreased significantly for the structures and therefore electrical conductivity increased proportionally. In addition, sensor response factors, Fermi energy levels and workfunction changes of calix[4]arene derivatives were calculated and examined. Charge transfer between the four calix[4]arene compounds and the favipiravir molecule has occurred after adsorption. This attributes that calix[4]arene derivatives can be used as a well-suited favipiravir sensor (electronic and workfunction) and adsorbent at room temperature. Based on the calculations made to see the solvent effect on the adsorption of favipiravir it was determined that it did not affect the interaction between the drug molecule and the calix[4]arene compound too much and the adsorption energy turned into a slightly less negative value.","Yuksel, KÃƒÂ¶se, Fellah","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10847-021-01087-1","20210615","Adsorption; Calix[4]arene; DFT; Detection; Favipiravir","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-16","",15057,""

"Emotional well-being in COVID-19 mass quarantine: the role of personal response and life activity: a 14-day diary study in China","This study aims to explore quarantined individuals' emotional well-being over time and how personal response and life activity predict emotional well-being and its change. Daily data were collected from 134 participants with 71 having 14 consecutive days' data. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) and General Linear Model (GLM) were used to examine the primary tests. Overall, positive and negative emotions declined significantly during the surveyed period. Meanwhile, differences were observed in the level of positive, depressed, and negative emotions and/or patterns of change among different population categories. The personal response of worrying about work and life was positively related to depressed and negative emotions at baseline, but was negatively related to the development of both depressed and negative emotions over time. Among life activities, family stressor was a significant predictor for both depressed and negative emotions while social support predicted positive emotions. Moreover, health &amp; hygiene activity was positively related to positive emotions at baseline. The results provide scientific evidence for public health policymakers on quarantine policies and inform the general public about quarantine life.

"Creating an e-cohort of individuals with lived experience of homelessness and subsequent mortality in Wales, UK","Homelessness is an extreme form of social exclusion, with homeless people experiencing considerable social and health inequities. Estimates of morbidity and mortality amongst homeless populations is limited due to the lack of recording of housing status across health datasets. The aim of this study is to: (i) identify a homelessness e-cohort by linking routine health data in Wales, and (ii) explore whether a period of reported past homelessness, places this population at greater risk of morbidity and mortality. Homelessness identified through linkage across primary, secondary care and substance misuse datasets in the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank. Mortality was examined through linkage to the Office for National Statistics mortality data. E-cohort of 15Ã‚Â 472 individuals with lived experience of homelessness identified. Of those, 21 individuals died between February and July 2020 involving coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19). Those with lived experience of homelessness had increased mortality from many causes including accidents, liver diseases and suicides. Linking multiple routine datasets provides a more comprehensive dataset of a marginalized population, including individuals who are not included in government homeless statistics. Application of the cohort demonstrated that individuals with lived experience of homelessness have increased mortality involving COVID-19 and other causes.

"Feasibility and outcome of an online streamed yoga intervention on stress and wellbeing of people working from home during COVID-19","The outbreak of COVID-19 and its associated measures has resulted in a sizeable working population transitioning to working from home (WFH), bringing additional challenges, and increasing work-related stress. Research has indicated that yoga has promising potential in reducing stress in the workplace. However, there are very few studies exploring the impact of online streamed yoga on stress management for people-WFH. To investigate the feasibility and outcome of an online streamed yoga intervention on stress and wellbeing of people-WFH during COVID-19. A six-week pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) yoga intervention was designed with yoga (nÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 26) and a wait-list control group (nÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 26). A mixed two-way ANOVA was used to assess changes in standardised outcome measures at baseline and post-intervention. Likert and open-ended questions assessed enjoyment, acceptability and perceived benefits of the program, which were analysed thematically. Compared with the control, the yoga group reported significant improvements in perceived stress, mental wellbeing, depression and coping self-efficacy, but not stress and anxiety. Participants experienced physical and mental health benefits and reported high acceptability and enjoyment of the intervention. An online yoga intervention can help people WFH manage stress and enhance wellbeing and coping abilities.","Wadhen, Cartwright","https://doi.org/10.3233/WOR-205325","20210614","Web-based; mental-health; mind-body; pandemic; remote-working","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-16","",15062,""

"Prevalence and correlates of psychological distress in the front-line anti-epidemic medical staff during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan","Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), medical staff and affiliated healthcare staff are under both physical and psychological pressures. Due to this serious situation, it is extremely important to assess the prevalence and possible predictors of psychological distress in front-line, anti-epidemic medical staff. A cross-sectional study was conducted through the use of the network crowdsourcing platform (which provides functions equivalent to Amazon Mechanical Turk) in Jilin, China. A total of 725 Jilin medical staff who had returned from Wuhan participated in the survey. The collected data included demographics and psychological responses to COVID-19, and the following tests were used to measure the data: (I) the Social Support Rate Scale (SSRS) was used to measure the types and levels of social support that were received by the medical staff; (II) the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire (SASRQ) was used to evaluate anxiety and dissociation symptoms in the aftermath of traumatic events; (III) the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to measure sleep quality; and (IV) the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) was used to evaluate nonspecific psychological distress. The Ãâ€¡Ã‚Â² test, Kruskal-Wallis test, ANOVA test and binary logistic regression were used to identify the factors that were correlated with psychological distress. In our study, 475 (65.5%) participants reported low psychological distress, and 72 (10%) participants reported high psychological distress. The results of the binary logistic regression analysis identified that the performance of physical activity in Wuhan (ÃŽÂ²=-0.585; P&lt;0.001; OR =0.557) and years of work experience (in contrast to approximately 0-5 years, approximately 6-15 years: ÃŽÂ²=-1.258; P=0.008; OR =0.284, &gt;15 years: ÃŽÂ²=-0.562; P=0.016; OR =0.570) were protective factors for the possibility of having a mental disorder, whereas a high PSQI score (ÃŽÂ²=0.106; P=0.024; OR =1.112) and a high SASRQ score (ÃŽÂ²=0.242; P&lt;0.001; OR =1.274) were risk factors. The high psychological distress (10%) of Jilin medical staff who returned from the frontline areas of Wuhan was higher than that in other studies. Medical staff with less physical activity and work experience in Wuhan, as well as high PSQI and SASRQ scores, had higher psychological distress.","Wang, Yao, Guo, Pan, Sun, Yan, Wang, Zhao, Li","https://doi.org/10.21037/apm-20-2548","20210613","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); distress; front-line medical staff; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-16","",15064,""
"Editorial: Mental Health and Schools: Has the Time Arrived?","The focus of public discourse around schools over the past 2 decades in the United States has been around the response to or prevention of school shooting incidents. This often became a rallying cry to compensate for a recent history of tragic events (mass shootings and school shootings as a subset) that seem to have no end nor sufficient political will to pursue definitive deterrents.<sup>1</sup> However, in recent months, we have faced a new experience around the role that schools have in promoting the mental health of our youths as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Schools all around the country were forced to shut down to prevent the spread of the virus, and students have had to rapidly shift to online learning from home, with at best parental assistance, isolated from their teachers, peers, and the familiar environment and structure of schools. Many have reported rising problems with myriad educational challenges, with students falling behind academically, struggling to learn through virtual environments or distance technologies, experiencing increasing frustration with learning, along with their parents, and increasing expressions of distress from social isolation and loneliness.<sup>2</sup> These experiences have been associated with worsening and parallel mental health challenges, including worsening impact of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), worsening depressive and anxiety symptoms, children on the autism spectrum battling multiple changes, with rising youth psychiatric hospitalizations.<sup>3,4</sup> The only children who have seemed to do better are those with social anxiety symptoms, who are temporarily protected from their daily stress triggers, but who will face them with a heightened vengeance once the pandemic is over.","Pumariega","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2021.05.001","20210613","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-16","",15065,""
